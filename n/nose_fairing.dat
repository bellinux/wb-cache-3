2500|$|While the {{original}} primary training versions (designated У – [...] "U") featured wings of constant chord, subsequent variants designed for soaring flight (designated П – [...] "P") had longer-span wings with tapering outer panels and a streamlined <b>nose</b> <b>fairing.</b> The ultimate {{development in the}} line were gliders intended for towed flight (designated Б – [...] "B"), which shared the longer wings and streamlined fairing of the P-types, but added a canopy to enclose the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|Physically the Mk XIs had {{a deeper}} <b>nose</b> <b>fairing</b> to {{accommodate}} a larger 14.5 gal oil tank and used the unarmoured, wrap-around PRU windscreen. Booster pumps for the wing tanks were fitted and covered by teardrop shaped fairings under the wings. Retractable tailwheels were fitted as standard {{and the majority of}} the Mk XIs built had the later large-area pointed rudder. 260 Mk XIs were powered by Merlin 61, 63 or 63A engines, while the remaining 211 used the high-altitude Merlin 70. All of the Merlin 70 and 198 of the Merlin 60 series aircraft were fitted with the Vokes Aero-Vee dust filter in the extended, streamlined carburettor air intake under the nose. All Merlin 60 powered aircraft featured the fuel cooler in the port leading edge wing root. The radio installation was either the VHF TR.1133 or TR.1143 fitted with the [...] "Rebecca" [...] beam approach equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1965, Project Black Spot was a {{test program}} {{designed}} to give the Air Force a self-contained night attack capability to seek out and destroy targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. After the program {{was approved by the}} Department of Defense in early 1966, E-Systems of Greenville, Texas modified two C-123K Providers which were redesignated NC-123Ks, but were often referred to as AC-123Ks. The aircraft were equipped with a long, 57.75inch <b>nose</b> <b>fairing</b> that housed an X-band forward-looking radar. Below and aft of the extended radome was a turret with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Low-Level Light Television (LLLTV), and a laser range-finder/illuminator. Also, a low-level Doppler navigation radar and weapons release computer were installed. Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispensers (for CBU bomblets) were stacked within the fuselage. Each container housed 12 cells, each cell containing three Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2,664 and 6,372 one pound bomblets. The bomblets were released through 12 openings in the cargo floor that aligned with the cells in the weapons dispenser. The lower fuselage contained 12 inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the cargo floor, forming a chute. Bomblet release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward section of the fuselage. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually. The first aircraft, 54–691, was delivered to Eglin AFB in August 1967 and the second, 54–698, incorporating an AN/ASD-5 Black Crow direction finder set (engine ignition sensor), was delivered in February 1968. The two aircraft were then deployed, first the Republic of Korea, to be evaluated against North Korean high-speed patrol boats used to insert agents, 19 August – 23 October 1968; and then to South Vietnam with operations beginning 15 November 1968. Despite their success, with 70% of all missions completed and in-commission rate of 84%, there were no follow-on NC-123Ks modified. [...] The two aircraft were transferred to the 16th Special Operations Squadron at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, where they continued to serve from late 1969 to June 1970. Both airframes were then returned to standard C-123K configuration to serve again as airlifters.|$|E

They are an object mythology for many Filipinos as they are mostly pictured as non-muscular beautiful men having crystal blue eyes, fair complexion and golden hair. They may have unusual features such as high-bridged <b>noses,</b> <b>fair</b> skin, and no philtrum. They are also known to be taller than human beings. Some say they have leaf-shaped ears and that they sparkle under direct sunlight or grow sharp teeth when threatened.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the first}} stage is cleared, the second-stage motor ignites and burns for {{approximately}} 65 seconds. The <b>nose</b> <b>fairing</b> is then jettisoned, separating from the missile. When the <b>nose</b> <b>fairing</b> is cleared of the missile, the third-stage TVC subsystem ignites, and ordnance separates the second-stage motor. The third-stage motor then ignites, pushing the equipment section the remaining distance (approx. 40 seconds) of the flight. When the third-stage motor reaches the targeted area, the Post Boost Control System (PBCS) ignites, and the third-stage motor is ejected.|$|E
50|$|The second- and third-stage {{sections}} {{are connected}} by an integrated equipment/adapter section (ES). The equipment/adapter section {{is modified to}} be shorter and more compact than the C-4's adapter section. The D-5's equipment section contains critical guidance and flight control avionics, such as the Mk 6 navigation system. The equipment section also contains the third-stage TVC system, ordnance for ejecting from the second-stage motor, and the MIRV platform. The <b>nose</b> <b>fairing</b> shields the payload and third-stage motor. Mounted within the nose cap (above the <b>nose</b> <b>fairing)</b> is an extendable aerospike. This aerospike effectively decreases drag by 50%. The third-stage hull is also reinforced by carbon fiber and kevlar.|$|E

5000|$|Engkanto {{have many}} {{similarities}} to humans {{in that they}} age, appear to have male and female sexes, can suffer from illness and indeed even die. They are an object mythology for many Filipinos. Often told by adults as stories and shown on media. They have different appearances. Some appear to be beautiful having blue eyes, fair complexion and golden hair. [...] They may however have unusual features such as high-bridged <b>noses,</b> <b>fair</b> skin, blond hair and lack of philtrum. They have {{a wide range of}} appearances but one common fact of a different feeling or vibe than humans. Other variants exhibit sexual dimorphism such as Bagobo spirits which are separated into the female tahamaling and the male mahomanay. The female spirit is alleged to have red complexion while the male have a fair complexion. Their dwellings will normally appear as natural features, for example large rocks or trees, or shadows in human form; although to humans they have befriended they can appear as magnificent palaces. These creatures prefer large trees and nature such as the balete in which they also place their belongings. An engkanto may choose to stay by a human's side as told by stories where characters are usually in either a sense of trance or a deep loss of energy. Engkanto may be good or bad.|$|R
50|$|The early {{satellites}} {{were designed}} with cylindrical bodies {{to maximize the}} size of the satellite that could fit inside of the rocket's <b>nose</b> cone or <b>fairing</b> which was also round.

50|$|The {{jealousy and}} avarice of her {{brothers}} soon compelled Athenais {{to seek a}} refuge at Constantinople; and, with some hopes, either of justice or favor, to throw herself {{at the feet of}} Pulcheria. That sagacious princess listened to her eloquent complaint; and secretly destined the daughter of the philosopher Leontius to have as her husband the emperor of the East, who had now attained the twentieth year of his age. She easily excited the curiosity of her brother, by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais; large eyes, a well-proportioned <b>nose,</b> a <b>fair</b> complexion, golden locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanor, an understanding improved by study, and a virtue tried by distress.|$|R
5000|$|The FIRST (Fabrication of Inflatable Re-entry Structures for Test) {{system was}} an Aerojet {{proposal}} for an inflated-spar Rogallo wing made up from Inconel wire cloth impregnated with silicone rubber and silicon carbide dust.

60|$|The entire {{population}} of the city, man, woman, and child, turned out to behold the chivalry of New Amsterdam, as it paraded the streets previous to embarkation. Many a handkerchief was waved out of the windows, many a <b>fair</b> <b>nose</b> was blown in melodious sorrow on the mournful occasion. The grief of the fair dames and beauteous damsels of Grenada {{could not have been}} more vociferous on the banishment of the gallant tribe of Abencerrages than was that of the kind-hearted fair ones of New Amsterdam on the departure of their intrepid warriors. Every love-sick maiden fondly crammed the pockets of her hero with gingerbread and doughnuts; many a copper ring was exchanged, and crooked sixpence broken, in pledge of eternal constancy: and there remain extant to this day some love verses written on that occasion, sufficiently crabbed and incomprehensible to confound the whole universe.|$|R
60|$|Any {{of these}} four couples {{might have been the}} one I sought; with regard to none of them was there conviction. They had all arrived either on Wednesday or Thursday. Two couples were still in {{occupation}} of their rooms, but neither of these were at home. Late in the afternoon I reduced my list by eliminating a young man in drab, with side whiskers and long cuffs, accompanied by a lady, of thirty or more, of consciously ladylike type. I was disgusted at the sight of them; the other two young people had gone for a long walk, and though I watched their boarding-house until the fiery cloud shone out above, sharing and mingling in an unusually splendid sunset, I missed them. Then I discovered them dining at a separate table in the bow window, with red-shaded candles between them, peering out ever and again at this splendor that was neither night nor day. The girl in her pink evening dress looked very light and pretty to me--pretty enough to enrage me,--she had well shaped arms and white, well-modeled shoulders, and the turn of her cheek and the fair hair about her ears was full of subtle delights; but she was not Nettie, and the happy man with her was that odd degenerate type our old aristocracy produced with such odd frequency, chinless, large bony <b>nose,</b> small <b>fair</b> head, languid expression, and a neck that had demanded and received a veritable sleeve of collar. I stood outside in the meteor's livid light, hating them and cursing them for having delayed me so long. I stood until it was evident they remarked me, a black shape of envy, silhouetted against the glare.|$|R
