40|$|ObjectivesThe <b>National</b> Emphysema <b>Treatment</b> Trial {{demonstrated}} that lung volume reduction surgery {{is an effective}} treatment for emphysema in select patients. With chronic lower respiratory disease being the third {{leading cause of death}} in the United States, this study sought to assess practice patterns and outcomes for lung volume reduction surgery on a national level since the <b>National</b> Emphysema <b>Treatment</b> Trial. MethodsAggregate statistics on lung volume reduction surgery reported in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database from January 2003 to June 2011 were analyzed to assess procedure volume, preoperative and operative characteristics, and outcomes. Comparisons with published data from the <b>National</b> Emphysema <b>Treatment</b> Trial were made using chi-square and 2 -sided t tests. ResultsIn 8. 5 years, 538 patients underwent lung volume reduction surgery, with 20 to 118 cases reported in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database per year. When compared with subjects in the <b>National</b> Emphysema <b>Treatment</b> Trial, subjects in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database were younger (P < . 001), a larger proportion underwent the procedure thoracoscopically (P < . 001), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 31 % versus 28 % of predicted (P < . 001). When mortality was compared between subjects in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database and all subjects in the <b>National</b> Emphysema <b>Treatment</b> Trial randomized to surgery, there were no significant differences. However, mortality was 3 % higher in subjects in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database when compared with the non–high-risk <b>National</b> Emphysema <b>Treatment</b> Trial subset (P = . 005). ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the importance of patient selection and the need to develop consensus on appropriate benchmarks for mortality rates after lung volume reduction surgery. It underscores the need for dedicated centers to increasingly address the heavy burden of chronic lower respiratory disease in the United States in a multidisciplinary fashion, particularly for preoperative evaluation and postoperative management of emphysema...|$|R
25|$|The rule of {{the shorter}} term, also called the {{comparison}} of terms, is a provision in international copyright treaties. The provision allows that signatory countries can limit the duration of copyright they grant to foreign works under <b>national</b> <b>treatment,</b> to at most the copyright term granted {{in the country of}} origin of the work.|$|E
25|$|Some western countries, {{including}} the United Kingdom, extend copyright protection to typeface designs. However, this has {{no impact on}} protection in the United States, {{because all of the}} major copyright treaties and agreements to which the U.S. is a party (such as the Berne Convention, the WIPO Copyright Treaty, and TRIPS) operate under the principle of <b>national</b> <b>treatment,</b> under which a country is obligated to provide no greater or lesser protection to works from other countries than it provides to domestically produced works.|$|E
25|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Treatment</b> Purchase Fund (NTPF) {{was set up}} in 2002 {{for those}} waiting over three months for an {{operation}} or procedure, and as a result over 135,000 patients on waiting lists have been treated so far. The NTPF involves the government paying for public patients to be treated for free in a private hospital in Ireland, or sometimes abroad if necessary. The NTPF has reduced waiting times for procedures to an average of between two and five months (with the average in 2009 being 2.4 months), compared to between two and five years in 2002. There are cases where essential care is needed urgently but not made available by the HSE under their NTPF, and contrary to relevant judgements by the European Court of Justice.|$|E

25|$|One and {{the same}} work may thus be copyrighted for {{different}} times in different countries (since, per lex loci protectionis, the copyright rules of each country apply within its jurisdiction, regardless of the work's country of origin). Its copyright may have expired already in countries with a minimum term, {{but at the same}} time, it may still be copyrighted in other countries that have longer copyright terms. <b>National</b> <b>treatment</b> may thus lead to an imbalance: while works originating from countries with minimal copyright terms are copyrighted longer in other countries that have longer copyright terms. In that situation, works from a country that goes beyond the minimum requirements of a treaty may already have entered the public domain in foreign countries with shorter copyright term while still being copyrighted at home.|$|E
25|$|The South African Constitution {{allows the}} Cabinet to {{override}} the President. The secret ballot appears to have gone against the president when Cabinet policy declared that HIV {{is the cause of}} AIDS. Again in August 2003, Cabinet promised to formulate a <b>national</b> <b>treatment</b> plan that would include ARVs. At the time the Health Ministry was still headed by Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who had served as health minister since June 1999, and was promoting approaches to AIDS such as a diet of African potatoes and garlic, while highlighting the toxicities of antiretroviral drugs. This led critics to question whether the same leadership that opposed ARV treatment would effectively carry out the treatment plan. Implementation was slow requiring a court judgement to eventually force government to distribute ARV's. Delivery was further improved when Thabo Mbeki was ousted, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang re-deployed as the Minister of the Presidency, and Barbara Hogan deployed to Minister of Health.|$|E
25|$|However, after {{becoming}} President, Mbeki changed tack and represented {{the views of}} {{a small minority of}} eminent scientists who claimed that AIDS was not caused by HIV. These included Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis, the U.S.A National Academy of Sciences member Peter Duesberg as well as others with varying degrees of prominence. Mbeki found their views compelling, although the overwhelming majority of scientists disagree with them. On 9 July 2000, at the International AIDS Conference in Durban, President Mbeki made a speech that attracted much criticism in that he avoided references to HIV and instead focused mainly on poverty as a powerful co-factor in AIDS diagnosis. His administration was repeatedly accused of failing to respond adequately to the AIDS epidemic, and including failing to authorise and implement an overall <b>national</b> <b>treatment</b> program for AIDS that included anti-retroviral medicines, and in particular an antiretroviral programme to prevent HIV transmission from pregnant mothers to babies while in the womb.|$|E

When the greenfield investment costs are low, however, the risk of monopolization decreases. It is also shown that "Investment Guarantees" can be counterproductive by helping the buyer of the state assets prevent other investors from entering greenfield by credible over-investment. We also find that the negative effects on domestic firms by <b>National</b> <b>Treatments</b> clauses are partly paid for by the foreign investor in the bidding competition over the state assets.

500|$|Fiona Measham, a criminologist at The University of Lancaster, {{thought the}} {{emergence}} of mephedrone was also related to the decreasing purity of ecstasy and cocaine on sale in the UK, a view reinforced in {{a report by the}} <b>National</b> <b>Treatment</b> Agency for Substance Misuse. The average cocaine purity fell from 60% in 1999 to 22% in 2009 and about half of ecstasy pills seized in 2009 contained no MDMA, and by June 2010 almost all ecstasy pills seized in the UK contained no MDMA. A similar pattern was observed in the Netherlands, with the number of ecstasy tablets containing no MDMA rising from 10% in mid-2008 to 60% by mid-2009, with mephedrone being detected in 20% of ecstasy tablets by mid-2009. The decrease of MDMA was thought to be partly due to the seizure of 33tonnes of sassafras oil, the precursor to MDMA, in Cambodia in June 2008, which could have been used to make 245 million doses of MDMA. According to John Ramsey, a toxicologist at St George's, University of London, {{the emergence of}} mephedrone was also related to the UK government banning the benzylpiperazine class of drugs in December 2009. gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL), another previously [...] "legal high", was also banned in August 2009 despite concerns it would be replaced by other drugs.|$|E

Both {{are embedded in}} the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e. a WTO member has to grant the most favourable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members. [...] "Grant someone a special favour {{and you have to}} do the same for all other WTO members." [...] <b>National</b> <b>treatment</b> means that imported goods should be treated no less favourably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle non-tariff barriers to trade (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).|$|E
