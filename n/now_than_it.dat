5|$|In the 1997 {{legislative}} elections the FN polled its best-ever {{result with}} 15.3% support in metropolitan France, confirming its {{position as the}} third most important political force in France. It also showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who {{decided not to run}} to focus on the 2002 presidential election. Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly (Toulon), thanks to a good communication director, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies. The FN was arguably more influential <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had been in 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, in an unusual display of dissent, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such compromise. In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.|$|E

25|$|Cyprinids {{are highly}} {{important}} food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In land-locked countries in particular, cyprinids {{are often the}} major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods, such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive frozen fish products made this less important <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as recreational fishing, and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.|$|E

25|$|The Netherlands {{became a}} {{constitutional}} monarchy in 1806, after French Emperor Napoleon appointed {{his younger brother}} Louis Bonaparte as vassal king over the Kingdom of Holland, that replaced the Batavian Commonwealth. After a brief annexation by France, in which Napoleon ruled directly over the Netherlands (1810–1813), William Frederick of Orange returned to restore his dynasty following Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig. The anti-French reactionary and Orangist ambiance amongst the Dutch populace, and the military forces of the conservative Sixth Coalition that occupied the Low Countries, allowed him first to establish the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands (1813–1815), a constitutional monarchy. During the Congress of Vienna, in which the European courts designed the Restoration, William lobbied successfully to unite the territories of the former Dutch Republic and Austrian Netherlands under his rule (confirmed by the Eight Articles of London). Next, he seized the opportunity of Napoleon's return to assume the title of King William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands on 16 March 1815 (confirmed by the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna on 9 June). His authority as an enlightened despot stretched much further <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had even been under his stadtholder ancestors during the Dutch Republic. After the Belgian Revolution in 1830, {{the power of the}} Orange-Nassau family was again restricted to the Northern Netherlands, and the House of Representatives gradually gained influence through a series of constitutional reforms.|$|E
500|$|During his {{lifetime}} Disraeli's opponents, {{and sometimes even}} his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 {{at the time of}} Young England, wrote, [...] "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" [...] Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that it is no more possible to answer that question <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was then. Nevertheless, Paul Smith, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and [...] "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon." ...|$|E
500|$|The Earl {{had always}} {{attempted}} to promote on merit rather than patronage {{and had become}} increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. At his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the King. The King asked if the navy were a better institution <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had been on St Vincent's entrance into it. St Vincent replied that it was not. He stated: [...] "Sire I have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the Navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the Navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of Members of Parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that {{the son of an}} old Officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on." [...] He continued on [...] "I would rather promote the son of an old deserving Officer than of any noble in the land." [...] In a letter dated 18 October 1806 to Viscount Howick, then the First Lord. [...] "If you will, my good Lord, bring a bill into Parliament to disqualify any Officer under the rank of Rear-Admiral to sit in the House of Commons, the Navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of Flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than I possess to command your fleets." [...] Presumably St Vincent was referring to a particular member of Parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.|$|E

[...] The notion of Asian 'cool' applied to Asian consumer electronics is borrowed from the cultural media theorist Eric McLuhan who described 'cool' or 'cold' media as stimulating participants to complete auditive or visual media content, {{in sharp contrast to}} 'hot' media that degrades the viewer to a merely passive or non-interactive receiver.|$|E

The Southern Daily Echo heaped similar adulation upon the concert of 18 November 2011 at Eastleigh's Concorde Club: [...] "Adam Ant, along with his backing band of The Good, the Mad and the Lovely possee, showed he can still rock, even in his mid-50s now.
