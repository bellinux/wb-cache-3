50|$|In Spanish, {{the words}} sí (yes) and no (no) are {{unambiguously}} classified as adverbs: {{not only do}} they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative sí can replace the verb after a negation (Yo <b>no</b> <b>tengo</b> carro, pero él sí = I dont own a car, but he does) or intensify it (I dont believe he owns a car. / He does own one! = No creo que él tenga carro. / ¡Sí lo tiene!). The word no is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it (Yo <b>no</b> <b>tengo</b> carro = I dont own a car). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation (<b>No</b> <b>tengo</b> ningún carro = I own no car).|$|R
