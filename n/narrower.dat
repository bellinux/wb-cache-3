Therefore, many optimizations have been proposed during the last years. In this paper, we present the <b>narrowing</b> strategies for arbitrary canonical systems in a uniform framework and introduce the new <b>narrowing</b> strategy LSE <b>narrowing.</b> LSE <b>narrowing</b> is complete and improves all other strategies which are complete for arbitrary canonical systems.

5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into <b>narrower</b> secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even <b>narrower</b> tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Narrowing</b> is {{a method}} for solving {{equations}} in the equational theories of term rewriting systems. Unification and rewriting, the central operations in <b>narrowing,</b> are often implemented on graph-like data structures to exploit sharing of common subexpressions. In this paper, we study the completeness of <b>narrowing</b> in graph-based implementations. We show that the well-known condition for the completeness of tree-based <b>narrowing,</b> viz. a normalizing and confluent term rewrite relation, does not suffice. Completeness is restored, however, if the implementing graph rewrite relation is normalizing and confluent. We address basic <b>narrowing</b> and show its completeness for innermost normalizing and confluent graph rewriting. Then we consider the combination of basic <b>narrowing</b> with two strategies for controlling sharing, obtaining minimally collapsing and maximally collapsing basic <b>narrowing.</b> The former is shown to be complete {{in the presence of}} innermost normalization and confluence, the latter in the presence of termination and confluence. Maximally collapsing <b>narrowing</b> sometimes speeds up <b>narrowing</b> derivations drastically.
