(2013) {{found that}} of {{participants}} in their study aged between 23 and 30, 26% {{of those who were}} gender nonconforming experienced some sort of depressive symptoms, versus 18% of those were gender conforming. There is no curative treatment for gender <b>non</b> <b>conformity,</b> however behavioral therapy has been reported to be successful, such as recognition and open discussions, or counseling sessions. Treatment for gender identity disorders (GID) such as gender variance have been a topic of controversy for three decades. In the works of Hill, Carfagnini and Willoughby (2007), Bryant (2004), [...] "suggests that treatment protocols for these children and adolescents, especially those based on converting the child back to a stereotypically gendered youth, make matters worse, causing them to internalize their distress." [...] In other words, treatment for GID in children and adolescents may have negative consequences. Studies suggest that treatment should focus more on helping children and adolescents feel comfortable in living with GID. There is a feeling of distress that overwhelms a child or adolescent with GID that gets expressed through gender. Hill et al. (2007) states, [...] "if these youth are distressed by having a condition deemed by society as unwanted, is this evidence of a disorder?". Bartlett and colleagues (2000) note that the problem determining distress is aggravated in GID cases because usually {{it is not clear whether}} distress in the child is due to gender variance or secondary effects (e.g., due to ostracization or stigmatization). Hill et al. (2007) suggests, [...] "a less controversial approach, respectful of increasing gender freedom in our culture and sympathetic to a child’s struggle with gender, would be more humane." ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: POCTs {{encompass}} a {{range of}} testing and most hospitals use POCTs to deliver results {{in a timely manner}} allowing quick clinical decisions and, potentially, a better clinical outcome. Consequently, POCTs demand the need for robust governance and quality assurance procedures are required to guarantee the reliability of POCTs results. METHODS: The Laboratory records all information about critical problems (ICP) notified by clinical wards and identified from data transmitted in real time by middleware. In this work we counted all ICP collected in March and November, from 2009 to 2013, and we reported the average of two months. The aim of this work is to analyse the collected data and verify if corrective actions undertaken have been effective. RESULTS: The number of POCT instruments increased from 126 (2009) to 168 (2013). The ICP typology concerns: in- strumentations failures (INS), 25 %; <b>non</b> <b>conformities</b> (NC), 25 %; failures in Internal Quality Control performances (IQC- F), 39 %; calibration problems, 7 %; others, 4 %. 70 % of ICP concerns 168 Blood gas analyzers (BG), 27 % from 309 glucose meters (GM) and 3 % from 236 coagulometers (CM). The ICP number related to BG decreased from 44 (2010) to 21. 5 (2013) : IQC-F, 53 %; NC, 20 %; INS, 17 %; others, 10 %. The main problem of IQC-F concerns a continuous decreasing of concentrations of lactate at a low level (87 %). Nevertheless, the ICP number is decreased: from 15 (2010) to 4. 5 (2013). The number of ICP related to GM highlights a variable trend over time: 12 (2009); 17 (2010); 23 (2011); 6 (2012); 11 (2013). The main problems are INS (37 %) and NC (34 %) that showed an increasing from 2009 to 2011, followed by a decreasing {{in the last two years}} (from 11. 5 and 15, in 2011, to 0. 5 and 6, in 2013 respectively). CM data are not reported for the low percentage. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate an improvement of POCTs management and the effectiveness of implemented corrective actions. The main implemented actions suggested by laboratory have been the BG electrode replacement, when the performance of IQC starts to decline, and the change of GM with new and more efficient analyzers (after 2011). The continuous monitoring of POCTs problems is an efficient tool for directing the laboratory interventions to the critical issues...|$|R

While controversies exist among clinicians over treatment for these children, a growing number of practitioners are encouraging parents to accept their children's gender expressions.

Specifically, it has been proposed that the framework of conformal anomaly detection can be used, as it provides the key property of a well-tuned alarm rate. However, inorder to get an acceptable precision {{there is a need to}} carefully tailor the nonconformity measure used to determine if a trajectory is anomalous. This also applies to the features that are used by the measure. To contribute to a better understandingof what features are feasible and how the choice of feature space relates to the types of anomalies that can be found we have evaluated a number of features on real maritime trajectory data with simulated anomalies. It isfound that none of the tested feature spaces was best for detecting all anomaly types in the test set. While one feature space might be best for detecting one kind of anomaly,another feature space might be better for other anomalies. There are indications that the best possible <b>non</b> <b>conformity</b> measure should capture both absolute anomalies, such asan anomalous position, as well as relative anomalies, such as strange turns or stops...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} textual representations of plural subjectivities in life-writing by three francophone Russian {{women in the}} early nineteenth century. It addresses a gap left by studies carried out on plural identities in Russian women’s life-writing composed in the long eighteenth century by its examination of the texts from a cross-cultural perspective and close focus on linguistic and cultural identity. The application of Felicity Nussbaum’s theory of gendered interdiscourses, Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin’s heteroglossia, Murielle Lucie Clément’s extension of Bakhtinian heteroglossia and my modifications to her approach reveal the representation of multiple discourses of self in the life-writings as well as the literary, spoken and cultural bilingualism of the life-writers and shows them to be bicultural. Bilingualism is not limited here to national languages, but is equally applicable to the expression of different subject positions within one culture and of discourses relating to different national cultures. Chapter One focuses on multiple and contradictory gendered subjectivities, the life-writers’ (<b>non)</b> <b>conformity</b> to socially prescribed images of femininity, to which they ultimately represent themselves as bound, and the addressees’ influence on self-representation. Chapter Two explores the life-writers’ linguistic identity, whilst the third chapter examines their cultural identity. The analysis demonstrates that while multiple factors influence the life-writers’ representation of their plurality, culture is key. None of the life-writers represents herself as either exclusively French or Russian by culture, but shows that each culture has a defined place in Russian life and that they coexist in an unproblematic way...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: (1) to assess the conformity of current treatment to the Canadian guidelines for pharmacological treatment of depression, (2) {{to determine whether there}} is a difference in costs of health care services by level of conformity to guidelines and (3) to identify patients’ and treating physician characteristics that could be associated with treatment conformity level and that could explain differences in costs. Methods: A population-based retrospective drug utilization review was performed. Using data from the Quebec Health Insurance Board (Canada) we identified 2750 adults who had received a diagnosis of depression and a prescription for psychotropic medication. Conformity to prescribing guidelines was defined by the type of medication, dosage and duration of treatment. The cost of health services was measured in terms of physician services, hospitalizations and medications. Results: Only 12. 7 % of patients were treated according to all criteria of the practice guidelines. Compared to the <b>non</b> <b>conformity</b> group of patients, those given guideline-concordant treatment generated higher costs for visits to their prescribing physician and for medication, but lower costs for visits to other physicians and to the emergency room. No savings were shown for other services or overall cost. Patients’ and treating physician characteristics varied by treatment conformity level. Conclusion: The pharmacological treatment of depression is suboptimal. Treating depressed patients according to prescribing guidelines is not associated with savings overall.

40|$|Controlling and {{improving}} the processes used to develop software has been proposed as a primary remedy {{to the problems of}} schedule, over budget and <b>non</b> <b>conformity</b> to requirements in software development. Consequently the software development community has adopted several Software Process Improvement approaches such as the Software Capability Maturity Model published by the SEI as a criterion to evaluate and improve software process maturity. The premise of the Software Capability Maturity Model is that a mature development process will deliver products on time, within budget, requirements and of high quality. Research carried out in developed countries {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} such programmes has confirmed that Software Process Improvement can contribute to the production of high quality software. However, this phenomenon has been less studied in smaller enterprises such as those in Uganda and other developing countries. This study examined the effectiveness of the Software Capability Maturity Model for use in small software developing enterprises and established that the model was difficult to implement in such organizations. Many of its constructs were irrelevant. An adoption model for software capability maturity was designed based on only those factors and constructs of the Software Capability Maturity Model that were found to be relevant to Small and Medium Enterprises. The new model was tested using case study and expert judgment methods. The experts and software developers indicated that the proposed model is more applicable in Small and Medium Enterprises operating in resource constrained countries such as Uganda...|$|E
40|$|The etudy made a {{description}} {{and use of}} a methodology for evaluating quality cost in a semimechanized    logging   operation   was   developed. For  description  this  goal the logging sub-operations were detailed. The effects of the <b>non</b> <b>conformity</b> of one sub-operation on the succeeding ones were listed and analysed. Those consequences on which a money value could be atributed were specified. The methodology was applied to a case study. Quality cost were divided in three categories: evaluation cost, prevention cost, and faillure cost. It was concluded that the firm is not investing enough in evaluation and prevention causing a faillure cost of R$ 1. 541, 11 /ha, which is considered too high. The percent composition of this cost was: log spliting 40, 96 %; error in wood volume determination in the stocking yeard 37, 12 %; wood waste in the stand 9, 52 %; non separation of thin logs 8, 46 %; logs left in the fire control line 1, 49 %; miscalculation of splited wood volume 1, 53 %; wood volume remaining in the coppices 0, 51 %; presence of branches in the fire control line 0, 41 %. The logs spliting operation must be worked out in order to diminish its cost. Firm profit may be increased throught investiment and research in reducing evaluation and prevention costs. Every waste cost must be avoided because {{is not only the}} firm itself, but the whole society who ends up paying the bill. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{minority}} games, {{players in}} a group must decide at each round which of two available options to choose, knowing that only subjects who picked the minority option obtain a positive reward. Previous experiments on the minority and similar congestion games have shown that players interacting repeatedly are remarkably able to coordinate eciently, despite not conforming to Nash equilibrium behavior. We conduct an experiment on a Minority-of-three game in which each player is a team composed by three subjects. Each team can freely discuss its strategies {{in the game and}} decisions must be adopted through a majority rule. Team discussions are recorded and their content analyzed to detect evidence of strategy co-evolution between teams playing together. Our main results of group discussion analysis show no evidence supporting the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium solution, suggesting that individuals' <b>non</b> <b>conformity</b> to Nash at the choice data level does not derive from imperfect ability to randomize, but by players intentionally not pursuing this type of strategy. In addition, teams that are more successful tend to be more self-centered over time, paying more attention to their own past successful strategies than to the behavior of other teams. Moreover, we nd evidence of mutual adaptation between players' strategies, as teams that are more sophisticated (i. e., they pay more attention to other teams' moves) tend, on average, to induce other teams to be less sophisticated and more self-centered. Our results contribute to the understanding of coordination dynamics resting on heterogeneity and co-evolution of decision rules rather than on conformity to equilibrium behavior, both at the aggregate and at the individual level. ...|$|E
