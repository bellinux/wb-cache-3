50|$|Sperm {{donation}} is {{also used}} in cases of rhesus incompatibility. This particularly occurs where a woman has a blood type which is rhesus negative, and where her partner is rhesus positive. The woman's body may reject a fetus if it has rhesus positive blood. Anti D injections have been developed and {{may be used to}} attempt to avoid this, and these are usually automatically given to rhesus negative women immediately after they give birth to their first child. However, in the past this was either not possible or was not always routinely undertaken where a woman gave birth or had an abortion and she may have trouble carrying a child later in life. Furthermore, for some women, the anti D injection does not provide the entire solution, particularly where there is a medical history of complications during pregnancy which risk the woman's blood and that of the fetus becoming mixed. In such cases, sperm from a rhesus <b>negative</b> <b>donor</b> can provide the solution and a woman may be able to conceive and carry a pregnancy to full term when otherwise this would not be possible. For this reason, sperm from rhesus negative sperm donors is often in great demand, particularly those with the O negative blood group who are universal donors.|$|E

The role of prophylaxis with lamivudine remains unclear. One hundred seventeen patients, with a median age of 52 years (20 - 67 years), with various hematologic malignancies transplanted between 1999 and 2007 entered the study. Eighty-seven recipients negative for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), antihepatitis B core antigen antibodies (anti-HBc), and HBV-DNA with HBsAg and HBV-DNA <b>negative</b> <b>donors</b> were defined as at low risk of HBV reactivation, whereas all the remaining 30 patients were defined as at high risk. Patients at high risk transplanted in 2005 or after received lamivudine to prevent HBV reactivation as per the Italian guidelines by the Associazione Italiana per lo Studio del Fegato (AISF). Patients at low risk did not experience HBV reactivation/hepatitis. Among the recipients at high risk, 11 of 25 anti-HBc positive, those HBsAg positive (2 of 2) or negative but transplanted from HBsAg positive donors (3 of 3) were treated with lamivudine.

40|$|Introduction: Discovery of Rh antigens in 1939 by Landsteiner and Weiner was {{the revolutionary}} stage in blood banking. Of these antigens, D, which decides Rh {{positivity}} or negativity, {{is the most}} antigenic. A problem is encountered when an individual has a weakened expression of D (Du), i. e., fewer numbers of D antigens on red cell membrane. Aims and Objectives: To know the prevalence of weak D in Indian population because incidence varies in different population. To determine the risk of alloimmunization among Rh D negative patients who receives the blood of weak D positive donors. Material and Methods: Rh grouping of 38, 962 donors who came to The Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion of Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad from 1 st January 2013 to 30 th September 2014 was done using the DIAGAST (Automated Grouping). The samples that tested negative for D antigen were further analysed for weak D (Du) by indirect antiglobulin test using blend of Ig G and Ig M Anti D. This was done using Column agglutination method in ID card (gel card). Results: The total number of donors studied was 38, 962. Out of these 3360 (8. 6 %) were tested Rh D negative. All Rh D <b>negative</b> <b>donors</b> were tested for weak D (Du). 22 (0. 056 % of total donors and 0. 65 % of Rh <b>negative</b> <b>donors)</b> {{turned out to be}} weak D (Du) positive. Conclusion: The prevalence of weak D (Du) in Western Indian population is 0. 056 %, So the risk of alloimmunization in our setting due to weak D (Du) antigen is marginal. But, testing of weak D antigen is necessary in blood bank because weak D antigen is immunogenic and can produce alloimmunization if transfused to Rh D negative subjects...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Radiosensitivity in {{relation}} to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status is important in South Africa as the prevalence of HIV infections is high. In this study the in vitro chromosomal radiosensitivity of HIV positive individuals was investigated and compared with that of HIV negative individuals. Materials and methods: Blood samples from 59 HIV positive and 39 HIV negative individuals were exposed in vitro to doses of 6 MV X-rays ranging from 1 - 4 Gy. Chromosomal radiosensitivity was assessed with the micronucleus assay. Micronuclei are a measure of chromosomal damage and were quantified in at least 500 binucleated lymphoblasts (BN) per sample. Un-irradiated control samples from each donor were also analysed. Results: In 47 % of HIV positive individuals difficulties with cell stimulation by adding phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) to blood cultures were noticed which resulted in insufficient yield of BN for microscopic analysis. Micronuclei frequencies were consistently higher in irradiated lymphocytes obtained from HIV positive individuals compared to that observed in cells from HIV <b>negative</b> <b>donors.</b> Data for both groups were fitted to the linear-quadratic equation Y = alpha D + beta D- 2 where Y is the number of micronuclei in 500 binucleated cells and D is the dose in Gy. The fitted parameters for respectively HIV positive and HIV negative lymphocytes are alpha - 80. 17 Gy(- 1), beta - 14 Gy(- 2) and alpha - 54. 5 Gy(- 1), beta - 16. 2 Gy(- 2). The confidence ellipses of these parameters are separated indicating that the increase in radiosensitivity is statistically significant. Conclusion: T-lymphocytes of HIV infected individuals were considerably more sensitive to X-rays compared to that of HIV <b>negative</b> <b>donors.</b> This may have implications for normal tissue tolerance during radiotherapy {{as well as for the}} radiological health of radiation workers...|$|R

Methods: 100 consecutive penetrating keratoplasties performed between July 1995 and June 1996 were included in this study. Donor corneoscleral rim cryosections were incubated with recipient serum. Fixation of recipient IgM on donor corneas was revealed with a polyclonal anti-human m-chain antibody. The mean follow up time was 61 months. Five years after transplantation, 63 % of patients were available for follow up. During the follow up period, 15 % of keratoplasties failed because of irreversible rejection. Results: Anti-donor stromal lamellae IgM were found in 14 recipients. Anti-donor keratocyte IgM were present in 28 recipients. Dilution of recipient serum (up to 1 / 800) did not modify the results of positive crossmatch assays. Crossmatch assays performed with positive recipient sera and <b>negative</b> <b>donor</b> corneoscleral rims were negative. No significant influence of IgM crossmatch results on graft survival and rejection-free graft survival was found.

Twenty‐five patients received liver grafts from donors having a blood alcohol level between 0. 04 and 0. 4 g/I with a mean of 0. 17 g/I. Twenty‐seven patients received a liver graft from a donor who had no measurable blood alcohol. There were no differences between these two groups of donors regarding the time of initial hospitalization until the time of donation. Graft failure within the first 30 days was 24 % for those receiving an organ from an alcohol‐positive donor as compared with 22. 2 % in those receiving an organ from an alcohol <b>negative</b> <b>donor.</b> The recipient mortality rate was 16 % and 11 %, respectively. No relationships between the donor blood alcohol level and organ performance, frequency of primary graft nonfunction, or number of episodes of acute cellular rejection were evident. Based upon these data, the presence of a measurable blood alcohol level in a donor should not mitigate against organ donation. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|The MHC {{region on}} 6 p harbors {{at least one}} {{susceptibility}} gene for multiple sclerosis (MS). Within this region, HLA-DM loci are of interest being involved in class II antigen processing. We investigated the association of HLA-DM polymorphisms with MS. Sixty-three patients with MS and 46 healthy controls from continental Italy were typed for HLA-DM polymorphisms and HLA-DRB 1 alleles. Besides, among the donors characterized for the DM polymorphisms, we considered 6 MS patients previously studied for the fine specificity of their MBP-specific T lymphocyte lines (TLL). The frequencies of allelic variants at the DMA and DMB loci were similar between MS patients and controls, even when HLA-DRB 1 * 1501 positive and <b>negative</b> <b>donors</b> were analyzed separately. Patients with predominant responses to different MBP epitopes did not differ for their HLA-DM haplotype while patients with predominant responses to the same MBP epitope could present different HLA-DM haplotypes. HLA-DM polymorphisms do not associate with MS and may not affect specific patterns of T cell responses to MBP...|$|R
5000|$|So far {{only one}} adult (the {{so-called}} [...] "Berlin patient") has been potentially cured {{and has been}} off of treatment since 2006 with no detectable virus. This was achieved through two bone marrow transplants that replaced his immune system with a donor's {{that did not have}} the CCR5 cell surface receptor, which is needed for some variants of HIV to enter a cell. Bone marrow transplants carry their own significant risks including potential death and was only attempted because it was necessary to treat a blood cancer he had. Attempts to replicate this have not been successful and given the risks, expense and rarity of CCR5 <b>negative</b> <b>donors,</b> bone marrow transplant is not seen as a mainstream option. It has inspired research into other methods to try to block CCR5 expression through gene therapy. A zinc-finger nuclease has been used in a Phase I trial of 12 humans and led to an increase in CD4 count and decrease in their viral load while off antiretroviral treatment.|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B is {{a serious}} global {{infection}} disease and {{a major cause of}} mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, data on Occult Hepatitis B in Iran are scare. The current study assessed the frequency of Anti-HBc and HBV DNA in serum sample of healthy blood <b>donors</b> <b>negative</b> for HBsAg stratified by sex and age; and also investigated the relationship between detection of HBV-DNA and anti-HBc positivity. Since anti-HBc screening is not performed in Iranian Blood Bank, we assessed whether anti-HBc could be adopted as a screening assay for the donated blood. The study included a total of 1525 blood samples of blood <b>donors</b> <b>negative</b> for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (87 % male with a mean age ± SD: of 31 ± 8 yr; and 13 % female with a mean age ± SD of 30 ± 6 yr). Eight percent (121 out of 1525) of the blood samples with negative HBs-Ag were positive for Anti-HBc and were all from males. HBV-DNA was detected in 36 out of 121 anti-HBc+ specimens (29. 7 %). The study found a positive relation between anti-HBc positivity and detection of HBV-DNA in serum samples of HBs-Ag <b>negative</b> blood <b>donors.</b> Findings from this study suggest that, introducing anti HBc screening in Iran maybe very practical in order to limit the transmission risk of Occult Hepatitis B virus through blood transfusion. <br /...|$|R
