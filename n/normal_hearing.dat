25|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} involving hard of hearing individuals as well as individuals that have had cochlear implants. These individuals tend to weigh visual information from speech more heavily than auditory information. In comparison to <b>normal</b> <b>hearing</b> individuals, this is not different unless {{there is more than}} one syllable, such as a word. Regarding the McGurk experiment, responses from cochlear implanted users produced the same responses as <b>normal</b> <b>hearing</b> individuals when an auditory bilabial stimulus is dubbed onto a visual velar stimulus. However, when an auditory dental stimulus is dubbed onto a visual bilabial stimulus, the responses are quite different. The McGurk effect is still present in individuals with impaired hearing or using cochlear implants, although it is quite different in some aspects.|$|E

25|$|Periods of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} from otitis media may have a detrimental effect on speech development in children. Some studies have linked otitis media to learning problems, attention disorders, and problems with social adaptation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with otitis media have more depression/anxiety-related disorders compared to individuals with <b>normal</b> <b>hearing.</b> Once the infections resolve and hearing thresholds return to normal, childhood otitis media may still cause minor and irreversible damage to the middle ear and cochlea.|$|E
25|$|An {{assessment}} of hyperacusis, a frequent accompaniment of tinnitus, {{may also be}} made. The measured parameter is Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) in dB, the subjective level of acute discomfort at specified frequencies over the frequency range of hearing. This defines a dynamic range between the hearing threshold at that frequency and the loudnes discomfort level. A compressed dynamic range over a particular frequency range is associated with subjectve hyperacusis. <b>Normal</b> <b>hearing</b> threshold is generally defined as 020 decibels (dB). Normal loudness discomfort levels are 8590+ dB, with some authorities citing 100dB. A dynamic range of 55dB or less is indicative of hyperacusis.|$|E
25|$|Tinnitus is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} a symptom of adulthood, and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of tinnitus, even though they do not express the condition or its effect on their lives. Children do not generally report tinnitus spontaneously and their complaints may not be taken seriously. Among those children who do complain of tinnitus, there is an increased likelihood of associated otological or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere’s disease or chronic suppurative otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12% to 36% in children with <b>normal</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss and approximately 310% of children have been reported to be troubled by tinnitus.|$|E

25|$|Cochlear {{implantation}} restores {{access to}} the acoustic signal in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. The acoustic information conveyed by an implant is usually sufficient for implant users to properly recognize speech of people they know even without visual clues. For cochlear implant users, {{it is more difficult}} to understand unknown speakers and sounds. The perceptual abilities of children that received an implant after the age of two are significantly better than of those who were implanted in adulthood. A number of factors have been shown to influence perceptual performance, specifically: duration of deafness prior to implantation, age of onset of deafness, age at implantation (such age effects {{may be related to the}} Critical period hypothesis) and the duration of using an implant. There are differences between children with congenital and acquired deafness. Postlingually deaf children have better results than the prelingually deaf and adapt to a cochlear implant faster. In both children with cochlear implants and <b>normal</b> <b>hearing,</b> vowels and voice onset time becomes prevalent in development before the ability to discriminate the place of articulation. Several months following implantation, children with cochlear implants can normalize speech perception.|$|E
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming <b>normal</b> <b>hearing,</b> the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E
25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with <b>normal</b> <b>hearing</b> loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E

In this study we want to determine and compare the persian vowels formants in <b>normal</b> and <b>hearing</b> Impaired students in 7 ـ 9 year old children of Isfahan. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was performed on 64 <b>normal</b> and <b>hearing</b> impaired students. Background information was by interview and then, vowel production test was performed. First three formants of each vowel were obtained and recorded by speech studio soft ware and Dr. Speech device Data were compared between groups. Results: Mean F 1 and F 2, and F 2 /F 1 and F 3 /F 1 ratio of Persian vowels between these three studied groups were different significantly. Mean F 3 of /o/, /e/ and /a/ in all groups was different significantly. Although we could not find such a significant differences for /u/, /i/ and /æ/ between these groups(p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The most important difference between <b>normal</b> and <b>hearing</b> impaired children is their vowel Space, and we found that, the more sever the hearing impairment is, the closer vowel space will be seen. The hearing impaired children rely mostly on their proprioceptive sense because of their hearing deficiency and it causes less movement of the tongue, so they usually substitute vowels which have similar F 1 and F 2...|$|R

2500|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) is a surgically implanted electronic device {{that provides a}} sense of sound {{to a person who}} is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing in both ears; as of 2014 they had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after learning how to speak. Cochlear implants bypass the <b>normal</b> <b>hearing</b> process; they have a sound processor that resides {{on the outside of the}} skin (and generally worn behind the ear) which contains microphones, electronics, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant. [...] The implant has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve.|$|E
2500|$|Cochlear {{implants}} for congenitally deaf {{children are}} considered to be most effective when implanted at a young age, during the critical period in which the brain is still learning to interpret sound. Hence they are implanted before the recipients can decide for themselves, on the assumption that deafness is a disability. Deaf culture critics argue that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the child's identity at the expense of a possible future deaf identity and ease of communication in sign language, and claim that measuring the child's success only by their mastery of hearing and speech will lead to a poor self-image as [...] "disabled" [...] (because the implants do not produce <b>normal</b> <b>hearing)</b> rather than having the healthy self-concept of a proudly deaf person.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Vestibular {{migraine}} is vertigo caused {{directly by}} migraine. Otoacoustic emission (OAE) {{is a low}} sound generated in the cochlea and measured in the outer ear canal. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether vestibular migraine with normal pure tone audiometry has abnormal changes in cochlear (OHC) function measured by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). MATERIALS and METHODS: DPOAEs were measured from 34 definite vestibular migraine patients with <b>normal</b> peripheral <b>hearing</b> sensitivity (11 males and 23 females), and they were compared to the results of 30 normal subjects (12 males and 18 females). RESULTS: The mean emission amplitudes across the DPOAE-measured frequencies in both ears of patients with definite vestibular migraine were lower than that of the normal subjects but statistically non-significant (p> 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The emission amplitudes that were reduced could be attributed to the patho-physiologic mechanism encountered in the ears of those patients, in spite of being of non-statically significant values.
