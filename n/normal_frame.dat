The <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> for them {{are defined as}} ones in which their coefficients vanish. A number of results, including theorems of existence and uniqueness, concerning <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> are derived. Special attention is paid on the important case when the bundle's base is a manifold. The <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> are defined and investigated also for derivations along paths and along tangent vector fields in the last case. It is proved that <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> always exist at a single point or along a given (smooth) path (with separable points of self-intersections, if any). On other subsets <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> exist only as an exception if (and only if) certain additional conditions, derived here, are satisfied.

40|$|The {{main subject}} {{of the book is}} an {{up-to-date}} and in-depth survey of the theory of <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> and coordinates in differential geometry. The book {{can be used as a}} reference manual, review of the existing results and introduction to some new ideas and developments. In the book can be found practically all existing essential results and methods concerning <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> and coordinates. Most of the results are represented in full detail with full, in some cases new, proofs. All classical results are expanded and generalized in various directions. Theorems of existence, uniqueness and, possibly, holonomicity of the <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> and coordinates are proved; mostly, the proofs are constructive and some their parts can be used independently for other tasks. Besides published results, their extensions and generalizations, the book contains completely new results which appear for the first time. Comment: 462 LaTeX pages.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{extends the}} notion of an archimedean frame to frames which are not {{necessarily}} algebraic. The new notion is called joinfitness and is Choice-free. Assuming the Axiom of Choice and for compact <b>normal</b> algebraic <b>frames,</b> the new and the old coincide. There is a subfunctor from the category of compact <b>normal</b> <b>frames</b> with skeletal maps with joinfit values, which is almost a coreflection. Conditions making it so are briefly discussed. The concept of an infinitesimal element arises naturally, and the join of suitably chosen infinitesimals defines the joinfit nucleus.

Today, many consumer grade digital cameras, including even some point-and-shoot cameras have hardware or software intervalometers available.
