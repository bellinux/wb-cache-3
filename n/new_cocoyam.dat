50|$|Xanthosoma is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} arum family, Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as malanga, otoy, otoe, cocoyam (or <b>new</b> <b>cocoyam),</b> tannia, tannier, yautía, macabo, ocumo, macal, taioba, dasheen, quequisque, ape and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro (taro kongkong). Many other species (including especially X. roseum) are used as ornamental plants, and in popular horticultural literature are known as ‘ape or elephant ear (from the purported resemblance of the leaf to an elephant's ear), although the latter name is sometimes also applied to members with similar appearance and uses in the closely related genera Caladium, Colocasia (i.e., taro), and Alocasia.|$|E
50|$|Cocoyams are {{herbaceous}} {{perennial plants}} {{belonging to the}} family Araceae and are grown primarily for their edible roots, although {{all parts of the}} plant are edible. Cocoyams that are cultivated as food crops belong to either the genus Colocasia or the genus Xanthosoma and are generally composed of a large spherical corm (swollen underground storage stem), from which a few large leaves emerge. The petioles of the leaves (leaf stems) stand erect and can reach lengths in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft). The leaf blades are large and heart-shaped and can reach 50 cm (15.8 in) in length. The corm produces lateral buds that give rise to side-corms (cormels, suckers) or stolons (long runners, creeping rhizomes) depending on the species and variety. Cocoyams commonly reach in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and although they are perennials, they are often grown as annuals, harvested after one season. Colocasia species may also be referred to as taro, old cocoyam, arrowroot, eddoe, macabo or dasheen and originates from the region of Southeast Asia. Xanthosoma species may be referred to as tannia, yautia, <b>new</b> <b>cocoyam</b> or Chinese taro and originates from Central and South America.|$|E
40|$|The <b>new</b> <b>cocoyam</b> or tannia (Xanthosoma sagittifolium Schott) is an {{important}} starchy staple in the humid tropics, especially various parts of West and Central Africa, where the daughter-corms or cormels are consumed. The young leaves are also utilized as a vegetable or spinach. The latter practice presents a major cormel production constraint as continuous defoliation depresses yield. However, a specialized spinach production system recently developed at the University of Ghana Agricultural Research Station at Kade, Ghana, holds promise in overcoming the problem. Corm-explants or 'microsetts' weighing 5 -l 0 g, are pre-sprouted in fresh, moist, medium-coarse textured sawdust for 3 weeks and are then transplanted in raised beds. These beds are a metre wide, 25 - 30 cm high {{and as long as}} space permits. The plants are spaced at 10 cm x 10 cm intervals and the beds hand-watered as necessary. The plants are defoliated to provide a spinach when the young leaves are available. This system could provide a year-round, diversified income source for small-scale market gardeners as well as serve as a highly lucrative large-scale agri-business venture. Efforts are currently directed to the breeding of specialised genotypes with high leaf turn-over rates and protein contents. The high intensity planting using 100, 000 plants/ha has oresented a new line of thinking as regards the optimum density required for specialized cormel production.

40|$|Starch {{from the}} tubers potato (Solanum tuberosum), taro (Alocassia indica), <b>new</b> <b>cocoyam</b> (Xanthosoma sagitifolium), true yam (Dioscorea alata), and root cassava,(Manihot esculenta) crops was {{isolated}} and its morphology, composition and physicochemical properties were investigated {{before and after}} heat-moisture treatment (HMT) [100 °C, for 10 h at a moisture content of 30 %). Native starch granules ranged in diameter from 3. 0 - 110 μm and were round to oval to polygonal with smooth surfaces. The total amylose content ranged from 22. 4 - 29. 3 %, of which 10. 1 - 15. 5 % was complexed by native lipid. The phosphorus content ranged from 0. 01 - 0. 1 %. The X-ray pattern of potato and true yam was of the "B " type. Whereas, that of <b>new</b> <b>cocoyam</b> and taro was of the "A" type. Cassava exhibited a mixed "A+B" type X-ray pattern. The relative crystallinity, swelling factor, amylose leaching, gelatinization temperature range and the enthalpy of gelatinization of the native starches ranged from 30 - 46 %, 22 - 54 %, 5 - 23 %, 13 - 19 °C and 12 - 18 J/g, respectively. Susceptibility of native starches towards hydrolysis by 2. 2 N HCI and porcine pancreatic ∝-amylase were 60 - 86 % (after 12 days), and 4 - 62 % (after 72 h), respectively. Retrogradation was most pronounced in the "B" type starches. Granule morphology remained unchanged after HMT. The X-ray pattern of the "B" type starches was altered ("B"→ "A+B") on HMT. However, {{that of the other}} starches remained unchanged. HMT decreased swelling factor, amylose leaching, gelatinization enthalpy and susceptibility towards acid hydrolysis, but increased gelatinization temperatures and enzyme susceptibility. Extent of retrogradation and relative crystallinity decreased on HMT of true yam and potato starches, but remained unchanged in the other starches. The foregoing data showed that changes in physicochemical properties on HMT are influenced by the interplay of crystallite disruption, starch chain associations and disruption of double helices in the amorphous regions...|$|E
