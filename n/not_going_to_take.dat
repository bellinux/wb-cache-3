5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and Finden illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its business dealings. However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E

When Tracy appears to be {{ignoring}} his cue cards, Jenna informs Liz of the situation, and realizes that Tracy might be illiterate, citing an earlier promo cue card mishap ("The Aftermath") as an example. Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits {{that he is}} illiterate and agrees to get help. Liz later notices Tracy reading a newspaper, and learns that he was using the ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch.|$|E

500|$|In January 2013, Joss Whedon {{deflected}} {{any direct}} influences from other series, {{such as the}} efforts of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in The X-Files, and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on [...] "the peripheral people...the people {{on the edges of}} the grand adventures." [...] As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences [...] "seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that." [...] Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, [...] "The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something I think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not just any powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] was {{the first}} episode not to feature Washington's character, Burke. Washington was officially fired from the series, {{following}} an on-set incident with Knight and Dempsey, which {{had been in the}} media attention since the commencement of the production for the third season. News reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co-star Knight with a homophobic slur. Following the exposure of the argument, Knight publicly disclosed his homosexuality, which led to Washington's issuing an apology statement, regarding his inappropriate use of words during the incident. The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which saw Washington ridiculing homosexuality during an interview, following the statement that denied the occurrence of an on-set incident. After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight. An issue of People disclosed Washington's presence at executive counseling, which led to an undetermined hiatus of his contract. After [...] "Didn't We Almost Have It All?", the last episode Washington appeared in, was filmed, the network decided not to give Washington the possibility of a renewal. In a statement released by his publicist, Washington assesed, [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it anymore". In another report, Washington stated he was planning to spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, while working on an independent film. In a subsequent interview, Washington highlighted the unfairness in his being let go from the series, considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series. Following his firing, Washington began asserting that racism within the broadcasting media was a primary factor in his dismissal from the series, which drew a critical perspective from Rhimes. During his appearance on Larry King Live, Washington once again denied using a homophobic epithet in reference to Knight.|$|E
500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself {{in a way that makes}} it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E
500|$|After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington {{issued a}} {{statement}} apologizing for repeating the word on the Golden Globes carpet. On January 30, 2007, a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled {{to return to the}} Grey's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday {{for the first time since}} entering [...] "executive counseling" [...] after making the comments at the Golden Globes. However, on June 7, 2007, ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington's contract, and that he would be dropped from the show. [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it anymore," [...] Washington said in a statement released by his publicist, borrowing the famous line from Network. In another report, Washington stated he was planning to [...] "spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, work on an independent film and avoid worrying about the show." [...] In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that [...] "they fired the wrong guy", referring to Knight, and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy. Washington, in late June 2007, began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series. On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who, he felt, was treating him like a [...] "B-word," [...] a [...] "P-word," [...] and the [...] "F-word," [...] which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back." [...] Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past. He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show, he would not hesitate to say [...] "yes". Washington's image was used in advertisements for the May 9, 2008 episode [...] "The Becoming". After this aired, Washington's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an unlawful use of his client's image. His publicist, Howard Bragman, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "they have the rights of the character to advance the story, but not the image" [...] and stated he expected this to result in a [...] "financial settlement", but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened.|$|E

30|$|There are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be {{enormous}} challenges to be solved, and {{if these are}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> seriously by politicians and city planners, a deterioration {{of the quality of}} life in many cities might be the inevitable consequence. Already today, the balance between tourists’ and locals’ needs in certain cities - or parts of cities - is not given anymore. For example, in Venice and Barcelona, many parts of the city have undergone a process that could be described as ‘museumisation’. Those parts of the city are being enjoyed and consumed by tourists but can usually not be enjoyed by locals any longer. Due to the changing nature of city tourism as previously discussed, this process of museumisation could be amplified to affect more city locations, that have not been designated or apparent tourist areas in the past, in a shorter period of time than ever before.|$|R

The affordable pricing strategy has also worked in their favor. There was a time when Old Monk dominated the rum market. There were other brands also but none came close in quality or popularity. About eight million bottles were sold annually. Today the sales are a quarter of that and they continue to decline.

40|$|Of all {{the changes}} in work over the last century, arguably the {{greatest}} impact upon the way work is done {{can be attributed to}} the exponential growth of flexible working patterns. The basis of flexible working is captured by a BT plc strap-line: work is not a place where you go but rather something you do! As the renowned futurist, Alvin Toffler, has indicated – “work is <b>not</b> necessarily <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in offices or factories. It is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place everywhere, anytime” (Toffler, A., The Third Wave, Morrow, New York, NY, 1980). There is a wealth of guidance available on how to improve the flexibility available within organizations from the enormous range of “flexible working solutions” books through to the consultancies that now include flexible working as prominent packages in their service portfolio. In this paper, the teleworking means of flexible working is explored and an assessment is made of its growth, advantages and disadvantages, implementation programs for successful teleworking and a case assessing the advances that BT plc have made in becoming a teleworking organization...|$|R

I chose this hotel because, though it lacked the fine flower of the more ancient respectability and the legendary charm of the States, it was so spectacular that it would be in itself a perpetual excitement for those ladies, and would form an effect of society which, with some help from us, might very well deceive them.

30|$|The {{percentage}} of lixiviated copper was also reported in Fig.  3. Some authors {{state that the}} reactivity of the compounds to be treated is {{the main cause of}} leaching in heterogeneous reactions [40]. The optimum pH to prevent Cu from leaching from the support is close to neutrality [11] [41], Since the pH of the reactions oscillates between 6 and 7, it is possible that leaching is a consequence of the compounds reactivity. The catalytic reactions could have some homogeneous contributions if the leached copper is still catalytically active. According to Fig.  3, a strategy to reduce leaching is to increase the severity of the conditions of reaction, which also prevents the accumulation of compounds {{on the surface of the}} catalyst. This is a plausible option since unproductive reactions were not verified in the working conditions as the use of H 2 O 2 was still efficient and the analyzed parameters (for example, COD) decreased. However, as the effect of copper leaching on the heterogeneous kinetic analysis was out of the scope of this study, homogeneous catalysis contributions are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> into account when determining heterogeneous kinetics models.
