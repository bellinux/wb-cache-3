40|$|Parasitic {{capacitors}} {{are formed}} during normal operational amplifier circuit construction. Operational amplifier design guidelines usually specify connecting a small 20 -pF to 100 -pF capacitor between the output {{and the negative}} input, and isolating capacitive loads with a small, 20 -Ω to 100 -Ω resistor. This application report analyzes the effects of capacitance present at the input and output pins of an operational amplifier, and suggests means for computing appropriate values for specific applications. The inverting and <b>noninverting</b> <b>amplifier</b> configurations are used for demonstration purposes. Othe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract JAVA applets {{can be used}} {{to teach}} {{electronics}} and other subjects in interactive mode. In the paper is presented the new application with JAVA Circuit simulator developed by Falstad (www. falstad. com). The JAVA applets Circuit simulator can help to the deep understand of the main functioning of the electronic circuits by interactive manipulation of the different functions. In the Circuit simulator there are many applications of the electronic circuits, in the paper are presented the diode application for the full wave rectifier circuits without or with filter and the AO <b>noninverting</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The theoretical part of each electronic circuit can help the students to understand JAVA applet. We {{contribute to the development of}} the theoretical part in romanian language...|$|E
40|$|A <b>noninverting,</b> {{direct current}} <b>amplifier</b> stage is {{cascaded}} into an integrator stage {{to form a}} two stage tuned network with a single input junction common to both stages. The network provides independent adjustment of center frequency, bandwidth and voltage gain. The insertion of a positive feedback loop between the stages provides a very narrow bandwidth network. The addition of back to back zener diodes between the common input node and ground converts the network into an oscillator...|$|R
