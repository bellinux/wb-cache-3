40|$|The {{decision}} to offer {{health insurance to}} employees and their families is a difficult one for many small and mid-sized businesses. Factors such as the aging U. S. population and rising medical costs have dramatically increased health insurance premiums, the majority of which is paid for by employers. Many firms contend that increasing health insurance costs have significantly reduced their profit margins {{and their ability to}} compete against firms that do not offer health insurance as a <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefit.</b> This paper conducts an initial empirical analysis to determine whether firms offering health insurance to their employees are placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to those firms not offering health insurance. Using business outlook survey data from a mid-sized, Midwestern economy, there is little evidence to suggest that providing health insurance, or identifying health insurance as a significant competitive issue, hurts the financial viability of a firm any more or less than it harms any other firm in the economy. As a result, while the cost of health insurance may be a significant problem for a firm’s bottom line, it does not appear to affect a firm’s ability to compete in its market...|$|E
40|$|The TVP {{labour market}} has {{undergone}} a great change during the economic reform period. Starting from a fully controlled recruitment system, more employees obtained employment through a more market oriented mechanism. This study applies human capital theory to investigate {{the impact of this}} institutional change on TVP wage determination. It is found that education as one of most important human capital variables plays an important role on the wage determination of those who obtained jobs through own effort (the market group), while it is insignificant for those who were assigned to the jobs (the non-market group). The further analysis suggests that although education plays different role on the market and non-market groups wage determination they are both productivity orientated. And the reason for this might be that the underlying technological processes of the work undertaken by the market group is higher than that for the non-market group. Does education, therefore, plays no role for the non-market group? The paper employs a logit model to prove that education is an important determinant for both the market and the non-market groups' occupational attainment. This suggests the following general picture: for the market group, there is a direct relationship between education, occupation and wage determination; for the non-market group this relationship is somewhat indirect. The rate of return to education {{is more likely to be}} reflected by <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefit.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|While {{much of the}} {{discussion}} of gender inequality in the labour market has centred on pay equity there has been extensive gender inequality {{in terms of the}} construction of and access to non wage benefits through employment. Typically <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefit</b> access in Australia has been associated with the full-time employed male breadwinner model of employment. In itself this has resulted in the exclusion of many women workers from non wage benefits but it has also meant that benefits are aligned to a particular family structure and assigned gender roles within this family structure. While there has been a sustained campaign for achieving gender pay equity in Australia for more than 30 years, in contrast non wage benefit access and equality for women workers remains relatively neglected by trade unions and in public policy discussion. The decentralisation of the industrial relations system from the late 1980 s was supposed to deliver “family friendly ” employment arrangements, including non wage benefits. We argue that such an agenda is partial, inequitable and flawed. Throughout 2002 there has been a public debate over access to and funding of paid maternity leave in Australia and this in itself has raised the issue of gender equity in the construction of and access to non wage benefits of employment. In this paper we demonstrate the gender inequality of access and the gender bias {{in the construction of the}} non wage benefits system in Australia. The paper considers how a trade union campaign and a public policy agenda can be developed that promotes gender equity in benefit access and in the construction of benefits that better meets the aspirations and the needs of women workers. ...|$|E
40|$|With fast {{development}} {{of technology and}} globalization competition, firms today are in a changing environment. Skills obsolete quickly. To prevent the skill shortage, training has been given more and more attention. However, current literature has some gaps in examining the training determinants. This thesis use the Workplace and Employee Survey (WES) data (1999 - 2005) to conduct research on the determinants of provision of training and training selection in Canada. The workplace data is a longitudinal panel data of seven waves while the employee data is linked to employer at the micro level. Training is first explored on the workplace panel data to capture the workplace determinants that decide training incidence and intensity. Then with these workplace determinants included, provided that different company train differently in regard of training incidence, employee’s participation in training is investigated on the linked data. Heckman Two-step selection model is adopted to correct the selection bias {{which has not been}} properly addressed in most of the studies. With the analysis results, determinants of training are identified. Profit, <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefit</b> and payroll are alternatives to training regardless of firm size. Firms train less if they are experiencing high turnover rate while more training will be provided if firms have larger proportion of professional and technical workers or undergo some organizational change. Employees with longer tenure, married people and female employees are the group of employees that have disadvantage in training. Classroom training is more sensitive for immigrants and temporary workers. The negative effects are greater for classroom training than on-the-job training when those two variables are presented. Collective bargaining agreements only guarantee a large proportion of employees having the training opportunity while training intensity cannot be promised. In fact, small firms reduce their training expenditure while large firms increase investment in training when they are unionized. Several implications are also mentioned...|$|E
30|$|A third {{possibility}} is that the standard neo-classical labor market model is correct, but that empirically the compensation of self-employed workers, informal employees, or formal employees is not measured properly. Absolute estimates of wage gaps are inherently imprecise due {{to the difficulty of}} measuring self-reported profits and of valuing <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefits.</b> For example, self-employed workers might systematically under-report earnings, which could lead to an observed self-employed penalty even when none exists (Hurst et al. 2010). On the other hand, the self-reported earnings of employees include only returns to labor, while the self-reported earnings of the self-employed may also include returns to capital, as well as returns to the risk of entrepreneurship. Failing to account for this may overestimate the self-employment earnings premium. Furthermore, formal sector wage employees often do not include in their reported earnings the value of <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefits</b> such as firms’ contributions to pensions, sick pay, severance pay, and health care, while self-employed workers and informal sector workers, who do not receive these <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefits,</b> may receive higher paid wages as compensating differentials. In the competitive labor market described above, self-employed and informal sector employees would include compensation for these foregone <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefits</b> (Meghir et al. 2015), which would lead to overestimation of self-employment and informal sector earnings (and may even lead to a measured premium for self-employment and informality).|$|R

A money value for earnings-related survivors ´ pension rights is estimated and added to the money wage to create an extended wage measure. We use Swedish micro data to analyse what the inclusion of different insurance rights might mean for wage differentials and wage dispersion.

40|$|Public sector {{employees}} {{continue to}} benefit from higher wages and <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefits</b> relative to their private sector counterparts. Coupled with the large increase in public sector employment in recent years, such wage premiums exert pressure on government expenditures and can eliminate any benefits obtained from tight fiscal management in the 1990 s. Moreover, wage premiums distort local labour markets as public and private employers compete {{to attract and retain}} skilled workers. This study re-examines wage disparities between private-sector employees and those in public administration at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels. Updating CFIB’s previous research, the study compares wages among occupations that are only found in both public administration and the private sector. Using Census data the study finds that, at all levels of government, wage premiums persist in favour of public administration (see Figure 1). Moreover, a significant overall increase in the wage premium favouring federal employees, over the 1995 - 2000 period, is found; while the premium enjoyed by provincial employees decreased and the premium paid to municipal employees remained relatively constant over the same period. <b>Non-wage</b> <b>benefits</b> such as employer pension contributions, premiums on disability, life, and medical insurance, are examined on a national aggregate level.

Estimating the model on Brazilian data recovers preferences for work, <b>non-wage</b> <b>benefits,</b> and a two-parameter evasion cost that reflects enforcement and reveals the wage penalty of working in the informal sector. The estimates reveal that the minimum wage in Brazil does not increase unemployment, rather it raises informality. Informal behavior is complementary, so that violating the minimum wage encourages agents to violate other laws. This complementarity can be substantial among the poorly educated. Labor market regulation and enforcement depresses wages among the low-skilled and increases wage inequality. Informal work carries an average wage penalty of 23 % of salary...|$|R

For example, empirical studies have shown that factors in the decline include changes {{in the structure of the}} economy, management opposition to organized labor, and other socio-political factors. 1 Furthermore, Neumann and Rissman (1984) have argued that as government has institutionalized protections for workers, support for organized labor has been weakened. The structure of compensation also has changed dramatically.
