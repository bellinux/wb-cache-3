500|$|According to Roger Ebert, Casablanca is [...] "probably on more {{lists of}} the {{greatest}} films of all time {{than any other single}} title, including Citizen Kane" [...] because of its wider appeal. Ebert opined that Citizen Kane is generally considered to be a [...] "greater" [...] film, but Casablanca is more loved. In his opinion, the film is popular because [...] "the people in it are all so good", and it is [...] "a wonderful gem". Ebert said that he has <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negative review of the film, even though individual elements can be criticized, citing unrealistic special effects and the stiff character/portrayal of Laszlo. [...] Critic Leonard Maltin considers Casablanca to be [...] "the best Hollywood movie of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|Hardy said: [...] "He {{combined}} a {{power of}} generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here {{was a man who}} could work out modular equations and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the zeta function and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doubly periodic function or of Cauchy's theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was...". When asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were [...] "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account." [...] He also stated that he had [...] "never met his equal, and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Gilbert's {{favourite}} comic themes is {{the elevation}} of an unqualified person {{to a position of}} high responsibility. In The Happy Land (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. In Pinafore, Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by [...] "never go to sea". In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in Pirates, and Ko-Ko in The Mikado, are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph [...] "always voted at [...] party's call", he sacrificed his personal integrity. The [...] "commercial middle class" [...] (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed. In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl. The Times wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a [...] "paternal" [...] Captain and the [...] "ethics... of all romanticism" [...] are accepted [...] "unflinchingly" [...] and taken to their logical conclusion: [...] "It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out".|$|E

I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American or European {{who was able to}} make the boomerang perform the tricks for which it has become famous. Throwing this weapon is like piano-playing; you have to be brought up to it in order to do it well.|$|R
2500|$|One {{episode of}} The Simpsons, [...] "The President Wore Pearls", has a plot {{loosely based on}} the musical, with Lisa Simpson in Eva's role. The episode {{includes}} parodies of songs such as [...] "Don't Cry for Me, Kids of Springfield". At {{the end of the}} episode, a comical disclaimer is displayed stating, [...] "On the advice of our lawyers, we swear we have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> musical based on the life of Eva Perón".|$|E
2500|$|Leibowitz {{called the}} editor of the Scottsboro weekly newspaper, who testified that he'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> black juror in Decatur because [...] "they all steal." [...] He called local jury commissioners to explain the absence of African-Americans from Jackson County juries. When Leibowitz accused them of {{excluding}} black men from juries, they did not seem to understand his accusation. It was as if the exclusion was so ordinary as to be unconscious. (Note: Since most blacks could not vote after having been disenfranchised by the Alabama constitution, the local jury commissioners probably never thought about them as potential jurors, who were limited to voters.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Questions {{regarding}} {{the number of}} female One Life to Live viewers who have been raped {{and what kind of}} message One Life to Live was sending to their tween-girl demographic, a demographic they ranked #1 in, was noted. Lynn Parrish, a RAINN (Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network) spokesperson for America’s largest anti-sexual assault organization, said that she had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rapist and his victim falling in love and that if people are to believe a medium watched primarily by women and written for women, it is [...] "as common as the winter cold". Parrish stated that One Life to Live did not contact RAINN before telling the 2008 Todd and Marty storyline, but that ABC agreed to air a rape-themed PSA in the near future. Parish spoke of her feelings about the pairing. [...] "There is nothing romantic about rape," [...] she said. [...] "Whoever writes a romance between a rapist and its victim under any circumstances clearly doesn’t understand rape nor violence — and probably shouldn’t be writing about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Multi-Tool Notepad, a mouse-based {{text editor}} written by Richard Brodie, with the $195 Microsoft Mouse in May 1983 at the Spring COMDEX computer expo in Atlanta. [...] Also introduced at that COMDEX was Multi-Tool Word, designed by Charles Simonyi {{to work with}} the mouse. Most watching Simonyi's demonstration had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mouse. Microsoft released the Microsoft Mouse in June 1983, and the boxed mouse and Multi-Tool Notepad began shipping in July. Initial sales were modest, as there was little one could do with it except run the three demonstration programs included in the box (a tutorial, practice application and Notepad) or program interfaces to it. The Multi-Tool product line began with expert systems for the Multiplan spreadsheet. On the suggestion of Rowland Hanson, who also convinced Bill Gates to change the name [...] "Interface Manager" [...] to [...] "Windows" [...] before the release of Windows 1.0, the Multi-Tool name was killed by the time Word shipped in November 1983. Hanson's rationale was that [...] "the brand is the hero". People didn't associate the stand-alone name Multi-Tool with Microsoft, and Hanson wanted to make Microsoft the hero, so the Microsoft name replaced [...] "Multi-Tool".|$|E
