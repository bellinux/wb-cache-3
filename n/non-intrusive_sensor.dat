Existing approaches are either invasive, where the transducers are in direct contact with the flow media, or intrusive, where the transducers extend into the flow. To overcome these draw-backs, we present the design of a novel non-intrusive and non-invasive ultrasonic transducer array. Important design parameters are discussed and analyzed using simulations.

40|$|International audienceTesting the RF {{functions}} of systems-on-chip incurs {{a very high}} cost. Built-in test is a promising alternative to facilitate testing and reduce cost. However, designing built-in test circuits that tap into the sensitive RF signal paths, in order to extract useful information {{for the purpose of}} testing, often finds the designers reluctant since it results in some performance degradation that needs to be accounted for during the design. In this paper, we study a transparent built-in test approach based on <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>sensors</b> that are not electrically connected to the RF circuit under test. The <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>sensors</b> simply monitor process variations and by virtue of this they are capable of tracking variations in the performances of the RF circuit as well.

The <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>sensors</b> consist of single layout components copied from the topology of the LNA and dummy analog stages formed by identical components used in the topology of the LNA. The sensors are placed in close physical proximity to the LNA such that the sensor measurements track the performances of the LNA by virtue of die-to-die and correlated within-die process variations. In this way, the alternate test paradigm is used to infer the performances from the sensor measurements. Although the correlation between sensor measurements and performances is negatively affected by the uncorrelated within-die variations, we show that the correlation still holds strong even for the advanced 65 nm technology node where this type of variations is more pronounced. In addition, we show that instead of using dummy area-hungry inductors to monitor inductance variability, we can obtain {{the same level of}} correlation by monitoring instead the sheet resistances of the metal lines that form the coil of the inductors...|$|R

Two polyethylenes were used in experiments with three extruder screw geometries at a range of screw speeds. Data generated by the infrared sensor was found to be highly sensitive to thermal fluctuations relating to the melting performance of the extruder screw.

40|$|Abstract—Partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection is {{an important}} method to evaluate the insulation condition of metal-clad apparatus. Non-intrusive sensors which are easy to install and have no interruptions on operation are preferred in onsite PD detection. However, it often lacks of accuracy due to the interferences in PD signals. In this paper a novel PD extraction method that uses frequency analysis and entropy based time-frequency (TF) analysis is introduced. The repetitive pulses from convertor are first removed via frequency analysis. Then, the relative entropy and relative peak-frequency of each pulse (i. e. time-indexed vector TF spectrum) are calculated and all pulses with similar parameters are grouped. According to the characteristics of <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>sensor</b> and the frequency distribution of PDs, the pulses of PD and interferences are separated. Finally the PD signal and interferences are recovered via inverse TF transform. The de-noised result of noisy PD data demonstrates {{that the combination of}} frequency and time-frequency techniques can discriminate PDs from interferences with various frequency distributions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the beginning, the {{classical}} one-dimensional analysis of piezoelectric active sensors is reviewed. The complete derivation for a free-free sensor is then extended {{to cover the}} cases of clamped and elastically constrained sensors. An analytical model based on structural vibration theory and theory of piezoelectricity was developed and used to predict the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance response, {{as it would be}} measured at the piezoelectric active sensor’s terminals. The model considers one-dimensional structures and accounts for both axial and flexural vibrations. The numerical analysis was performed and supported by experimental results. Experiments were conducted on simple beam specimens to support of the theoretical investigation, and on thin gauge aluminum plates to illustrate the method’s potential. It was shown that E/M impedance spectrum recorded by the piezoelectric active sensor accurately represents the mechanical response of a structure. It was further proved that the response of the structure is not modified by the presence of the sensor, thus validating the sensor’s non-invasive characteristics. The sensor calibration procedure is outlined and statistical analysis was presented. It was found that PZT active sensors have stable and repeatable characteristics not only in as-received condition, but also while mounted on 1 -D or 2 -D host structure. It is shown that such sensors, of negligible mass, can be permanently applied to the structure creating a <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>sensor</b> array adequate for on-line automatic structural identification and health monitoring...|$|E

For instance, new resources are allocated to applications when the average {{load on the}} physical node exceeds a certain threshold.

As Web applications face significant variations in their request load, the amount of computational resources they use has to be dynamically adjusted.

40|$|For an {{increasing}} number of people living with chronic medical conditions, wearable wire-less sensor devices can provide non-intrusive yet continuous physiological monitoring al-lowing effective clinical management without compromising quality of life. Truly <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>sensor</b> devices will have light weight and small form factor, placing fundamen-tal constraints on the available energy, which necessitates very careful energy management at all layers. This chapter investigates the opportunities and challenges in the use of dy-namic radio transmit power control for prolonging the lifetime of such energy constrained body-wearable sensor devices. We first present extensive empirical evidence that the wireless link quality can change rapidly in body area networks, and a fixed transmit power results in either wasted energy (when the link is good) or low reliability (when the link is bad). We quantify the potential gains of dynamic power control in body-worn devices by benchmarking off-line the energy savings achievable for a given level of reliability. We then propose a class of schemes feasi-ble for practical implementation that adapt transmit power in real-time based on feedback information from the receiver. We profile their performance against the off-line benchmark, and provide guidelines on how the parameters can be tuned to achieve the desired trade-off between energy savings and reliability within the chosen operating environment. Finally, we implement and profile our scheme on aMicaZmote based platform, and also report pre-liminary results from the ultra-low-power integrated healthcare monitoring platformwe are developing at Toumaz Technology.

40|$|Waternomics is a European Union-funded {{research}} project aspiring {{to develop and}} introduce Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an enabling technology to manage water as a resource, increase end-user conservation awareness, affect behavioural changes and avoid water losses through leak detection. Existing leakage detection methods are generally focused on scrutinising large diameter pipes in water supply distribution networks or transmission pipes. However, {{it has been estimated}} that the average household's leaks can be as much as 35 m 3 of water per year. In order to solve the problem, analysis of different types of data in the household piping system is required, including detection and identification. One conventional approach is to use flow sensors installed at several locations within the household piping system and perform a mass balance approach to detect leakage. However, this method is expensive and difficult to implement. This research proposes a novel approach to household leakage detection by means of sound signal recordings. The approach consists of recording the sound signals that are produced by water fixtures and appliances, and then use these recordings to detect any abnormal situation which may be an indication of a leak. The method comprises three major steps: recording, storing and processing of sound signals. The recording step is done by means of a non-intrusive sound sensor that sends records remotely; the storage step is made in a database of sound signals for different types of uses; finally, the processing step is made through a sound signal identification software tool that is able to search the database libraries for related sounds, in a similar way as the Shazam app for music.

Potential specific ITS technologies that are either being implemented or are being considered include pre-trip information, en-route information, variable message signs, and Hoosier Helpers. It is expected that the implementation of various ITS technologies on the Borman Expressway will result in improved traffic flow, lower travel times, higher average speeds, and improved safety and environment. This study evaluated the impacts of these ITS technologies on mobility, air quality, and safety on the Borman Expressway and its vicinity. 1) Mobility - The performance of various ITS components under normal and incident conditions for the Borman Expressway Evaluation Network were simulated {{and the results were}} compared with the corresponding scenarios in the absence of these technologies. The results suggest that the network can accommodate the vehicles that divert from the Borman Expressway, indicated by the decrease in the overall network average travel time with increase in market penetration of information. Hence, providing en-route route diversion information to some users can result in significant benefits in terms of travel time savings and congestion alleviation. 2) Air Quality - The performance of various ITS components under normal and incident conditions for the Borman Expressway Evaluation Network were simulated and the resulting HC, CO, and NOx emissions were compared with the emissions under a do-nothing scenario. The same network was used for air quality impact evaluation that was used for evaluating the mobility impacts of ITS. The results obtained from the simulation experiments indicated that significant improvement in air quality can be achieved by effective implementation of various ITS technologies under normal and incident conditions. One important trend observed from the results of these experiments was that the magnitude of reduction in mobile emissions was highest under incident conditions with link closure, and lowest under normal peak-hour conditions. 3) Safety - By testing the hypothesis that secondary crashes may take place {{as a direct result of}} primary incidents or traffic congestion, safety impacts were evaluated. Logistic regression modeling was used to predict the likelihood (risk) of a primary incident being followed by a secondary crash, using the “best” combination of primary incident characteristics.
