5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by Australian {{electronic}} music group the Avalanches, released on 27 November 2000. It was issued on Modular Recordings and {{produced by the}} Avalanches' members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler). The album uses sampling extensively, containing an estimated 3,500 samples from various genres of music. The album was created in two separate <b>near-identical</b> studios by Chater and Seltmann, exchanging audio mixes of records they sampled.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a <b>near-identical</b> match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5|$|The flank vents have erupted {{andesite}} and dacite, {{belonging to}} a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a limited range of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect {{the small amount of}} research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have <b>near-identical</b> composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include amphibole, plagioclase and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian batholith.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts with the King's Bench, the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload, in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary. Reaching an acceptable medium with the King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts; with several courts of <b>near-identical</b> jurisdiction, there was little need for separate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880, the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist, marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas.|$|E
5|$|While {{good for}} the King's Bench, the Common Pleas became {{suspicious}} of the new developments, as legal fictions such as the Bill of Middlesex damaged its own business. Fighting against the King's Bench in a reactionary and increasingly conservative way, an equilibrium was eventually reached in the 17th century. Reaching an acceptable medium with the Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas {{proved to be the}} downfall of all three courts; with several courts of <b>near-identical</b> jurisdiction, there was little need for separate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. The King's Bench thus ceased to exist, except as the King's Bench (now Queen's Bench) Division of the High Court.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} seven Grade II listed buildings and one Grade II* listed building—the Church of All Saints. Some of the oldest parts of the church date from the 13th century, although the structure was virtually rebuilt afresh in 1877. The church roof consists of red tiles with a small broach spire and a wooden turret. The walls are made of flint with stone dressed buttresses and the windows date from the Restoration period. Other listed buildings in the vicinity include Southwood Farmhouse, Manor Farmhouse and the Upper Farmhouse. Southwood Farmhouse is two storeys high and dates from the 18th century. Its walls are made of red brick with cambered floor openings and its roof is steeply tiled. Manor Farmhouse lies {{to the south of}} the village and consists of a <b>near-identical</b> design with Southwood Farmhouse, although it was probably constructed in the early 19th century. The Upper Farmhouse lies in the centre of the village and is a house of mixed periods. The building itself dates from the 17th century, though expansions were made in the 18th and 19th centuries. The house has interior framing and a Victorian lighting system. Its taller expansions were made in the 18th century, and in between the expansions lies a 19th century gable with a brick porch at its north side.|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, <b>near-identical</b> statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E
25|$|The HM V type trams, {{alongside}} the <b>near-identical</b> RM 3 type produced {{at the same}} time by Valmet, were the last development in a series of five <b>near-identical</b> tram types produced by Karia and Valmet for operations on the Helsinki and Turku tram network during the 1950s (the previous types being HM IV and RM 1 for Helsinki and RM 2 for Turku).|$|E
25|$|ITRANS, ISCII, IAST (and the <b>near-identical</b> ISO 15919), and Harvard-Kyoto romanization schemes {{have been}} {{employed}} primarily for usage by non-native speakers {{who are more}} familiar with the Latin alphabet.|$|E
25|$|All {{cars have}} an {{aerodynamics}} package {{consisting of a}} front spoiler and splitter, side skirts and a rear wing. The aerodynamics package for each manufacturer is homologated {{after a series of}} tests which ensure that the different body styles produce <b>near-identical</b> downforce and drag numbers.|$|E
25|$|St John Altarpiece {{is one of}} Memling's {{more ambitious}} works, and shares <b>near-identical</b> scenes with two other works: the Donne Triptych, in London's National Gallery, and the Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.|$|E
25|$|Ninety-one 3-car {{units were}} built by Pressed Steel at Linwood near Paisley, from 1959–1961, {{although}} they were not introduced into service until 1960. A further 19 <b>near-identical</b> Class 311 units were built in 1967 following the Inverclyde electrification, although these units were built by Cravens in Sheffield.|$|E
25|$|One version {{suggests}} that the sunken ship was actually the Olympic, <b>near-identical</b> sister-ship of the Titanic, which {{was the subject of}} a large insurance claim, and that the two vessels were secretly switched before the voyage. Another was that the Titanic’s owner, J.P. Morgan, wanted to eliminate several prominent bankers who were opposing his plan for the creation of a U.S. central bank.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} monuments were erected {{due to a}} dispute. Many of {{the workers}} and their families wanted Jesse Jackson to speak in the city's memorial effort. Mayor Abbie Covington did not want Jackson involved and was backed up by many other local authority figures. One group of the survivors held their own service which included Jackson. Both services unveiled <b>near-identical</b> monuments, which are situated just 50 yards (46m) from each other.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Stone {{produced}} a miniseries for ABC Television called Wild Palms. In a cameo, Stone appears {{on a television}} in the show discussing how the theories in his film JFK had been proven correct (the series {{took place in a}} hypothetical future, 2007). That same year, he also spoofed himself in the comedy hit Dave, espousing an (accurate) conspiracy theory about the film President's replacement by a <b>near-identical</b> double. In 1997, Stone published A Child's Night Dream (St. Martin's Press), a semiautobiographical novel first written in 1966–1967.|$|E
25|$|Produced by Walt Disney Theatrical and {{directed}} by Richard Eyre with co-direction from Matthew Bourne who also acted as co-choreographer with Stephen Mear, the original West End production opened in December 2004 and won two Olivier Awards, one for Best Actress in a Musical {{and the other for}} Best Theatre Choreography. A Broadway production with a <b>near-identical</b> creative team opened on November 16, 2006, with only minor changes from the West End version. It has received seven Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, and winning for Best Scenic Design.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo 3DS Game Card is a {{media format}} used to {{physically}} distribute video games for Nintendo 3DS systems. Despite looking <b>near-identical</b> to its predecessor, the Nintendo DS Game Card, {{there is a}} small tab jutting out {{on the side of the}} card, preventing 3DS game cards from being inserted into a Nintendo DS. These game cards can hold up to either 1GB, 2GB or 4GB of game data depending on the game, which is 2, 4 and 8 times more storage, respectively, than the biggest Nintendo DS Game Card's capacity (512MB). Some sources claim that an 8GB version could be produced should a game ever require it.|$|E
25|$|MS Stockholm was {{the name}} of two <b>near-identical</b> ocean liners built by Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico, Monfalcone, Italy between 1936 and 1941 for the Swedish American Line. Neither of the ships entered service for the company that had ordered them—the first ship was entirely {{destroyed}} by fire during construction in 1938, while the second was completed in 1941 but immediately sold to the Italian government as a troopship. The second ship served for three years in the Regia Marina and Kriegsmarine under the name MS Saubadia, until sunk by British bombers outside Trieste in 1944. It is unknown if she was ever actually used as a troopship.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the Bell patent was {{acknowledged}} throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of Siemens & Halske (S) set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent. The Siemens company produced <b>near-identical</b> copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties. The establishment of the International Bell Telephone Company in Brussels, Belgium in 1880, {{as well as a}} series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation. The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his resignation from the company.|$|E
25|$|By 1912, the Post Office had {{received}} numerous complaints from postmasters that the many <b>near-identical</b> Washington stamps {{in the issue}} confused postal clerks, too often leading them to give customers higher denominations than they paid for. The Post Office addressed this problem in the series of 1912–14 by making {{a significant change in}} the line up in the Washington-Franklin denominations. Washington would now appear on the lower values only; all denominations of 8c and higher would display the Franklin-head. The realignment provided a clear visual distinction between the cheaper and the more expensive stamps. To further heighten the distinction, the Post Office now introduced the oak-leaf frame for the Franklin stamps, thus eliminating olive branches from the higher values along with Washington.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of its}} history, a {{connection}} was assumed between Chardonnay and Pinot noir or Pinot blanc. In addition to being found in the same region of France for centuries, ampelographers noted that the leaves of each plant have <b>near-identical</b> shape and structure. Pierre Galet disagreed with this assessment, believing that Chardonnay {{was not related to}} any other major grape variety. Viticulturalists Maynard Amerine and Harold Olmo proposed a descendency from a wild Vitis vinifera vine that was a step removed from white Muscat. Chardonnay's true origins were further obscured by vineyard owners in Lebanon and Syria, who claimed that the grape's ancestry could be traced to the Middle East, from where it was introduced to Europe by returning Crusaders, though little external evidence supports that theory. Another theory stated that it originated from an ancient indigenous vine found in Cyprus.|$|E
25|$|The Bristol 450 {{made its}} race debut at the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Two cars were entered, {{with a third}} held back as a spare. Unfortunately for Bristol, both were out before half {{distance}} with <b>near-identical</b> failures. In each case the balance weights became detached from the crankshaft. This caused the rear wheels to lock at high speed, in turn causing the cars to veer {{off the road and}} catch fire. However, in the laps that the cars had managed to complete, Jack Fairman easily managed to post a new lap record for the 2 litre class. The cars were rebuilt at the factory, incorporating the revised aerodynamic bodywork, and only three weeks later, in early July, were entered into the 12h race at Reims. The Reims track shared the high speed character of its French cousin at La Sarthe and suited the Bristol's character well. Although one car again broke down, this time due to transmission failure on the first lap, the remaining car cruised to a class victory and finished fifth overall.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the quest for {{simplicity}} the original design concept was not for a Washington-Franklin series, but for a series devoted exclusively to Washington, with all its <b>near-identical</b> stamps exhibiting the same image of the first United States President—they would differ from one another only in denomination and color. This idea originated with one Charles H. Dalton of Boston, who, {{in a letter to}} his Senator, Winthrop M. Crane, expressed admiration for the current British stamps, all of which employed the same profile portrait of King Edward VII. Dalton recommended that the next U.S. series be similarly uniform, with every one of its stamps presenting the same profile head of Washington found on the 2¢ denomination of the 1894 First Bureau Issue. The senator passed this letter on to the Postmaster General, George Meyer, who by and large followed Dalton’s recommendation. Full uniformity, however, would have violated a long-standing postal tradition dating back to 1851, which had placed Franklin on every definitive one-cent stamp issued by the U.S. Post Office. It may have been for this reason that Franklin was admitted to the 1908 series in the single case of the one-cent stamp. The Washington-Franklin series resulting from this compromise was designed by the renowned artist Clair Aubrey Houston, known for his many postage stamp designs. Most denominations of the 1902–03 series had been identical in color to their counterparts in the preceding First Bureau Issue. By contrast, the Washington-Franklin set preserved the previous colors only for its five lowest values: new and very different colors were chosen for all denominations of 6-cents and higher.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} second {{encounters}} of humanity with the monolith have visual elements in common; both apes, and later astronauts, touch the monolith gingerly with their hands, and both sequences conclude with <b>near-identical</b> images of the Sun appearing directly over the monolith (the first with a crescent moon adjacent {{to it in the}} sky, the second with a <b>near-identical</b> crescent Earth in the same position), both echoing the Sun–Earth–Moon alignment seen {{at the very beginning of}} the film. The second encounter also suggests the triggering of the monolith's radio signal to Jupiter by the presence of humans, echoing the premise of Clarke's source story [...] "The Sentinel".|$|E
500|$|An {{equilibrium}} {{between the}} courts was eventually reached, {{but the result}} was three common law courts (the Exchequer of Pleas, Common Pleas and King's Bench) with <b>near-identical</b> jurisdictions. By the 18th century, it was customary {{to speak of the}} [...] "twelve justices" [...] of the three courts, not distinguishing them, and assize cases were shared equally between them. In 1828, Henry Brougham complained in Parliament that ...|$|E
500|$|Operation Bernhard was an {{exercise}} by Nazi Germany to forge British bank notes. The initial {{plan was to}} drop the notes over Britain {{to bring about a}} collapse of the British economy during the Second World War. The first phase was run from early 1940 by the [...] (SD) under the title [...] (Operation Andreas, Operation Andrew). The unit successfully duplicated the rag paper used by the British, produced <b>near-identical</b> engraving blocks and deduced the algorithm used to create the alpha-numeric serial code on each note. The unit closed in early 1942 after its head, Alfred Naujocks, fell out of favour with his superior officer, Reinhard Heydrich.|$|E
500|$|The City {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Melissa Camacho of Common Sense Media criticized {{the program for}} featuring a <b>near-identical</b> plotline to its predecessor The Hills, where Lauren Conrad was similarly shown {{to pursue a career}} in the fashion industry while addressing difficulties among her friends. Ginia Bellefante from The New York Times suggested that the series was purposely produced sub-par to its parent series, commenting that it [...] "is not the advertisement for New York that The Hills, with its dreamily shot opening-credit sequence, is for Los Angeles". An editor from The Village Voice questioned if Port was interesting enough to lead her own spin-off series, describing her personality as featuring [...] "unavoidable, inexorable ordinariness".|$|E
500|$|On , Woolley {{met with}} the Commission of Fine Arts. [...] Woolley asked the Commission to view {{sketches}} produced by the Mint's engraving department. [...] Barber was present to explain the coinage process to the Commission members. [...] Woolley suggested to the members {{that if they did}} not like the Mint's work, they should [...] select sculptors to submit designs for the new pieces. [...] It was Woolley's intent to have distinct designs for the dime, quarter and half dollar—previously, the three pieces had been <b>near-identical.</b> [...] The director informed the Commission that as the existing coinage had been in use for 25 years, {{it would have to be}} changed—which numismatic historian David Lange calls a [...] "misinterpretation of the coinage laws".|$|E
500|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} legislation, Linderman had pattern coins prepared. [...] In August 1874, Philadelphia Mint superintendent James Pollock sent him patterns with an obverse showing a seated Liberty by Philadelphia sculptor Joseph A. Bailly with a reverse by chief engraver William Barber. [...] Pollock did not approve Bailly's proposal, deeming it too similar to the Seated Liberty design which was then on all domestic silver coinage, and so the new coin would too closely resemble the quarter. On March 31, 1875, after the enactment of Jones's bill, Pollock sent Linderman additional patterns, all by Barber, and even more on April 12. Pollock deprecated a reverse design with a shield, but Linderman liked it and stated {{that it would have been}} adopted but for the law requiring an eagle to appear on silver pieces larger than the dime. Linderman selected an obverse design <b>near-identical</b> to the other silver coinage (until 1916, the silver coins were given similar appearances). That design, by the late chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht, following a concept by Thomas Sully and Titian Peale, was first used in 1836 and by 1840 was on all denominations of silver coins then being struck. The right-facing eagle is <b>near-identical</b> to the one which Barber had rendered for the trade dollar, which had debuted in 1873. Linderman had realized that the difference in size between the new coin and quarter was small, and thought a scaled-down version of the trade dollar suitable for the twenty-cent piece; he got his way on the reverse. The eagle carries the arrows of war in its right, or dominant claw, and the olive branch of peace in the left, in heraldry preferring war over peace.|$|E
500|$|Another {{musical work}} {{has also been}} discovered, with {{identical}} or <b>near-identical</b> music, that long predates Alexandrov's 1943 involvement with the Anthem of the USSR. A Ukrainian Scouting (Plast) anthem from c. 1912, with music composed by Yuriy Piasećkiy (Юрій Пясецький) known as [...] "Plastovy Obit" [...] (Пластовий Oбіт - The Plast Oath), to lyrics by Plast founder Oleksander Tysovsky (Oлександр Тисовський) has been noted by Plast members to bear an extremely close or identical resemblance to the later Russian/Soviet anthem. The music and words are found in various Plast handbooks and songbooks, and a performance of this song in 2012 can be viewed on YouTube. The first line reads: [...] "V pozhezhakh vsesvitnykh, u lunakh kryvavykh" [...] - [...] "В пожежах всесвітних, у лунах кривавих". The Piasetsky-Tysovsky anthem actually glorifies the Ukrainian independence movement, which {{had the support of}} the Plast organization.|$|E
500|$|Simonsohn urged {{researchers}} to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An {{example of a}} confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of <b>near-identical</b> popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters [...] "Den" [...] compared to with [...] "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, {{and more likely to}} be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more [...] "Den" [...] dentists than [...] "Wal" [...] than implicit egotism.Using both a different data set (TwitterandGoogle+accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.|$|E
500|$|British {{dance music}} artist Airi L {{released}} a bootleg {{version of the}} song 9 May 2010, several days before the Guetta and Rowland version was due to be released. EMI Music called Airi L's version [...] "inferior" [...] and decided to combat her cover by releasing Guetta's version on 11 June 2009 in the UK, earlier than originally planned. The cover debuted and peaked at number twenty-two, selling 12,000copies whilst Guetta and Rowland's version debuted at number seven with 25,000copies. According to Yahoo! Music's James Masterton, Rowland's version would have debuted at a higher place {{had it not been}} for the [...] "bootleg cover". He said the single had to be rush released [...] "when not one but two spoiler (and indeed <b>near-identical)</b> cover versions started to race up the iTunes rankings and threatened to have a negatively impact on the 'official' version." [...] The following week Guetta and Rowland's version would debut at number one.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Jessica Hopper of Spin {{highlighted}} the album's slower songs, but concluded that L7 had essentially {{remained the same}} [...] "pop-metal" [...] band {{that they were in}} the past. Los Angeles Timess Greg Kot observed that, although the album explores a more textured and nuanced sound, its lack of energy in the second half makes [...] "such screeds as 'The Masses are Asses' come off as mean-spirited." [...] Writing for Salon, Jennie Yabroff felt that, while the album features compelling and thrilling songs, none [...] "has the depth or complexity to satisfy the listener beyond the initial junk-food high." [...] In a negative review, Carly Carioli of Boston Phoenix criticized the album for its vague lyrics.

500|$|With several tight corners, {{the prologue}} was {{expected}} to favour riders with good bike handling skills. The first rider to leave the start house in Liège was 's Tom Veelers, {{with most of the}} general classification contenders going {{towards the end of the}} starting order, as rain was not scheduled to disrupt the race. Veelers set a time of 7' 47" [...] for the course – which was <b>near-identical</b> to the 2004 prologue held in the city, won by then- rider Fabian Cancellara, over a [...] parcours – but this was immediately beaten by [...] rider Simon Gerrans, who went five seconds quicker around the course. Gerrans' lead was also not to last for long, as Ukrainian national champion Andriy Hryvko (...) bettered his mark by 14 seconds; the time was ultimately good enough for tenth place in the stage results. Hryvko held the lead for over an hour, as no other rider could get within three seconds of his time at that point.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the mint}} {{had given the}} twenty-cent piece a smooth rim, rather than the reeded one on the quarter, the two pieces were {{immediately}} confused. At , the twenty-cent piece was only slightly smaller than the quarter at , and the two pieces had <b>near-identical</b> obverses. Mistakes in change-making were widespread, and the twenty-cent piece quickly became extremely unpopular. [...] In April 1876, when Congress began to allow the redemption of fractional currency with coin, the twenty-cent piece was listed as among the denominations that could be exchanged for the low-denomination paper. Nevertheless, in July, legislation was introduced to abolish the twenty-cent piece. [...] Although the bill did not pass immediately, according to numismatist Vernon Brown in his article on the piece, the pendency of the bill convinced the mint {{that there was no}} point in striking further twenty-cent pieces. The mintage for 1876 was low (coining took place at Philadelphia and Carson City), and only proof specimens were coined in 1877 and 1878, at Philadelphia. Most of the 1876 Philadelphia mintage were sold as souvenirs at the Centennial Exposition.|$|E
500|$|On 28 April 1988, {{almost two}} months after the Gibraltar shootings, ITV {{broadcast}} an episode of its current affairs series This Week, produced by Thames Television, entitled [...] "Death on the Rock". This Week sent three journalists to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shootings from both Spain and Gibraltar. Using eyewitness accounts, and with the cooperation of the Spanish authorities, the documentary reconstructed the events leading up to the shootings; the Spanish police assisted in the reconstruction of the surveillance operation mounted against the IRA [...] members as they travelled around Spain in the weeks before 6 March, and the journalists hired a helicopter to film the route. In Gibraltar, they located several new eyewitnesses to the shootings, who each said they had seen McCann, Savage, and Farrell shot without warning or shot after they had fallen to the ground; most agreed to be filmed and provided signed statements. One witness, Kenneth Asquez, provided two <b>near-identical</b> statements through intermediaries, but refused to meet with the journalists or sign either statement. After failing to persuade Asquez to sign his statement, the journalists eventually incorporated his account of seeing Savage shot while on the ground into the programme.|$|E
