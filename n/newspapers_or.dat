5|$|In the 19th century, recessions {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said {{she had not seen}} any <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|However, known {{cases of}} the {{diffusion}} of writing, such as Sequoyah's invention of the Cherokee syllabary after seeing the power of English-language <b>newspapers,</b> <b>or</b> Uyaquk's invention of the Yugtun script inspired by readings from Christian scripture, involved greater contact than the signing of a single treaty. The glyphs could be crudely written rongorongo, {{as might be expected}} for Rapa Nui representatives writing with the novel instrument of pen on paper. The fact that the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was taboo; such taboos may have lost power along with the tangata rongorongo (scribes) by the time Rapanui society collapsed following European slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud's day. Orliac points out that Tablet C would appear to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the prison}} {{business}} was run by a debtors' committee of nine prisoners and a chair (a position held by Dickens' father). Appointed on the last Wednesday of each month, and meeting every Monday at 11am, the committee was responsible for imposing fines for rules violations, an obligation they met with enthusiasm. Debtors could be fined for theft; throwing water or filth out of windows or into someone else's room; making noise after midnight; cursing, fighting or singing obscene songs; smoking in the beer room from 8–10 am and 12–2 pm; defacing the staircase; dirtying the privy seats; stealing <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> utensils from the snuggery; urinating in the yard; drawing water before it had boiled; and criticizing the committee.|$|E
5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} told what she can and cannot do. After it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E

50|$|Publicity {{involves}} attaining {{space in}} media, {{without having to}} pay directly for such coverage. As an example, an organization may have the launch of a new product covered by a <b>newspaper</b> <b>or</b> TV news segment. This benefits the firm in question since it is making consumers aware of its product, without necessarily paying a <b>newspaper</b> <b>or</b> television station to cover the event.|$|R

25|$|Most {{defendants}} in defamation lawsuits are <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> publishers, which {{are involved in}} about twice as many lawsuits as are television stations. Most plaintiffs are corporations, businesspeople, entertainers and other public figures, and people involved in criminal cases, usually defendants or convicts but sometimes victims as well. In no state can a defamation claim be successfully maintained if the allegedly defamed person is deceased.|$|E
25|$|Other jobs include {{cleaning}} cars; petty vending, selling small {{items such}} as balloons or sweets; selling <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> flowers; begging; shining shoes; working in small hotels; working on construction sites; and working in roadside stalls or repair shops. Street children, especially the older children, are also sometimes engaged in activities such as stealing, pick-pocketing, drug-peddling, and prostitution, though {{this is a small}} proportion. Most of the street children work 8–10 hours total each day in their various economic activities.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s {{began with}} a five-month strike by workers over either wages and {{benefits}} (according to local <b>newspapers),</b> <b>or</b> unilateral work rules (according to the Industrial Union of Marine and Ship-building Workers). In {{the midst of the}} strike, the Navy towed , which was under conversion at the time, to the nearby Boston Navy Yard for completion, an action which prompted both laborers and management to negotiate a three-year contract and helped to nullify unpopular work rules. Later that year, the Long Beach was launched, which was a major achievement for the yard.|$|E
25|$|The Midd-West School District has {{procedures}} to identify children needing special education. Screening {{of children is}} conducted for hearing, vision, motor skills, and speech and language. If a disability is suspected, teachers, other school personnel, or parents may refer a child for an evaluation. Parents suspecting that their child may have a disability and needs special education or early intervention services can request a screening or an evaluation by contacting the superintendent's office. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in <b>newspapers</b> <b>or</b> other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them.|$|E
