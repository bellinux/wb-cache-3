5000|$|NSEL was {{promoted}} as a spot commodity exchange by FTIL and only token 100 shares {{were given to}} NAFED so that the brand of NAFED can be used and the exchange could be touted as a 'farmer's market'. Even before NSEL commenced business it was given a specific exemption from Forward Contracts Regulation Act (FCRA) 1952 by ministry of Consumer affairs in 2007 headed by Shri Sharad Pawar.This exemption was only for all one day forward contracts up to 11 days. Mr.Paul Joseph who signed this exemption later was known to have joined the FTIL group. The business between 2007-2009 was lackluster {{and that is when}} NSEL with full knowledge of Jignesh Shah and other board members introduced fraudulent 'paired contracts' where investors could buy short duration contract and sell a long duration contract at the same time (usually T+2 and T+25). NSEL in 2010 applied to FMC for registration of these NTSD (<b>Non</b> <b>Transferable</b> Specific Delivery [...] ) paired contracts exceeding 11 days under section 14A of FCRA. The FMC did not approve or reject this application till the scam broke out in 2013. Without waiting for the FMC regulation approval or registration, NSEL went ahead and sold these contracts rampantly through brokers. The FMC-Ministry of consumer affairs fully knowing these contracts were illegal (they were collecting NSEL data from early 2012) did not stop them and let the scam balloon into an astronomical amount.|$|E

"We {{call for}} a {{national}} dialogue on a revised Constitution to correct the inherent flaws in the present power structure by decentralizing the political system, making it more compatible with the diverse political, social and cultural nature of Afghanistan. The Afghan people deserve and need a parliamentary form of democracy instead of a personality-centered Presidential system.We firmly believe that any negotiation with the Taliban can only be acceptable, and therefore effective, if all parties to the conflict {{are involved in the}} process. The present form of discussions with the Taliban is flawed, as it excludes anti-Taliban Afghans. It must be recalled that the Taliban extremists and their Al-Qaeda supporters were defeated by Afghans resisting extremism with minimal human embedded support from the United States and International community. The present negotiations with the Taliban fail {{to take into account the}} risks, sacrifices and legitimate interests of the Afghans who ended the brutal oppression of all Afghans.In order to speed the withdrawal of international forces, the participants believe it is essential to strengthen regional and national institutions that are inclusive and represent the concerns of all the communities of Afghanistan. The participants favor a change in the Electoral System from a Single <b>Non</b> <b>Transferable</b> Vote System to a nationally accepted variant of the Proportional Representation system with equal opportunities for both independent candidates, the political parties, or tribal representatives. We also support the election of Governors and empowerment of provincial councils.

40|$|The Value is a {{solution}} concept originally due to Shapley (1953). The idea behind the concept is to evaluate how much will a player {{be willing to pay}} to participate in a given game. It seeks to represent what the game is worth for a player. In some sense the value captures the expected outcome of the game. We will start with the TU (transferable utility) framework and the axiomatic approach and then consider various extensions to the NTU (<b>non</b> <b>transferable</b> utility) case...|$|E
40|$|We study {{equity in}} economies where agents are endowed with different, <b>non</b> <b>transferable,</b> {{personal}} talents. To compensate them for such differences a given {{amount of money}} needs to be shared among them. We axiomatize a family of social orderings over allocations based on efficiency, fairness and robustness properties. Taking into account incentive constraints we derive the optimal policy: individuals with the same talent need to be equally compensated and only people whose level of talent is below a certain threshold should receive a positive compensation. compensation, talents, fairness, axioms, social orderings, incentive- compatibility...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a matching {{model in which}} individuals belonging to two populations (‘males’and ‘females’) can match to share their exogenous income risk. Within each population, individuals can be ranked by risk aversion in the Arrow-Pratt sense. The model permits <b>non</b> <b>transferable</b> utility, {{a context in which}} few general results have previously been derived. We show that in this framework (i) a stable matching always exists, (ii) it is essentially unique, and (iii) it is negatively assortative: for any two couples, the more risk averse male is matched with the less risk averse female. We discuss the implications of these results for the empirical analysis of risk-sharing. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{alternative}} way {{to build a new}} environmen- tal agreement after the deadline of the Kyoto Protocol. Considering the many lacks of the previous international environmental agreements we build a cooperative game with <b>Non</b> <b>Transferable</b> Utility (NTU). Two or more countries are considered to form a coalition if they sign a multilateral environmental agreement. We show {{that it is possible to}} find a self-generating system corresponding to the formation of a stable grand coalition on the aim to induce an ecient environmental agreement. The con- vexity and positive externalities imply the eciency of the grand coalition. In other words, convexity implies that a coalition can achieve at least as much as what its part can achieve...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{estimate}} the magnitudes of yield gaps, causative factors and constrains for attending greater farm potential in adsali, suru, preseasonal and ratoon sugarcane production in Maharashtra. Primary data were collected from 250 sugarcane cultivators using random sampling technique. Data collected during 2011 - 2012 were analyzed using the IRRI methodology on yield gaps, multiple linear regression and tabular analysis. Results reveal that the magnitude of yield gap-I was higher, which implies that, the technology developed at research station cannot be duplicated on demonstration plots to exploit the full potential of sugarcane. This gap was attributable to environmental differences and <b>non</b> <b>transferable</b> component of technology. The orthodox practices being followed on farmerâ€™s field lead to yield gap-II. The farmers usually do not adopt a technology as a package but take up individual practices suitably trimmed to fit into their budget and skills (management and operational) which lead to the variation in the adoption of cultural practices and consequently to the yield gaps. The yield gaps cannot be completely eliminated, but can be minimized by efficient and effective resources management...|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{studies the}} {{financial}} structure in buyout firms under moral hazard due to unobservable efforts and an excessive risk-taking. The {{choice of the}} exit route may lead to agency conflicts between the entrepreneur and the LBO firm: the former may take very risky decisions to increase the probability of IPO exit. If the target is taking public, he gets a <b>non</b> <b>transferable</b> and private benefit. The opportunistic behavior of the entrepreneur decreases the probability of sale exit; the preferred exit route of the LBO firm. Without moral hazard, {{there are many ways}} to finance the project and the two agents exert strictly positive efforts. With moral hazard, the entrepreneur, the LBO firm and the bank must finance jointly the buyout. Financing the project through standard debt-equity contracts does not implement the first-best solution. Only a set of projects can be financed through both the LBO fund and the bank at the macroeconomic level.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} same notations {{and some of the}} results of BATON and LE~IAIRE (1981). The reader is {{referred}} to that work for more details about the classical risk exchange model, which will not be recalled here. The main result of that former paper was to characterize the core of the market in the case of exponential utdities, and to show that it is never empty. Since the core always exists, and since ~t ~s such an intuitive notion, one m~ght wonder why we introduce here a much more complicated concept. The reason is that the core is presently subject to a heavy fire of critmisms-both experimental and theore-tmal-from leading researchers in game theory; they claim that tile core is much too static, that ~t {{does not take into account}} the real dynamics of the bargaining process, that it does not introduce the full spectrum of negotiation threats of the traders. Indeed, experimental data consistently produce final payoffs that he outside the core, but within the bargaining set (abbreviated: b. s.)

40|$|The {{target of}} this thesis was the {{synthesis}} of different substituted cyclic sulfoximines suitable for the use as ligands in the asymmetric 1, 4 -addition. This aim was tried to achieve through synthesis of different substituted cyclic sulfoximines for the use as chiral nontransferable ligands in the stoichometric conjugate addition. Another topic was {{the synthesis of}} sulfoximines which could work as ligands in the catalytic conjugate addition. The ortho directed lithiation used for the ortho-alkylation of the cyclic sulfoximines worked with good yields and selectivities. Unfortunately the further functionalisation in ortho-position with different donor atoms for the use as chiral ligands failed. The reactivity of cyclic sulfoximines was investigated in different metallation and deuteration experiments. An interesting rearrangement occured for the dimethyl substituted cyclic sulfoximines. By ortho-lithiation of this sulfoximines and warming up to room temperature the sulfoximines rearranged to 2 -aminothiobenzene-derivatives. This rearrangement reaction was further investigated by NMR-experiments and {{it was possible to}} determine the configuration at the sulfur atom after the rearrangement by an X-ray analysis. The reaction proceeded under inversion of the configuration. The enantiomeric pure rearrangement products belong to a pharmaceutical interesting group of compounds. The stoichometic conjugate addition with cyclic sulfoximines as chiral <b>non</b> <b>transferable</b> ligands with cuprates was carried out with exellent yields but moderate enantioselectivities. In the catalytic enantioselective conjugte addition good yields but only moderate enantioselctivities were achieved with the neutral sulfoximines...|$|E
