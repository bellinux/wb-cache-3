40|$|The {{problem of}} {{irrecoverable}} receivables {{has to be}} solved by every company. <b>Insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> offer one possibility of handling this problem. The ever-increasing number of <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> caused in the present economic situation by {{the expansion of the}} financial crisis and partially due to a certain novelty of the Insolvency Act, provides adequate material for examining this problem. The following article concerns in its theoretical part the possible causes that lead company to bankruptcy, <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> as such and also the evolution of the number of insolvency proposals in the past two years. The article aims to document the experiences of Czech creditors, especially from among the ranks of small and medium firms, with settling overdue receivables by means of <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Their experiences were investigated with the aid of questionnaire surveys. Overdue receivables are registered by half of all respondents. However, only 5 % from the entire volume of receivables are settled by <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> In most cases, receivables amounting to small sums, i. e. up to CZK 50 thousand, were at issue.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) No. 2015 / 848 on <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> (recast) as concerns the coordination among <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The recast Regulation {{on the one}} hand maintains the general framework of the pre-existing Regulation (EC) No. 1346 / 2000, based on the co-existence of the main <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> to be opened in the Member State where the debtor possesses the centre of his main interests (COMI), and secondary insolvency proceeedings, which may be opened in another Member State where the debtor possesses an establishment, with effects limited to the debtor’s assets present within that Member State. On the other hand, the recast Regulation introduces a series of amendments, inspired to the objective of securing the prevalence of the main insolvency proceeedings. These amndments tend to favour the concentration within the main <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> of the whole of the operations inherent in the disposal of the insolvency of the debtor, so as to reduce as far as possible the need for secondary <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> to be opened in another Member State. This aim is concretely pursued by granting extensive powers to the administrator of the main <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> among which, the power of undertaking to apply, as concerns the protection of creditors’ rights in respect of assets located in a Member State where secondary <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> could have been opened, the same law as would have applied in case such proceedings were opened (s. c. “synthetic” or “virtual” secondary <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings).</b> The recast Regulation contains also express provisions dealing with jurisdiction on actions directly deriving from <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> and closely linked with them, favouring their joinder, either before the courts of the Member State competent for the <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> as such, or before the courts competent for other actions in civil and commercial matters to which they may be related. The new Regulation refrains instead from regulating the relationships between the <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> and pending lawsuits or arbitral proceedings concerning assets of the debtor, which are left for domestic law to regulate, thereby exposing the uniformity in the application of the Regulation to the risk inherent in the differences among Member States’ laws on the subject. Furthermore, reflecting a traditional, strictly inter partes approach, the new Regulation, unlike the Brussels I recast Regulation, falls short of addressing the problems of coordination which might arise with proceedings pending before third country courts...|$|R

40|$|With the Council {{regulation}} (EC) No. 1346 / 2000 of 29 May 2000 on <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> {{that came}} into effect May 31, 2002 the European Union has introduced a legal framework for dealing with cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> In order to achieve the aim of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> having cross-border effects within the European Community, the provisions on jurisdiction, recognition and applicable law {{in this area are}} contained in a Regulation, a Community law measure which is binding and directly applicable in Member States. The goals of the Regulation, with 47 articles, are to enable cross-border <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> to operate efficiently and effectively, to provide for co-ordination of the measures to be taken with regard to the debtor’s assets and to avoid forum shopping. The Insolvency Regulation, therefore, provides rules for the international jurisdiction of a court in a Member State for the opening of <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the (automatic) recognition of these proceedings in other Member States and the powers of the ‘liquidator’ in the other Member States. The Regulation also deals with important choice of law (or: private international law) provisions.

40|$|Purpose of the article: The adverse {{economic}} {{situation in the}} Czech Republic has elicited a rising number of proposals to commence <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> <b>Insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> are resolved by the insolvency act from January 2008. The longer the duration of <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the higher are their costs, which reduce gained yields. Methodology/methods: Research {{is focused on the}} area of small and medium-sized enterprises. The research was based on a questionnaire survey in which representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech Republic were addressed. The questionnaire contained 18 closed questions. The research results are evaluated and presented through a graphical representation. Scientific aim: The article aims to gain information from representatives of small and medium firms as to how they settle overdue receivables, how they enforce them, whether they have had experience with an arbitration clause and whether they have been participants in <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Findings: Research has demonstrated that small and medium enterprises, for the most part, do not include an arbitration clause in purchase agreements. Small and medium enterprises tend to utilize court enforcement of receivables in exceptional cases and do not ascertain receivables of a subject in <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> They mostly enforce their irrecoverable receivables themselves. The relative amount of transaction costs connected with enforcement of receivables is in the vicinity of 1 to 5 %, and only a small part (1 to 5 %) of the volume of overdue receivables in <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> are truly successfully enforced. Conclusions: The course of <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings</b> can be considered to be an urgent problem in need of a solution, as the longer the duration of <b>insolvency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the higher the costs for the parties involved and the lower the total amount recovered...|$|R
