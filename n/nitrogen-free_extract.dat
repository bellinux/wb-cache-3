40|$|Alternative {{sources of}} feeds {{offering}} high-quality nutrients, especially proteins, limiting amino acids but also energy, {{could be found}} in unconventional plants. One of the possible ways of replacing feeds of animal origin in the rations for monogastric ani-mals is the use of amaranth and its processed prod-ucts, which meet the demands for substitution of meat-and-bone meals (Herzig, 2001). Grain of the current amaranth species is of high nutritional value. Dry matter content ranges from 90 to 94 %, N-substances from 15 to 18 %, ether ex-tract (fat) from 6 to 8 %, crude fibre from 3 to 5 %, ash from 2 to 3 %, and <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extracts</b> range between 60 and 65 %. The advantage of amaranth grains compared to conventional cereals is a rela-tively high content of proteins and more balanced composition of essential amino acids (Carlsson, 1979; Bressani et al., 1987 b; Szelényi-Galántai and Zsolnai-Harszi, 1992; Andrasofszky et al., 1998). All species under study show favourable amino acid composition. Amaranth grain is rich in lysine and tryptophan, which are comparable to proteins of animal origin; the levels of sulphur amino ac-ids are also higher, the content of leucine is low (Bressani et al., 1992), and the limiting amino acid is threonine (Jarošová et al., 1997). Lysine content of A. hypochondriacus 5. 95 g/ 16 g N is higher com-pared to 2. 90 g/ 16 g N in wheat flour (Dodok et al., 1997). A suitable content of lysine and tryptophan together with low content of leucine makes it a high-quality supplement e. g. for maize, which is rich in leucine but poor in lysine and tryptophan (Vetter...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} review on the feeding practice, the {{nutritional}} pathology and the documented nutritional peculiarities of zoo ruminants. The difference in chemical composition between browse and grass historically {{led to the}} conclusion that browsers need a diet lower in fibre and higher in protein than grazing ruminants. The term “concentrate selectors”, coined to describe browsing ruminants, additionally focused the attention on the chemical nature of a browser’s diet assumed high in easily fermentable, soluble nutrients; the choice of the term “concentrate” therefore has been critized in the scientific literature (e. g. Owen-Smith 1996). In comparative nutritional surveys, browsing ruminants in zoos tend to consume less fibre, more protein and more <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extracts</b> than grazers. While this could be interpreted as a reflection of their nutritional needs, this feeding type displays, in comparative pathological surveys, a higher incidence of acidotic changes in the ruminal mucosa, indicating that this group does not ingest sufficient amounts of fibrous material. Additionally, data from controlled bilance trials does not support the notion that browsing ruminants have higher protein requirements. We suspect that the lesser fibre intake in browsers is due to their reluctance to ingest hay, which is usually offered ad libitum. Reluctance to ingest hay and digestive problems after hay ingestion have been reported for different captive browsing ruminant species and is reflected by a similar reluctance of free-ranging browsers to ingest grasses. There is reason to believe that it is the physical rather than the chemical difference between grass and browse that affected the evolution of different ruminant feeding types. Attention within the zoo community should focus on providing browsers with a fibre source that corresponds to the physical characteristics of their natural forage...|$|R

In phase one, group one (T 1) was the control without any feed additive, T 1 was added (per quintal) with (g) 100, 120 & 80; 0. 305, 0. 366 & 0. 244 and 12, 14. 4 & 9. 6 of probiotic (Sacchyromycescerevisiae), xylanase and phytase enzymes, to make T 2, T 3 and T 4 diets, respectively. Initial, final and total weights (kg) in both the phases of the experiment were not significant. Number of days taken to reach the target weight (35 kg) was lower (P< 0. 05) in T 3 and T 2 for phases 1 and 2, respectively. Average daily feed intake (kg) and average daily gain (g) were lower and higher in T 3 and T 2 in phases 1 and 2, respectively and were not significant. The trend was similar for total feed intake (kg), feed conversion ratio and cost of feed per kg production (Rs). The total feed intake in phase one was lower (P< 0. 05) in T 3 than others. The digestibility of organic matter, crude fibre, ether extract and <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract</b> among groups were not significantly different, but the digestibility of crude fibre (CF) and <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract</b> (NFE) tended to be more in T 3.

Six isonitrogenous (30 % crude protein) and isocaloric (16. 5 kJ/g) practical diets were formulated. The control diet contained fish meal, soybean meal, meat and bone meal and copra meal as principal protein sources. Feed pea meal was progressively substituted at 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 % and 30 % of total protein. A leading commercial milkfish feed was also tested as an additional control. The experimental diets were fed to triplicate groups of milkfish fingerlings (mean initial weight of 0. 42 Â± 0. 01 g) at 10 % body weight/day. Growth performance (expressed as percentage of weight gain and SGR), survival, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of milkfish fed diets with up to 10 % substitution of the dietary protein with feed pea meal were not significantly different (P> 0. 05) compared to fish fed the control diet. Replacement with feed pea meal at 15 % and higher levels led to milkfish fed these diets showing a significantly lower growth response compared to fish fed with the control without any feed pea meal. Nevertheless, it was observed that milkfish fed diets with up to 20 % of total dietary protein substitution with feed pea meal showed better growth rates and feed conversion ratios than the commercial feed control. Whole body composition (crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extracts</b> and ash content) of milkfish fed the various test diets was not significantly different. Apparent digestibility coefficients of feed pea meal and experimental diets in milkfish were also determined.

Sadržaj sirovih bjelančevina (CP) se smanjio od 133 u kontrolnoj silaži do 116 i 117 g/kg DM (P < 0, 05) u silažama pripremljenim s 15 odnosno 30 g ekstrakta kestena/ kg siliranog materijala. Silaže pripremljene s povećanim količinama ekstrakata tanina kestena imale su veće količine od 11, 2 do 13, 6 g N u pravoj bjelančevini/kg DM u kontrolnoj silaži i silaži pripremljenoj s 30 g ekstrakta kestena/kg svježe trave. Nasuprot tome količine octene, propionske i maslačne kiseline nisu se značajno promijenile. Dobiveni rezultati navode na zaključak da se tanini mogu uspješno upotrijebiti kao dodaci silaži s povoljnim djelovanjem na topivost bjelančevina i sadržaj pravih bjelančevina. Fresh {{meadow grass}} was ensiled with {{chestnut}} tannin extract (Farmatan 75 ®, Tanin Sevnica, Slovenia) at concentrations of 0 (control), 3, 15 and 30 g of extract/kg of ensiling material. Addition of tannins to the fresh grass material {{did not change}} substantially the dry matter (DM), ether extract and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) contents of silages. The crude fibre content decreased (P < 0. 05) and <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extracts</b> increased (P < 0. 05) with the increasing amounts of added chestnut extract. The crude protein (CP) content decreased from 133 in control silage to 116 and 117 g/kg DM (P < 0. 05) in silages prepared with 15 and 30 g of chestnut extract/kg of ensiling material, respectively. Silages prepared with increasing amounts of chestnut tannin extract had greater amounts (from 11. 2 to 13. 6 g N in true protein/kg DM in control silage and silage prepared with 30 g of chestnut extract/kg of fresh grass, respectively) and proportion of N in true protein (TrueN) (from 52. 3 to 72. 5 % of N in control silage and silage prepared with 30 g of chestnut extract/kg of fresh grass, respectively). On the contrary, the amounts of soluble N (SolN) decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) with increasing amounts of chestnut tannin extract from 8. 9 to 3. 0 and 2. 9 g N/kg DM in control silage and silages prepared with 15 and 30 g of chestnut extract/kg of fresh grass, respectively. In accordance with the above mentioned trends, the proportions of SolN in total CP contents also decreased (P < 0. 05) from 43. 7 to 15. 7 % in control silage and silage prepared with 15 g of chestnut extract/kg of ensiling material, respectively. Increasing the amounts of chestnut extract in silages also decreased the amounts of ammonia-N in silages. The addition of chestnut tannin extract did not influence pH values of silages. The highest amounts of added chestnut tannin extract (15 and 30 g/kg of fresh grass) significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased lactic acid content (from 101 to 81 g/kg DM in control silage and silages with 15 and 30 g of chestnut extract/kg of fresh grass, respectively). On the contrary, the amounts of acetic, propionic and butyric acid did not change significantly. Obtained results suggest that tannins can be successfully used as silage additives, with favorable effects on protein solubility and true protein contents...|$|R

40|$|The {{roe deer}} {{belong to the}} {{markedly}} selective type of free-living ruminants and thus it is impor-tant to know the intake of individual feeds mainly {{in relation to the}} their quality. Little is known about the neurohumoral regulation of feed intake as well as about the passage of digesta in the guts. In the red deer the mean passage speed of digesta is twice as fast as that observed in domestic ruminants and it can only be supposed that this process is even faster in the red deer. Lochman (1975) stated the digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, fibre and <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract</b> in meadow hay to be 56 and 38 %, 37 and 31 %, 57 and 31 % and 57 and 35 % in roe does and bucks, respectively.

40|$|A {{digestibility}} {{study was}} conducted in which an identical diet was fed to five species, namely, rats, pigs, sheep, guinea pigs and humans. The diet consisted mainly of whole wheat. As fed, it was found to be unsuitable for digestibility studies with guinea pigs. With sheep, a basal hay diet was fed and digestion coefficients determined indirectly. Variability between individuals was relatively low, for all species, for food fractions other than crude fiber and ether extract. Humans digested crude fiber to the same extent as pigs and rata. The range of the digestion coefficients for crude protein, <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract</b> and digestible energy was remarkably small, considering that the species used in this study had anatomically different digestive systems. All species showed significant differences in the total digestible nutrients and digestible energy of the diet. Further research is needed in comparative species digestibility studies with humans...|$|E
40|$|Nutrients {{present in}} the {{feedstuffs}} are not completely available to the animal body. Large portions of the nutrients are excreted In the faeces because of being not digested In the alimentary tract. Therefore, the digestibility of the feedstuff {{is defined as the}} portion of a feed or nutrient of feed which is not recovered In faeces, i. e., the portion which has been absorbed by the animal. When the digestibility is expressed in percentage it is known as digestibility coefficient. Digestibility coefficients are calculated for dry matter, crude protein, crude fibre, ether extract and <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract.</b> Digestibility of gross energy {{present in the}} food can also be determined. The digestibility coefficients normally determined are the apparent digestibility coefficients since the nutrients found in the faeces contain small proportion of nutrients from the previously utilized food In the form of mucosal debris, unspent enzymes ate...|$|E

Moisture was determined by oven drying at 105  °C for 24  h; crude protein (nitrogen ×  6.25) was determined by Kjeldahl method after acid hydrolysis; lipid was extracted by petroleum ether (boiling point 40 – 60  °C) for 7 – 8  h in a Soxhlet apparatus followed by determination of lipid gravimetrically; crude fibre was determined as loss on ignition of dried lipid-free residues after digestion with 1.25  % H 2 SO 4 and 1.25  % NaOH and ash was determined by combustion at 550  °C in a muffle furnace till a constant weight was achieved. <b>Nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract</b> (NFE) was calculated by taking the sum of values for crude protein, crude fibre, crude lipid, moisture and ash and subtracting this from 100.

30|$|Citrus pulp meal {{presented}} a lower <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract</b> and crude energy than the wheat meal, but with higher values than those observed with citrus peel meal (Moreno Alvarez et al. 2000). The bromatological {{analysis of the}} CPD exhibited a higher value of crude protein (CP 44.3 %), CL (19.8 %) and CF (3.6 %) {{in comparison to the}} CON, although the gross energy (GE) content was lower in comparison to the CON (Table  3). Besides, the CP values of the CPD were higher in orange pulp (8.5 % here) than that reported by Lashkari and Taghizadeh (2012) and Rodriguez et al. (2012) (6.2 % in these other studies). This high CP content could be due to the silage procedure that contributed to the increase in protein content due to anaerobic bacteria activity and the bacteria themselves. The amino acid values of the CPD were higher in most of the IAA, except methionine and lysine, which are the most limiting AAs in fish nutrition. Cystine, tyrosine, serine and glutamine were also lower in comparison to the CON values (Table  3).|$|E
40|$|Influence of Various Physicochemical Treatments of Mucuna pruriens Seeds on the Nutrient Chemical Composition. Mucuna pruriens {{is being}} intensively {{used to fight}} off couch grass Imperata cylindrica and restore washed out {{lithosol}} fertility, {{in most of the}} agro ecological zones of Benin. From the huge amount of grains harvested, only a small part is used as seeds. This study was made {{to determine the effects of}} different ways of processing Mucuna pruriens var. utilis and M. pruriens var. cochichennensis grains on the toxic factor contents such as L-dopa and other antinutritionnal factors. Of the different physical and chemical treatment tested, grilling remarkably increased the potential nutritional content while boiling gave lower nutrient values. While awaiting assessment of the residual L-dopa level, the following treatment could be advised : after a preliminary soaking of the grains in cold water during 24 hours, they were dehulled and grilled for one hour. That procedure offered higher dry matter, higher crude protein and higher <b>nitrogen-free</b> <b>extract</b> in the preparations. The chemical contents of the two cultivars are not identical but dry matter and phosphorus contents are comparable...|$|E
