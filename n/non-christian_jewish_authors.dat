50|$|Although {{there was}} a huge amount of work being {{accomplished}} in Spain, there was no central school for translating and no real organized effort, as there had been at times among the Arabs.

Some scholars, however, have suggested that Raymond de Sauvetât the Archbishop of Toledo, seems to have started an organized movement of support for translations, and many scholars who seem to be associated with him in documents may have translated two-by-two, working together.|$|R
