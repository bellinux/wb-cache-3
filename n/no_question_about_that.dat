(The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that.

Still, the war went on; many battles were fought, many cities were besieged, the Roman power gaining ground all the time, though not, however, by any very decisive victories.|$|R
40|$|In query learning, {{the goal}} is to {{identify}} an unknown object while minimizing the number of yes or <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> (queries) posed <b>about</b> <b>that</b> object. We consider three extensions of this fundamental problem that are motivated by practical considerations in real-world, time-critical identification tasks such as emergency response. First, we consider the problem where the objects are partitioned into groups, and {{the goal is}} to identify only the group to which the object belongs. Second, we address the situation where the queries are partitioned into groups, and an algorithm may suggest a group of queries to a human user, who then selects the actual query. Third, we consider the problem of query learning in the presence of persistent query noise, and relate it to group identification. To address these problems we show that a standard algorithm for query learning, known as the splitting algorithm or generalized binary search, may be viewed as a generalization of Shannon-Fano coding. We then extend this result to the group-based settings, leading to new algorithms. The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on simulated data and on a database used by first responders for toxic chemical identification. ...|$|R
50|$|Edward P. Hurt, {{who became}} head track coach at Morgan State University (then known as Morgan State College) in 1929. In the early days, when the CIAA conference stood for “Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association”, Coach Hurt {{reportedly}} said, “We had {{a heck of}} a problem getting started; there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that.” At <b>that</b> time, the small black colleges played one another and received little national attention. Hurt said, “It was hard to get recognition, especially, in track & field, and we just {{never had a chance to}} compete against the better schools. When we first started trying to improve our program, nobody knew we were alive.” Coach Hurt started developing a premier program and he built Morgan State into a national power dynasty. By 1950 Morgan State’s Track Team was drawing national and international attention due to the impressive showing at the Penn Relays. In 1950, the foursome, known as The Historic Four, of Sam LaBeach, Bob Tyler, Bill Brown and George Rhoden, broke the Class A Mile Relay Championship of America race record at the Penn Relays that stood for 56 years. Many elite track athletes, attracted by Morgan’s increasing notoriety, came to the school because of the popularity of its track team during that era. His presence was legionary, players wanted to go the extra mile, didn’t’ want to let him down. He was a father figure to the athletes. He and “Mom Hurt”, his wife G. Beatrice Hurt, took the kids into their home during non-competition times. His influence is why guys went to Morgan because coach considered the athletes his kids. You can still hear him stay “Run from there at the 100 mark”. Hurt was awarded with many honors, including in 1975 he was the first Black coach inducted to the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame.|$|R

40|$|The paper puts {{forward a}} case for more {{attention}} {{to be paid to}} fundamental structural factors that will determine the scope and success of any regional integration initiative in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The paper provides a review of current estimates of trade potential in the region and contrasts this with the author's own estimates of intra-regional trade. A gravity model is used. The model examines how the reduction of trade transaction costs, the level of development and the size of an economy influences trade potential amongst countries. A major finding is that fundamental structural and economic factors such as the transaction costs of trading, the growth paths of economies and changes in per capita income should be the focus of regional integration rather than trade policy in its own right. The empirical results show that intra-regional trade in SADC is not low by international standards. When compared to regions such as the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) or Mercosur, actual South African exports are higher than estimated potential exports. However, the model indicates low trade volumes for combinations of countries in the SADC region. In particular, there is increasing scope for non-SACU countries to increase their exports to South Africa. These arguments have to be seen {{in the context of the}} impending Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in the SADC region. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> the fact <b>that</b> an FTA will enhance the prospects for increasing intra-regional trade. However, it is important not to exaggerate the impact of a regional agreement. In other words, there is no substitute for national economic policies that are conducive to growth.

40|$|Today's {{world is}} {{characterized}} by volatility and uncertainty. Cooperation is needed to survive in this harsh business climate. Cooperation in supply chains are practiced and well known but in today's tough and volatile environment {{it is simply not}} enough. Wastes and unnecessary processes have to be eliminated to secure a competitive advantage. Incorporating lean in supply chains get more and more attention and embrace in the modern literature and media. Lean implemented in supply chains is praised to create a proactive supply chain that successfully eliminate waste and create efficiency. In the thesis the negative aspects, the angle that is very seldom described in the literature, of incorporating lean in supply chain is researched. I will view lean from the management perspective and research the negative aspects, their cause and impact on the entire supply chain. Being aware of the criticism of lean from the employee and society perspective this research serves to find if lean from the management perspective is a flawless story. To achieve the aim of this thesis I conducted a survey research where 100 supply chain executives from different countries, different industries and of different designations within supply chain management were asked to share their lean experience. The summary of my research show that lean incorporated in supply chains is not only a sunshine story. I can conclude problems, even a mismatch, with the lean concept incorporated in supply chains- the time sensibility lean brings. In my research it became obvious that lean supply chains are very sensitive to delays and that the consequences of the delays will strike very hard - hence the lean supply chain can also be seen as more vulnerable and fragile compared to ordinary supply chains. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> the fact <b>that</b> any company, any network of companies or a supply chain for that matter, are better off without delays. A delay will always be negative. In a lean environment, where time aspects such as Just-In-Time and a pull scenario are present, a delay will immediately ruin the entire execution and the consequences will naturally spread in the supply chain. In today's volatile and ever changing world I believe that leanness in supply chains are indeed needed but to an extent where the time factors are viewed realistically in order to avoid drastic consequences. My conclusion is that supply chains should be realistically lean, bearing the time factors of lean in mind, to avoid being mean. I encourage every supply chain to identify their lean level in order to avoid a mean result...|$|R

When our great brethren the disenslaved Brazilians frame their Declaration of Independence, I hope they will insert this missing link: [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all monarchs are usurpers, and descendants of usurpers; for the reason that no throne was ever set up in this world by the will, freely exercised, of the only body possessing the legitimate right to set it up--the numerical mass of the nation." ...|$|E

Over there, twenty thousand people in a million elect themselves gentlemen and ladies, and the nine hundred and eighty thousand accept that decree and swallow the affront which it puts upon them. Why, if they didn't accept it, it wouldn't be an election, it would be a dead letter and have no force at all. Over here the twenty thousand would-be exclusives come up to the polls and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen. But the thing doesn't stop there. The nine hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen too, and that elects the whole nation.
