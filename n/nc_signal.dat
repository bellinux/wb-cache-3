30|$|A two-way relay {{transmission}} typically {{consists of}} two stages: multiple access stage and broadcast stage. NC is applied in the second stage and has two types. The first type of NC is performed in the bit level [3]. Each node transmits its packet to the relay node successively. The relay node decodes each packet and combines them together via NC and forwards the coded packet later. The second type of NC is performed in the signal level. Typically two nodes transmit simultaneously their packets. The relay node regards the superposed signal as a <b>NC</b> <b>signal</b> and forwards it. Each node recovers its desired signal from the <b>NC</b> <b>signal</b> with interference cancelation [4].

Thereby, the known benefits associated with NC sources can be achieved. Moreover, we address the 2 -D off-grid problem by proposing a low-complexity procedure that estimates the sources' grid offset from the closest neighboring grid points. For a single off-grid source, we show analytically that the 2 -D offset estimation problem is separable, allowing to perform the offset estimation in both dimensions independently...|$|E

We find the following striking features as compared to the standard model (SM) result: (1) generally larger cross sections for an NC scale of order 1 TeV; (2) completely different dependence on initial beam polarizations; (3) distinct distributions in the polar and azimuthal angles; and (4) day-night asymmetry due to the Earth's rotation.

40|$|Abstract—Although noncircular (<b>NC)</b> <b>signals</b> are {{frequently}} en-countered in wireless communications, their statistical property {{has not yet}} been utilized in state-of-the-art methods for spectrum sensing. In this paper, a variant of Hadamard (HDM) ratio test is devised to exploit the NC property of the primary signals for spectrum sensing, which is named the NC-HDM algorithm. As the NC-HDM approach is able to exploit full statistical property of the <b>NC</b> <b>signals</b> and handle deviations from independent and identi-cally distributed (IID) noise, it is superior to the state-of-the-art al-gorithms in detection accuracy and/or robustness. Moreover, per-formance analysis is conducted for the NC-HDM approach, in-cluding the invariant property, false-alarm probability and detec-tion probability. That is, employing the moment-matching Box’s Chi-square approximation, the false-alarm probability can be de-termined. Since the exact moments of the NC-HDM test statistic under the signal-absence hypothesis can be determined and all mo-ments have been matched, the derived false-alarm probability is very accurate, leading to simple and precise computation of the theoretical decision threshold. On the other hand, as the first two exactmoments of the NC-HDM test statistic under the signal-pres-ence hypothesis can be precisely calculated, the detection prob-ability based on moment-matching Beta approximation is quite accurate. Numerical results are included to demonstrate the su-periority of the NC-HDM approach and validate our theoretical calculations.

The angle estimation performance of the proposed algorithm is much better than that of the conventional Capon algorithm and very close to that of the two-dimensional NC-Capon algorithm, which has a much higher complexity than the proposed algorithm.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{measurement of}} the 8 B solar neutrino flux has been made at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). This measurement has an increased sensitivity to the neutral current reaction. This is due to an enhanced neutron capture efficiency, accomplished by adding salt, NaCl, to the heavy water in the detector. The data set analyzed in the salt phase consists of approximately 254 days of neutrino data. The data set has been analyzed using independently developed probability density functions (PDFs) in an extended maximum likelihood calculation. The final 8 B model-constrained results of this analysis are given by the fluxes (in units of 10 6 neutrinos/(cm 2 s)) : • F Sun CC = 1. 69 ± 0. 07 stat + 0. 07 - 0. 08 syst • F Sun NC = 4. 91 ± 0. 2 3 stat + 0. 32 - 0. 27 syst • F Sum ES = 2. 11 + 0. 29 - 0. 27 stat + 0. 13 - 0. 19 syst These fluxes give a CC/NC ratio of 0. 344 ± 0. 021 (stat) + 0. 07 - 0. 08 syst. The results clearly demonstrate that solar neutrinos are oscillating from one flavor to another, and therefore must have a mass. The total solar neutrino flux, F Sun NC is in good agreement with the expectations from the standard solar model. The results are also consistent with previous SNO results in the pure D 2 O phase. There are improved statistical uncertainties, due to the enhancement of the <b>NC</b> <b>signal</b> by the chlorine.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} {{a suite of}} schemes for {{wireless}} multiuser relay networks, where multiple source nodes (SNs) and relay nodes (RNs) share the spectral resources and hence we take into the account the co-channel interference (CCI). Our objective is to deal with both the channel fading and CCI {{in order to improve}} the attainable outage performance. Firstly, we consider the opportunistic relay selection (ORS) design in the scenario, where multiple RNs are available for assisting the transmission of a single SN, while CCI is imposed by other SNs in the network. We design the single-user-detection-aided (SUD-aided) and multi-user-detection based successive interference-cancellation-aided (MUD-SIC-aided) systems, where multiple-user detection (MUD) receivers using successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the destination node (DN) are adopted to combat co-channel interference. In SUD-aided system, we employ single-user detection (SUD) at the RNs and MUD SIC at the DN. In MUD-SIC-aided system, we employ MUD-SIC at both the RNs and DN. We present the outage analysis of both systems based on an outage-optimised ORS scheme, implying that the proposed ORS scheme provides the best outage performance. We show that the traditional ORS scheme proposed for SUD receivers based on the highest SNR criterion is not outage-optimal, when employing MUD-SIC in the presence of CCI. Hence, we propose a novel ORS scheme based on a best-effort detection (BED) criterion that outperforms the traditional ORS scheme. Furthermore, considering the effects of the outdated channel state information (CSI), an improved BED-ORS is proposed for enhancing the robustness towards CSI imperfections. Then, we study the scenario, where multiple SNs are coordinated to share a RN. In this case, network coding (NC) may be invoked at the RN, which treats the CCI from other SNs as useful messages and superimposes them to reduce the time slots required for relaying, therefore achieving higher spectral efficiency. However, NC systems may not always be beneficial in cooperative communications, where the detrimental interference of the undesired SNs, often referred to as network coding noise (NC noise), may outweigh the benefits of NC. In previous works, the outage performance was only evaluated numerically for several case studies. Against this background, we propose a systematically analytical framework for evaluating the outage performance for a multi-unicast NC-aided network, where each DN extracts the information of the desired SN from the <b>NC</b> <b>signal</b> forwarded by the RN. As our main contribution, we present the outage analysis of this system in the presence of NC noise and the closed-form analytical outage probability expressions are derived for an arbitrary number of SN-DN pairs. We show that if NC is employed, the quality of the worst SN-DN link may dominate the outage performance of every SNs. We then consider a two-hop network, where multiple SNs transmit to a DN {{with the aid of a}} RN and we assume the direct link between the SNs and the DN is weak. In this scenario, we show that the NC-aided relaying is not preferred and hence the buffer-aided relaying (BAR) is advocated for improving the uplink. The RN is equipped with a buffer, which is capable of storing multiple frames received from the SNs. During each time slot, the proposed protocol activates either the SNRN hop or the RN-DN hop, depending on the channel quality of each hop and the buffer state at the RN. In order to optimise the hop selection for the network, we design a hop quality metric (HQM) and propose a multi-user buffer-aided-relaying uplink (MU-BR-UL) protocol. The benefits of the proposed protocol is analysed in terms of the end-to-end outage probability and the end-to-end transmission delay. Then, the optimal power allocation is proposed for minimizing the end-to-end outage probability under the total power constraint. Furthermore, the impact of the buffer size, the number of users and the relay position on the achievable outage performance are characterized. The results indicate that the outage performance is significantly improved when theproposed power allocation is utilized in the MU-BR-UL protocol. Finally, we consider a new family of networks, in which the SNs and RNs have energy harvesting (EH) capability, which allows the nodes to harvest energy from the environments and convert it to electrical energy for wireless transmissions. The EH removes the constraints of relying on a battery for constant power supply, but also demands novel energy usage policy (EUP) design for effectively utilizing the random power supply gleaned from the EH system. We start with the point-to-point (P 2 P) network and by effectively exploiting the statistics of the energy arrival rates, we propose novel search algorithms for designing the EUP, which achieve a significantly better outage performance than the state-of-the-art designs reported in the literature. Based on the proposed methods in P 2 P network, we design novel EUPs for spacedivision- multiple-access (SDMA) and SDMA-based relay sharing networks. We show that the proposed EUPs significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of outage performance. <br/...|$|E

The derivation is based on the Slepian-Bangs formula, which is still applicable due to the deterministic data assumption. Simulation results show that the C-NC CRB decreases when the number of strictly non-circular signals increases within a fixed number of sources.

Nociceptin (NC), also called orphanin FQ, is the endogenous ligand of the opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL 1) receptor and does not bind classical high-affinity opioid receptors. In the present study, {{administration of}} NC exacerbated ibotenate-induced white-matter lesions while coadministration of ibotenate with either of two NC antagonists reduced excitotoxic white-matter lesions by up to 64 %. Neither ibotenate plus endomorphin I (a selective μ receptor agonist), nor ibotenate plus naloxone (a classical opioid receptor antagonist) modulated the excitotoxic lesion. Pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotides targeting the NC precursor peptide mRNA significantly reduced ibotenate-induced white-matter damage. Finally, high doses of fentanyl, which stimulates both classical μ opioid receptors and ORL 1, exacerbated excitotoxic white-matter lesion. This toxic effect was blocked by inhibiting ORL 1 but not classical opioid receptors.

Correspondingly, suppression of NF-κB signaling is under intense scrutiny for potential clinical applications. However, the majority of studies regarding the contribution of NF-κB signaling to tumorigenesis examine only classical NF-κB signaling. The more recently described non-canonical NF-κB pathway has not been specifically investigated for its role in cancer development. The non-canonical pathway is IKKα-dependent, and is characterized by stabilization of the protein NIK and processing of NF-κB 2 /p 100 to p 52. Target genes of this pathway include the cytokine BAFF and the chemokines CXCL 12, CXCL 13, CCL 19, and CCL 21. These proteins function in lymphoid development, immune cell trafficking, and angiogenesis. Several of them have been observed in association with both lymphoid malignancies and solid tumors. We investigated the activation state of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and its target genes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and found this pathway to be constitutively activated. The NC NF-κB proteins p 52 and RelB were expressed in the nuclei of human pancreatic tumor tissues and PDAC cell lines. Additionally, the panel of PDAC cell lines exhibited NC activation in terms of modification and processing of p 100 and stabilization of NIK. Strikingly, these cells also dramatically overexpressed NC NF-κB target genes. We confirmed the role of NC activation in the upregulation of these genes by inhibiting <b>NC</b> <b>signaling</b> and suppressing the expression of these chemokines and cytokines.

40|$|Recently, several {{high-resolution}} {{parameter estimation}} algorithms {{have been developed}} to exploit the structure of strictly second-order (SO) non-circular (<b>NC)</b> <b>signals.</b> They achieve a higher estimation accuracy and can resolve up to twice as many signal sources compared to the traditional methods for arbitrary signals. As a benchmark for these NC methods, we derive the closed-form deterministic R-D NC Cramér-Rao bound (NC CRB) for the multi-dimensional parameter estimation of strictly non-circular (rectilinear) signal sources in this paper. Assuming a separable centro-symmetric R-D array, we show that in some special cases, the deterministic R-D NC CRB reduces to the existing deterministic R-D CRB for arbitrary signals. This suggests that no gain from strictly non-circular sources (NC gain) can be achieved under the deterministic data assumption in these cases. For more general scenarios, finding an analytical expression of the NC gain for an arbitrary number of sources is very challenging. Thus, in this paper, we simplify the derived NC CRB and the existing CRB for the special case of two closely-spaced strictly non-circular sources captured by a uniform linear array (ULA). Subsequently, we use these simplified CRB expressions to analytically compute the maximum achievable asymptotic NC gain for the considered two source case. The resulting expression only depends on the various physical parameters and we find the conditions that provide the largest NC gain. Our analysis is supported by extensive simulation results...|$|R

Negative regulation by TNF requires the classical NF-κB pathway as inhibition of basal and induced CXCL 12 was reversed in HUVEC-expressing dominant negative IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) kinase (IKK) β (IKKβK 44 M). TNF did not inhibit the NC NF-κB pathway activation as LIGHT-induced p 100 processing to p 52 was intact; however, TNF either alone or together with LIGHT up-regulated p 100 and RelB expression and induced the nuclear localization of p 100 -RelB complexes. Enhanced p 100 and RelB expression was inhibited by IKKβK 44 M, which led us to question whether the IκB function of elevated p 100 mediates the inhibition of CXCL 12 expression by TNF. We retrovirally transduced HUVEC to express p 100 at a level similar to that up-regulated by TNF; however, basal and LIGHT-induced CXCL 12 expression was normal in the transduced cells.

[Phe 1 (psi) (CH 2 -NH) Gly 2]Nociceptin(1 - 13) NH 2 ([F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2) {{has been reported}} to antagonize NC actions in peripheral guinea-pig and mouse tissues. In this study, we investigated the effects of a range of NC C-terminal truncated fragments and [F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2 on NC receptor binding, glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical slices (rCX), inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in CHO cells expressing the NC receptor (CHO(NCR)) and electrically evoked contractions of the rat vas deferens (rVD). In radioligand binding assays, a range of ligands inhibited [125 I]-Tyr 14 -NC binding in membranes from rCX and CHO(NCR) cells. As the peptide was truncated there was a general decline in pKi. [F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2 was as potent as NC(1 - 13) NH 2. The order of potency for NC fragments to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation in whole CHO(NCR) cells was NCNH 2 > or =NC=NC(1 - 13) NH 2 >NC(1 - 12) NH 2 > >NC(1 - 11) NH 2. [F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2 was a full agonist with a pEC 50 value of 8. 65. NCNH 2 and [F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2 both inhibited K+ evoked glutamate release from rCX with pEC 50 and maximum inhibition of 8. 16, 48. 5 +/- 4. 9 % and 7. 39, 58. 9 +/- 6. 8 % respectively. In rVD NC inhibited electrically evoked contractions with a pEC 50 of 6. 63. Although [F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2, displayed a small (instrinsic activity alpha = 0. 19) but consistent residual agonist activity, it acted as a competitive antagonist (pA 2 6. 76) in the rVD. The differences between [F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2 action on central and peripheral <b>NC</b> <b>signalling</b> could be explained if [F/G]NC(1 - 13) NH 2 was a partial agonist with high strength of coupling in the CNS and low in the periphery. An alternative explanation could be the existence of central and peripheral receptor isoforms. 7240...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} and mechanical properties of extracellular matrices (ECMs) modulate diverse aspects of cellular fates; however, how regional heterogeneity in ECM composition regulates developmental programs {{is not well}} understood. We discovered that fibronectin 1 (Fn 1) is expressed in strikingly non-uniform patterns during mouse development, suggesting that regionalized synthesis of the ECM plays cell-specific regulatory roles during embryogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we ablated Fn 1 in the neural crest (NC), a population of multi-potent progenitors expressing high levels of Fn 1. We found that Fn 1 synthesized by the NC mediated morphogenesis of the aortic arch artery and differentiation of NC cells into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by regulating Notch signaling. We show that <b>NC</b> Fn 1 <b>signals</b> in an <b>NC</b> cell-autonomous manner through integrin α 5 β 1 expressed by the NC, leading to activation of Notch and differentiation of VSMCs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust image watermarking scheme for multimedia copyright protection. In this work, host image is partitioned into four sub images. Watermark image such as ‘logo’ {{is embedded in}} the two of these sub images, in both D (singular and diagonal matrix) and U (left singular and orthogonal matrix) components of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of two sub images. Watermark image {{is embedded in the}} D component using Dither quantization. A copy of the watermark is embedded in the columns of U matrix using comparison of the coefficients of U matrix with respect to the watermark image. If extraction of watermark from D matrix is not complete, there is a fair amount of probability that it can be extracted from U matrix. The proposed algorithm is more secure and robust to various attacks, viz., JPEG 2000 compression, JPEG compression, rotation, scaling, cropping, row-column blanking, row-column copying, salt and pepper noise, filtering and gamma correction. Superior experimental results are observed with the proposed algorithm over a recent scheme proposed by Chung et al. in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER), Normalized Cross correlation (<b>NC)</b> and Peak <b>Signal</b> to Noise Ratio (PSNR). </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that {{parameter}} estimation algorithms designed to exploit the prior knowledge of the strict second-order (SO) non-circularity (<b>NC)</b> of incident <b>signals</b> can estimate the parameters of twice as many sources and achieve significant gains in reducing the estimation error. So far, the magnitude of the NC gain could only be quantified through simulations and finding a generic analytical expression for arbitrary scenarios is an intricate task. In this paper, we adopt a first-order performance analysis framework to analytically compute the asymptotic NC gain of NC Standard ESPRIT for the case of two uncorrelated strictly SO non-circular (rectilinear) sources captured by a uniform linear array (ULA). We assume a maximum phase separation of the sources, which yields the largest NC gain. For this scenario, we derive simplified asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) expressions of NC Standard ESPRIT and Standard ESPRIT, which are subsequently used to compute the NC gain. While the simplified MSE expression of Standard ESPRIT depends on the source separation, we show that if NC Standard ESPRIT is applied in this case, the two non-circular sources entirely decouple. Thus, the NC gain can theoretically approach infinity if the separation of the two sources tends to zero. Our derived expressions are verified by simulation results.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the potential of}} inhibitory performance, response speed, and response accuracy and variability, measures central to the conceptualization of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in distinguishing children with ADHD from healthy controls (HCs). Method: The stop signal paradigm was administered to 38 children with ADHD and 31 <b>NCs.</b> The stop <b>signal</b> reaction time (SSRT), mean reaction time (MRT), intraindividual coefficient of variation (ICV), and number of errors were used to predict diagnostic status. Results: Univariate tests showed that the ADHD group performed worse than NCs {{on all of the}} dependent variables. Exploratory univariate analyses showed that oppositional defiant disorder comorbidity and ADHD type did not influence results except for the ICV, the effect for this variable (more variability in the ADHD group) being less pronounced for the Predominantly Inattentive type than for the Hyperactive-Impulsive and Combined types. A logistic regression model of the MRT, ICV, and number of errors combined showed best predictive performance, with the MRT contributing the most to group classification (56 % of the variance). The final model (MRT, ICV, and number of errors) predicted 87 % of the sample in the correct diagnostic category. Operating characteristics showed excellent sensitivity and specificity of 89. 5 % and 83. 9 %, respectively. Conclusions: Our results contrast with theoretical accounts emphasizing inhibitory control as the pivotal measure characterizing cognitive performance in ADHD.

40|$|Abstract Background Development {{of the eye}} {{depends partly}} on the periocular mesenchyme derived from the neural crest (NC), but the fate of NC cells in {{mammalian}} eye development and the signals coordinating the formation of ocular structures are poorly understood. Results Here we reveal distinct NC contributions to both anterior and posterior mesenchymal eye structures and show that TGFβ signaling in these cells is crucial for normal eye development. In the anterior eye, TGFβ 2 released from the lens {{is required for the}} expression of transcription factors Pitx 2 and Foxc 1 in the NC-derived cornea and in the chamber-angle structures of the eye that control intraocular pressure. TGFβ enhances Foxc 1 and induces Pitx 2 expression in cell cultures. As in patients carrying mutations in PITX 2 and FOXC 1, TGFβ <b>signal</b> inactivation in <b>NC</b> cells leads to ocular defects characteristic of the human disorder Axenfeld-Rieger's anomaly. In the posterior eye, NC cell-specific inactivation of TGFβ signaling results in a condition reminiscent of the human disorder persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. As a secondary effect, retinal patterning is also disturbed in mutant mice. Conclusion In the developing eye the lens acts as a TGFβ signaling center that controls the development of eye structures derived from the <b>NC.</b> Defective TGFβ <b>signal</b> transduction interferes with NC-cell differentiation and survival anterior to the lens and with normal tissue morphogenesis and patterning posterior to the lens. The similarity to developmental eye disorders in humans suggests that defective TGFβ signal modulation in ocular NC derivatives contributes to the pathophysiology of these diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNeural crest (NC) {{cells have}} been elegantly traced to follow stereotypical migratory {{pathways}} throughout the vertebrate embryo, yet we still lack complete information on individual cell migratory behaviors and how molecular mechanisms direct NC cell guidance. Here, we analyze the spatio-temporal migratory pattern of post-otic NC and the in vivo {{role of the}} small Rho GTPase, RhoA, using fluorescent cell labeling, molecular perturbation, and intravital 4 D (3 D+ time) confocal imaging in the intact chick embryo. We find that the post-otic NC cell migratory pattern is established in two phases with distinct cell migratory behaviors. An initial wide front of lateral-directed NC cells, led by NC from rhombomere 7 (r 7), move as a distinct subpopulation. This is followed in time by fewer NC cells that migrate collectively from r 7 to r 8 in a follow-the-leader manner with extensive cellular extensions between cells. We show that post-otic migratory NC cells express RhoA, using RT-PCR on isolated, flow cytometry sorted NC cells and in neural tube culture explants. When RhoA function is altered by expression of a dominant negative or constitutively active form, or injection of C 3, {{there are two major}} consequences. RhoA constitutively active expressing NC cells are less directional, slower and form fewer follow-the-leader chain assemblies. NC cells expressing RhoA-DN are less affective in retracting filopodia, migrate slower and also form fewer follow-the-leader chain assemblies. Together, these alterations to <b>NC</b> cell intrinsic <b>signaling</b> and cell–cell contact disrupt the precise spatio-temporal post-otic NC cell migratory pattern...|$|R
