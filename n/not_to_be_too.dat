5|$|The real-life {{surprise}} of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made {{it one of the}} film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> close to the screen during the sequence. The scene has frequently been called {{one of the most memorable}} moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire magazine named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking it above the decapitation scene in The Omen (1976) and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London (1981).|$|E
25|$|After the funeral, Kōichi, Shige and Keizō leave immediately, {{with only}} Noriko not returning. After they leave, Kyōko is angry {{with them and}} voices her {{complaints}} to Noriko about her siblings by deriding them over being selfish to their family. She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care {{how hard it was}} for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand how hard it is for them to have to take time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E
25|$|Jaime II, {{the nephew}} of Don Sancho, succeeded him, but was under the {{guardianship}} of his uncle Philip. At {{the beginning of his}} regency, Philip, in the king's name, confirmed all the privileges of the Jews, and in 1325 bestowed on them the right of citizenship. He protected them from forcible baptism, and strictly forbade the baptism of their children against the parents' will. Permission was granted them (1331) to build a new synagogue in their quarter, but it was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> elaborate. As one means of preventing the erection of a handsome building, Jaime collected all their money into the state treasury. Under Pedro IV (1336–87), who in 1344 united Majorca with the kingdom of Aragon, the Jews of the Balearic Isles lived unmolested, with all their rights safeguarded; but {{at the time of the}} hostile agitations against the Jews in Spain their peaceful condition likewise came to an end.|$|E

Hot Chip used a variety of vocal structures, including layered vocals, where two takes of the same vocals were added together, changed by idiosyncrasies from the way it had been sung, and the doubling of a single performance, shifted out of beat.|$|E

2500|$|The Book of Odes {{has been}} a revered Confucian classic since the Han Dynasty, and has been studied and memorized by centuries of {{scholars}} in China. The individual songs of the Odes, though frequently on simple, rustic subjects, have traditionally been saddled with extensive, elaborate allegorical meanings that assigned moral or political meaning to the smallest details of each line. The popular songs were seen as good keys to understanding the troubles of the common people, and were often read as allegories; complaints against lovers were seen as complaints against faithless rulers, [...] "if a maiden warns her lover <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> rash... commentators promptly discover that the piece refers to a feudal noble whose brother had been plotting against him...".|$|E

2500|$|The {{proposed}} genus Oligocorax {{appears to}} be paraphyletic – the European species have been separated in Nectornis, and the North American ones are placed in the expanded Phalacrocorax. A Late Oligocene fossil cormorant foot from Enspel, Germany, sometimes placed herein, would then be referable to Nectornis if it proves <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> distinct. All these early European species might belong to the basal group of [...] "microcormorants", as they conform with them in size and seem to have inhabited the same habitat: subtropical coastal or inland waters. Limicorallus, meanwhile, was initially {{believed to be a}} rail or a dabbling duck by some. There are also undescribed remains of apparent cormorants from the Quercy Phosphorites of Quercy (France), dating to some time between the Late Eocene and the mid-Oligocene.|$|E
2500|$|The groups congregate in {{the early}} morning and evening, any time of year, at parks or public squares, or {{anywhere}} they can find enough space, regardless of what other use that space may nominally have, such as a parking lot. Morning dancers try to avoid parks since they are preferred locations for taiji, the martial arts school whose slowed-down moves are often practiced as exercise, known as tai chi in the West. They begin as early as 5:30a.m., and tend to use spaces nearer supermarkets so they are better positioned to bargain for and purchase fresh vegetables when the markets open. In the evening they tend to start dancing after dinner; for this reason spaces used by square dancers in the evening tend <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> far from their homes as they also may have to tend to grandchildren they may be watching while their own children work late.|$|E
2500|$|When Larry Sanger left Wikipedia, Wales's {{approach}} {{was different from}} Sanger's. Wales was fairly hands-off.

That's what I am doing. That's my life goal." [...] In May 2010, the BBC reported that Wales had relinquished many of his technical privileges on Wikimedia Commons (a Wikipedia sister project that hosts much of its multimedia content) after criticism by the project's volunteer community over what they saw as Wales's hasty and undemocratic approach to deleting sexually explicit images he believed [...] "appeal solely to prurient interests".|$|E

2500|$|Jones was {{a logical}} choice for Fisk President. Jones, who {{for seven years}} worked as a {{professor}} of sociology at Hampton Institute, and after a brief stint as a statistician at the Bureau of the Census, joined the newly created Phelps-Stokes Fund in 1912 as its educational director, a position he would hold for over three decades. [...] Despite his unique qualifications for the position, Jones quickly turned down the opportunity, feeling he could do more for Black education in his role with the Phelps-Stokes Fund than he could at a single institution. With Jones no longer interested, responsibility for finding a suitable candidate fell largely to Booker T. Washington, and for good reason. Any serious candidate for the position required the blessing of Washington, Fisk's Board of Trustees and the General Education Board. In March 1914, after a long search, John Cutler Shedd, a professor of physics at Olivet College in Michigan, emerged as the leading candidate for the position. Shedd travelled to New York City to meet with a variety of Fisk stakeholders, including the Carnegie Foundation, officers of the American Missionary Association, academics from Cornell University (all of whom were friends with Booker T. Washington), and Wallace Buttrick. Shortly thereafter, Shedd and his wife visited Fisk's campus, and then proceeded [...] to Tuskegee to meet with Washington. Washington believed Shedd was [...] "the best man we can get for the presidency of Fisk University," [...] but warned of opposition by Fisk alumni and the Nashville Black community who wanted a Black president. He also predicted and a stormy period of two or three years for Shedd and his family to acclimate to the unique conditions of the South. Washington observed most Northerners [...] "make the mistake of expressing opinions before they have had time to get into the local atmosphere of the community, or of the South." [...] Shedd [...] "ought to be cautioned <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> ready with opinions concerning either Fisk or Southern conditions." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Collectif Assistance Juridique (CAJ) {{independent}} group, a {{total of}} 4,500 people were arrested during the events. Among them, 1,950 were kept in garde à vue and 635 prosecution cases opened. Less than 15% of the arrested people were therefore [...] presented to the magistrates, due to insufficient evidence of alleged legal violations. The CAJ note {{that many of the}} people presented before the courts had no previous criminal record and were far from the profile of [...] "criminal rioters". They included many leaders of the movement, in particular outside Paris. A 24 March 2006 internal administrative order asked the magistrates <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> lenient on their judgments. 42% of the persons presented before courts passed in immediate comparution, a specific (and controversial) procedure, which allow them to be judged on the spot. During the 1994 demonstrations against the CIP, a student law prepared by Balladur's government, 1000 persons only had been arrested, although the clashes had been more violent. Although Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy stated on 16 March that his [...] "priority was to arrest casseurs" [...] (rioters), the independent CAJ (Judicial Assistance Group) noted {{that the vast majority of}} arrestations hadn't been of on-the-spot witnessed violence (flagrant délit) and that many were contested. For example, on 31 March a US citizen visiting Paris was detained by the police, while on 7 April an old man getting out of a supermarket was also detained. Furthermore, many young people from the suburbs were blocked from demonstrating in Paris. According to the government, this was to impede turmoils in the capital, but critics such as the CAJ have spoken of a negation of presumption of innocence and of [...] "racial and social discrimination", since some categories of the population – mainly youth living in housing projects, those accused of having taken part in the riots in autumn 2005 – were blocked from exercising their civil rights of demonstrating against a law that affected them as well as other categories of the population. These blockings in suburbs' train stations have provoked in some cases clashes with the police, for example in Savigny-sur-Orge, in Saint-Denis or in Les Ulis... "There is no evidence which permit us to establish a parallel between the young rioters of November and the disturbing elements of this spring", notes the CAJ report, countering the Interior Minister's claims. Furthermore, police abuse was reported on a number of cases, including Cyril Ferez, a trade union member who entered coma state for several weeks following the 18 March demonstration. In Caen Charlotte entered coma for a day; Victor had two ribs broken, etc. A three-year-old child was placed 24 hours in observation after having inhalaed gas. On 16 March, the Parisian préfecture de police announced that 18 demonstrators had been injured. The IGS (internal affairs department) was charged of Cyril Ferez' case (who was in coma for several weeks) and litigation was initiated against police officers allegedly excessively brutal and violent during arrests. Additionally, cooperation between the police forces and the trade union [...] "service orders" [...] (SO, in charge of the demonstrations) was observed, including handing-over of several demonstrators to the police by the trade union's SO. Finally, the CAJ note the disproportion of sentences toward young demonstrators, while others acts of vandalism currently committed by farmers or viticulturists were more lightly punished. It thus alluded to this Alsatian mayor accused of having burned 14 travel trailers but who was condemned only to six months on parole, contrasting with the sentences given to demonstrators (for example, a high school student condemned to 41 days of jail in Fleury-Mérogis because he had burnt two garbage cans before his school).|$|E
