50|$|In the gas {{treatment}} plant gas passes through molecular sieves to remove sulphur {{to less than}} 15 ppm and water to less than 1 ppm to prevent ice formation in the downstream refrigeration plant. The dry sulphur-free gas passes through an activated carbon bed to remove any mercury to protect the downstream aluminium heat exchangers. The gas then passes to the cryogenic nitrogen removal system where it is cooled to -100°C by Joule-Thomson chilling. In the pre-separation column the gas is separated into a methane stream and a nitrogen-rich stream. In the low temperature (-185°C) double column the nitrogen-enriched gas is separated into the reject <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stream</b> containing less than 1.5% methane and a low pressure methane stream containing less than 1.5% nitrogen. The liquid methane stream is pumped to 10 bar {{and then to the}} sales gas compressors. The reject <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stream</b> is heated and used to regenerate the molecular sieves then the sulphur-rich gas is burnt in a thermal oxidiser. There are four electric motor-driven sales gas compressors each of capacity 50 MMSCFD with a discharge pressure of 55-75 barg. Gas was exported through a 30-inch 3 km pipeline to Burton Point where it was delivered into the National Transmission System.|$|E
50|$|For smaller {{volumes of}} gas, a system {{utilizing}} Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) {{is a more}} typical method of separation. In PSA, methane and nitrogen can be separated by using an adsorbent with an aperture size {{very close to the}} molecular diameter of the larger species, in this case methane (3.8 angstroms). This means nitrogen is able to diffuse through the adsorbent, filling adsorption sites, whilst methane is not. This results in a purified natural gas stream that fits pipeline specifications. The adsorbent can then be regenerated, leaving a highly pure <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stream.</b> PSA is a flexible method for nitrogen rejection, being applied to both small and large flow rates.|$|E

The growth of food, fuel, feed, and fiber crops on agricultural land requires additions of nitrogen fertilizer to bolster crop yields. The portion of applied nitrogen {{that is not}} utilized by the crops is highly susceptible to transport to nearby <b>streams.</b> Elevated <b>nitrogen</b> concentrations in <b>streams</b> can lead to water quality concerns such as ecosystem degradation or drinking water contamination. Identification of geospatial, environmental, and watershed characteristics (variables) that are correlated with <b>nitrogen</b> concentration in <b>streams</b> will provide {{a greater understanding of}} the influence that certain variables have on <b>nitrogen</b> transport to <b>streams.</b> The route through which water travels from the landscape to streams (flowpath) is one of these variables. Movement of many forms of nitrogen is linked to the movement of water, therefore, understanding the fluxes of water to streams will help to expand the understanding of nitrogen transport and the affect that landscape management changes will have on the concentrations of <b>nitrogen</b> in <b>streams.</b> 	In some areas, groundwater is an important flowpath for delivering water and <b>nitrogen</b> to <b>streams.</b> Hydrograph separation can be used to estimate the amount of total streamflow that is attributable to slowflow sources (flowpaths through which water moves slowly) such as groundwater, and fastflow sources (flowpaths through which water moves quickly) such as overland flow. Because flowpaths have an impact on water and <b>nitrogen</b> transport to <b>streams,</b> testing and improving hydrograph separation techniques is needed. Two independent methods of hydrograph separation, the graphical-based BFI program and chemical tracer-based end-member mixing analysis (EMMA), were used to estimate slowflow contributions to the same streams. The estimates of slowflow from the two separate methods of hydrograph separation were not identical, highlighting the differences in how each method works and the difficulty of accurately estimating slowflow. A modified method of EMMA, referred to as a ratio-based EMMA, was created and tested using synthetic and real stream data. The ratio-based EMMA represents a new method of hydrograph separation, as it produced reasonably accurate slowflow estimates when tested against synthetic and real stream data. The importance of flowpath was then tested in six highly modified streams in agricultural watersheds that had extensive data sets and well understood hydrology. The importance of flowpath on <b>stream</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentrations in these streams aligned with expectations based on what is currently known. Finally, this study was expanded to a large number of small streams where statistical methods were used to gain broader understanding of the controls on water and <b>nitrogen</b> movement to <b>streams,</b> and to allow for extrapolation of this information to unstudied streams. 	 In addition to flowpath, a small number of geospatial, environmental, and watershed variables were shown to be important for estimating total nitrogen loads and concentrations in a large number of small streams. These variables were used in the development of several multiple linear regression models, many of which performed well when applied to a set of validation streams, having reasonable high R 2 values and low normalized root mean squared errors. 	Determination of the important flowpath(s) as well as other important variables which increase <b>nitrogen</b> movement to <b>streams</b> will allow watershed managers to more accurately implement beneficial land management practices in an effort to reduce <b>nitrogen</b> movement to <b>streams.</b> This knowledge will become increasingly important in an effort to maintain or reduce the amount of <b>nitrogen</b> in <b>streams</b> while increasing crop production to support the rising global population...|$|R
50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes have a {{very important}} role in the separation industry. Nevertheless, they were not considered technically important until the mid-1970s. Membrane separation processes differ based on separation mechanisms and size of the separated particles. The widely used membrane processes include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrolysis, dialysis, electrodialysis, gas separation, vapor permeation, pervaporation, membrane distillation, and membrane contactors. All processes except for pervaporation involve no phase change. All processes except (electro)dialysis are pressure driven. Microfltration and ultrafiltration is widely used in food and beverage processing (beer microfiltration, apple juice ultrafiltration), biotechnological applications and pharmaceutical industry (antibiotic production, protein purification), water purification and wastewater treatment, the microelectronics industry, and others. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are mainly used for water purification purposes. Dense membranes are utilized for gas separations (removal of CO2 from natural gas, separating N2 from air, organic vapor removal from air or a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stream)</b> and sometimes in membrane distillation. The later process helps in the separation of azeotropic compositions reducing the costs of distillation processes.|$|E

40|$|Copper {{catalysts}} {{supported on}} acid treated activated carbon (AC) were prepared, characterized and tested {{in terms of}} their SO 2 oxidation activity. Reactions of CuO-AC in flow systems with sulfur dioxide, oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>streams</b> were investigated to determine the types of chemical interactions that occur on the sorbent surface. The effects of reaction temperature, acid treatment, metal loading, support particle size, SO 2 concentration and O- 2 concentration on SO 2 oxidation activity were evaluated. It was found that carbon materials used as catalyst supports for copper oxide catalysts provided a high catalytic activity for adsorbing SO 2 from flue gas and oxidizing it. Acid pretreatment of the carbon supports increased the content of specific surface chemical groups to enhance the catalytic activity for SO 2 oxidation. Metal loading, as well as support particle size, have a significant influence on the SO 2 activity. The supported metals rather than surface oxygen functional groups on AC may be the active sites for adsorbing SO 2. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{chemical}} reaction {{for which the}} reaction rate can be varied is studied in a fully developed, two-dimensional, turbulent mixing layer. The layer is formed between two <b>nitrogen</b> <b>streams,</b> one carrying low concentrations of fluorine and the other hydrogen and nitric oxide. For fixed concentrations of fluorine and hydrogen and for nitric oxide concentrations that are small fractions of the fluorine concentration, the heat release is fixed but the overall reaction rate {{is controlled by the}} nitric oxide concentration. Therefore, for fixed flow conditions, the nitric oxide concentration determines the ratio of the reaction rate to the mixing rate. For large values of this ratio, the amount of product, at a given downstream location, measured by the mean temperature rise, is independent of the reaction rate, i. e., the reaction is mixing limited. As the reaction rate is reduced the major effects are: (1) amount of product declines (as expected), (2) the mean temperature profile, which is initially some what unsymmetrical because the hydrogen-fluorine freestream concentration ratio is set at a large value, becomes symmetrical, and (3) the ramp-like instantaneous temperature traces within the large structure gradually become more top-hat...|$|R
40|$|Membrane-aerated biofilm {{reactors}} performing autotrophic nitrogen removal can {{be successfully}} applied to treat concentrated <b>nitrogen</b> <b>streams.</b> However, their process performance is seriously {{hampered by the}} growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). In this work we document how sequential aeration can bring the rapid and long-term suppression of NOB and {{the onset of the}} activity of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed that such shift in performance was mirrored by a change in population densities, with a very drastic reduction of the NOB Nitrospira and Nitrobacter and a 10 -fold increase in AnAOB numbers. The study of biofilm sections with relevant 16 S rRNA fluorescent probes revealed strongly stratified biofilm structures fostering aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in biofilm areas close to the membrane surface (rich in oxygen) and AnAOB in regions neighbouring the liquid phase. Both communities were separated by a transition region potentially populated by denitrifying heterotrophic bacteria.
