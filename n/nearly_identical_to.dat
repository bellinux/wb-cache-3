5|$|The two U-43-class U-boats were <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> {{the eight}} boats of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-27 class, which were built to UB II plans. Despite the similarities, {{the two groups}} are {{identified}} in sources as distinct classes.|$|E
5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E

5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements {{and the fact that}} its composition is <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> that of Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|William Hunt, the onsite {{architect}} {{employed to}} oversee Blore's design, while remaining faithful to Blore's overall plans, {{was not afraid}} to alter them. Most notably, the Western Gatehouse, the main approach to the palace, was intended to have octagonal towers, but Hunt redesigned the gatehouse in an English 14th-century castle style, with solid round towers and machicolations, <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the towers at Bodiam Castle, East Sussex.|$|E
5|$|At 03:49 on {{the morning}} of August 9, 1945, Bockscar, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the {{secondary}} target. The mission plan for the second attack was <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.|$|E

5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the one in existence today.|$|E
5|$|Cortana can {{no longer}} be fully hidden, as it was made the default search {{experience}} in the Windows shell for all users (on previous revisions, a generic search experience without any Cortana branding and functionality is used if it is disabled). As with previous builds, users must still opt-in and grant permission for the software to perform data collection and tracking in order to fully enable Cortana's personalized features. If this functionality is not enabled, Cortana operates in a feature-limited mode with basic web and device search functionality, <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the non-Cortana search experience on previous builds.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups. The popular {{association of the}} Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with the natural environment. None of these are borne out by evidence.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark the}} album's tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was re-released on November 23, 2004 in {{high-resolution}} SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc {{one of the}} album's deluxe edition re-release is <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the original version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc {{is a collection of}} remixes and B-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{construction}} {{began on}} the second phase, the B Station. The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E
5|$|Oviraptorid eggs {{appear to}} have been 17cm (6in) long on average, and the most {{complete}} eggs found with MPC-D107/15 are thought to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14 to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The eggs are <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> some that have previously been found in Mongolia, and have therefore been assigned to the oofamily (egg-taxon family) Elongatoolithidae. The eggshells are relatively thin, between 1and 1.2mm (0.03and 0.04in), and their outer surface is covered by ridges and nodes that rise about 0.3mm (0.01in) above the shell. The micro-structure of the eggshells could not be properly studied, as the calcite has been heavily altered and re-crystallized.|$|E
5|$|The Excellency {{over the}} Masses (also {{known as the}} Minister over the Masses) shared the same censorial and {{advisory}} roles as the other two Excellencies, the Excellency of Works and Grand Commandant. Like his previous counterpart, the Chancellor, {{he must have been}} responsible for drawing up the annual budget, although contemporary sources fail to mention this point. Aside from the court conference, the Great Conference of leading officials across the empire was conducted by his ministry. The Chancellor's bureaus were also retained by the Excellency over the Masses, and were <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> that of the new Eastern-Han Grand Commandant's bureaus. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister Coachman, Minister of Justice, and Minister Herald.|$|E
50|$|The Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México ordered one {{additional}} DR-6-4-2000 unit after purchasing the two demonstrators.

40|$|Supplemental Table 1. Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) used {{to construct}} the genetic risk score for asthma. SNPs were selected based on association with asthma at p 0. 95. Thus, the proxy SNPs captured <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> information <b>to</b> the GWAS SNPs...|$|R
5|$|The {{carriage}} was <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> {{the carriage}} of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time {{to set up}} for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E
5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.|$|E
5|$|After Caesar's assassination, Mark Antony, who {{had been}} Caesar's Master of the Horse, formed an {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution, and as such, the senate and assemblies remained powerless. The conspirators were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Lepidus became powerless, and Antony went to Egypt to seek glory in the east, while Octavian remained in Rome. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and committed suicide in 30 BC. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome, as the unchallenged master of the state. In 27 BC, Octavian offered to give up the Dictatorial powers which he had held since 42 BC, but the senate refused, and thus ratified his status as master of the state. He became the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, and the transition from Roman Republic to Roman Empire was complete.|$|E
