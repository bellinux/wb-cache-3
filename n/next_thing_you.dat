Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple choices. We agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes." [...] He recorded the sound to a tape and met Hillenburg by the gate.

500|$|American vocalist Barbra Streisand {{recorded}} her {{own version}} of [...] "Jubilation" [...] for her sixteenth studio album, ButterFly (1974). Despite Anka's original version totaling six minutes and 29 seconds, Streisand's is considerably shorter at three minutes and 52 seconds. On Anka's self-written book My Way: An Autobiography, he wrote that {{he was surprised to}} learn that Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters was the one who produced the track: [...] "Peters was still her hairdresser. <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know he's her producer, and he's produced mega motion pictures". However, he also acknowledged Streisand's rendition: [...] "Barbra can sing the phone book. She has no problem singing anything. She's got one of the great voices". For an album review on Billboards [...] "Top Album Picks" [...] column in their weekly magazine, a critic listed Streisand's version of [...] "Jubilation" [...] as one of the [...] "best cuts" [...] on ButterFly.|$|E

500|$|Complications in Mercedes' {{relationship}} with Malachy occurred when she begins {{an affair with}} Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle) while working with him at The Loft. Metcalfe expressed that she had initial [...] "reservations" [...] about the storyline which she felt was [...] "far-fetched", adding that once she had begun filming the scenes she thought the plot was [...] "brilliant" [...] even though she felt Mercedes would {{be perceived as a}} [...] "bitch". Whittle expressed similar doubts, saying he felt it was [...] "a bit out of character" [...] for Calvin, although he felt the plot was [...] "exciting". At first the pair did not like each other, but after spending time together, they realised that there was more to their personalities than they initially thought. Whittle explained that the attraction between Mercedes and Calvin began [...] "building", to the point that she and Malachy have [...] "a massive row" [...] and Calvin comforts her; Whittle stated that [...] "the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know they’re tearing each other’s clothes off".|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know, people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea {{for the first time on}} any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E

5000|$|Rodriguez noted, [...] "So much of {{this album}} was {{inspired}} by coming home to Austin. I {{had been living in}} New York City for almost a decade when I moved back to my hometown. One of the first things that I realized I had been missing was waking up to the sounds of the birds...The peace and quiet here allowed me to reflect on life in a way that I couldn't do in New York. The pace is so fast there, {{it can be hard to}} be fully aware and in the present...you are always having to think of the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> or <b>you</b> will be left behind. A lot of the tunes on this record are reflections of life from a slightly more relaxed vantage point." ...|$|R

500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Driscoll {{responded to}} {{criticism}} in a post to CNN's Belief Blog, writing: [...] "You {{try to write}} a book on marriage and sex with your wife and <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know {{there are a lot of}} ants crashing your picnic."

5000|$|Even If It Kills Me was {{recorded}} in early 2007 at Stratosphere Studios in Chelsea and Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village. While recording the album, Pierre strove to sing more softly than {{he had in the}} past, out of fear he would blow his voice out touring the album. He later felt his vocal performances on the album were not his best. He struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the song, which had never happened before. In addition, the band were worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their predecessor was so successful. The album was co-produced by Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and Eli Janney of Girls Against Boys. [...] "Adam works ten times faster than most people and he's already onto the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> before <b>you</b> have a chance to think about what you did, so {{it was kind of like}} playing catch up," [...] Pierre later recalled.|$|R

2500|$|Gerard Way {{also said}} in a November 2009 {{interview}} with Rock Sound that the fourth album would be their defining work. [...] "A friend who heard the record recently said he now {{had no interest in}} listening to our older work anymore, that we had made all our old material redundant. I took it as a compliment, the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> should always make the last thing seem unimportant and I think that will happen when we finally release this album." ...|$|E

His struggles continued throughout {{the first half of the}} season, as he posted the worst ERA among starters in the AL (6.92) along with a 7–9 record. Quoted in the Los Angeles Times in July, Kazmir said [...] "It kind of feels like I'm thinking too much about where I'm throwing the ball and things start snowballing, and the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know you don't really know what's going on." ...|$|E

[...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'.

I'm an NRA National Rifle Association member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with.
