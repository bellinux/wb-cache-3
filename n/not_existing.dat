He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of <b>not</b> <b>existing.</b> He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E

25|$|The Russian {{copyright}} law of 1993 covered works first disclosed on Russian territory, {{as well as}} undisclosed works that existed in objective form within Russia, regardless of the nationality of the author. It also covered works of Russian authors that were first disclosed outside of Russia or that, if undisclosed, existed only abroad. Foreign works (i.e., works not disclosed in Russia or <b>not</b> <b>existing</b> there of an author {{who did not have}} Russian citizenship) were subject to the Russian {{copyright law}} according to the provisions of the international treaties Russia was a member of. In 2004, article 5, which laid down these definitions, was amended with a new sub-paragraph 5(4) to cover also foreign works that were still copyrighted in their foreign country of origin, but had never been copyrighted in Russia. Such restored copyrights on foreign works were limited to at most the copyright term they enjoyed in the foreign country.|$|E

2500|$|While {{for most}} of its history the concept of Mestizo and Mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico’s {{intellectual}} circles, in recent times the concept has been target of criticism, with it's detractors claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of [...] “(Racism) <b>Not</b> <b>existing</b> here (Mexico), as everybody is Mestizo” the Mestizo ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico.

2500|$|Heraclitus {{does not}} form any {{abstract}} nouns from his ordinary use of [...] "to be" [...] and [...] "to become" [...] {{and in that}} fragment seems to be opposing any identity A to any other identity B, C, etc., which is not-A. Hegel, however, interprets not-A as <b>not</b> <b>existing</b> at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or [...] "pure" [...] being without particularity or specificity. Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming, and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.|$|E

2500|$|One {{perspective}} {{is that to}} deduce from the evidence a definite Anglican Shakespeare is to misapprehend the religious circumstances of the time, the word [...] "Anglican" [...] <b>not</b> <b>existing</b> until nearly two decades after the writer's death and contemporary historians not recognising Anglicanism as a firm organisation or religious identity during his lifetime. In a similar vein, Maurice Hunt, Jean-Christophe Mayer and others have written of a Shakespeare with a syncretic or hybrid faith, in some sense both Catholic and Protestant. However, Eamon Duffy points out that {{although the majority of}} Tudor people were muddled and uncertain, accepting of compromise and accommodation, [...] "Religious diversity was not a notion to conjure with in Tudor England… Ritual and doctrinal diversity were evils, aspects of social and religious disunity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry's {{philosophy}} {{goes on to}} aver that we undergo life in {{a radical}} passivity, we are reduced to bear it permanently as what we have not wanted, and that this radical passivity of life is the foundation {{and the cause of}} suffering. No-one has ever given himself life. At the same time, the simple fact of living, of being alive and of feeling oneself instead of being nothing and of <b>not</b> <b>existing</b> is already the highest joy and the greatest happiness. Suffering and joy belong to the essence of life, they are the two fundamental affective tonalities of its manifestation and of its [...] "pathetic" [...] self-revelation (from the French word pathétique which means capable of feeling something like suffering or joy).|$|E
2500|$|But {{the freshly}} {{constituted}} party {{still had to}} impose itself on the political stage, spread its ideology and rally the supporters of a still-powerful Destour. It also had to convince lower classes that the Neo Destour was their defender, inviting them to join and recover a [...] "dignity manhandled by {{half a century of}} protectorate". In order to do so, tours were organized throughout the country, which drew a distinction between the new and old parties in their communication field. Despite its significant influence, the Destour did not succeed in mobilizing the illiterate masses whose political weight was still <b>not</b> <b>existing.</b> Cells were created and a structure was formed all around the country, making the Neo Destour a powerful engine more effective than all the preceding nationalist formations. If the elders addressed the colonial power to express their requests, the secessionists addressed the people. To reach these aims, Tahar Sfar created El Amal, an Arabic version of L'Action Tunisienne, which became the party's official paper.|$|E

2500|$|While most Wufuxu {{methods for}} {{expelling}} the Three Worms involve anthelmintic herbs, a few do not. For instance, a recipe {{attributed to the}} Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長 (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "Pluck peach leaves {{on the third day}} of the third month; crush them to extract seven pints of juice. Then mix in liquor and heat it five or six times. Take it before meals and the three worms will be driven out." [...] One anomalous Wufuxu method does not mention either medicinal herbs or diet. [...] "The Recipe of Master Redpine" [...] (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "When you cut the nails of your hands and feet on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, you can drive out the three worms from your intestines." [...] Arthur (2013: 88) reasons that [...] cutting one's nails for cleanliness might help a person to avoid future parasite infestations but <b>not</b> <b>existing</b> ones, perhaps Master Redpine was referring to the Ghost Festival that is held on the full moon of the seventh lunar month.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{assumption}} {{in these}} calculations is that populations are homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning that every individual comes {{into contact with}} every other individual, when in reality populations are better described as social networks as individuals tend to cluster together, remaining in relatively close contact with {{a limited number of}} other individuals. In these networks, transmission only occurs between those who are geographically or physically close to one another. The shape and size of a network is likely to alter a disease's HIT, making incidence either more or less common. In heterogeneous populations, R0 is now considered to be a measure of the number of cases generated by a [...] "typical" [...] infectious person, which depends on how individuals within a network interact with each other. Interactions within networks are more common than between networks, in which case the most highly connected networks transmit disease more easily, resulting in a higher R0 and a higher HIT than would be required in a less connected network. In networks that either opt not to become immune or are not immunized sufficiently, diseases may persist despite <b>not</b> <b>existing</b> in better-immunized networks.|$|E

The poster on the wall behind his bed for Pleonexia Pictures isn’t exactly subtle ('pleonexia' is a term for extreme greed) and neither are the answers he gives Gloria.
