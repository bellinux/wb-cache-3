40|$|This paper evaluates {{a set of}} {{contrail}} reduction strategies {{based on}} environmental and operational costs. A linear climate model was first used to convert climate effects of carbon dioxide emissions and aircraft contrails to changes in Absolute Global Temperature Potential, a metric that measures the mean surface temperature change due to aircraft emissions and persistent contrail formations. The concept of social cost of carbon and the carbon auction price from recent California's cap-and-trade system were then used to relate the carbon dioxide emissions and contrail formations to an environmental cost index. The strategy for contrail reduction is based on minimizing contrail formations by altering the aircraft's cruising altitude. The strategy uses a user-defined factor to trade off between contrail reduction and additional fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions. A higher value of tradeoff factor results in more contrail reduction but also more fuel burn and carbon emissions. The strategy is considered favorable when the <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> cost benefit exceeds the operational cost. The results show how the <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> benefit varies with different decision-making time-horizon and different carbon cost. The cost models provide a guidance to select the trade-off factor {{that will result in}} the most <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> benefit...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} <b>Net</b> <b>Environmental</b> Benefit Analysis for {{oil spill}} response, from an ecological point of view. This involves the weighing up of {{advantages and disadvantages}} of various spill responses to the flora and fauna and their habitats, compared with no response. Particular attention is paid to nearshore dispersant spraying and shore cleanup; and the scientific case history and experimental evidence which can be brought to bear on these responses is reviewed. For shoreline cleanup, consideration is given both to the shore itself, and to potentially interacting systems which could be affected in various ways depending upon the spill response (e. g. a bird colony or nearshore aquaculture facilities). It is concluded that for some scenarios, nearshore dispersant spraying can offer a <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> benefit. For most cases of shore oiling, there is little ecological justification for any form of cleanup if only the shore itself is considered, but moderate cleanup carried out for the sake of interacting systems is acceptable. Aggressive cleanup often delays recovery. 2 INTRODUCTIO...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} benefits and burdens of phosphorus recovery in four centralized and two decentralized municipal wastewater systems were compared using {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA). In centralized systems, phosphorus recovered as struvite from the solids dewatering liquid resulted in an environmental benefit except for the terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication impact categories, with power and chemical use offset by operational savings and avoided fertilizer production. Chemical-based phosphorus recovery, however, generally required more resources than were offset by avoided fertilizers, resulting in a <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> burden. In decentralized systems, phosphorus recovery via urine source separation reduced the global warming and ozone depletion potentials but increased terrestrial ecotoxicity and salinization potentials due to application of untreated urine to land. Overall, mineral depletion and eutrophication are well-documented arguments for phosphorus recovery; however, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily present a <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> benefit. While avoided fertilizer production does reduce potential impacts, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily offset the resources consumed in the process. LCA results indicate that selection of an appropriate phosphorus recovery method should consider both local conditions and other environmental impacts, including global warming, ozone depletion, toxicity, and salinization, in addition to eutrophication and mineral depletion impacts...|$|R
