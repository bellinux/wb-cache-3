5|$|The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii {{versions}} of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock feature online competitive play, {{in which the}} player can compete against another user through the console's <b>network</b> <b>service.</b> There are three modes of online play, Face Off, Pro Face Off, and Battle mode. Face Off challenges are score attack modes introduced in Guitar Hero II where two players attempt to gain the best score on a given song; in the standard Face Off challenge, the players may select different difficulty levels, while Pro Face Off requires the players {{to play at the}} same difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Thatgamecompany, LLC (stylized as thatgamecompany) is an American {{independent}} {{video game}} development company co-founded by University of Southern California students Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago in 2006. The company was a developer for Sony Computer Entertainment, contracted to create three downloadable {{games for the}} PlayStation 3's PlayStation <b>Network</b> <b>service,</b> and has since secured independent funding. The first of their games is a remake of Chen's award-winning Flash title Flow, with enhanced visuals and sound, added multiplayer modes and compatibility with the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller. The title was released on the PlayStation Store in 2007. The company's second PlayStation 3 game, Flower, was released on the PlayStation Store in 2009, and their third game, Journey, was released in March 2012 on the PlayStation Store. Their fourth game, Sky, is planned for a Q4 2017 release, with a timed exclusive on iOS devices.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{struggled}} to get its programs aired {{in many parts of}} the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by the telephone company AT Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links which were owned by AT The service provider did not have enough cable lines and microwave circuits to provide signal relay service from all four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT allocated times when each network could offer live programs to their affiliates. In 1950, AT allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time <b>network</b> <b>service,</b> but gave ABC only 53 hours, and DuMont just 37. AT also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, but was forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT's actions with the Federal Communications Commission, and eventually received a compromise.|$|E
30|$|The same {{information}} exchange mechanism {{is used for}} all <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> independent of which packet type will be created and which communication interface will be used. The complexity of low-level operations (buffer management, packet construction, etc) are thus hidden from the <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> This way, <b>network</b> <b>services</b> are not technology dependent, which promotes reuse of <b>network</b> <b>services</b> in different contexts.|$|R

30|$|Using {{a packet}} facade, <b>network</b> <b>services</b> {{do not need}} to strip the {{protocol}} headers from received packets to interact with packets. Thus, when non-essential <b>network</b> <b>services</b> are omitted from devices with low resources, the remaining <b>network</b> <b>services</b> can still interpret the received packets. In addition, packet attributes remain associated with a packet even if network protocols are omitted at intermediate nodes. Thus, when lightweight nodes are provided with simpler versions of the <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> these simpler services can inspect the packet attributes that were added by more advanced <b>network</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Steam client, {{as part of}} {{a social}} <b>network</b> <b>service,</b> allows users to {{identify}} friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature. Users can use text chat and peer-to-peer VoIP with other users, identify which games their friends and other group members are playing, and join and invite friends to Steamworks-based multiplayer games that support this feature. Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games. Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends, game library including earned achievements, game wishlists, and other social features; users can choose to keep this information private. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10million of the 25million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community. In conjunction with the 2012 Steam Summer Sale, user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user's participation in the Steam community and past events. Steam Trading Cards were introduced in beta in May 2013 and were fully supported by June 2013. By playing specific games, players would earn virtual trading cards, which they could trade with friends and use towards gaining rewards on the service such as game discounts, downloadable content, or in-game items, and customize their user profile page. In 2010, the Steam client became an OpenID provider, allowing third-party websites to use a Steam user's identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials. In order to prevent abuse, access to most community features is restricted until a one-time payment of at least 5 is made to Valve. This requirement can be fulfilled by making any purchase of five dollars or more on Steam, or by adding at the same amount to their wallet.|$|E
25|$|Bill C-60 {{prescribed}} that <b>network</b> <b>service</b> {{providers are}} only required to remove content pursuant {{to a court}} order. However, it required <b>network</b> <b>service</b> providers to operate by a notice-and-notice system: allegations of copyright infringement needed to be forwarded to the subscriber. While failure to forward the notice came with a maximum damage award of $5,000, there was no penalty for filing a wrongful notice. The bill required the <b>network</b> <b>service</b> provider retain subscriber identity records for six months upon receipt of an infringement notice and for one year in the even of legal proceedings. Failure to do so came with statutory damages of up to $10,000 for the <b>network</b> <b>service</b> provider.|$|E

Secondly, {{in the area of}} the Internet, Bill C-60 sought to impose a system of notice-and-notice for <b>network</b> <b>service</b> providers. In contrast, the DMCA prescribes a system of notice-and-takedown in order for <b>network</b> <b>service</b> providers to be exempt from infringement liability.|$|E
