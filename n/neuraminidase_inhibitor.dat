2500|$|Hirst {{noticed that}} {{hemagglutination}} tended to wear off over time, and in 1942, {{he discovered that}} influenza virus has an intrinsic enzymatic activity that can release the virus from its attachment to red blood cells. This was a ground-breaking discovery, as previously a key distinction between viruses and bacteria had been that viruses were believed to lack enzymes. Hirst demonstrated that red blood cells once de-agglutinated could not be re-agglutinated, and correctly deduced that the enzyme destroys a receptor for the virus on the red blood cells. This enzyme, then {{referred to as the}} [...] "receptor-destroying enzyme" [...] was later shown to be the influenza neuraminidase, another viral envelope glycoprotein, which acts as a sialidase. Like hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is essential for the influenza life cycle, being required for the progeny virus to leave the host cell. Neuraminidase is the target of the <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> class of antiviral drugs, which include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).|$|E

40|$|Despite being {{a common}} viral disease, {{influenza}} has very negative consequences, causing {{the death of}} around {{half a million people}} each year.

The treatment of influenza is mainly based on the administration of <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> The <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> zanamivir, laninamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir have been commercialized and have been demonstrated to be potent influenza viral <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> against most influenza strains.

40|$|Study Design and Setting: Reviews of <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{published}} during January 2005 to May 2013 {{were identified}} by searching PubMed. In a blinded evaluation, the reviews were classified as favorable if investigators agreed that they supported the use of <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> for prophylaxis or treatment of influenza. Reference lists were used to identify all unique citations to primary articles. Three classification methods were tested {{for their ability to}} predict favorable conclusions using only citation information. Objectives: To examine the use of supervised machine learning to identify biases in evidence selection and determine if citation information can predict favorable conclusions in reviews about <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Results: Citations to 4, 574 articles were identified in 152 reviews of <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and 93 (61 %) of these reviews were graded as favorable. Primary articles describing drug resistance were among the citations that were underrepresented in favorable reviews. The most accurate classifier predicted favorable conclusions with 96. 2 % accuracy, using citations to only 24 of 4, 574 articles. Conclusion: Favorable conclusions in reviews about <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> can be predicted using only information about the articles they cite.

40|$|Lately, several press {{releases}} {{as well as}} a parliamentary inquiry questioned the effectiveness of the <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (NAI, oseltamivir and zanamivir) in concerns of therapy of influenza.

All three scientific expert societies (GfV, DVV and PEG) are considering this point illegitimate and also dangerous simplification. On the one hand, the recent analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration confirms a significant reduction in time to first alleviation of symptoms in children (oseltamivir) and adults (oseltamivir and zanamivir).

His subsequent structural studies on resistance to this drug class suggested how to design drugs against moving targets. His discoveries underpin drug stockpiling for pandemic preparedness. He has made seminal contributions to structural studies of antibodies and antibody-antigen complexes. Recent work on apoptosis solves the long-standing problem of how pro-apoptotic Bax changes conformation to dimerise and then oligomerise and permeabilise the mitochondrial membrane, an essential step in the intrinsic cell-death pathway.|$|E
50|$|Transition state analogs (transition state analogues), are {{chemical}} compounds with a chemical structure that resembles the transition state of a substrate molecule in an enzyme-catalyzed chemical reaction.

Theory suggests that enzyme inhibitors which resembled the transition state structure would bind more tightly to the enzyme than the actual substrate.

50|$|<b>Neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (NAIs) are a {{class of}} drugs which block the {{neuraminidase}} enzyme. They are commonly used as antiviral drugs because they block the function of viral neuraminidases of the influenza virus, by preventing its reproduction by budding from the host cell. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) a prodrug, Zanamivir (Relenza), Laninamivir (Inavir), and Peramivir belong to this class. Unlike the M2 inhibitors, which work only against the influenza A, <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> act against both influenza A and influenza B. The <b>neuraminidase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> oseltamivir and zanamivir were approved in the US and Europe for treatment and prevention of influenza A and B. Peramivir acts by strongly binding to the neuraminidase of the influenza viruses and inhibits activation of neuraminidase much longer than Oseltamivir or Zanamivir. However, Laninamivir in the cells is slowly released into the respiratory tract, resulting in long-lasting anti-influenza virus activity. Thus the mechanism of the long-lasting activity of laninamivir is basically {{different from that of}} Peramivir.|$|R
