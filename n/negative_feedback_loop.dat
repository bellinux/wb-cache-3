5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loop</b> of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E

30|$|Understanding {{the role}} of {{feedback}} is crucial {{in the study of}} dynamical systems; see, e.g., [2, 3] for relevant surveys. The absence of <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> tends to favor steady state attractors.

In these systems trajectories converge generically towards an equilibrium under mild regularity hypotheses; see, e.g., [4 – 6].

25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loop.</b> If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency.

It is intriguing that such <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> exist in many cases in a particular form of coupled positive and <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> with different time delays.

In other words, coupled <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> enable cellular systems to produce perfect re-sponses to noisy stimuli with respect to signal duration and amplitude.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Feedback</b> <b>loops,</b> both {{positive}} and negative are embedded in the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade. In the three layer MAPK cascade, both <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> originate from the terminal layer and their sites of action are either of the two upstream layers. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} cascade uses coupled positive and <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> in generating oscillations. Two plausible designs of coupled positive and <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> can be elucidated from the literature; in one design the positive <b>feedback</b> precedes the <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> in the direction of signal flow and vice-versa in another. But it remains unexplored how the two designs contribute towards triggering oscillations in MAPK cascade. Thus it is also not known how amplitude, frequency, robustness or nature (analogous/digital) of the oscillations would be shaped by these two designs. Results We built two models of MAPK cascade that exhibited oscillations as function of two underlying designs of coupled positive and <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loops.</b> Frequency, amplitude and nature (digital/analogous) of oscillations were found to be differentially determined by each design. It was observed that the positive feedback emerging from an oscillating MAPK cascade and functional in an external signal processing module can trigger oscillations in the target module, provided that the target module satisfy certain parametric requirements. The augmentation of the two models was done to incorporate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cascade components followed by induction of a nuclear phosphatase. It revealed that the fate of oscillations in the MAPK cascade is governed by the feedback designs. Oscillations were unaffected due to nuclear compartmentalization owing to one design but were completely abolished in the other case. Conclusion The MAPK cascade can utilize two distinct designs of coupled positive and <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> to trigger oscillations. The amplitude, frequency and robustness of the oscillations in presence or absence of nuclear compartmentalization were differentially determined by two designs of coupled positive and <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loops.</b> A positive <b>feedback</b> from an oscillating MAPK cascade was shown to induce oscillations in an external signal processing module, uncovering a novel regulatory aspect of MAPK signal processing. </p...|$|R

As the blood sugar goes higher, additional insulin will bring the blood sugar back down in a classic <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loop.</b> [...] As insulin is released from the beta cells, amylin is also released into the bloodstream.

[...] As the blood sugar level comes back toward normal, the beta cells will stop spurting insulin and amylin. [...] As the glucose level approaches a low mark, the pancreatic alpha cells will release glucagon directly into the bloodstream. [...] Glucagon causes the liver to release stored glucose back into the bloodstream. [...] Increased glucagon will increase blood glucose levels to produce a positive error in the <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>loop.</b> [...] Together, the three endocrine hormones work as a system to maintain the blood glucose level between high and low boundaries.
