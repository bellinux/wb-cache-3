40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma</b> is {{a common}} fibrous bone lesion in {{children}} that occurs in the metaphysis of the long bones of the lower extremities. The lesion rarely leads to aneurysmal bone cyst, which is characterized as a blood-filled space. Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} 13 -year-old Japanese boy with a complaint of discomfort in the thigh and a small, well-defined, osteolytic lesion with cortical thinning located in the medullary space of the distal diaphysis of the femur. At 10 -month follow-up, the size of the lesion had increased. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging failed to detect any solid area. Curettage and bone graft were performed and confirmed a blood-filled cystic lesion. The pathological diagnosis of the cyst wall was that of <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma,</b> suggesting aneurysmal bone cyst as a secondary change. An aneurysmal bone cyst is rarely found secondary to <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma,</b> and the diaphyseal location is atypical for <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma,</b> both of which made diagnosis challenging. Conclusion The current case is a reminder to clinicians that, although rare, <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma</b> can be associated with aneurysmal bone cyst, and both can occur in the diaphysis of long bones. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 19 cases with bone tumors, {{including}} six osteosarcomas. three giant cell tumors of bone, one {{malignant fibrous histiocytoma}}, four nonossifying fibromas, four chondromas and one chondrosarcoma, were examined as to enzyme histochemistry; the enzymes consisted of alkaline phosphatase (ALPase), acid phosphatase (ACPase), nonspecific esterase (NSE), adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), 5 '-nucleotidase (5 '-Nucl) and beta-glucuronidase (beta-Gl). Osteosarcoma was strongly positive for ALPase followed by 5 '-Nucl. Giant cell tumor, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma</b> showed enzyme histochemistry similar to each other: multinucleated giant cells and round cells in these tumors were strongly positive for ACPase, NSE, ATPase and 5 '-Nucl simulating osteoclasts and histiocytes, whereas spindle cells were positive for ATPase and 5 '-Nucl in their cytoplasm and weakly positive for ACPase. Chondroma and chondrosarcoma were focally positive for ACPase and NSE; the ACPase was sensitive to tartaric acid treatment. These observations showed that ALPase activity is very characteristic to osteosarcoma, and is useful for its diagnosis.

30|$|MRI is more {{appropriate}} to identify the presence of bone oedema as well as identify and quantify infiltration, extraosseous masses and soft tissue changes.

Materials and methods. 20 adolescent patients, 14 males and 6 females, with mean age 18 years and 6 months (range, from 16 to < 21 years); presented to the National Institute of Neuromotor system, Egypt, between September 2007 and September 2009, with giant <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibromas</b> of the distal tibia. Diagnosis was made by clinical examination, plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathological reports. Treatment was achieved by curettage without bone graft, but with intralesional filling with bone cement. Evaluation concerning pain, functional activity using MSTS scoring, pathological fracture, and local recurrence were done over a mean follow-up period of 6 years and 2 months (range, 5 to 7 years). Results. Pain and functional activity improved in the twenty patients with mean MSTS score of 29. 2 (range, 25 to 30).

This review summarizes and illustrates the spectrum of benign bone conditions that may be FDG-avid and mimic malignancy, including osteomyelitis, bone lesions due to benign systemic diseases (Brown tumor, Erdheim-Chester disease, Gaucher disease, gout and other types of arthritis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and sarcoidosis), benign primary bone lesions (bone cysts, chondroblastoma, chondromyxoid fibroma, desmoplastic fibroma, enchondroma, giant cell tumor and granuloma, hemangioma, <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma,</b> and osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma), and a group of miscellaneous benign bone conditions (post bone marrow biopsy or harvest status, bone marrow hyperplasia, fibrous dysplasia, fractures, osteonecrosis, Paget disease of bone, particle disease, and Schmorl nodes). Several ancillary clinical and imaging findings may be helpful in discriminating benign from malignant FDGavid bone lesions. However, this distinction is sometimes difficult or even impossible, and tissue acquisition will be required to establish the final diagnosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Intraosseous lipoma {{is a rare}} benign bone disease. Long and cancellous {{bones are}} the most locationsthat can be affected. Almost all lesions were {{discovered}} incidentally on imaging modalities that were done during an unrelated investigation. As it is rare, it may be mistaken for <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma,</b> aneurismal bone cyst, simple bone cyst, bone infarct or chondroid tumors. Recently with the high quality imaging modalities such as CT scan and/or MR imaging, the diagnosis of intramedullary lipoma and some other bone lesions can be done {{without the need for}} bone biopsy and surgery. Case Report: We’re reporting a rare case of intraosseous lipoma of the distal femur. Plain film radiography showed barely visible medullary expansion and lucency in the distal left femoral diaphysis. The patient underwent further evaluation with computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI). According to the MRI and CT scan findings, intraosseous lipoma was confirmed and the need for more diagnostic tests were eliminated. Conclusion: Although Intraosseous lipoma doesn’t have any manifestations clinically but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bone pains. MRI has an important role in characterization of soft tissue and bone marrow lesions therefore non-surgical approach for most of the patients with intraosseous lipoma would be beneficial.

40|$|Overexpression of the {{hepatocyte}} {{growth factor}} receptor (Met/HGF receptor), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET proto-oncogene, {{is involved in}} transformation and invasive behavior of human carcinomas and sarcomas, We have previously found that bone sarcomas express high levels of Met/HGF receptor while {{in some cases the}} ligand HGF is co-expressed with the receptor, activating an autocrine loop. In this study, we analyzed 40 biopsy samples of a collection of giant cell tumors and other rare benign tumors of bone for expression of the MET proto-oncogene. These included <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibromas,</b> osteoblastomas, desmoplastic Fibromas of bone, chondroblastomas, and giant cell tumors of bone. Snap frozen samples were tested for the MET and HGF gene expression by immuno-histochemistry and Western blotting with anti-MET antibodies and RT-PCR. Over 50 % of all cases scored positive for MET expression being constantly positive in recurrent or locally aggressive lesions. Sporadic co-expression of the Met/HGF receptor and ligand is also demonstrated. Met/HGF receptor expression in benign bone neoplasms suggests its early involvement in sarcomagenesis. J. Cell.

30|$|Langerhans histiocytosis, as a {{systemic}} disease, {{appears to be}} one of the most tissue-destructive syndromes, able to induce multiple and grossly apparent lytic lesions involving many organs and the bones. Since this lytic activity cannot be connected with a neoplastic nature of the disease, one can reasonably assume that histiocytosis X cells induce bone resorption in eosinophilic granuloma through their ability to secrete locally tissue-lytic factors such as interleukins and prostaglandins [53]. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the production of interleukins (IL) such as IL- 1 and prostaglandins (PG) such as PGE 2 and PGD 2 by suspensions of Langerhans cells [53, 54]. Although definitive proof that corticosteroid injection is responsible for the observed response is difficult to obtain, the inhibition of IL- 1 -induced bone resorption and prostaglandin production by methylprednisolone [55] may account for its clinical and radiographic effect. Previous studies on the treatment of certain osteolytic lesions including bone cysts, aneurysmal cysts, eosinophilic granulomas and <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibromas</b> showed that the results obtained through the introduction of methylprednisolone acetate in crystals were better than those obtained by using other corticosteroids with topical action [40]. This is because it is a microcrystalline suspension of acetate of methylprednisolone that is relatively insoluble and, therefore, has a prolonged pharmalogical effect [40]. A particular dosage for eosinophilic granulomas cannot be recommended. The amount of methylprednisolone acetate injected was established empirically on the basis of the size of the lesion. A minimum of 40  mg for small lesions involving less than half the diameter of the involved bone, and up to 160  mg for large lesions of the pelvis has been recommended [36 – 38].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Data on {{childhood}} bone {{tumors are}} mainly confined to reports on malignant tumors or on institutional registries. Incidence figures on both benign and malignant bone tumors in childhood are lacking. Methods: From January 1999 to December 2003, 1474 newly diagnosed bone tumors in children up to 18 years were registered in Pathologisch Anatomisch Landelijk Geautomatiscerd Archief (the nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology in The Netherlands). Data provided were diagnosis, date of birth, age at diagnosis, and localization. For incidence calculations, data on {{age and sex}} in each year of investigation {{were obtained from the}} StatLine database of Statistics Netherlands (www. cbs. nl). Results/Conclusions: Incidence of pathology-proven bone tumors in children is low. Incidence of pathology-proven bone tumors in The Netherlands is 79. 3 per 1, 000, 000. From the very first year of life, incidence increases from 3. 9 per 1, 000, 000 to a peak at 13 to 15 years of 142. 9 per 1, 000, 000. Osteochondromas are the most prevalent tumors, followed by aneurysmal bone cysts. The overall incidence is higher for male compared with female patients, mainly due to different frequencies found in aneurysmal bone cysts, Ewing sarcoma, and osteochondroma. Shifts in incidence differ among the various tumors. In infants, bone tumors are mainly chondromas and fibrous dysplasia, which both show a steady increase at older ages. Tumors most prevalent at older ages are osteochondromas, osteosarcomas, osteoid osteomas, and chondromas. A peak incidence at approximately the age of 10 is noted for solitary bone cysts, <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibromas,</b> and osteoblastomas. Small children more often have localizations in the skull and facial bones. Comparison with literature data showed significant differences due to referral-based institutionally bias, whereas tumor registries only give data for specific tumor type...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Chondromas are {{uncommon}} benign tumors of cartilaginous origin. Although chonodroma of the jaw {{is extremely}} rare, the commonly involved are the anterior {{portion of the}} maxilla, condyle and coronoid process. A chondroma is a painless, slow growing tumor causing destruction and exfoliation of teeth. On a radiograph, the tumor appears as a cyst-like radiolucent lesion, while some are sclerotic. The borders are usually ill-defined. Irregular calcifications may be seen with radiolucencies and then it is an osteochondroma. Material and Methods. We present a patient with a resected and histologically proven chondroma of the skull base and maxilla. A 65 -year-old female was admitted to our clinic with swelling and breathing difficulties. MRI showed a large soft tissue mass of the skull base and maxilla. Clinicopathological and radiological features were examined by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discussion and Conclusion. Chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) is a rare, benign cartilaginous tumor that often occurs in the metaphyses of proximal tibia, proximal and distal femur and small bones of the foot. The differential diagnosis is wide and includes simple or aneyrismal bone cyst, giant cell tumor, <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma,</b> fibrous dysplasia, enchondroma, chondroblastoma, eosinophilic granuloma and fibrous cortical defect. Our case demonstrates an uncommon occurrence in the maxillary sinus: CMF with nasal, pterygoid and orbital infiltration. In the diagnosis of an intracranial chondrocytic tumor, {{it is important to}} distinguish it from enchondroma and chondrosarcoma. MR provides a detailed assessment of soft tissue masses of the craniofacial region, while CT offers superior analysis of bone structure involvement. The present case underlines the importance of MR examination in the diagnosis of soft tissue masses in the craniofacial region...|$|E
40|$|Driver {{mutations}} {{in the two}} histone 3. 3 (H 3. 3) genes, H 3 F 3 A and H 3 F 3 B, were recently identified by whole genome sequencing in 95 % of chondroblastoma (CB) and by targeted gene sequencing in 92 % of giant cell tumour of bone (GCT). Given the high prevalence of these driver mutations, {{it may be possible}} to utilise these alterations as diagnostic adjuncts in clinical practice. Here, we explored the spectrum of H 3. 3 {{mutations in}} a wide range and large number of bone tumours (n 5 412) to determine if these alterations could be used to distinguish GCT from other osteoclast-rich tumours such as aneurysmal bone cyst, <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma,</b> giant cell granuloma, and osteoclast-rich malignant bone tumours and others. In addition, we explored the driver landscape of GCT through whole genome, exome and targeted sequencing (14 gene panel). We found that H 3. 3 mutations, namely mutations of glycine 34 in H 3 F 3 A, occur in 96 % of GCT. We did not find additional driver mutations in GCT, including mutations in IDH 1, IDH 2, USP 6, TP 53. The genomes of GCT exhibited few somatic mutations, akin to the picture seen in CB. Overall our observations suggest that the presence of H 3 F 3 A p. Gly 34 mutations does not entirely exclude malignancy in osteoclast-rich tumours. However, H 3 F 3 A p. Gly 34 mutations appear to be an almost essential feature of GCT that will aid pathological evaluation of bone tumours, especially when confronted with small needle core biopsies. In the absence of H 3 F 3 A p. Gly 34 mutations, a diagnosis of GCT should be made with caution...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{quest for}} ideal bone graft {{substitutes}} still haunts orthopedic researchers. The impetus for this search of newer bone substitutes {{is provided by}} mismatch between the demand and supply of autogenous bone grafts. Bone banking facilities such as deep frozen and freeze-dried allografts are not so widely available {{in most of the}} developing countries. To overcome the problem, we have used partially decalcified, ethanol preserved, and domestic refrigerator stored allografts which are economical and needs simple technology for procurement, preparation, and preservation. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the radiological and functional outcome of the partially decalcified allograft (by weak hydrochloric acid) in patients of benign lytic lesions of bone. Through this study, we have also tried to evolve, establish, and disseminate the concept of the bone bank. Materials and Methods: 42 cases of lytic lesions of bone who were treated by decalcified (by weak hydrochloric acid), ethanol preserved, allografts were included in this prospective study. The allograft was obtained from freshly amputated limbs or excised femoral heads during hip arthroplasties under strict aseptic conditions. The causes of lytic lesions were unicameral bone cyst (n = 3), aneurysmal bone cyst (n = 3), giant cell tumor (n = 9), fibrous dysplasia (n = 12), chondromyxoid fibroma, chondroma, <b>nonossifying</b> <b>fibroma</b> (n = 1 each), tubercular osteomyelitis (n = 7), and chronic pyogenic osteomyelitis (n = 5). The cavity of the lesion was thoroughly curetted and compactly filled with matchstick sized allografts. Results: Quantitative assessment based on the criteria of Sethi et al. (1993) was done. There was complete assimilation in 27 cases, partial healing in 12 cases, and failure in 3 cases. Functional assessment was also done according to which there were 29 excellent results, 6 good, and 7 cases of failure (infection, recurrence, and nonunion of pathological fracture). We observed that after biological incorporation, the graft participates in bone physiology and morphology. We did not observe any adverse host graft antigenic reaction. Conclusions: We conclude that decalcified allograft is suitable alloimplant for use in benign lesions of bone, is easy to prepare and store, and is thus well suited for use in developing countries...|$|E
