Customers {{have to be prepared to}} sleep in beds made of snow or ice, but in the warmth of furs, blankets and sleeping bags designed to withstand extremely cold temperatures. Temperature in the rooms is below zero Celsius, but much warmer than outside. Staying at an ice hotel is expensive as prices for a <b>night</b> <b>range</b> from around US $300 to $3,000. Some ice hotels may be destination hotels.|$|E
50|$|Mounted on {{the front}} of the turret in an {{armoured}} box is the electro-optical tracking equipment which consists of a TV tracking camera, and infra-red tracking camera and a laser rangefinder. The tracking cameras have a day range of approximately 6,000 meters and a <b>night</b> <b>range</b> of 5,000 meters. The laser rangefinder has a range of between 500 and 5,500 meters with an accuracy of 5 meters. Mounted on either side of the turret are two 25 millimeter Type 87 cannons, which eject spent shell casings to either side of the vehicle. The 25mm cannons have a rate of fire of 600-800 rpm each,and are gas-operated. About 1,000 rounds are carried. The cannons are used to engage targets out to a range of 2,500 meters and at altitudes of up to 2,000 meters. Additionally two QW-2 infra-red homing missiles can be mounted above the cannons on each side. The QW-2 missiles are based on a shoulder-launched missile and can engage targets flying between 10 and 3,500 meters in altitude at a slant range of between 500 and 6,000 meters. To the rear of the turret is the CLC-1 S-band pulse-doppler search radar which has a reported range of 11 kilometers, and is optimized to detect low-flying targets. Finally, an array of four electrically fired smoke grenades are mounted on either side of the turret, aimed to fire forward and to either side of the vehicle.A large door which opens to the left is provided in the rear of the hull.|$|E

40|$|The {{timing of}} nocturnal cough and its {{association}} with change in ambient temperature was documented in 11 asthmatic children, median age 5. 1 years, while they were receiving continuous prophylaxis. Studies were performed in their homes on three nights. A voice activated system with electronic time signal recorded coughing. Ambient temperature was recorded every five minutes throughout the night on a Grant Squirrel data logger. Ten children coughed on 27 nights with a median of six bouts of coughing a <b>night</b> (<b>range</b> 0 - 272). The cough rate in the two hours after going to bed {{was significantly higher than}} the cough rate {{in the middle of the}} night (2 - 4 am or 4 - 6 am). Peak coughing times were 7 - 9 pm and 6 - 8 am. The room temperature was lowest between 5 and 7 am. There were no significant differences between cough rates during periods of rapid temperature change (more than 1 degree C an hour). The timing of nocturnal cough observed in this study differed from the known basophase of circadian cycles described for adults and children...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To present our {{experience}} of early endonasal DCR (endoDCR) {{in the treatment of}} acute dacryocystitis (AD). Methods. International multicenter non-comparative retrospective study. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were identified. All were treated with antibiotics prior to surgery with a median of time from referral to endoDCR surgeon to surgery of 3 days (range 1 - 7). Surgery was performed using mechanical powered endoDCR (MENDCR) in 15 / 18 (83. 3 %) cases; mitomycin C was used in 5 / 18 (27. 8 %) and all cases underwent bicanalicular intubation. An increase in perioperative bleeding was noted in 5 / 18 (27. 8 %), causing interference in surgical technique in one (5. 6 %). Resolution of AD was seen in all cases, with no recurrences. 17 / 18 (94. 4 %) cases were free of epiphora at median follow-up of 12 months (range 2 - 36), with nasal endoscopy revealing free flow of fluorescein through the ostium in 17 / 18 (94. 4 %) of cases. The median total length of stay was 1 <b>night</b> (<b>range</b> 0 - 3). CONCLUSIONS: EndoDCR surgery performed early in AD led to rapid resolution of the condition in all cases and was associated with subsequent anatomical and functional success in 94. 4 % of cases. Early endoDCR surgery in the context of AD and the potential associated health economic benefits are worth further consideration and study. Simon N.

40|$|We used {{acoustic}} telemetry {{to describe}} the spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use {{of one of the}} species most targeted by recreational anglers in the NW Mediterranean, Serranus cabrilla (Linnaeus, 1758). Temporal patterns and fish position were determined using a fixed-receiver array located in a marine protected area (MPA) in Palma Bay (Balearic Islands). Fish position as centre of activity (COA, the centre of the area the fish uses during a specific time) and space utilisation preferences could be described due to a receiver array design with a high range detection overlap (more densely distributed near the COA). There were significantly more detections per time unit during the day, which was interpreted as increased activity possibly related to feeding habits and social behaviour. S. cabrilla spent 95 % of its time in an average area of 0. 77 ± 0. 17 km 2, with a core area (50 % of the time) of 0. 10 ± 0. 29 km 2. The home range size was not related to fish size or diel pattern (i. e. the size of the daytime home range was not significantly different from the <b>night</b> <b>range).</b> The linearity index and the index of reuse (proxies of site fidelity) also demonstrated that this species has high site fidelity, which suggests that it is sedentary with a limited adult dispersal capacity. Two main habitats were observed in the study area, and S. cabrilla spent on average much less time in seagrass meadows (Posidonia oceanica beds) compared to soft, gravel and detritus bottoms. A relatively small MPA would be a useful management tool for establishing sustainable exploitation levels of this species. © Inter-Research 2011.

40|$|Background : The ideal {{treatment}} for patients presenting with bilateral {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) deficiency remains controversial. The purpose was to evaluate cost and mid-term functional results after one-stage bilateral ACL reconstruction using either hamstring or patella tendon autograft. Methods : We compared the mid-term outcome of 7 patients (14 knees) who had one-stage bilateral ACL reconstruction {{with that of a}} matched group of patients who had unilateral reconstruction (21 patients). Results : The median duration of hospital stay was 4 <b>nights</b> (<b>range</b> 3 to 5) for the bilateral group and 2 <b>nights</b> (<b>range,</b> 1 to 4) for the control group. The duration of rehabilitation process in patients from the control group with unilateral ACL reconstruction was one week shorter (9 versus 8 weeks). In the bilateral group, the median Lysholm score was 96 (range 85 – 100) and in the control group, the median score was 93 (range 81 – 100). The median time to return to full-time work and to full sports was 9 weeks and 7 months for the simultaneous bilateral group and 8 weeks and 6 months for the unilateral group. Six patients (86  %) in the bilateral group and 17 patients (81  %) in the control group were still performing at their pre-injury level of activity. The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia saves EUR 2, 925 when we perform simultaneous bilateral ACL reconstruction instead of two stage ACL reconstruction. Conclusions : Mid-term clinical results suggested that simultaneous bilateral ACL reconstruction using either hamstring or patella tendon autograft is clinically effective. For patients presenting with symptomatic bilateral ACL deficient knees, one stage bilateral ACL reconstruction is reproducible, cost effective, and does not compromise functional results. </p...|$|R

40|$|From June 2008 to January 2016 nearly 800 elves {{have been}} {{recorded}} by a low-light camera in northeastern Spain. Elves occur in this region mainly over the lower-topped cold airmass maritime thunderstorms, peaking from November to January. Cloud-to-ground strokes still produce elves when maritime winter storms are carried inland, suggesting the cold season thunderstorm charge configuration favors strokes with large electromagnetic pulses. Altitudes of 389 elves were determined using optical data combined with a lightning location network. The overall median altitude was 87. 1 km, near the typical OH airglow height, but average heights during individual <b>nights</b> <b>ranged</b> between 83 and 93 km. The lower elve nights (84 km) occurred during slightly elevated geomagnetic conditions (Kp> 3 -, ap-index > 10).
