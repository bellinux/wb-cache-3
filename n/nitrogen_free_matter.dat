Since the various fatty acid profiles (chain length, degree of unsaturation, and branching of the chain) of the different sources influence biodiesel fuel properties, it is important to possess data on how the presence of NaNO 3 as nitrogen source can influence the profile of produced fatty acids from algae. The fatty acid profiles of Desmodesmus quadricaudatus and Chlorella sp. were detected in pure batch cultures experiments. BG- 11 <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> medium and the medium contained 1. 5 g NaNO 3 l − 1 were used in this investigation. At late stationary growth phase in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> medium, Chlorella sp. produced 58. 39 % saturated fatty acids and 41. 60 % unsaturated fatty acids. While in medium contained 1. 5 g NaNO 3 l − 1 Chlorella sp. produced 62. 08 % saturated fatty acids and 37. 92 % unsaturated fatty acids. In <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> medium D. quadricaudatus produced 66. 92 % saturated fatty acids and 33. 07 % unsaturated fatty acids.

It was observed that highly significant inverse correlations exist between percent water content and percent ash content (wet weight), percent fat content (wet weight) and percent protein content (wet weight) in both species. In Wallago attu, there was no effect of wet body weight and total body length on percent water contents but positive influence on percent ash contents (wet weight), percent fat contents (wet weight), percent protein contents (wet weight), percent ash <b>free</b> <b>matter</b> (wet weight and dry weight), percent fat <b>free</b> <b>matter</b> (wet weight) and percent protein <b>free</b> <b>matter</b> (wet weight and dry weight). In case of Sperata sarwari, wet body weight and total body length have positive influence on percent water contents, percent fat contents (wet weight), percent protein <b>free</b> <b>matter</b> (wet weight and dry weight) and negative influence on percent ash contents (wet weight), percent protein contents (wet weight), percent ash <b>free</b> <b>matter</b> (wet weight and dry weight) and percent fat <b>free</b> <b>matter</b> (wet weight). Condition factor has a highly significant positive correlation with percent fat content (wet weight) in both species.

There was no significant effect of sex on body constituents in both species. The results also indicated that the proximate composition of the Wallago attu and Sperata sarwari depend on season. It was found that body constituents varied in different months of the year. The predictive equations can be used to estimate values of body composition with a fair amount of accuracy for both species. Flame Atomic Spectrometry was used as an analytical tool for analysis of trace metal concentration in relation to body size. In Wallago attu, it was observed that the metals i. e. Cd, Co, Fe and Cu were found to increase isometrically while Zn, Ni and Pb showed negative allometry with increasing body weight and total length. In Sperata sarwari, Cd, Co, Fe and Zn were found to increase isometrically while Ni, Cu and Pb showed negative allometric growth with body weight and total length. In both species, there were not significant differences in elemental concentration with relation to sex. The effect of season on elemental concentration was analyzed by using the ANOVA. Significant differences were observed in case of copper, zinc and lead concentrations in Wallago attu while zinc and nickel concentrations in Sperata sarwari. Wet body weight of both the species was not consistent with the cube law and showed positive allometry. The regression slope was W = 0. 001698 L 3. 27 for W. attu and W = 0. 001698 L 3. 28 for S. sarwari. The values of the slope b are significantly higher than b = 3. 0, which shows that the weight grows more rapidly as compared to the cube of the length.
