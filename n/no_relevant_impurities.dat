40|$|There may be {{substantial}} {{differences in the}} chemical composition of technical-grade products of the same active ingredient manufactured under different conditions, from different raw materials, or by different routes of synthesis. Resulting differences in impurity content may significantly affect the toxicological properties of pesticide products. <b>Relevant</b> <b>impurities</b> are those that may exhibit pronounced toxic effects compared to the active ingredient, affect phytotoxicity or physical properties of formulations, result in undesirable residues in food,or cause environmental contamination. The first safety assessment of an active ingredient by a regulatory body considers toxicological data developed on a representative batch of technical products, {{with the assumption that}} the material produced commercially by the original or generic manufacturers has an equal or higher content of active ingredient and contains the same or fewer impurities at equal or lower concentrations as the fully characterized technical product used in the toxicological tests. Three steps are essential for ensuring the safety of commercial technical- grade pesticide products, whether produced by the original manufacturer or by generic manufacturers. First, the identity and chemical structure of the impurities must be elucidated. This should include positive identification of major (= 1 %) and all toxicologically or environmentally <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities,</b> and characterization of minor impurities (> 0. 1 %). Second, in addition to recognition of a minimum active ingredient content, official specifications should also list <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities</b> and their maximum permissible concentrations. Implementation of these specifications should be aided by a decision-making scheme for establishing similarity of subsequently evaluated technical products. Third, appropriate analytical methods for the detection and quantification of impurity levels should be developed and employed in a quality-monitoring program associated with the manufacturing and formulation proces...|$|R
40|$|The {{design for}} a set of four high-efficiency vacuum {{ultraviolet}}/extreme ultraviolet (VUV/XUV) spectrometers has been developed, which shall be used for plasma impurity monitoring and impurity transport studies on the stellarator experiment Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X). The new high-efficiency XUV overview spectrometer (HEXOS) system covers the wavelength range from 2. 5 to 160 nm, divided into four subsections with some overlapping, thus achieving a complete coverage of prominent spectral lines from the <b>relevant</b> <b>impurity</b> elements. Taking into account spectrometer geometries and detector geometries, toroidal holographic diffraction gratings are numerically optimized to maximize the total throughput while maintaining good spectral resolution. The performance of the spectrometers is tested and optimized by means of ray tracing calculations. In order to prove the potential for line identification as well as the expected levels of signal intensity and noise figures of the new systems, spectra are simulated using the impurity transport code STRAHL. Under typical plasma conditions on W 7 -X the new spectrometers will allow clear identification of all <b>relevant</b> <b>impurity</b> elements in the plasma. The large collected photon flux results in a high accuracy for the measured line intensities, even when operating the spectrometers at spectra rates of 1000 /s.

50|$|In 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made {{an attempt}} to revive the line, reopening Colton mine and {{starting}} a new bore at Timwood. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907 no passenger service was provided. The ore which was extracted in this period was ill-suited to the furnaces and was almost unsaleable, so the Syndicate built a plant at Washford station to extract <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities</b> and waste and form the resulting material into briquettes which it hoped would be cheaper to transport and more attractive to customers.|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of the chemical solutions is important for high efficiency cell processing. In solar cell industry, the possible contamination of wet chemical bathes for texturing and cleaning with trace impurities is not yet studied intensively. Questions concerning the desired bath purity or the maximum impurity load of the cleaning bath can only be answered empirically. This paper gives an overview of possible measurement techniques and tools for qualification of the cleaned surface itself {{as well as for}} controlling the <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities</b> in the cleaning solutions. Atomabsorption spectrometry and emission spectrometry to analyse impurities in wet chemical solutions are described. The correlation between metal impurities and the lifetime are shown...|$|R
