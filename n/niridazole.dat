50|$|<b>Niridazole</b> is a schistosomicide. It is used {{to treat}} schistosomiasis, the helmintic disease caused by certain flatworms (trematodes) from the genus Schistosoma (formerly Bilharzia). It is also known by its trade name Ambilhar. It is usually given as tablets.|$|E
50|$|Until 1964, all {{available}} amoebicides were {{selective in their}} sites of action. The development of newer nitro-imidazole derivatives led to <b>Niridazole.</b> It was given in a daily dose of 25-30 mgm. per kg to 50 patients for seven days. The cure rate {{was found to be}} 84% with serious side effects in one patient. An Indian study of 30 patients on this drug revealed that it acted as a contact amoebicide and also against the invasive forms.23 The therapeutic action of Ambilhar was found to be significantly better than that produced by a combination of dehydroemetine and chloroquine.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{drug that}} {{has proven to}} be {{effective}} against embedded fleas. Oral <b>niridazole</b> was once considered a therapeutic drug, but well-designed studies are lacking and, given the severe adverse effects, this is one drug that is likely to cause more harm than good. However, it has some anecdotal evidence of lysing the fleas altogether. Oral ivermectin is considered by some in endemic areas to be a panacea against the fleas but studies using high doses have failed to validate this hypothesis. Other drugs such as topical ivermectin and metrifonate have been somewhat successful, but not enough to be significant. 2,5 For superinfections, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, amoxicillin, (with/without clavulanate) have been used successfully, though these treat only secondary infections.|$|E
50|$|This {{is another}} {{derivative}} {{of the parent}} drug and its results are better than <b>niridazole.</b> This amoebicide acts directly on the trophozoites of E. Histolytica. Studies showed that because of very high concentration in the liver extremely small amounts of the drug were effective in amoebic liver abscess, but with such low doses, eradication of amoebae in the bowel was uncertain. The drug is quickly absorbed, partly metabolized, and rapidly excreted without any cumulative effect. It is more active in the tissues than in the gut lumen. It follows that a higher dosage is needed in the cure of luminal than systemic infection. The side effects of metronidazole are infrequent. Gastro-intestinal symptoms and headache occur occasionally. Heavy coating of tongue, brownish urine, metallic taste, dry mouth, and nausea occur more often. Vertigo, incoordinate ataxia, and paraesthesias have been reported on rare occasions. Tsai et al. observed psychosis which usually disappeared {{within a day or}} two after metronidazole was withdrawn, but tremors and muscle spasm lasted for several days. It has an antabuse-like action and alcohol should be avoided during its use. A transitory leucopenia may occur. Cardiovascular symptoms are rare. Treatment should be discontinued promptly if ataxia or any other symptoms of C.N.S. involvement occur.Only {{a few years ago when}} metronidazole was introduced it was considered to be the last word in the therapy of amoebiasis. However, the recent evidence that this drug is carcinogenic and possibly mutagenic in animals is disturbing. Due to such reports the use of the drug remains controversial, especially as metornidazole is a very widely and commonly used antibiotic. The potential risk in human beings must be weighed against the severity of the disease. The oral dose of 400 mg. thrice daily for 5 days suffices for the treatment of amoebic liver abscess. Adams29 in his analysis of 2,074 cases of liver abscess preferred metronidazole to other amoebicidal agents. A single oral dose of 2.5 G. metronidazole combined with closed aspiration has also produced dramatic response and cure in patients with amoebic liver abscess. Recently the use of intravenous preparation of metronidazole has been reported. Studies by Lazarachick et a revealed presence of anaerobic bacteroides in as many as 26% cases of amoebic liver abscess with so called 'sterile' pus. Intravenous metronidazole is a drug of choice for anaerobic infections Therefore it may be of extra advantage, if used in amoebic liver abscess. Metronidazole should not be used as a single agent for the eradication of bowel infection.33 When used alone, a few cases are known to have developed amoebic liver abscess, months after apparently successful cure of dysentery. Cases refractory to metronidazole have been occasionally described.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>niridazole,</b> an anti-helminthic drug, on cell-mediated immune responses was investigated.

40|$|Sera from {{guinea pigs}} given <b>niridazole,</b> an anti-schistosomal compound, {{have been shown}} to {{reversibly}} block the production of antigen-induced migration inhibitory factor by sensitized guinea pig lymph node cells. Since <b>niridazole</b> itself has no effect in vitro, the blockade of production of migration inhibitory factor is probably due to drug metabolites in the serum. We report here further studies on the mechanism of this drug-induced suppression of cellular hypersensitivity; the data show that <b>niridazole</b> active serum does not block the production of migration inhibitory factor once it has been initiated. Indeed, if <b>niridazole</b> active serum is added a little as 60 sec after the addition of antigen, the lymphocytes will produce migration inhibitory factor. These results suggest the presence of at least two stages in production of migration inhibitory factor after the addition of antigen to lymphocytes. The first, lasting less than 60 sec, is susceptible to blockade by <b>niridazole</b> active serum; the second is not. The elucidation of the mechanism of this blockade should lead to further understanding of the early events after antigen triggering of sensitized lymphocytes...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Administration of <b>niridazole</b> to rats {{poisoned}} with copper {{caused a}} significant increase in both the urinary and biliary excretion of the metal. Although the urinary excretion of iron was increased by the drug, iron excretion was significantly decreased during the drug-induced excretion of copper after copper poisoning.

Polarity and molecular weights of the metal-drug chelates formed in vivo may be the directing forces not only in the selection of the metal for chelation, but also for its urinary or biliary excretion. The laboratory preparation of two copper-niridazole complexes lends support to these conclusions.

This is supported by the ultra violet spectra of the complexes prepared in vitro. The effect of Ambilhar on tissue phosphorus seems to be indirect.

40|$|Eosinophilia is {{frequently}} observed after treatment {{of patients with}} infections due to parasitic helminths. For definition of the characteristics and causes of post-treat-ment eosinophilic responses, 47 patients with Bancroft's filariasis, who were treated with diethylcarbamazine, and eight patients with schistosomiasis mansoni, who were treated with <b>niridazole,</b> were studied. After therapy for eight days, both groups de-veloped significant (P < 0. 05) increases in their levels of eosinophilia, which peaked in two to four weeks. Maximal levels averaged two and one-half to three times the levels before treatment. Before therapy the number of circulating eosinophils was unrelated to intensity of infection in both groups, but after treatment, when the same relationship was examined in the larger group (the patients with filariasis), the de-gree of post-treatment eosinophilia was significantly correlated with the patients' worm burdens before treatment (r = 0. 727; P < 0. 001). Thus, treatment of helminthic infections can provide a unique opportunity for studying eosinophil responses of humans to graded doses of antigen and has shown that acute responses are determined quantitatively {{by the amount of}} antigen initially presented to the host...|$|E
