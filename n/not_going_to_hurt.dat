25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> her.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} July, Maroney competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England. During {{training}} she aggravated {{a previous}} bone break in the big toe of her right foot but she still competed on vault, though she did not {{take part in the}} floor routine as she had hoped. [...] "Bad things happen, you just have {{to make the best of}} it," [...] Maroney said. [...] "It does hurt. It’s broken. How is it <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt?</b> I just try to ignore it and I have worked so hard to be here I can ignore the pain for a little bit." [...] She helped the American team qualify in first place, and individually qualified in first place to the vault final with a score of 15.800.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} process, Hall and the design team took a research trip to Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, where they met a team of DARPA-funded researchers who were pioneering the new field of 'soft robotics' using inflatable vinyl, which ultimately inspired Baymax's inflatable, vinyl, truly huggable design. Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. … It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute he showed me that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot." [...] Hall stated that the technology [...] "will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future, making robots that are very pliable and gentle and <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> people when they pick them up." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Obama Administration testified about similar {{legislation}} in the United States Senate, indicating then that the sanctions could end up being counterproductive by giving the Venezuelan government propaganda material. One {{of the members of}} the opposition coalition against the Venezuelan government, a group called MUD, agreed, saying that [...] "the government's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hurt.</b> On the contrary, they will use this to play the victim, to travel the world and talk about U.S. imperialism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, Dora; don't get ugly," [...] was {{the reply}} {{from the former}} bully of Putnam Hall. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Oh, we {{just came}} in to rest out of the storm,” was the answer, {{in a voice that}} sounded strangely {{familiar}} to Dave. “We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> your shed any, or the cattle either.” ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{has been}} parodied in several episodes of Family Guy in cutaway gags. In [...] "Brian Sings and Swings", Shalit mugs Peter in a cutaway and makes threats using several movie title puns ("Don't Panic Room... I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> William <b>Hurt</b> you. I only want your Tango & Cash. So just Pay it Forward and we'll all be Happy Gilmore!"), which only serves to confuse Peter. In [...] "The Book of Joe", Peter haunts Shalit and his fictional wife Joanne (who is {{identical}} to Shalit himself with a large moustache) by pretending to be the ghost of Roger Ebert. In another episode, Peter obtains the power of transformation and while {{in the form of}} Britney Spears he kisses Justin Timberlake and then turns into Shalit, exclaiming to a horrified Timberlake, [...] "I'm Gene Shalit now! BYE!" [...] In [...] "Big Man on Hippocampus", Peter reads aloud a review that was supposedly written by Shalit.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Dolvett takes Rob {{aside for}} a special adventure: {{repelling}} off a waterfall. While Rob is initially reluctant, Dolvett encourages him to look his fear {{in the face and}} say, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let you <b>hurt</b> me anymore." [...] Dolvett is afraid of heights, so this challenge will enable the two of them to face their fears together. But it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an easy journey. At the practice wall, Rob is terrified and starts crying. After that, Rob doesn't want to do it anymore. Dolvett is well aware that Rob deals with fear in unhealthy ways and is saddened to see Rob break down and storm off. He knows Rob doesn't trust himself, his body or his abilities, and Dolvett is desperate to help him see that his inadequacies are all in his mind. But failure is not an option, and with Dolvett by his side, Rob successfully makes it down the waterfall and feels on top of the world.|$|R
5000|$|Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+, saying “The Kids Rob a Train” lays out {{everything}} {{right there in}} the title. But it’s still a surprisingly tense episode, even though the children are never in any real danger. It reminds me of “Fort Night,” the great Halloween episode with crazy Millie. The kids were never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die that night, and they’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>hurt</b> trying <b>to</b> jump back onto the train. But Bob’s Burgers manages to create suspense in both episodes while still being very, very funny." [...] Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10, saying [...] "Shame that the episode didn’t just stick with the adults as the whole train robbery bit with the kids wasn’t all that exciting. The three gang up with Regular-Sized Rudy who is stuck in the juice caboose while his dad is on a date to liberate the bars of chocolate {{from the front of the}} train. It’s a deeply silly idea and seemed, as ever, just an excuse for the kids to toss off as many weird asides as they could. Though a success in that regard, I probably laughed less at this episode than any of the 14 that preceded it. A better batting average than most sitcoms, to be sure, but a slight disappointment for one of TV’s finest half-hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the lizard}} {{sat down beside}} him in the most {{friendly}} manner, and said: 'Don't be afraid, my good man, I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> you; on the contrary, I am most anxious to help you.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, don't be afraid," [...] said Ralph. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> anybody's feelings. But when I {{first meet}} that man, I hope I {{may be able}} to keep him from knowing what I think of him." ...|$|E
50|$|As Angel {{suddenly}} appears {{during her}} speech she orders her followers to attack him. They do but Angel cuts the sewn {{mouth of the}} Keeper and a long hissing sound is heard. With her name revealed, Jasmine glows and screams are heard as her face switches between her beauty and true form until it settles in the middle. Now with purple eyes and covered in boils Jasmine begs her followers to calm down as they erupt into chaos and despair. Convinced that something has gone terribly wrong, Gunn kicks {{open the door to}} the cage and they head upstairs. Out in the streets of L.A., everything is chaotic and Jasmine is upset that no one is worshipping her anymore. She contacts Connor through one of the cops at the church; Connor runs off to find her. Angel catches up to Jasmine and tells her that she lost. She replies, “There are no absolutes. No right and wrong. Haven’t you learned anything working for the Powers? There are only choices. I offered paradise. You chose this!” He counters that he chose this world because he could; she had taken choice away from everyone. “And look what free will has gotten you,” Jasmine says. Angel responds that free will is what makes humans human; Jasmine points out that he’s not human. “Working on it,” he says. She heads off, wanting to be alone, and Angel says that he’s <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let her <b>hurt</b> anyone else. He lists the things she’s done, pointing out that thousands of people are dead because of her. Jasmine asks how many people will die because Angel stopped world peace. She argues that she murdered thousands in order to save billions, but now the world has to fend for itself. “The price was too high, Jasmine,” Angel says. “Our fate has to be our own, or we’re nothing.” He tells her that everyone has done horrible stuff, but they can make up for it; she doesn’t have the world she wanted, but she can still try to make it better. Jasmine doesn’t want to. She punches Angel off of a bridge and uses a car as a weapon. She tells him that she loved the world and sacrificed everything to be there. Angel counters that she did so in order to run the world. Jasmine says that the other Powers That Be didn’t care the way she did and he knows it.|$|R
5000|$|In May, when Heather, Steve's mother, was {{released}} from Ferncliff and placed into her son's care, Olivia was right away suspicions that Heather was up to no good. Olivia picks up on Heather's strange behavior and thinks she is better off back in Ferncliff. Steve, who is so desperate to believe that his mother has changed and is a good person, does not see through her lies, and does not believe Olivia when she tells him that Heather is not {{as well as she}} seems. When all else fails, Olivia hires Damian Spinelli, a private investigator to look into Heather's misdoings. When Steve finds this out, he is angry, believing that Olivia is acting unfair towards his mother by labelling her as crazy, and their constant arguing and decides that he wants a break from their relationship. Olivia pleads with Steve that she is only trying to protect him from getting hurt by his mom again, and that she loves him. [...] "I love you too, but this isn't working," [...] he says, and walks away as tears stream down Olivia's face. Olivia, still clearly upset over her and Steve's break up, returns to work at the Metro Court and finds Heather in one of the rooms, disguised as a maid. The two argue, yet again and Heather pulls out a syringe that she states is filled with LSD. The two struggle, but Heather ends up stabbing Olivia with the LSD under the orders of Heather's boss and Monica and Sonny's enemy Cesar Faison, just as Dante bursts into the room, he hurriedly takes his mother to General Hospital, which allows Heather to get away. By the time Dante and Olivia arrive at GH, she is having terrifying hallucinations, and she picks up a scalpel, threatening to slit her own throat. Steve is able to talk Olivia down from killing herself by telling her that he finally believes her about his mother, that he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let Heather <b>hurt</b> her again and that he loves her. Olivia, seeming somewhat calmer now, lowers the scalpel long enough for Dante to take it from her hand. She is then, still frantic, put into a straight jacket and taken to a room. Steve then tells Dante it's too soon to know if Olivia will recover from the LSD. Olivia is then sedated, but when she wakes up, continues having occasional hallucinations, almost all of which seem to be predicting what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen in the future, or seeing the truth in things and people that no one else can see from the surface. As Olivia struggles through trying to get back into her life, and dealing with her strage visions, she gets support from Steve, who sticks by her side.|$|R

60|$|Facing {{the mirror}} of the days to come, she tried it on. It was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt.</b> There was no doubt of that. She saw the fatuous, {{approving}} face of the eternal Mrs. Phillips, thrust ever between them, {{against the background of}} that hideous furniture, of those bilious wall papers--the loneliness that would ever walk with her, sit down beside her in the crowded restaurant, steal up the staircase with her, creep step by step with her from room to room--the ever unsatisfied yearning for a tender word, a kindly touch.

6000|$|As {{they emerged}} from the enclosure, {{the girl with the}} fruit basket stood near the gate, looking outward from the wall, her face turned away from the awful home of Tu-Kila-Kila.

6000|$|There {{was a brief}} silence, but the intentness in the men’s {{eyes and}} the {{hardening}} of their lips were significant.
