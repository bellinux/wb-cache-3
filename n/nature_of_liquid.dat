In contrast to this common sense, we propose that two order parameters, namely, density and bond order parameters, are required to describe the phase behavior <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> since they intrinsically tend to form local bonds.

A recent approach by combining a local structure index with potential-energy minimisations allows us to overcome this difficulty. Thus, in this work we extend such study and employ it to quantitatively determine the fraction of structured molecules as a function of temperature for different densities.

The second, called 'crystallography' route, is based on the direct calculation of $S(Q) $ in the reciprocal space from the atomic positions in the simulation box. We describe these two methods and apply them to four disordered systems of increasing complexity. The two approaches yield structures in good agreement to the level of two- and three body correlations; consequently, it has been proven that the 'crystallography route' can also deal perfectly with disordered materials.

A celestial body composed <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> metallic hydrogen brings great promise to astronomy, relative to understanding thermal emission and solar structure. At the same time, as an incom- pressible liquid, a condensed Sun calls into question virtually everything which is cur- rently believed {{with respect to the}} evolution and <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the stars. Should the Sun be condensed, then neutron stars and white dwarfs will fail to reach the enormous densities they are currently believed to possess.

40|$|We present neutron {{spin echo}} {{measurements}} on the structural relaxation of undercooled liquid selenium above glass transition. We find a two-stage relaxation process essentially {{similar to that}} generally observed in liquids, {{except for the fact}} that the slow-stage characteristic time τ 1 varies with the temperature T more slowly than η(T) /T, where η(T) is the macroscopic viscosity. We interpret this apparent discrepancy with respect to the usually found scaling law as the manifestation of the equilibrium-polymer <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> selenium. On the other hand, the data suggest that the Kohlrausch exponent of the slow stage is temperature dependent. Concerning the rapid stage of the relaxation, we show that a possible alternative to the mode-coupling interpretation is to attribute it to the existence of local inhomogeneities of the density close to the glass transition...|$|E

The thermodynamic properties of these effective quantities are analyzed, moreover, the critical temperature, critical pressure and critical volume are obtained.
