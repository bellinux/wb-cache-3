5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible.

25|$|Although GM R (as it {{is known}} in colloquial shorthand) began as an {{organization}} largely built around one man (Kettering), it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them. World War II {{was a turning point}} wherein military affairs, after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years, first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them. Civilian life, too, changed in this direction. By the 1950s, corporations such as GM and many others were facing a new era of R, different from earlier ones. Less about genius inventors and individual inventions, and more about organizational progress and integrated systems, it raised <b>new</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> where the capital for R would come from in an era of limitless demand for R (although not necessarily for production). Alfred Sloan, longtime CEO of GM (1920s to 1960s), discussed in his memoir (also considered a seminal management treatise) the relationships between government, academia, and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science, in light of this new era. The views he laid out reflected (and influenced) wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to today.|$|E

40|$|Spaced seeds {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{studied in the}} homology search field. A spaced seed {{can be regarded as}} a very special type of hash function on k-mers, where two k-mers have the same hash value if and only if they are identical at the w (w <k) positions designated by the seed. Spaced seeds substantially increased the homology search sensitivity. It is then a natural question to ask whether there is a better hash function (called hash seed) that provides better sensitivity than the spaced seed. We study this question in the paper. We propose a strategy to classify amino acids, which leads to a better hash seed. Our results raise a <b>new</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> how to design the best hash seed...|$|R

His feeling for the Cohens, and especially for little Jacob, showed a persistent activity of affection; but these objects had entered into his daily life for years; and Deronda felt it noticeable that Mordecai asked no <b>new</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Mirah, maintaining, indeed, an unusual silence on all subjects, and appearing simply to submit to the changes that were coming over his personal life. He donned the new clothes obediently, but said afterward to Deronda, with a faint smile, [...] "I must keep my old garments by me for a remembrance." [...] And when they were seated, awaiting Mirah, he uttered no word, keeping his eyelids closed, but yet showing restless feeling in his face and hands. In fact, Mordecai was undergoing that peculiar nervous perturbation only known to those whose minds, long and habitually moving with strong impetus in one current, are suddenly compelled into a new or reopened channel. Susceptible people, whose strength has been long absorbed by dormant bias, dread an interview that imperiously revives the past, as they would dread a threatening illness.
