40|$|The {{fast food}} supply chain is facing {{increased}} operating costs due to rising food and energy prices. Based on {{a case study of}} a major fast food logistics operator, this paper uses a metaheuristic evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal combination of low carbon vehicle, powertrain and transport refrigeration technologies that minimise <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>costs</b> for a heterogeneous fleet of heavy goods vehicles operating in the chilled and frozen food sector. Based on the financial and operational constraints of the live case study, the model suggests that rigid trucks should include spray reduction mud-flaps, new generation single-wide tyres, light weighting materials and flywheels. Depending on the duty cycle and fuel used, other additional technologies can further enhance the <b>net</b> <b>present</b> savings. Conventional diesel vehicles can reduce their <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>costs</b> by 10. 25 % and 11. 43 % in urban and regional duty cycles. The model suggested that alternative refrigeration technologies had less potential for reducing costs unless working more than 10 hours per day; however they could make a considerable contribution to lower carbon emissions. As fast food logistic operators have access to used cooking oil, they can buy cheaper biodiesel while reducing GHG emissions by up to 84 %. When comparing a conventional powered rigid truck using DERV with one using B 65, cost savings were estimated to be £ 32, 000 for urban duty cycles and over £ 42, 000 for regional duty cycles per truck over their 5 year lifespans, reducing their CO 2 by 231 and 273 tonnes respectively...|$|R

A dynamic cost minimisation model is used to find the optimal combination of carbon abatement strategies to meet annual emissions targets between 2010 and 2050.

40|$|We {{develop a}} simulation-based meta-heuristic {{approach}} that determines the optimal {{size of a}} hybrid renewable energy system for residential buildings. This multi-objective optimization problem requires the advancement of a dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm that maximizes the renewable energy ratio of buildings and minimizes total <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>cost</b> and CO 2 emission for required system changes. Three proven performance metrics evaluate {{the quality of the}} Pareto front generated by the proposed approach. The obtained results are compared against two reported multi-objective optimization algorithms in the related literature. Finally, an existing residential apartment located in a cold Canadian climate provides a test case to apply the proposed model and optimally size a hybrid renewable energy system. In this test application, the model investigates the potential use of a heat pump, a biomass boiler, wind turbines, solar heat collectors, photovoltaic panels, and a heat storage tank to produce renewable energy for the building. Furthermore, the utilization of plug-in electric vehicles for transportation reduces gasoline use where all power is generated by the building, and the utility provides the means to match intermittent renewable generation from solar and wind to the building electrical loads. Model results show that under the chosen meteorological conditions and building parameters a wind turbine, and plug-in electric vehicle technologies are consistently the optimal option to achieve a target renewable energy ratio. In particular, the optimization result shows that the renewable energy ratio can achieve near 100 % by installing a 73 kW wind turbine, a 200 kW biomass boiler, and using plug-in electric vehicles. This option has a <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>cost</b> of C$ 705, 180 and results in total CO 2 emission of 2. 4 ton/year.

40|$|Abstract:- Off-grid {{settlements}} require efficient, {{reliable and}} cost-effective renewable energy as {{alternative to the}} power supplied by diesel generator. Techno-economic analysis is required to find the optimum renewable energy system in the long run. This paper reviews the application of genetic algorithms in optimization of hybrid system consisting of pico hydro system, solar photovoltaic modules, diesel generator and battery sets. It is intended to maximize the use of renewable system while limiting the use of diesel generator. Daily load demand is assumed constant for derivation of annual load. Power derived from the hybrid {{should be able to}} meet the demand. Local weather data is used and analyzed to assess the technical and economic viability of utilizing the hybrid system. Optimization of the system will be based on the component sizing and the operational strategy. Genetic algorithms programming is used to evaluate both conditions in minimizing the total <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>cost</b> for optimum configuration. Manufacturer data for the hybrid components is used in calculation of sizing to represent actual power derivation.

Assuming equal pest control efficacy, the study calculates the annualized <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>cost</b> per acre of owning and operating each sprayer for ten years using a baseline discount rate of 10 percent over 200 acres of semi-dwarf apple trees.

40|$|Forest {{management}} {{affects the}} quantity of CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere by carbon sequestration in standing biomass, carbon storage in forest products and production of bioenergy that replace fossil fuels. The main question in this paper is whether forest sequestration is worth increasing {{at the expense of}} bioenergy and forest products to achieve EU’s emission reduction target to 2050 cost-effectively. The assessment is based on numerical calculations using a dynamic, partial equilibrium model of cost-effective solutions, where three abatement methods in the forest sector are included together with abatement in the fossil fuel sector. The results show that forest sequestration in standing biomass is cost-effective compared to bioenergy. When sequestration is taken into account, <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>costs</b> for meeting EU carbon targets can be reduced by 18 %. This is achieved through an increase in annual carbon sequestration by 30 - 158 million ton CO 2. The overall cost of reaching the 80 per cent carbon reduction target amounts to 2, 002 billion Euros when sequestration is included in the policy, but increases to 2, 371 billion Euros without sequestration.

The two energy sources can, to some extent, compensate each others minima. The combination of solar and wind should be especially favorable for locations at high latitudes such as Sweden with a very uneven distribution of solar radiation during the year.

The aim was to evaluate the system costs, the cost of energy generated by the PV-Wind-Hybrid systems, the effect of the load size and to what extent the combination of these two energy sources can reduce the costs compared to a PV-alone system. The study has been performed with the simulation tool HOMER developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for techno-economical feasibility studies of hybrid systems. The results from HOMER show that the <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>costs</b> (NPC) for a hybrid system designed for an annual load of 6000 kWh with a capacity shortage of 10 % will vary between $ 48, 000 and $ 87, 000.
