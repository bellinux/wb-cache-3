Toward this end, we propose two axioms on social choice correspondences, Strong <b>Non-Discrimination</b> <b>and</b> Exclusion. Strong <b>Non-Discrimination</b> describes circumstances under which certain coalitions, the losing coalitions, have no influence over social choice. Exclusion requires that there are situations in which certain coalitions, the winning coalitions, can exercise their power. We show that the weak core correspondence is the minimal correspondence satisfying Maskin Monotonicity <b>and</b> Strong <b>Non-Discrimination.</b> We also show that the weak core is the unique correspondence satisfying Nash implementability, Strong <b>Non-Discrimination,</b> <b>and</b> Exclusion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Some {{physicians}} lack {{knowledge and}} awareness about health issues specific to sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals. To help improve this, hospitals have implemented policies that mandate <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>and</b> training to promote sexual and gender minority health. There is limited evidence about how such policies relate to physicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and gender and sexual minority affirmative practices. Method A {{random sample of}} 1000 physicians was recruited from {{a complete list of}} physicians affiliated with one of two university Hospitals located in Tennessee and 180 physicians completed the survey concerning attitudes and knowledge about SGM individuals. Physicians were affiliated with either Hospital A that had not implemented policies for <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>and</b> training, or Hospital B that did. Results Physicians held different attitudes about SGM patients than non-patients. Physicians affiliated with Hospital A held more negative attitudes about SGM individuals who were non-patients than physicians affiliated with Hospital B. There were no differences between the two hospitals in physicians’ attitudes and knowledge about SGM patients. Conclusion Policies that mandate <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>and</b> training as they currently exist may not improve physicians’ attitudes and knowledge about SGM individuals. Additional research is needed to understand how these policies and trainings relate to physicians’ SGM affirmative practices...|$|R
