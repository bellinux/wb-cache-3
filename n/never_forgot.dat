5|$|Perry Como <b>never</b> <b>forgot</b> Canonsburg either. One of {{the things}} he did to give a helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there.

5|$|Brian {{gave his}} own {{daughter}} by his first wife in marriage to Sigtrygg. Brian in turn took as his second wife Sigtrygg's mother, the now thrice-married Gormflaith. The cessation of revolt was followed by over a decade of peace in Dublin while Sigtrygg's men served in the armies of Brian. However, Sigtrygg <b>never</b> <b>forgot</b> the insult of the Ulaid, and in 1002 he had his revenge when his soldiers served in Brian's campaign against the Ulaid and ravaged their lands.|$|E
5|$|Fischer played {{thousands}} of blitz and offhand games with Collins and other strong players, studied {{the books in}} Collins' large chess library, and ate almost as many dinners at Collins' home as his own. Future grandmaster Arnold Denker was also a mentor to young Bobby, often taking him to watch the New York Rangers play hockey at Madison Square Garden. Bobby enjoyed those treats and <b>never</b> <b>forgot</b> them; the two became lifelong friends.|$|E

5|$|Alfred Baker {{lost much}} of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send {{one of his sons}} to college. Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother {{continue}} his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker <b>never</b> <b>forgot.</b> Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to allow his father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I <b>never</b> <b>forgot</b> him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|Queen Gertrude showed blatant favoritism {{towards her}} German {{relatives}} and courtiers, causing widespread discontent among the native lords. Taking {{advantage of her}} husband's campaign in the distant Principality of Halych, a group of aggrieved noblemen seized and murdered her in the forests of the Pilis Hills on 28 September 1213. King Andrew only punished one of the conspirators, a certain Count Peter, after his return from Halych. Although Béla was a child when his mother was assassinated, he <b>never</b> <b>forgot</b> her and declared his deep respect for her in many of his royal charters. In his correspondence with his sister, the noted Franciscan saint, Elizabeth of Hungary, he was often counseled to restrain his anger at the nobles {{for the death of}} their mother.|$|E

5|$|As {{is often}} the case with huge ancient ruins, {{knowledge}} of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people <b>never</b> <b>forgot</b> about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s.|$|E
