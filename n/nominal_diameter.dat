5000|$|Because the [...]22 long rifle round {{commonly}} uses a heeled lead or lightly plated bullet, the <b>nominal</b> bullet <b>diameter</b> {{is larger}} than the <b>nominal</b> bore <b>diameter</b> to prevent excessive lead fouling that can occur when shooting lead bullets that are the same or slightly smaller than the groove diameter. SAAMI specifies a <b>nominal</b> bullet <b>diameter</b> of 0.2255 with a tolerance of -0.004, while the specified bore diameter is 0.222. In practice, 0.224 or slightly larger bullets are common, with barrel groove diameters commonly around 0.223.|$|R
2500|$|The Central London Railway (CLR) {{was given}} {{permission}} in 1891 for a tube line between Shepherd's Bush and a station at Cornhill, {{and the following}} year an extension to Liverpool Street was authorised, with a station at Bank instead of at Cornhill. The line was built following the streets above rather than running underneath buildings, because purchase of wayleave under private properties would have been expensive, {{and as a result}} one line runs above another in places, with platforms at different levels at St Paul's, Chancery Lane and Notting Hill Gate stations. The tunnels were bored with the <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> of , increased on curves, reduced to [...] near to stations.

The CH 4 (90 %) + C 3 H 8 (10 %) hydrate-water interfacial tension (σHW) of 42 ± 3 mJ/m 2 was obtained through the Gibbs-Thomson equation for dissociation within cylindrical pores. With this value, the experimental results were in good agreement with the calculated ones based on the van der Waals and Platteeuw model. A correction term for the capillary effect and a Pitzer model for electrolyte solutions were adopted to calculate the activity {{of water in the}} aqueous electrolyte solutionswithin silica gel pores. At a specified temperature, three-phaseH-LW- Vequilibriumcurves of pore hydrateswere shifted to higher-pressure regions depending on pore sizes and NaCl concentrations.
