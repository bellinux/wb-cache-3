5|$|The company's {{television}} stations, for {{the most}} part <b>non–network</b> affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of Million Dollar Movie, launched by New York's WOR-TV in 1954. In June 1962, RKO General and Zenith Electronics initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's WHCT-TV aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges. However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under FCC pressure. RKO General exited the media business permanently in 1991.|$|E

25|$|For the 1974-75 season, the <b>non-network</b> {{schedule}} was gutted to cut costs.

After Release the World entered into an agreement to buy the station, The Chris Panos Show was added to this rotation. The remaining time after NBC went off the air at 4:30 pm and before the NBC Nightly News at 6:30 pm was filled by a daily movie, with the local evening newscast moving to 7 pm. Close-Up was kept, while Children's World was replaced with The Phil Donahue Show.|$|E

This gave Baton a 57.2 percent controlling interest in the network, triggering a put option allowing the remaining affiliates to sell their CTV shares to Baton without selling their stations, which they did. Baton was now full owner of the CTV network and immediately began plastering the CTV brand across its stations, even on <b>non-network</b> programming, and dropped its secondary Baton Broadcast System (BBS) brand. The company changed its name to CTV Inc. in 1998, and eventually acquired two of the final three large-market stations, CKY and CFCF (it replaced the third, CHAN, as discussed below).|$|E
2500|$|By the fall, WHFV was in dire straits. Beginning Labor Day 1974, {{it became}} {{little more than}} a {{pass-through}} for NBC, as nearly all syndicated programs besides news and Donahue were removed from the schedule. The station filled out its schedule during <b>non-network</b> hours with a daily 4:30 pm movie, an unusually timed 7 pm local newscast, and one low-rent syndicated show in the 7:30 pm slot. Realizing the station was on the brink, Television Fredericksburg began advertising nationally for a buyer and had to resort to short-term loans to continue operations, but was not bringing in the money to pay them back and slipped into default. The Free-Lance Star reported that the station had been sued for more than $1 million owed to five local banks, two equipment lessors, and the IRS, in addition to reporting operating losses of $207,000 year-to-date in October 1974. One potential sale to Fairfax County businessman Charles Henry Smith, Jr. fell through in September. Smith expressed his opinion that the operation could turn a profit in several years, and its fatal mistake was going on the air without accounting for this; it clearly did not have enough cash on hand to survive even a year of losses.|$|E

40|$|Detectability of {{discrete}} event systems, {{the ability to}} determine the current and subsequent states, {{is very important in}} supervisory control and many other applications. So far only detectability of <b>non-networked</b> discrete event systems has been defined and investigated. <b>Non-networked</b> discrete event systems assume all the communication to be carried out on time without any delays or losses. The assumption of reliable link is true when the distance of communication is short; however, it is often violated in networked systems. In my dissertation, I investigate the detectability for the networked discrete event systems. Because applications vary, we investigate the four types of the network detectabilities: detectability, strong detectability, periodic detectability, and strong periodic detectability. In addition, I will investigate the network D-detectability, which is the ability to just distinguish certain pairs of states. As in <b>non-networked</b> discrete event systems, I will extend the network detectability to network I-Detectability, and network Co-detectability. Network I-detectability is defined as the ability of determining the initial state of the system after finite numbers of event of observations when the system is subject to communication delays and losses. Network Co-detectability, on the other hand, is defined as the ability of determining the current state and subsequent states of the system with at least one agent under communication delays losses. In each case, I will define and prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the detectabilities if possible. In some cases, methods to check types of network detectabilities are developed. Examples are also given to illustrate different types of results...|$|R
