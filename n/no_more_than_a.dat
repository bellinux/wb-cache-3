5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few hops.|$|E
5|$|Even {{classical}} historians, {{who were}} writing only {{years after the}} events themselves, seem to be divided {{as to what the}} motives of Spartacus were. Appian and Florus write that he intended to march on Rome itself—although this may have been <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> week or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors.

The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E

5|$|Small-scale, {{transient}} supercells {{embedded within}} the outer bands {{of the hurricane}} produced numerous tornadoes throughout its path. Unlike supercells over the Great Plains, these storms last <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few hours and are often training. Most of the tornadoes occurred in the hurricane's right-front quadrant, where strong low-level wind shear, high moisture content, and low convective available potential energy combined to produce locally favorable tornadic conditions.

The Santo Domingo International Airport suspended all flight operations on the morning of August16.

5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{eggs are}} usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests are <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention for <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
