5|$|The Delichon martins have simple flight {{calls of}} one to three <b>notes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> two more {{widespread}} species these have a distinctive buzzing quality. The male's song is a short simple ripple, perhaps less musical than that given by other swallows.|$|E
5|$|Artwork for Arthur {{was created}} by Bob Lawrie. The album was {{packaged}} in a gatefold sleeve, and included a shaped insert depicting Queen Victoria (holding a house containing Arthur Morgan), with lyrics on the reverse. Liner <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK were written by Geoffrey Cannon and Julian Mitchell; in the US, notes by rock critic John Mendelsohn replaced Cannon's.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, the Kampfgruppe Auschwitz (Combat Group Auschwitz) was {{organized}} {{with the aim}} of sending out information about what was happening. Sonderkommandos buried <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground, hoping they would be found by the camp's liberators. The group also smuggled out photographs of corpses and preparations for mass killings in mid-1944.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, Elmore named {{their new}} stand at Horsdon Park after Stansfield, {{ahead of a}} game against Hengrove Athletic. The match {{attracted}} over 100 fans, ahead of a usual average of 35. From 2011 to 2015, an aeroplane belonging to Flybe bore an image of Stansfield, with other aeroplanes belonging to the company featuring such former footballers as George Best and Kevin Keegan. In 2015, Stansfield was featured on £5 Exeter Pound <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the policy}} of the Bank of England to redeem all {{withdrawn}} notes for current currency at the face value shown on the note, except for counterfeit currency. Examples of counterfeits from Operation Bernhard have appeared at auction and been sold through dealers for a higher face value than the original £5. There are also examples of the <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> museum of the National Bank of Belgium and the Bank of England Museum.|$|E

5|$|Although Orion has a {{few lines}} in both Homeric poems and in the Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E

Also usually the last note of a [...] melodic formula is a perfect fifth below the first tenor note.|$|R
5|$|Schubert's famous String Quintet {{was written}} in September 1828, {{together}} with the final versions of the sonatas. The slow movements of the quintet and the B-flat Sonata bear striking similarities in their main sections: both employ the same unique textural layout, in which two-three voices sing long <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle register, accompanied by the contrasted, short pizzicato notes of the other voices, in the lower and upper registers; in both movements, the long notes over the relentless ostinato rhythm, convey an atmosphere of complete stillness, of arrest of all motion and time. String quintet textures also appear elsewhere, throughout the sonata trilogy.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of placing prayer <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Wall {{has also been}} adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths. Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a kvitel in the Western Wall include Pope John Paul II in 2000, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008, and U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann in 2012. Pope Francis inserted a handwritten Spanish language text of the Lord's Prayer in the Wall during his visit in 2014. On May 22, 2017, Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Wall; he also inserted a note.|$|E

5|$|WHO has {{set out a}} {{strategy}} for traditional medicines with four objectives: to integrate them as policy into national healthcare systems; to provide knowledge and guidance on their safety, efficay, and quality; to increase their availability and affordability; and to promote their rational, therapeutically sound usage. WHO <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strategy that countries are experiencing seven challenges to such implementation, namely in developing and enforcing policy; in integration; in safety and quality, especially in assessment of products and qualification of practitioners; in controlling advertising; in research and development; in education and training; and in the sharing of information.|$|E

25|$|Accented <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orchestra, {{particularly}} in the strings, reflect the annoyance of Otello at having his sleep disturbed. Notes played piano and pizzicato by the strings accompany Iago's account of the events, giving his account a feeling of false remorse and unhappiness. Upon Otello's orders, the disturbed islanders return to their homes, accompanied by legato <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper strings and woodwinds depicting the calm that has once more been reestablished.|$|E
