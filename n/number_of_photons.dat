25|$|A very {{important}} {{difference between a}} gas of massive particles and a photon gas with a black body distribution is that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> in {{the system is not}} conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This electron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an individual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of the emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons will vary. It can be shown that, {{as a result of this}} lack of constraint on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> in the system, the chemical potential of the photons must be zero for black body radiation.|$|E
25|$|By {{lining the}} light {{receiving}} {{surface of the}} cell with nano-sized metallic studs, {{the efficiency of the}} cell can be substantially increased, as the light reflects off these studs at an oblique angle to the cell, increasing the length of the path the light takes through the cell, thereby increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> absorbed by the cell, and so also the amount of current generated.|$|E
25|$|A massive {{ideal gas}} {{with only one}} type of {{particle}} is uniquely described by three state functions such as the temperature, volume, {{and the number of}} particles. However, for a black body, the energy distribution is established by the interaction of the photons with matter, usually the walls of the container. In this interaction, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> is not conserved. As a result, the chemical potential of the black body photon gas is zero. The number of state variables needed to describe a black body state is thus reduced from three to two (e.g. temperature and volume).|$|E
5000|$|To force this {{alternative}} emission to occur, an incident photon must strike the fluorophore. This {{need to be}} struck by an incident photon has two implications for STED. First, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> incident <b>photons</b> directly impacts the efficiency of this emission, and, secondly, with sufficiently large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> fluorescence can be completely suppressed. [...] To achieve the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> incident <b>photons</b> needed to suppress fluorescence, the laser used to generate the <b>photons</b> must be <b>of</b> a high intensity. Unfortunately, this high intensity laser {{can lead to the}} issue of photobleaching the fluorophore. Photobleaching is the name for the destruction of fluorophores by high intensity light.|$|R

25|$|In the BB84 {{protocol}} Alice sends quantum {{states to}} Bob using single photons. In practice many implementations use laser pulses attenuated {{to a very}} low level to send the quantum states. These laser pulses contain a very small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons,</b> for example 0.2 photons per pulse, which are distributed according to a Poissonian distribution. This means most pulses actually contain no photons (no pulse is sent), some pulses contain 1 photon (which is desired) and a few pulses contain 2 or more photons. If the pulse contains more than one photon, then Eve can split off the extra photons and transmit the remaining single photon to Bob. This {{is the basis of}} the photon number splitting attack, where Eve stores these extra photons in a quantum memory until Bob detects the remaining single photon and Alice reveals the encoding basis. Eve can then measure her photons in the correct basis and obtain information on the key without introducing detectable errors.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time before}} the {{discovery}} of quantum mechanics people realized that the connection between light waves and photons must be of a statistical character. What they did not clearly realize, however, was that the wave function gives information about the probability of one photon being in a particular place and not the probable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> in that place. The importance of the distinction can be made clear in the following way. Suppose we have {{a beam of light}} consisting of a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> split up into two components of equal intensity. On the assumption that the beam is connected with the probable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>photons</b> in it, we should have half the total number going into each component. If the two components are now made to interfere, we should require a photon in one component to be able to interfere with one in the other. Sometimes these two photons would have to annihilate one another and other times they would have to produce four photons. This would contradict the conservation of energy. The new theory, which connects the wave function with probabilities for one photon gets over the difficulty by making each photon go partly into each of the two components. Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between two different photons never occurs.Paul Dirac, The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1 ...|$|E
