40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to bilateral negotiation in which the dispute is between only two parties. However, automated multilateral negotiation in which more than two negotiating parties need to reach a joint agreement, has received relatively less attention, even though such negotiations are required in many circumstances (e. g. a group of managers making a joint decision for their company investments, a group of friends planning their holiday together). In such cases, automated <b>negotiation</b> <b>tools</b> can play a key role in providing effective solutions. One of the important issues in designing such <b>negotiation</b> <b>tools,</b> is to decide on the protocol that governs the interaction between parties and determines when the final agreement will be reached. In this paper, we focus on and investigate different mediator-based protocols for multilateral negotiations. We take [3] as a starting point and propose a variant of this protocol.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} advance our {{understanding}} of health policy agenda setting and formulation processes in a lower middle income country, Ghana, by exploring how and why maternal health policies and programmes appeared and evolved on the health sector programme of work agenda between 2002 and 2012. We theorized that {{the appearance of a}} policy or programme on the agenda and its fate within the programme of work is predominately influenced by how national level decision makers use their sources of power to define maternal health problems and frame their policy narratives. National level decision makers used their power sources as <b>negotiation</b> <b>tools</b> to frame maternal health issues and design maternal health policies and programmes {{within the framework of the}} national health sector programme of work. The power sources identified included legal and structural authority; access to authority by way of political influence; control over and access to resources (mainly financial); access to evidence in the form of health sector performance reviews and demographic health surveys; and knowledge of national plans such as Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy. Understanding of power sources and their use as <b>negotiation</b> <b>tools</b> in policy development should not be ignored in the pursuit of transformative change and sustained improvement in health systems in low- and middle income countries (LMIC). </p...|$|E

Automotive {{industry}} {{is at the}} vanguard of creating a lean supply chain, whose practices are geared toward maintaining minimal inventory and streamlining all facets of the supply chain management process. The strategy includes {{a constant stream of}} just-in-time supply to car manufacturers through mixed loading of components with high frequency of pick-up and delivery, which is challenging the logistics operations. Therefore, manufacturers in automotive industry tend to outsource their logistics. Mathematical models and solution procedures are proposed in this paper to support logistics planning in automotive industry when there is constraint on delivery intervals. They may also be used as decision aids to outsource the logistics function, as <b>negotiation</b> <b>tools,</b> as joint planning tools, and/or as evaluation tools for continuous improvement...|$|E

How to make everyone a winner is the key problem we need to resolve in requirement negotiation. The existing WinWin based Requirements <b>Negotiation</b> <b>Tools</b> like EasyWinWin, ARENA, ARENA-M have proven to be highly efficient in the initial requirement acquisition. However, it has been less easy to adapt to the evolving nature of requirements, and to provide the flexibility for stakeholders, especially the clients, to easily share knowledge and update the win conditions and agreements as a project proceeds. Wiki provides a flexible platform for asynchronous collaboration to create content in general. We can take advantage of wiki in requirement negotiation. Based on wiki, we defined a method to negotiate WIOAs of WinWin model, which is called WikiWinWin. The main strength of WikiWinWin are that it can effectively support the WinWin requirements negotiation approach and easy to exchange ideas and share knowledge among stakeholders. We have also developed two versions of WikiWinWin negotiation tool. TWikiWinWin, which is developed on TWiki, defines the main process of WikiWinWin negotiation. JSPWikiWinWin is developed on JSPWiki, and it improves the WikiWinWin negotiation, including automation of content management, extendability and database support. This paper also describes the design of JSPWikiWinWin. It takes advantage of JspWiki plugins to let it support winwin process.

40|$|Abstract The {{traditional}} policing {{model is}} often said to focus excessively on the means of policing instead of on effectiveness. Other policing philosophies, such as community-oriented and information-led policing, attempt to remedy this shortcoming. Various mathematical police deployment models were developed over time to assist police administrators, with performance indicators that neatly fit into the traditional model. In this changed environment their value and usability suddenly seem questionable. Through for the Belgian police zone VLAS (a mid-sized local police district), it is illustrated how such techniques still were useful for a successful transition towards a COP and ILP framework. The methodology allowed us to remove uncertainties, prematurely eliminate overseen deficiencies in proposals, serve as a communication and <b>negotiation</b> <b>tool</b> to lower resistance and to better use scarce resources. The methodology also provided management afterwards, with a control mechanism to identify causes of unexpected deviations.
