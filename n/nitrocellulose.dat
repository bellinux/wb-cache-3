5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and <b>nitrocellulose.</b> They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials {{can also be used}} as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powder, based on nitroglycerine or <b>nitrocellulose,</b> by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E
5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for <b>nitrocellulose,</b> acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of <b>nitrocellulose</b> film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E
25|$|Camphor {{is used as}} a {{plasticizer}} for <b>nitrocellulose,</b> {{an ingredient}} for fireworks and explosive munitions.|$|E
25|$|The most {{probable}} cause of Air France Flight 406 crashing was sabotage with a <b>nitrocellulose</b> explosive.|$|E
25|$|The {{latter half}} of the 19th century saw the {{invention}} of nitroglycerin, <b>nitrocellulose</b> and smokeless powders which soon replaced black powder in many applications.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the textile industry, cotton is used in fishing nets, coffee filters, tents, explosives manufacture (see <b>nitrocellulose),</b> cotton paper, and in bookbinding. The first Chinese paper was made of cotton fiber. Fire hoses were once made of cotton.|$|E
25|$|Many commercially {{important}} polymers are synthesized by {{chemical modification}} of naturally occurring polymers. Prominent {{examples include the}} reaction of nitric acid and cellulose to form <b>nitrocellulose</b> {{and the formation of}} vulcanized rubber by heating natural rubber in the presence of sulfur.|$|E
25|$|By August 1940, the War Office {{produced}} training {{instructions for}} the creation and use of Molotov cocktails. The instructions suggested scoring the bottles vertically with a diamond to ensure breakage and providing fuel-soaked rag, windproof matches or a length of cinema film (made of highly flammable <b>nitrocellulose)</b> {{as a source of}} ignition.|$|E
25|$|Western {{blotting}} is {{a process}} by which proteins separated in the acrylamide gel are electrophoretically transferred to a stable, manipulable membrane such as a <b>nitrocellulose,</b> nylon, or PVDF membrane. It is then possible to apply immunochemical techniques to visualise the transferred proteins, as well as accurately identify relative increases or decreases of the protein of interest.|$|E
25|$|DuPont {{continued}} to expand, {{moving into the}} production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments. The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted {{in the creation of}} the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel). At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base <b>nitrocellulose</b> powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining <b>nitrocellulose</b> and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.|$|E
25|$|Coatings. Clear {{coatings}} {{preserve the}} natural color, warmth and metallic tone of copper alloys. However, particularly on exterior applications, they introduce maintenance {{into what is}} naturally a maintenance-free material. They are organic chemicals that are dry at ambient temperatures or require heat for curing or solvent evaporation. Examples of clear organic coatings include alkyd, acrylic, cellulose acetate butyrate, epoxy, <b>nitrocellulose,</b> silicone, and urethane. Further details are available.|$|E
25|$|Other {{flammable}} liquids such as diesel fuel, methanol, turpentine, jet fuel, and isopropyl alcohol {{have been used}} in place of, or combined with petrol. Thickening agents such as solvents, foam polystyrene, baking soda, petroleum jelly, tar, strips of tyre tubing, <b>nitrocellulose,</b> XPS foam, motor oil, rubber cement, detergent and dish soap have been added to help the burning liquid adhere to the target and create clouds of thick, choking smoke.|$|E
25|$|Goddard {{described}} extensive {{experiments with}} solid-fuel rocket engines burning high grade <b>nitrocellulose</b> smokeless powder. A critical breakthrough {{was the use}} of the steam turbine nozzle invented by the Swedish inventor Gustaf de Laval. The de Laval nozzle allows the most efficient (isentropic) conversion of the energy of hot gases into forward motion. By means of this nozzle, Goddard increased the efficiency of his rocket engines from 2 percent to 64 percent and obtained supersonic exhaust velocities of over Mach 7.|$|E
25|$|A {{protease}} specific {{protein array}} based on immobilized antibodies designed to capture specific proteases from biological samples offers {{a step up}} in analysis of protein levels beyond transcript expression. Capture antibodies spotted to <b>nitrocellulose</b> membranes can bind proteases in complex mixtures which have been pre-incubated and bound by detection antibodies allowing for parallel analysis of relative protease levels. These arrays offer parallelization of protein levels over traditional western blot. Unfortunately, these assays fail to provide insight on enzymatic function for proteases and suffer similar drawbacks to western blots regarding reliable quantification.|$|E
25|$|Traditional DNA {{sequencing}} {{techniques such}} as Maxam-Gilbert or Sanger methods used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used {{in the field of}} immunology and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or isoforms of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a <b>nitrocellulose</b> or PVDF membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a western blot.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works began {{producing}} {{smokeless powder}} for firearms ammunition {{in the early}} 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared at Santa Cruz {{under the direction of}} assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of <b>nitrocellulose</b> and nitroglycerine. Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW Smokeless powder and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid cartridge case corrosion caused by picric acid in the Peyton Powder.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works {{manufactured}} powder for naval artillery. Initial {{production was}} prismatic brown powder, and the works later obtained {{a license to}} produce The United States Navy's patented <b>nitrocellulose</b> smokeless powder. Both powders were used by the Pacific and Asiatic Fleets, and for Pacific harbor and coast defense. The powder works operated a proving ground at Santa Cruz beginning 1892 using guns provided by the United States Inspector of Ordnance. Individual powder lots were test fired in the guns {{for which they were}} intended, including a 57mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss, a 6"/45 caliber Quick-Fire Rifle Model 1897, and an 8"/32 caliber Breech-Loading Rifle Model 1888.|$|E
25|$|The {{separated}} fragments {{are then}} transferred to a <b>nitrocellulose</b> or nylon filter; this procedure is called a Southern blot. The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are denatured. Radiolabeled probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called variable number tandem repeat sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.|$|E
25|$|The {{vesicular}} transport assay detects the translocation {{of molecules}} by ABC transporters. Membranes prepared under suitable conditions contain inside-out oriented vesicles with the ATP binding site and substrate binding {{site of the}} transporter facing the buffer outside. Substrates of the transporter are taken up into the vesicles in an ATP dependent manner. Rapid filtration using glass fiber filters or <b>nitrocellulose</b> membranes are used to separate the vesicles from the incubation solution and the test compound trapped inside the vesicles is retained on the filter. The quantity of the transported unlabelled molecules is determined by HPLC, LC/MS, LC/MS/MS. Alternatively, the compounds are radiolabeled, fluorescent or have a fluorescent tag so that the radioactivity or fluorescence retained on the filter can be quantified.|$|E
25|$|Glass solders are {{available}} as frit powder with grain size below 60 micrometers. They can be mixed with water or alcohol {{to form a}} paste for easy application, or with dissolved <b>nitrocellulose</b> or other suitable binder for adhering to the surfaces until being melted. The eventual binder has to be burned off before melting proceeds, requiring careful firing regime. The solder glass can be also applied from molten state {{to the area of}} the future joint during manufacture of the part. Due to their low viscosity in molten state, lead glasses with high PbO content (often 70–85%) are frequently used. The most common compositions are based on lead borates (leaded borate glass or borosilicate glass). Smaller amount of zinc oxide or aluminium oxide can be added for increasing chemical stability. Phosphate glasses can be also employed. Zinc oxide, bismuth trioxide, and copper(II) oxide can be added for influencing the thermal expansion; unlike the alkali oxides, these lower the softening point without increasing of thermal expansion.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically <b>nitrocellulose</b> or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Dailly was {{the scene}} of an {{ammunition}} explosion on 28 May, 1946, when about 5500 105mm shells, amounting to 449 tons, exploded in three separate magazines successively. The blast threw four 105mm guns from their emplacements and damaged six more. Six construction workers were killed, part of a crew working on a funicular shaft linking Dailly to the upper part of Savatan. The explosion was attributed to decomposition of <b>nitrocellulose</b> propellant. Two similar explosions happened at Grisons in June 1946 and at Blausee-Mitholz in 1947, without loss of life. The damage to Dailly resulted in a comprehensive modernization of the fort, with additions of 81mm and 120mm mortars, removal of obsolete weapons and the installation of two modern 150mm gun turrets. An underground caserne for 650 men was built at this time, with NBC protection. The four 105mm guns of the northern casemates and the two 105mm guns of the central casemate were repaired and upgraded, but the four guns of the south battery were never replaced. The new 150mm gun turrets were mounted on barbettes deep, with an individual rate of fire of 22 rounds per minute in bursts, or 15 rounds per minute sustained. Design began in 1949, with the first test firings in 1960.|$|E
500|$|Mk V: Similar to the Mk IV, {{but with}} {{cylinders}} [...] wider {{to allow for}} the use of <b>nitrocellulose</b> propellant-based cartridges. Officially adopted 9 December 1913, with a [...] barrel, although some models produced in 1915 had [...] and [...] barrels.|$|E
500|$|The early {{motion picture}} {{industry}} primarily used <b>nitrocellulose</b> film stock, commonly called nitrate film. This film is flammable, and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns. Nitrate fires burn rapidly, and cannot typically be extinguished, capable of burning even underwater. Additionally, <b>nitrocellulose</b> {{is subject to}} thermal decomposition and hydrolysis, breaking down over time {{in the presence of}} high temperatures and moisture. This decaying film stock releases nitrogen oxides that themselves contribute to the decay and make the damaged film burn more easily. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can even spontaneously combust. In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film, there is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances necessary for self-ignition. Sustained temperatures of [...] or higher, large quantities of nitrate film, increased humidity, poor ventilation, and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors. Most such fires in film archives have taken place in heat waves during summer months, in closed facilities with limited ventilation, exacerbating several of these variables. Especially in confined areas, such fires can result in explosions.|$|E
500|$|While the calibre of {{the main}} battery {{remained}} quite constant, {{the performance of the}} guns improved as longer barrels were introduced. The introduction of slow-burning <b>nitrocellulose</b> and cordite propellant allowed the employment of a longer barrel, and therefore higher muzzle velocity—giving greater range and penetrating power for the same calibre of shell. Between the Majestic class and Dreadnought, the length of the British 12-inch gun increased from 35 calibres to 45 and muzzle velocity increased from [...] per second to [...] per second.|$|E
500|$|The Fundación Patrimonio Fílmico Colombiano is conserving and {{restoring}} the first <b>nitrocellulose</b> recordings of Colombian films, {{as well as}} some earlier Columbian films.

500|$|On 16 February 1910, during {{exercises}} in the Gulf of Jouan, a torpedo was accidentally launched from her sister ship Patrie. The torpedo struck République, damaging her hull. On 25 September 1911, the battleship Liberté was moored near Republique in Toulon. An accidental explosion, {{the result of the}} spontaneous combustion of <b>nitrocellulose</b> gel, occurred aboard Liberté; she was destroyed and debris was hurled into the air. République was hit by a [...] piece of armor plate from Liberté, on the starboard quarter directly behind the main battery turret.|$|E
500|$|Before {{and during}} World War I, the gun used about [...] of RP C/12 (Rohr-Pulver– tube powder) {{propellant}} {{that was a}} mix of <b>nitrocellulose,</b> nitroglycerin and small amounts of other additives with a calorific value of 950 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2975 [...] kelvins. In World War II, it was replaced by RP C/38 that substituted diethylene glucol dinitrite for the nitroglycerine which had a calorific value of 810 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2495 K. This had the virtue of being harder to ignite, lessening {{the risk of a}} catastrophic fire or explosion, and reduced the erosive effects of the gaseous propellant on the gun's bore. Sources differ on the amount of RP C/38 used by the gun during World War II; Campbell says , but Hogg says [...]|$|E
500|$|Little Boy was {{developed}} by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group of Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer. The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb. Like Thin Man, it was a gun-type fission weapon, but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235, whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239. Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium (the [...] "bullet") onto a solid cylinder of the same material (the [...] "target") {{by means of a}} charge of <b>nitrocellulose</b> propellant powder. It contained [...] of enriched uranium, of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission. Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design.|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Little Ferry facility spurred an interest in fire safety as an aspect of film preservation. Unlike previous large nitrate film fires, the spontaneous combustion of decomposing film stock {{was determined to be}} responsible. Investigators suggested that the older <b>nitrocellulose</b> film stored in the archive was of lower quality than then-current film and thus more prone to instability. The Society of Motion Picture Engineers's Committee on Preservation of Film, three months after the vault fire, cited [...] "recent and rather extensive film fires" [...] as evidence that existing preservation efforts had failed to adequately address the [...] "fire problem". More heavily reinforced film vaults were suggested, to prevent fires in a single vault from destroying entire archival facilities. Film storage cabinets with ventilation and cooling systems were also proposed, as was further research into improving the quality of cellulose acetate film to encourage its use as a safer replacement for nitrate film.|$|E
500|$|Vérités {{first major}} {{assignment}} was received in late July 1908, {{a month after}} she joined the French fleet. She carried the President of France Armand Fallières to Reval, Russia, arriving on 27 July. There, Fallières visited with the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, who inspected Vérité. She joined Liberté and Justice for {{a visit to the}} United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in September 1909. The three ships, representing France during the celebrations and commanded by Admiral Jules le Pord, were the first foreign ships to arrive. The ships departed from Brest and reached New York seven days later, having run at an average of the performance of the ships' propulsion systems was regarded as satisfactory by contemporary naval experts, including the United States Naval Institute. In early 1911, the French Navy conducted experiments with wireless telegraphy, and used Vérité and Justice for the tests. The wireless transmitters could pick up messages as far as [...] away. On 25 September 1911, Liberté was destroyed by an accidental explosion in Toulon, the result of the spontaneous combustion of <b>nitrocellulose</b> gel in her ammunition magazines. Debris hurled by the explosion damaged several nearby battleships, including Vérité.|$|E
2500|$|The Mk VII (and later Mk VIII) rounds have {{versions}} utilizing [...] <b>nitrocellulose</b> flake powder smokeless propellants. The <b>nitrocellulose</b> versions—first {{introduced in}} World War I—were designated with a [...] "Z" [...] postfix indicated after the type (e.g. Mark VIIZ, with a weight of 175 grains) and in headstamps.|$|E
2500|$|One major {{difference}} between <b>nitrocellulose</b> and PVDF membranes relates {{to the ability of}} each to support [...] "stripping" [...] antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes. [...] While there are well-established protocols available for stripping <b>nitrocellulose</b> membranes, the sturdier PVDF allows for easier stripping, and for more reuse before background noise limits experiments. [...] Another difference is that, unlike <b>nitrocellulose,</b> PVDF must be soaked in 95% ethanol, isopropanol or methanol before use. PVDF membranes also tend to be thicker and more resistant to damage during use.|$|E
2500|$|British and German {{propellant}} charges {{differed in}} packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula of 37% <b>nitrocellulose,</b> 58% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. It {{was a good}} propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The petroleum jelly served as both a lubricant and a stabiliser. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% <b>nitrocellulose,</b> 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also shed micro-dust particles of <b>nitrocellulose</b> and iron pyrite. [...] While cordite propellant was manageable, it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships' magazines.|$|E
