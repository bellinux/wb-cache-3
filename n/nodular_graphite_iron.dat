Shells of rolls are made of high chromium steel and for cores a combination of pherlitic – ferritic <b>nodular</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>iron</b> is used. Due to compression loading of rolls, where slabs are reduced to the long stripes, special specimens have been used and tested under compression loading conditions.

The residual stresses {{as a consequence of}} mechanical and thermal treatment of rolls (specimens) are considered during experimental determination of treated material parameters and are not taken into account in the subsequent calculation procedures. The tests specimens have been loaded with pure pulsating compression load (load ratio R= 0 in compression) at different load levels. Therefore, a typical S-N curve and appropriate fatigue parameters (fatigue strength coefficient σf’ and fatigue strength exponent b) are determined.

30|$|For the {{analyzed}} {{tensile test}} on <b>nodular</b> <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron,</b> unknown boundary conditions and plastic parameters have been identified. By performing sensitivity analyses, it is shown that {{only some of}} the parameters can be identified for a given uncertainty. This {{is due to the fact}} that only a very limited number of scans is available for the reported analyses. However, even under these very difficult conditions, it is possible to carry out identifications with rather low uncertainties. Further, the verification analyses also show that most of the errors are due to the fact that measured (i.e., noisy) boundary conditions are prescribed on the numerical model. Yet, the identification results are virtually insensitive to the quality of the mesh because the geometry of the tested sample is very simple. In the present analyses the boundary conditions were measured and directly applied to the finite element model to compute kinematic bases. However, the boundary conditions may themselves become part of the set of unknowns. The present framework is suitable to such extensions.|$|R

To determine the geometry of the averaged Voronoi polyhedron, Kolmogorov statistical theory of crystallisation was applied. The principles of a differential mathematical formulation of this problem were discussed.

For investigations, a differential scanning calorimeter, type Multi HTC S 60, was used. During heating, three endothermic effects related with pearlite decomposition, phase transformation α → γ, and carbon dissolution in austenite were observed on a DSC diagram. During cooling, two exothermic effects related with phase transformation γ→ α and pearlite formation were observed to consecutively take place on a DSC diagram. The values of the enthalpy of these processes differ and depend on the initial microstructure of the examined samples. The metallic matrix in 5 mm sample after the process of heating and cooling changes totally in favour of ferrite. The same effect, though less advanced in intensity, takes place in 10 mm sample, while in 15 and 20 mm samples the matrix constitution remains unchanged.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{the present}} study is to {{illustrate}} the full integration of sensor and imaging data into numerical procedures for the purpose of identification of constitutive laws and their validation. The feasibility of such approaches is proven in the context of in situ tests monitored by tomography. The bridging tool consists of spatiotemporal (i. e., 4 D) analyses with dedicated (integrated) correlation algorithms. A tensile test on <b>nodular</b> <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron</b> sample is performed within a lab tomo-graph. The reconstructed volumes are registered by resorting to integrated digital volume correlation (DVC) that incorporates a finite element modeling of the test, thereby performing a mechanical integration in 4 D registration of a series of 3 D images.

Convergence studies can thus be performed in which the quality of the discretization is controlled both for the simulation and the registration. Incremental DVC analyses are carried out with the scans acquired during the in situ mechanical test. For DVC, the mesh size results from a compromise between measurement uncertainties and its spatial resolution. Conversely, a numerically good mesh may reveal too fine for the considered material microstructure.
