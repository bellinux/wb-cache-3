The actual site of the castle may also have been important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, also appears to have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E

However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{technological}} progress and economic change, many <b>new</b> <b>occupations</b> have emerged in the labour market, while others have become redundant and disappeared. Along with these <b>new</b> and emerging <b>occupations,</b> <b>new</b> skills have been introduced that can be developed through formal education, on-the-job training or learning-by-doing (or in some other way). This paper presents the Occupations Observatory, which we have created {{with the aim of}} providing up-to-date information on these changes in the labour market – reflected in the rise of <b>new</b> <b>occupations</b> and their corresponding skill changes – to policy-makers, researchers, educational institutes, job seekers and many other stakeholders (and how occupational dynamics feed into the occupational classification schemes).

Funded by the European Union’s 7 th Framework Programme for Research, the InGRID project (Inclusive Growth Research Infrastructure Diffusion) involves 17 European partners, including CEPS.

500|$|Early on, {{conditions}} in the hospice were rudimentary, consisting only of a table, some chairs, a stove, and a few beds for the mothers (called [...] "penitents"), with Cadron-Jetté herself sleeping on the floor. The attic could only be reached by a ladder on {{the exterior of the}} house and was not insulated. For this reason, Cadron-Jetté's <b>new</b> <b>occupation</b> was unpopular with her (now mature) children, who objected to the conditions of dire poverty in the Hospice and attempted to dissuade her from her new calling, on one occasion {{going so far as to}} begin moving her belongings out of the Hospice. Despite this, Cadron-Jetté persevered, expanding the Hospice's operations to provide accommodation for up to seven or eight women at a time, and, from July 1845, taking on an additional caregiver. [...] This caregiver was Sophie Raymond née Desmarets, herself a widow, who in addition to helping with the mothers, undertook fundraising activities on behalf of the hospice. [...] Through the combined efforts of Raymond and Bourget, the Hospice attracted the attentions of Antoine-Olivier Berthelet, a wealthy philanthropist, who provided money, food and firewood, and later contributed to the building of facilities for the Misericordia Sisters on Dorchester Boulevard.|$|E

2500|$|During the Age of Enlightenment, advancements {{in science}} {{ushered in a}} <b>new</b> <b>occupation</b> of [...] "wine doctors" [...] who could fashion {{examples}} of wines from obscure items and chemicals.

Following the Phylloxera epidemic, when true wine was scarce, wine fraud rose. Some merchants would take dried raisins grown from other species of grapevines and make wine that they passed off as being from a more prestigious provenance such as the more well known wines from France or Italy.|$|E

The use of apprenticeship is standard practice in some industries, but expansion beyond traditional occupations has been limited. The Department of Labor has not systematically identified <b>new</b> <b>occupations</b> suitable for apprenticeship programs, nor has it successfully alleviated the concerns of some employers about apprenticeship requirements, which has slowed the expansion of apprenticeship to <b>new</b> <b>occupations.</b> Labor has approved 19 <b>new</b> <b>occupations</b> for apprenticeships in the last five years, and many of these have been in less traditional occupations, such as internetworking technicians. Employers are often wary of apprenticeship programs. For example, some employers are reluctant to commit to incremental increases in wages as required by apprenticeship regulations. GAO identified several apprenticeship programs in which apprenticeship training helped to develop workers with sought-after skills. The key to the establishment of the several programs GAO reviewed was the close interaction between employers and federal or state apprenticeship officials to ensure that employers understood the value of apprenticeships. ...|$|R

In addition, alleged provocations on the part of university staff members during the previous strike action as well the conclusions of the European Commission's most recent report on Bulgaria have been cited among the trigger factors for the university students' decision to renew the occupation. The leading figures behind the <b>new</b> <b>occupation</b> were profiled as belonging to a [...] "radical wing" [...] of the previous occupying students (who had been against their colleagues' decision – that was taken in mid January – to restore full access to the university facilities for the staff and non-occupying students) and did not receive the full backing of all the previous participants in the occupation, some of whom adopted the stance that the timing of the occupation was not well-chosen and had caused them to postpone the public debate in the form of round table discussions, which was supposed to begin on that date and was envisioned as a new phase of the protest. It has also been suggested that the new student protesters did not shun the politicization of their activities, as they were seeking a [...] "decapsulation" [...] and unlike the other occupiers were open to cooperating with political parties and civil society organizations that are in opposition to the Oresharski government, as well as with football fan clubs.

We find that highly-educated native and foreign-born workers are imperfect substitutes. Immigrants with graduate degrees specialize in occupations demanding quantitative and analytical skills, whereas their native-born counterparts specialize in occupations requiring interactive and communication skills.
