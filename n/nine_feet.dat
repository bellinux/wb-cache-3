5|$|Heroes and {{religious}} masters with above normal height are {{a recurring theme}} in Chinese folklore. For instance, his student Wu Song {{is said to be}} over <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> tall in the same folktale. In The Story of Yue Fei, the General simultaneously duels with two other warriors vying for first place in a military exam; one is <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> tall and the other is eight feet tall. A Hagiography of the Taoist saint Zhang Daoling states he was over seven feet tall.|$|E

Resembling less a conventional loudspeaker than an elegant sideboard, it is a landmark product for the company that was sought after by the well-heeled and celebrities. With an estimated total production of about 1,000 units, it is highly sought after by collectors to this day.|$|E

5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner and}} outer walls were {{constructed}} similarly with the outer wall measuring <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> high and 18 inches thick, which was also coated in plaster. The outer wall {{is believed to have}} been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to infer that the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, which seems to conform to a proposal that the walls and the layout of buildings were used to maintain social barriers. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the outer wall, it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification.|$|E
5|$|The M40 motorway, {{which was}} nearing {{completion}} {{at the time}} of production, doubled for the fictitious M104. In the run-up to the filming of the plane's near-miss with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5, at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass, the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations, the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times. During a take, a crosswind sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would lose control of the Tiger Moth if it were to hit the ground. She therefore kept the plane in mid-air while passing under the bridge, clearing it by <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> (2.7m) as originally planned. On another attempt, the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low-level glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming; subsequently, Hughes and production manager were arrested. Hughes, a pilot with more than three decades' flight experience by 1968, later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only {{the first time in her}} career that she had feared for her safety.|$|E

25|$|When the {{reservoir}} level dropped to 173.69 feet nine gates were in operation at 20 feet. The previous record level of 173.93 feet was on May 18, 1989.

25|$|The tunnel was 12 {{feet tall}} at its tallest point and was <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> wide at its widest, which {{proved to be}} too small in later years. The tunnel {{suffered}} subsidence in the early 20th century and was closed after a partial collapse in 1914. Inspections of the disused tunnel continued until the 1960s, but since that time, {{there has been no}} attempt to investigate the interior of the tunnel at any significant distance from the portals.|$|E
25|$|Subsidence, or {{the gradual}} sinking of landforms, is another result of water scarcity. The U.S. Geological Survey {{estimates}} that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 {{percent of it}} due to groundwater usage. In some areas east of Houston, Texas the land has dropped by more than <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> due to subsidence. Brownwood, a subdivision near Baytown, Texas, was abandoned due to frequent flooding caused by subsidence and has since {{become part of the}} Baytown Nature Center.|$|E

25|$|The Forks {{is located}} in the flood plain of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. Before the {{floodway}} was built in 1968, the location of the Forks was prone to flooding when accumulated winter snow rapidly melted in the spring. One of the largest of these floods, in 1826, destroyed the original Fort Garry. The Red River rose three metres (over <b>nine</b> <b>feet)</b> in one day. It created a lake that remained for months and washed away nearly every building in the settlement. Due to recurring flooding, the Forks site was used as a transitional camp.|$|E
25|$|Naval {{gunpowder}} weapons {{also appeared}} and were rapidly adopted by Korean ships for conflicts against Japanese pirates in 1380 and 1383. By 1410, 160 Korean ships {{were reported to}} have equipped artillery of some sort. Mortars firing thunder-crash bombs are known to have been used, and four types of cannons are mentioned: chonja (heaven), chija (earth), hyonja (black), and hwangja (yellow), but their specifications are unknown. These cannons typically shot wooden arrows tipped with iron, the longest of which were <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> long, but stone and iron balls were sometimes used as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the Salt Lake Temple are <b>nine</b> <b>feet</b> thick at the base and six feet thick at the top.

Prior to that, the Nauvoo temple sported a flying angel weather vane. Of the dozen temples built from {{the construction of the}} Salt Lake Temple until the 1980s, only the Los Angeles had a similar statue. Moroni statues then became a standard part of nearly all LDS temples, and have been added to several temples originally built without them.|$|E
40|$|The {{analytical}} {{models and}} {{results of a}} structural dynamics investigation of the reference initial operation and evolutionary configurations of the <b>nine</b> <b>foot</b> bay space station are presented. This investigation was carried out between April and August 1984 {{as part of a}} team effort to define a reference configuration for the first U. S. manned space station. The results presented herein serve as a guide, a point of departure and a standard for future NASA and contractor studies leading to the design of the Space Station. The reference initial operation configuration of the <b>nine</b> <b>foot</b> bay station was found to be very flexible, with its lowest mode between 0. 096 and 0. 138 Hertz depending on station attachments. However, for the transient load cases which were then available, internal member loads had positive margins of safety and preliminary results indicate that laboratory experiments which require quiescent conditions can be satisfied down to the order of 0. 0001 g's...|$|R
