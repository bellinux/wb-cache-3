GAO estimated costs of ambulance transports based on a nationally representative survey of 215 ambulance providers that did not share costs with nonambulance services. Providers that shared costs with other institutions or services and could not report their costs for ambulance services separately, such as fire departments, were excluded because their reported costs appeared unreliable.

40|$|Aims: In {{order to}} predict the number of ophthalmologists which need to be trained in France between 2000 and 2020, we studied the number of office visits, {{diagnostic}} procedures and therapeutic procedures private-practice ophthalmologists performed per year. Method: We performed a descriptive and multivariate analysis using principal components and a hierarchic classification. Results: Men had a greater work-load than women. Physicians who accepted the <b>National</b> <b>Fee</b> Schedule as payment in full performed more office visits and diagnostic procedures but fewer surgical procedures than physicians who did not. Physicians who were trained before the medical-studies reform in 1985 performed less surgery than those who received their training after 1985. A principal component analysis identified four classes of physicians. Class 1 physicians (35. 6 % of all ophthalmologists) performed {{a high number of}} office visits, somewhat fewer diagnostic procedures and many fewer surgical procedures than the national average. Class 2 physicians (48. 6 % of all ophthalmologists) performed many office visits, although their average work-load was only 40 % the work-load of class 1 physicians. They performed few diagnostic and surgical procedures. Class 3 physicians (5. 1 % of all ophthalmologists) performed a much higher than average number of diagnostic procedures, a nearly average number of surgical procedures and approximately the same number of office visits as class 2 physicians. Finally, Class 4 physicians (10. 7 % of all ophthalmologists) exclusively performed diagnostic and surgical procedures. Conclusion: The wide variation in the work-loads of private-practice ophthalmologists has to be considered when determining future needs based on the existing resources...|$|E

40|$|Background: Management of deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) has evolved from hospitalisation for intravenous heparin therapy to treatment options that include acute management as an outpatient. While efficacy and safety remain the principal basis for choosing a therapy, the economic consequences of that choice {{should be considered as}} well. Objective: To estimate the average cost of various DVT management options from the perspective of US health payers. Design: Inpatient and outpatient management strategies were examined. Inpatient cases were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Edition, Clinical Modification codes and were classified into subgroups according to complication status. A cost estimate was developed by applying unit costs to the corresponding course of treatment. Cost estimates included initial acute care and that occurring in the following 6 months. Resource use profiles and unit costs were derived from several statewide inpatient, emergency room and ambulatory care databases supplemented by <b>national</b> <b>fee</b> schedules, published reports and peer-reviewed literature. All costs are reported in 1999 US dollars. Results: The mean 6 -month treatment costs for inpatient management ranged from $US 3906 to $US 17 168, depending on complication status. For outpatient management, the cost ranged from $US 2394 to $US 3369, depending on frequency of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) injection and need for professional assistance. Conclusions: The management strategy selected for DVT has an important economic impact. Self-administered LMWH in a homecare setting results in the lowest cost. However, as some patients either cannot, or will not, be treated this way, it is important for decision makers to consider the costs of other strategies.

40|$|Background User {{fees for}} primary care tend to {{suppress}} utilization, and many countries {{are experimenting with}} fee removal. Studies show that additional inputs are needed after removing fees, although well-documented experiences are lacking. This study presents data {{on the effects of}} fee removal on facility quality and utilization in Afghanistan, based on a pilot experiment and subsequent nationwide ban on fees. Methods Data on utilization and observed structural and perceived overall quality of health care were compared from before-and-after facility assessments, patient exit interviews and catchment area household surveys from eight facilities where fees were removed and 14 facilities where fee levels remained constant, {{as part of a larger}} health financing pilot study from 2005 to 2007. After a national user fee ban was instituted in 2008, health facility administrative data were analysed to assess subsequent changes in utilization and quality. Results The pilot study analysis indicated that observed and perceived quality increased across facilities but did not differ by fee removal status. Difference-in-difference analysis showed that utilization at facilities previously charging both service and drug fees increased by 400 % more after fee removal, prompting additional inputs from service providers, compared with facilities that previously only charged service fees or had no change in fees (P = 0. 001). Following the <b>national</b> <b>fee</b> ban, visits for curative care increased significantly (P < 0. 001), but institutional deliveries did not. Services typically free before the ban—immunization and antenatal care—had immediate increases in utilization but these were not sustained. Conclusion Both pilot and nationwide data indicated that curative care utilization increased following fee removal, without differential changes in quality. Concerns raised by non-governmental organizations, health workers and community leaders over the effects of lost revenue and increased utilization require continued effort to raise revenues, monitor health worker and patient perceptions, and carefully manage health facility performance.

40|$|Objective – The {{first wave}} of {{experiences}} of exemptions policies suggested that poverty-based exemptions, using individual targeting, were not effective, for practical and political economic reasons. In response, many countries have changed their approach in recent years – while maintaining user fees as a necessary source of revenue for facilities, they have been switching to categorical targeting, offering exemptions based on high-priority services or population groups. This chapter aims to examine the impact and conditions for effectiveness of this recent health finance modality. Methodology/approach – The chapter {{is based on a}} literature review and on data from two complex evaluations of <b>national</b> <b>fee</b> exemption policies for delivery care in West Africa (Ghana and Senegal). A conceptual framework for analysing the impact of exemption policies is developed and used. Although the analysis focuses on exemption for deliveries, the framework and findings are likely to be generalisable to other service- or population-based exemptions. Findings – The chapter presents background information on the nature of delivery exemptions, the drivers for their use, their scale and common modalities in low-income countries. It then looks at evidence of their impact, on utilisation, quality of care and equity and investigates their cost-effectiveness. The final section presents lessons on implementation and implications for policy-makers, including the acceptability and sustainability of exemptions and how they compare to other possible mechanisms. Implications for policy – The chapter concludes that funded service- or group-based exemptions offer a simple, potentially effective route to mitigating inequity and inefficiency in the health systems of low-income countries. However, {{there are a number of}} key constraints. One is the fungibility of resources at health facility level. The second is the difficulty of sustaining a separate funding stream over the medium to long term. The third is the arbitrary basis for selecting high-priority services for exemption. The chapter therefore concludes that this financing mode is unstable and is likely to be transitional...|$|E

40|$|The {{continous}} {{health expenditure}} increase {{in developed countries}} is often related with the acute hospital care of the elderly. To monitor the characteristics of elderly acute hospital care included the expenditure trend is crucial {{in order to identify}} the appropriateness of this care. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe quality and quantity of in-hospital care use of elderly population in Italy in 2006 and to compare the results with the same information gathered for 1996 and 2001. All the 2006 acute hospital admission longer than one day of the patients older than 64 years sourced from the Register of Discharge Form of the Italian Ministry of Health have been analyzed. A list of the 30 more frequent diagnoses has been compiled and compared with the same list compiled for 2001. On the basis of the <b>National</b> <b>Fee</b> for each Disease Related Group an analysis of the hospital expenditure has been carried out. The correlation between DRGs National Fees and frequency of the diagnosis in the discharge form has been based on the 80 diagnosis that has been recorded for more than 10. 000 discharge forms in 2006. A relevant increase of acute hospital admission for respiratory, cardiovascular and urinary pathologies among the elderly has been observed. Moreover the number of hospital admissions for major joints and implant of lower limbs is doubled from 1996. The total health expenditure for the elderly acute care longer than one day is increased of 6. 3 % and a positive correlation between higher DRGs fees and higher frequency of diagnosis has been observed (Pearson correlation value = 0. 478; p< 0. 001 - cubic regression R-square value = 0. 301; p< 0. 001). The hospital acute care use of the elderly patients seems to be more related to emergency care than in the past, while a decrease of DRGs related to chronic diseases and generic diagnosis has been observed. The more frequent cause of in-hospital admission seems to be related also to a higher DRGs fee. As already observed in the past years, a trend towards the use of more expensive DRGs could be detected...|$|E

Current treatments, although effective in reducing symptoms and limiting exacerbations, do not adequately target the underlying disease processes that drive exacerbation development. The Aerobika* oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) device {{has been shown in}} a real-world effectiveness study to lower the frequency of moderate-to-severe exacerbations during a 30 -day post-exacerbation period. This study sought to determine the impact on exacerbations and costs and to determine the cost-effectiveness of the Aerobika* device. Methods: Data from published literature and <b>national</b> <b>fee</b> schedules were used to model the cost-effectiveness of the Aerobika* device in patients who had experienced an exacerbation in the previous month, or a post-exacerbation care population. Exacerbation trends and the impact of the Aerobika* device on reducing exacerbation frequency were modeled using a one-year Markov model with monthly cycles and three health states: (i) no exacerbation, (ii) exacerbation, and (iii) death. Scenario analysis and one-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) were also performed. Results: When the effect of Aerobika* device was assumed to last 30 days, use of the device resulted in cost-savings ($ 553 per patient) and improved outcomes (ie, six fewer exacerbations per 100 patients per year) compared to no OPEP/positive expiratory pressure therapy. When the effect of the Aerobika* device was assumed to extend beyond the conservative 30 -day time frame, the Aerobika* device remained the dominant strategy (21 fewer exacerbations per 100 patients per year; cost savings of $ 1, 952 per patient). Consistency in findings after performing OWSAs indicates the robustness of results. Conclusion: The Aerobika* device is a cost-effective treatment option that provides clinical benefit and results in direct medical cost savings in a post-exacerbation care COPD population.
