40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} South Africa’s economic fundamentals on <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} main determinants of investment in South Africa are resource prices, input productivity and the economic performance of the domestic economy. The results illustrate that <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment</b> are close but not perfect substitutes. In addition, we find that an increase in labour input costs reduces both <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> Further, an increase in fixed capital productivity increases <b>net</b> direct <b>investment.</b> Further, also the results illustrate that subsidies increase both <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> Moreover, an increase in exports increases both <b>net</b> direct <b>investment</b> and <b>net</b> portfolio <b>investment.</b> Policy recommendations are thus proposed that may increase foreign direct investment in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|In the {{literature}} of comprehensive national accounts, national <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> are used to indicate dynamic welfare improvement in an economy. A well-known approach associates national <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> with the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets in an economy. Following this capital stock approach, sectoral <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> {{can be defined as}} the shadow value of change in stock of capital assets owned by a sector in an economy. An alternative approach is based on future commodity flows to a sector. This commodity flow approach associates sectoral <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> with the present value of changes in future commodity flows to a sector. In the present paper, I compare these two approaches and prove that they coincide with each other only if the future commodity flows to the sector can be attributed to current stock of capital assets in the sector alone. In empirical studies, commodity flow approach can be a better alternative if the purpose is to estimate the contributions to national <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> of a recipient of future cash flows...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} welfare {{accounting}} shows that comprehensive measures of <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> {{can be used}} to test whether an economy is following unsustainable paths of consumption. However, the notion of <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> used in most applied studies rules out technological progress and terms-of-trade gains from international trade. This paper considers an augmented expression of <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> derived from a dynamic growth model featuring international trade in different types of resource inputs, exogenous productivity growth in final sectors, and cost-reducing progress in resource extraction. Calculating augmented <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> for the world’s top twenty oil producers, we show that the difference with standard non-augmented measures can be large and may even revert some established conclusions regarding sustainability: prospects are more favorable than previously thought in oil-exporting countries endowed with large reserves like Angola, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. In oil-importing economies, future consumption possibilities are limited by the lack of expected rental incomes from future resource exports...|$|R
40|$|The World Bank {{recently}} began publishing estimates of countries' “genuine savings”: a comprehensive measure of <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> across {{all forms of}} capital (natural and human as well as produced). This article presents the first empirical investigation of {{the consistency of the}} Bank's estimates with the hypothesis that <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> should equal the difference between a country's average future consumption and its current consumption. Results show that the Bank's estimates are consistent only with weak versions of this hypothesis and then only for developing countries. Moreover, a simple autoregressive-integrated-moving-average (ARIMA) model outperforms any <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> measure, comprehensive or conventional, as a predictor of the difference between current and future consumption. In sum, the Bank's <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> estimates tend to move {{in the same direction as}} the difference between current and average future consumption in developing countries, but they have little value for predicting the magnitude of this difference.

40|$|In recent years, in {{line with}} {{developments}} in the financial markets, financial instruments developed rapidly. As {{a result of this}} development, how to classify financial instruments, recognition of these principles has become important. As a result of the every day increase in types of financial instruments, financial risks have emerged. Especially {{after the end of the}} Bretton Woods system that based on fixed exchange rates in 1970 ’s, entities faced the financial risk. IAS 39 gathered financial risks faced by businesses in the financial markets in three groups. These risks are risk arising from financial instruments at fair value and risk arising from cash flows and risk arising from the <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> in a foreign operation. Preventing from the risk arising from the <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> in a foreign operation hedge that composes the subject of this study and also one type of prevention from financial risk, is explained in Turkish Accounting Standards TAS 21 and TAS 39.

40|$|Measures of {{the state}} and local {{government}} capital stock and investment are necessary inputs into several areas of economic analysis, including the measurement of national wealth and its growth. We estimate <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> and depreciation of state and local government nonresidential capital. In aggregate, we estimate a net state and local nonresidential capital stock of $ 1. 8 trillion in 1985, 17 % larger than that estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Net state and local government investment has exceeded the state and local deficit annually for the last forty-five years. While the fraction of state and local purchase of goods and services devoted to <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> has fallen, it has exceeded federal government net capital formation except during defense buildups and has averaged more than 40 % of private fixed nonresidential <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> since 1951.

40|$|The paper {{tests for}} {{a link between}} the level of unionization and <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> rates in Canadian manufacturing. Evidence from a {{balanced}} panel of 18 industries between 1967 and 1987 reveals a negative non-linear relationship. The negative relation occurs at levels of unionization between 0 and approximately 50 %, with a plateau above this level. At the mean level of unionization, a one percent increase in the unionization rate leads to a 0. 7 percent drop in the <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> rate. <b>Net</b> <b>investment</b> rates do not appear to respond to measures of strike intensity. 1. INTRODUCTION This paper examines the relationship between the level of industry unionization and industry investment in Canada for the period 1967 - 1987. This is an important empirical issue because the theoretical impact of unions on investment is uncertain. There are two competing models for union effects on investment. The traditional on-the-demandcurve model treats the union wage increase as a tax on labor. The end result [...] ...|$|R

We find that, in the steady state, aggregate <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> in organization capital is roughly one-fifth of measured output. During the initial phase of transition, the failure rate of plants rises 200 - 400 percent, measured output and aggregate productivity stagnate, physical <b>investment</b> falls, and <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> in organization capital rises between 300 and 500 percent above its steady-state level.

50|$|The desired {{stock of}} capital goods is {{determined}} by such variables as the expected profit rate, the expected level of output, the interest rate (the cost of finance), and technology. Because the expected level of output plays a role, this model exhibits behavior described by the accelerator effect but less extreme {{than that of the}} simple accelerator. Because the existing capital stock grows over time due to past <b>net</b> <b>investment,</b> a slowing of the growth of output (GDP) can cause the gap between the desired K and the existing K to narrow, close, or even become negative, causing current <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> to fall.|$|R
