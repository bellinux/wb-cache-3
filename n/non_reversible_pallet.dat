40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{original}} formulation of the Granta-Gravel and Cam-Clay constitutive models, the framework of elasto-plasticity has been successfully applied to describe the geomaterials behaviour. Thanks to the modifications proposed by different authors, several aspects of the granular materials behaviour were progressively taken into account, such as the non associated flow rule {{and the effects of}} induced anisotropy. Recently, a series of triaxial laboratory tests performed by di Prisco and Imposimato (1996) has put in evidence an aspect which is disregarded in elasto-plasticity: the time dependency of the mechanical behaviour of loose sand specimens. The same authors proposed to interpret the observed behaviour within the framework of visco-plasticity. In this paper, the <b>non</b> <b>reversible</b> behaviour of an idealised granular material composed of a 2 D stack of disks is analysed by performing a series of Distinct Element numerical simulations (PFC- 2 D code). Starting from different stress levels (from isotropic to close to failure) previously recorded during a biaxial compression simulation, a series of finite stress probes is applied to the numerical specimen. All the probes have the same (small) magnitude, but they differ in direction in the principal stress plane. For each probe, the stress increments are applied to the boundary plates in an unique finite step, and the corresponding strain increments are recorded during the following time period. The obtained results show that the transient state is reached passing through two phases: a first one, where mainly elastic strains take place as the stress increment propagates within the specimen followed by a second one where the measured strains (<b>non</b> <b>reversible)</b> increase under constant stress; The duration of both phases considerably increases as the initial stress state approaches to failure. These results, which confirm the adequacy of a visco-plastic flow rule, are put in relation to the specimen structure progressive rearrangement caused by the applied stress-increment...|$|R

SHELVIP couples {{the general theory of}} elasto-plasticity with a time-dependent component. In the stress space an external non-hardening plastic surface defines the locus of plastic strains development, while an internal stress-hardening viscoplastic surface establishes the onset of viscoplastic strains. The 3 SC model consists of an elastic element for the time independent reversible response, a viscoelastic Kelvin element for primary creep (time-dependent reversible strains) and a viscoplastic element for secondary creep (time-dependent <b>non</b> <b>reversible</b> strains).

Asymmetrical relations are relations that are <b>non</b> <b>reversible.</b> For example, “Jack reads the newspaper” cannot be reversed {{to the newspaper}} reading Jack. In this way, asymmetrical relations are logical relations and underlie everyday logic and common sense. They govern the conscious sphere of the human mind. Symmetrical relations, on the other hand, move in both directions simultaneously. For example, 'Daniel sits on a stone' can be reversed as, 'a stone sits on Daniel', without being untrue. Symmetrical relations, govern the unconscious mind. Matte Blanco states that the symmetrical, unconscious realm is the natural state of man and is a massive and infinite presence while the asymmetrical, conscious realm is a small product of it. This is why the principle of symmetry is all-encompassing and can dissolve all logic, leading to the asymmetrical relations perfectly symmetrical.|$|R

The basic structure we shall use for such a theory, a 'd-space', is a topological space equipped with a family of 'directed paths', closed under some operations. This allows for 'directed homotopies', generally <b>non</b> <b>reversible,</b> represented by a cylinder and cocylinder functors. The existence of 'pastings' (colimits) yields a geometric realisation of cubical sets as d-spaces, together with homotopy constructs which will be developed in a sequel. Here, the 'fundamental category' of a d-space is introduced and a 'Seifert - van Kampen' theorem proved; its homotopy invariance rests on 'directed homotopy' of categories. In the process, new shapes appear, for d-spaces but also for small categories, their elementary algebraic model.
