Out of seventy-nine randomly collected air samples from delivery rooms at the four largest hospitals (Khartoum Teaching Hospital, Al Ribat Hospital, Ahmed Fadul Hospital and Omdurman Maternity Hospital), 63. 3 % showed positive bacterial growth.

40|$|The {{practice}} of the operating <b>room</b> <b>nurse</b> is hidden from most nurses and patients behind {{the doors of the}} theatre suite. This 'hidden' world, shrouds operating <b>room</b> <b>nursing</b> practice in an air of mystery. Nurses outside the operating room may only guess at how the day to day reality of nursing practice in the operating room is constructed. The role of the operating <b>room</b> <b>nurse</b> is described within the literature as having a 'perioperative' focus which encompasses operating <b>room</b> <b>nursing</b> care throughout the patient's experience of surgery. The question driving this thesis asks operating <b>room</b> <b>nurses</b> how they describe their practice and explores the day to day {{practice of}} these nurses through the stories they tell. Using an ethnographic methodology, six operating <b>room</b> <b>nurses</b> share their stories which depict their understandings of the nurse's role in the operating room and communicate their experiences of practice. Within the data chapters the nurses tell stories of coming to theatre and their understandings {{of the role of the}} operating <b>room</b> <b>nurse.</b> With the exception of one nurse, the understandings of the nurses in the focus group contrast sharply with the notions of the 'perioperative' role contained within the professional literature. The second of the data chapters focuses on the stories the nurses tell of their experiences in operating <b>room</b> <b>nursing</b> practice. The stories communicate the biomedical influence on nursing practice in the operating room as the nurses' views of the 'object body' are revealed. The nurse's role is also exposed to be a series of tasks which are directed to the support of the surgical team...|$|R
40|$|Background: Infection {{therapy for}} {{children}} needs antibiotics. Since penicillin resistence already high, doctors tend to give second line drug, like cefotaxim, for initial therapy especially in HND {{so that its}} resistence tends to increase. The objectives {{of this study were}} to observe the difference of bacterial pattern and its sensitivity to cefotaxim and amikacin and to observe factors influencing bacterial pattern in HND and non-HND patients of Pediatric Ward at Kariadi Hospital. Method: Data were collected retrospectively from medical records of Pediatric Ward at Kariadi Hospital in year 2004. Statistic analysis used are X 2 and logistic regression test. Results: Three major bacteria causing bacteremia were Enterobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. There were no significant differences of bacterial pattern (p= 0, 054). Bacteria in HND room less sensitive to cefotaxim than those in non-HND room(p= 0, 014). Amikacin sensitivity, in both <b>nursing</b> <b>room,</b> did not significantly differ(p= 0, 13). Age,length of stay, invasive procedures, complications, <b>nursing</b> <b>room,</b> and cefotaxim initial affected bacterial pattern. Length of stayand <b>nursing</b> <b>room</b> affected cefotaxim sensitivity. Amikacin sensitivity was affected by length of stay. Conclusion: Cefotaxim sensitivity in HND room less sensitive than in non-HND room. Keyword: infection, initial antibiotics therapy, amikacin, cefotaxim. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a healthcare monitoring {{system that can}} be used in an intensive care room. Biological information represented by ECG signals is achieved by ECG acquisition part. AD 620 Instrumentation Amplifier selected due to its low current noise. The ECG signals of patients in the intensive care room are measured through wireless nodes. A base node is connected to the <b>nursing</b> <b>room</b> computer via a USB port, and is programmed with a specific firmware. The ECG signals are transferred wirelessly to the base node using nRF 24 L 01 + wireless module. So, the nurse staff has a real time information for each patient available in the intensive care room. A star Wireless Sensor Network is designed for collecting ECG signals. ATmega 328 MCU in the Arduino Uno board used for this purpose. Internet for things used For transferring ECG signals to the remote doctor, a Virtual Privet Network is established to connect the <b>nursing</b> <b>room</b> computer and the doctor computer.

30|$|In the Cape Town cohort, the {{location}} and procedure of recording were somewhat more standardized than in the Tampere cohort (i.e., the recordings were captured while conducting routine examinations in the same <b>nursing</b> <b>room).</b> The cry trigger used was vaccination (i.e., invasive) or measurement of infant weight at a weighing scale (i.e., non-invasive). All Cape Town recordings were stored as 48 -kHz sampling rate, two-channel audio in a 24 -bit Waveform audio file (WAV) format. The audio recorder used was Zoom H 4 n recorder with built-in condenser microphones. The distance between infant’s mouth and the recorder was approximately 1.3 m for infants being vaccinated and 70 cm for infants being weighed. Our data collection was conjoined with another study whose protocol required the mic {{to be a bit}} far and hence the larger distance between the infant and the recorder as compared to the Tampere cohort. Due to guidelines of the project concerning protection of privacy of the involved participants, we are not able to publish the audio data used in this project.|$|E
