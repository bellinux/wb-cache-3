40|$|<b>Non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{applied in the}} industrial context for their strong potentialities in improving and standardizing quality control. Especially in the intermediate manufacturing stages, early detection of defects on semi-finished products allow their direction towards later production processes according to their quality, with consequent considerable savings in time, energy, materials and work. However, the raw data coming from <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> systems are not always immediately suitable for sophisticated defect detection algorithms, due to noise and disturbances which are unavoidable, especially in harsh operating conditions, {{such as the ones}} which are typical of the steelmaking cycle. The paper describes some pre-processing operations which are required in order to exploit the data coming from a <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> system. Such a system is based on the joint exploitation of Laser and Electro-Magnetic Acoustic Transducer technologies and is applied to the detection of surface and subsurface cracks in cold and hot steel slabs...|$|R

40|$|Stone decay is {{affected}} by the influence of climatic factors. In particular marble degradation, that could be expressed by decohesion and /or bowing, is mainly due to the action of temperature and water (rains and relative humidity). In this work <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> and <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed to evaluate the decay of marble slabs subjected both to natural exposition and to artificial ageing tests (Lab - Bow test). Measurements of Ultrasonic Pulse Velocities (UPV) and bowing have been executed periodically on marble slabs exposed for a period of four years as preliminary field tests. On the base of this work an integrated test methodology to monitoring and previewing the behaviour of faÃ§ade slabs have been set up. The methodology has been applied on the marble faÃ§ade of modern building of centre Italy and consists of in situ and laboratory tests. In laboratory a <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> (flexural strength) has been added to the <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> to evaluate the decay before and after cycles of an ageing test.

Moreover this work confirms the effectiveness of the employed <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>tests</b> and their god correlation with the mechanical tests...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} on the testing of concrete elasticity {{has been done in}} order to measure concrete compressive strength using a <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity. An equipment that was used for this research was a Sonic Wave Analyzer (SOWAN). In this research, concrete samples were formed in cylindrical shape with 15 cm diameter and 30 cm length. The compressive strengths of this concrete were 19, 23, and 25 (⁄). After that the time delay of sonic wave was measured. The research results showed that primary and secondary sonic wave velocity, elasticity, and compressive strenght were = 3525 m/s, = 1950 m/s, 23240 x N/, and 24 x (⁄) respectively. Based on the data, it was concluded that this <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>test</b> based on sonic wave velocity can be used to measure the concrete compressive strength, because the values obtained were comparable to the values obtained using the Universal Testing Machine (UTM) which is a <b>destructive</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|The high {{variability}} in the mechanical properties of massive wood members is a significant disadvantage from this material {{when compared to other}} construction materials. This variability may be reduced through the implementation of grading procedures, either by visual features (visual grading), or by mechanical properties (mechanical grading). This paper presents work developed in University of Coimbra to characterized and grade, visually and mechanically, Portuguese Maritime Pine. Two hundred Maritime pine logs were collected in an interior central region of Portugal. After drying, the logs were visually characterized according to the EN 1310. Each log was then subjected to <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>tests,</b> for the determination of the dynamic modulus of elasticity followed by <b>destructive</b> <b>tests,</b> for the determination of bending and compression strength, following EN 14251. The correlations between the visual features and the mechanical properties and between the dynamic modulus of elasticity and mechanical properties were determined. Based on the results, conclusions were drawn regarding the most appropriate features {{to be used in the}} visual strength grading process. Based on this analysis a proposal was given to visually grade Portuguese Maritime pine. Furthermore, the visual grading results were discussed and compared with the results obtained with the <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>tests.</b> The results obtained in this study were compared with results obtained in a similar study undertaken in the Delft University of Technology, with sixty eight Larch round logs collected in three different locations in the Province of Drenthe (Netherlands) ...|$|R

50|$|Analysis of {{a failed}} part can be done using {{destructive}} testing or non-destructive testing.
