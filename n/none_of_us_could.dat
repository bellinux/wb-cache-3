25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

2500|$|Season four won near-universal {{critical}} acclaim. The Boston Globe {{referred to}} the show as a [...] "taut exercise in withheld disaster" [...] and declared the show [...] "riveting." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette labelled the series [...] "smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium." [...] Season four was listed by many critics {{as one of the}} best seasons of television in 2011. Time listed Walter White's [...] "I am the one who knocks" [...] line {{as one of the best}} television lines of 2011. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that, [...] "Breaking Bad is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep." [...] The A.V. Club review of the finale summed it up as a [...] "fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean anybody is home free. Nothing's ever easy on Breaking Bad." [...] The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, [...] "What a season of television– truly something <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> ever have expected, or claimed we deserved." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{early work}} of Stroun and Anker spurred intense {{investigation}} into the relationship of circulating nucleic acids and human conditions, such as disease, trauma, and pregnancy. For example, Lo demonstrated that fetal-specific nucleic acids could be detected in maternal peripheral blood in the late 1990s. As such, the pair organized the first global symposium dedicated to circulating nucleic acid research in 1999 held in Menthon, France. The conference was named CNAPS (Circulating Nucleic Acids in Plasma and Serum) and is held every other year to this day. In fact, the 2015 conference organizers’ welcome address begins, “When our forerunners and field-founders Philippe Anker and Maurice Stroun organized the first event in 1999 in Menthon, France, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> attendees <b>could</b> have imagined that Circulating Nucleic Acids would be a game changer” ...|$|R

The government is there to help people but not control them," [...] he remarked. A 2000 Rolling Stone profile notes that Hoppus [...] "pray every night". He elaborated on his religious views in a 2005 interview: [...] "It's amazing to me that anyone can say that one thing is right.

2500|$|In late April 1994, {{the band}} {{relocated}} to Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, but recording was disrupted because Stipe {{suffered from a}} tooth abscess that required medical attention. Unlike previous album sessions, by the time production had moved to Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles, California, the band was behind schedule. Litt attributed the delay to recording live at Crossover, which lengthened the mixing process; he told Rolling Stone, [...] "We're {{trying to figure out}} how raw to leave it and how much to studiofy it." [...] At the same time, Stipe was still writing when the band was supposed to be mixing the record. Tension arose between the band members, who were staying in different locations in Los Angeles and would rarely be in the studio at the same time. Tensions came to a head when the group was recording at Louie's Clubhouse, Litt's home studio in Los Angeles, where years later Stipe recalled, [...] "We broke up [...] [...] [...] We reached the point where <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> speak to each other, and we were in a small room, and we just said 'Fuck off' and that was it." [...] The group had a meeting to resolve its issues; Mills told Rolling Stone, [...] "We have to begin working as a unit again, which we haven't been doing very well lately." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ford was legendary for his {{discipline}} and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; {{he was also}} infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive {{the full force of}} his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a [...] "big idiot" [...] and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from The Searchers) once referred to Ford as [...] "the only man who could make John Wayne cry"[...] He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: [...] "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in Mogambo, was not the only person to suffer at the hands of John Ford's notorious behaviour. He recalls [...] "Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled {{out in front of the}} entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight." [...] "We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day's work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was as good as his word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour." ...|$|E

5000|$|All {{four members}} {{were born and}} raised in Nashville. Callie and Phoebe, daughters of Christian artist Morgan Cryar, sang {{background}} vocals on Music Row from a young age. Taylor and Bruno had grown up influenced heavily by their father's music collection, which included everything from gritty southern rock to soul. [...] The two sets of siblings met each other at a mutual friend's campfire. In May 2009, the four came together and played for the first time, originally just playing songs that the Cryar sisters had written. [...] "Things progressed in a way that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> really <b>could</b> have predicted," [...] says Callie. [...] "We knew that it was an intriguing sound, and we liked what was happening," [...] adds Bruno. By the following winter, they made their first record, Tell Your Mama, and released it in March 2010. [...] The record was received with critical acclaim. It is [...] "a blend of bluegrass, folk, & alternative music all held together tightly by Callie & Phoebe’s angelic harmonies & Taylor & Bruno’s hypnotic rhythms." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that we all sat gasping in our chairs, with that sweet, wet south-western breeze, fresh from the sea, flapping the muslin curtains and cooling our flushed faces. I wonder how long we sat! <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> afterwards <b>could</b> agree at all on that point. We were bewildered, stunned, semi-conscious. We had all braced our courage for death, but this fearful and sudden new fact--that {{we must continue to}} live after we had survived the race to which we belonged--struck us with the shock of a physical blow and left us prostrate. Then gradually the suspended mechanism began to move once more; the shuttles of memory worked; ideas weaved themselves together in our minds. We saw, with vivid, merciless clearness, the relations between the past, the present, and the future--the lives that we had led and the lives which we would have to live. Our eyes turned in silent horror upon those of our companions and found the same answering look in theirs. Instead of the joy which men might have been expected to feel who had so narrowly escaped an imminent death, a terrible wave of darkest depression submerged us. Everything on earth that we loved had been washed away into the great, infinite, unknown ocean, and here were we marooned upon this desert island of a world, without companions, hopes, or aspirations. A few years' skulking like jackals among the graves of the human race and then our belated and lonely end would come.|$|R

Whether you had gained the brig before it burst, <b>of</b> course <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knew. We <b>could</b> only hope that you had done so. The storm was a terrible one here. While some thought that the brig might have foundered at once when it struck her, it was certain that if she {{weathered}} the first blow she would have to run for it. It {{was one of the worst}} storms, people here say, that has been experienced on the coast for many years, alike in its fury and in its duration, and all agreed that she would have been blown at least a thousand miles off the land before the gale spent its force. As the wind continued in the same quarter for a long time it would have taken the brig weeks to beat back against it, but when two months passed without your return, all concluded that you had either sunk before gaining the ship, or that she had gone down in the gale, or been wrecked among some of the islands into whose neighbourhood she must have been blown. However, the admiral continued to hope long after the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had given you up. At the end of two months he appointed me his flag-midshipman to fill your place, as he especially said, until your return.

Mr. Stevenson afterwards told me that I had spoken of Monsieur Paul de St. Victor, as a fine writer, but added that [...] "he was not a British sportsman."
