5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace.

5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989.

The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined {{that there was no}} evidence to support the allegations and <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for further investigation.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress saw <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to spend money to improve them.

He was released on $2,500 bail three hours after the arrest, and was ordered by the Williamson County, Tennessee court to take an anger assessment which found <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for any further action. The altercation was disputed by Atkins' lawyer, who stated that it was purely verbal. Atkins filed for divorce within 24 hours of the alleged assault. The divorce was settled in late-September 2012.

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
