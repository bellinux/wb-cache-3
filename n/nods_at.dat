60|$|I <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> {{recollection}} of the vulpine-face superintendent of the Sierra Mills.|$|R

6000|$|... 222 And now {{no longer}} letted[49] of his prey, [...] He leaps up {{at it with}} enraged desire: [...] O'erlooks the {{neighbours}} with a wide survey, [...] And <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> every house his threatening fire.|$|E

6000|$|BOHUN (again {{interrupting}} him). My {{specialty is}} being right when {{other people are}} wrong. If you agreed with me I should be of no use here. (He <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> him to drive the point home; then turns suddenly and forcibly on Crampton.) Now you, Mr. Crampton: what point in this business have you most at heart? ...|$|E
6000|$|CRAMPTON (suddenly {{gripping}} {{him by the}} arm as {{he turns}} away again to the cabinet). So much the worse for them. I tell you you don't understand my character. If I could spare all my teeth, I'd make you pull them all out one after another to shew you what a properly hardened man can go through with when he's made up his mind to do it. (He <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> him to enforce the effect of this declaration, and releases him.) ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a look of}} bare toleration on Mr. Egremont's face, as if {{he endured}} because it would soon be over, as Nuttie bowed several times, and his wife, though less quick to catch people's eyes, {{sometimes}} also made her recognition. When the streets were past and Nuttie had aimed her last <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> the nursery parties out walking on the road, she became aware that those cold, lack-lustre, and yet sharply critical eyes of her father were scanning her all over.|$|E

6000|$|MRS WARREN. No, thank you. Vienna is {{no place}} for you--at least not until youre a little older. [She <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> him to {{emphasize}} this piece of advice. He makes a mock-piteous face, belied by his laughing eyes. She looks at him; then comes back to him]. Now, look here, little boy [taking his face in her hands and turning it up to her]: I know you through and through by your likeness to your father, better than you know yourself. Don't you go taking any silly ideas into your head about me. Do you hear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] {{thought the}} Colonel {{to himself as}} he strolled to the church, now and again {{acknowledging}} greetings or stopping to chat with one of the villagers--"I wonder {{if they are going to}} have a little sacred music together in the chapel. If so, upon my soul, I should like to make the congregation. And that pious fellow Morris, too--the blameless Morris--to go philandering about in this fashion. I hope it won't come to Mary's ears; but if it does, luckily, with all her temper, she is a sensible woman, and knows that even Jove <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> times." ...|$|E
6000|$|At Timon's villa[50] let us pass a day, Where all cry out, 'What sums {{are thrown}} away!' [...] 100 So proud, so grand; of that stupendous air, Soft and {{agreeable}} come never there. Greatness, with Timon, dwells {{in such a}} draught As brings all Brobdignag before your thought. To compass this, his building is a town, His pond an ocean, his parterre a down: Who but must laugh, the master when he sees, A puny insect, shivering at a breeze! Lo, what huge heaps of littleness around! The whole a labour'd quarry above ground; [...] 110 Two Cupids squirt before: a lake behind Improves the keenness of the northern wind. His gardens next your admiration call, On every side you look, behold the wall! No pleasing intricacies intervene, No artful wildness to perplex the scene; Grove <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> grove, each alley has a brother, And half the platform just reflects the other. The suffering eye inverted nature sees, Trees cut to statues, statues thick as trees; [...] 120 With here a fountain, never to be play'd; And there a summer-house, that knows no shade; Here Amphitritè sails through myrtle bowers; There gladiators fight, or die in flowers; Unwater'd see the drooping sea-horse mourn, And swallows roost in Nilus' dusty urn.|$|E
60|$|She <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> {{me with an}} air of {{accepting}} the rendered justice and went on with the utmost simplicity.|$|R
60|$|He broke off. Nostromo, {{leaning back}} against the table, his arms folded on his breast, <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> him slightly.|$|R
60|$|And I <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> {{the alley}} of the Prado opening before us between {{the rows of}} the {{perfectly}} leafless trees.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was worth}} watching, too; the fellow was simply an édition de luxe of [...] "Turveydrop on Deportment." [...] As the [...] "lady" [...] slowly {{unfolded}} her tale of grievances against our lawless soldiery and mentioned certain instances of wanton disregard of property rights--among them, {{as to the}} imminent peril of bursting our sides we partly overheard, the looting of her own wardrobe--the look of sympathetic agony in Haberton's handsome face was the very flower and fruit of histrionic art. His deferential and assenting <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> her several statements were so exquisitely performed that one could not help regretting their unsubstantial nature and the impossibility of preserving them under glass for instruction and delight of posterity. And all the time the wretch was drawing his chair nearer and nearer. Once or twice he looked about {{to see if we}} were observing, but we were in appearance blankly oblivious to all but one another and our several diversions. The low hum of our conversation, the gentle tap-tap of the cards as they fell in play and the furious scratching of the adjutant-general's pen as he turned off countless pages of words without sense were the only sounds heard. No--there was another: at long intervals the distant boom of a heavy gun, followed by the approaching rush of the shot. The enemy was amusing himself.|$|E
60|$|MORELL. Yes, I did. Well, {{that did}} not prevent our getting on very well together. God made you what I call a scoundrel as he made me {{what you call a}} fool. (The effect of this {{observation}} on Burgess is to remove the keystone of his moral arch. He becomes bodily weak, and, with his eyes fixed on Morell in a helpless stare, puts out his hand apprehensively to balance himself, as if the floor had suddenly sloped under him. Morell proceeds in the same tone of quiet conviction.) It was not for me to quarrel with his handiwork in the one case more than in the other. So long as you come here honestly as a self-respecting, thorough, convinced scoundrel, justifying your scoundrelism, and proud of it, you are welcome. But (and now Morell's tone becomes formidable; and he rises and strikes {{the back of the chair}} for greater emphasis) I won't have you here snivelling about being a model employer and a converted man when you're only an apostate with your coat turned for the sake of a County Council contract. (He <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> him to enforce the point; then goes to the hearth-rug, where he takes up a comfortably commanding position with his back to the fire, and continues) No: I like a man to be true to himself, even in wickedness. Come now: either take your hat and go; or else sit down and give me a good scoundrelly reason for wanting to be friends with me. (Burgess, whose emotions have subsided sufficiently to be expressed by a dazed grin, is relieved by this concrete proposition. He ponders it for a moment, and then, slowly and very modestly, sits down in the chair Morell has just left.) That's right. Now, out with it.|$|E
6000|$|Mentioning Mr. Baffle {{gives an}} {{instance}} of there being good in persons where good is not expected, for it cannot be denied that Mr. Buffle's manners when engaged in his business were not agreeable. To collect is one thing, and to look about as if suspicious of the goods being gradually removing {{in the dead of}} the night by a back door is another, over taxing you have no control but suspecting is voluntary. Allowances too must ever be made for a gentleman of the Major's warmth not relishing being spoke to with a pen in the mouth, and while I do not know that it is more irritable to my own feelings to have a low-crowned hat with a broad brim kept on in doors than any other hat still I can appreciate the Major's, besides which without bearing malice or vengeance the Major is a man that scores up arrears as his habit always was with Joshua Lirriper. So at last my dear the Major lay in wait for Mr. Buffle, and it worrited me a good deal. Mr. Buffle gives his rap of two sharp knocks one day and the Major bounces to the door. [...] "Collector has called for two quarters' Assessed Taxes" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "They are ready for him" [...] says the Major and brings him in here. But on the way Mr. Buffle looks about him in his usual suspicious manner and the Major fires and asks him [...] "Do you see a Ghost sir?" [...] "No sir" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "Because I have before noticed you" [...] says the Major [...] "apparently looking for a spectre very hard beneath the roof of my respected friend. When you find that supernatural agent, be so good as point him out sir." [...] Mr. Buffle stares at the Major and then <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> me. [...] "Mrs. Lirriper sir" [...] says the Major going off into a perfect steam and introducing me with his hand. [...] "Pleasure of knowing her" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "A--hum!--Jemmy Jackman sir!" [...] says the Major introducing himself. [...] "Honour of knowing you by sight" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "Jemmy Jackman sir" [...] says the Major wagging his head sideways in a sort of obstinate fury [...] "presents to you his esteemed friend that lady Mrs. Emma Lirriper of Eighty-one Norfolk Street Strand London in the County of Middlesex in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Upon which occasion sir," [...] says the Major, [...] "Jemmy Jackman takes your hat off." [...] Mr. Buffle looks at his hat where the Major drops it on the floor, and he picks it up and puts it on again. [...] "Sir" [...] says the Major very red and looking him full in the face [...] "there are two quarters of the Gallantry Taxes due and the Collector has called." [...] Upon which if you can believe my words my dear the Major drops Mr. Buffle's hat off again. [...] "This--" [...] Mr. Buffle begins very angry with his pen in his mouth, when the Major steaming more and more says [...] "Take your bit out sir! Or by the whole infernal system of Taxation of this country and every individual figure in the National Debt, I'll get upon your back and ride you like a horse!" [...] which it's my belief he would have done and even actually jerking his neat little legs ready for a spring as it was. [...] "This," [...] says Mr. Buffle without his pen [...] "is an assault and I'll have the law of you." [...] "Sir" [...] replies the Major [...] "if you are a man of honour, your Collector of whatever may be due on the Honourable Assessment by applying to Major Jackman at the Parlours Mrs. Lirriper's Lodgings, may obtain what he wants in full at any moment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, what {{a pretty}} little girl!" [...] cried Betty, smiling and <b>nodding</b> <b>at</b> the other child, who smiled and <b>nodded</b> back <b>at</b> her. She {{did not know}} herself, never having had any glass but a quiet pool in the wood or the brook in the meadow.|$|R
60|$|He <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> her slightly, {{watching}} her fixedly, {{turning up the}} corners of his eyes slyly, his nose seeming slyly to sharpen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tis strange, the miser should his cares employ To gain those riches he can ne'er enjoy: Is it less strange, {{the prodigal}} should waste His wealth, to {{purchase}} what he ne'er can taste? Not for himself he sees, or hears, or eats; Artists must choose his pictures, music, meats: He buys for Topham, drawings and designs, For Pembroke, statues, dirty gods, and coins; Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone, And books for Mead, and butterflies for Sloane. Think we {{all these are}} for himself? no more Than his fine wife, alas! or finer w***e. [...] For what has Virro painted, built, and planted? Only to show, how many tastes he wanted. What brought Sir Visto's ill-got wealth to waste? Some demon whispered, [...] "Visto! have a taste." [...] Heaven visits with a taste the wealthy fool, And needs no rod but Ripley with a rule. See! sportive Fate, to punish awkward pride, Bids Bubo build, and sends him such a guide. A standing sermon, at each year's expense, That never coxcomb reached magnificence! [...] You show us, Rome was glorious, not profuse, And pompous buildings once were things of use. Yet shall, my lord, your just, your noble rules Fill half the land with imitating fools; Who random drawings from your sheets shall take, And of one beauty many blunders make; Load some vain church with old theatric state, Turn arcs of triumph to a garden-gate; Reverse your ornaments, and hang them all On some patched dog-hole eked with ends of wall; Then clap four slices of pilaster on 't, That, laced with bits of rustic, makes a front Shall call the winds through long arcades to roar, Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door; Conscious they act a true Palladian part, And, if they starve, they starve by rules of art. [...] Oft have you hinted to your brother peer A certain truth, which many buy too dear: Something there is more needful than expense, And something previous even to taste--'tis sense. Good sense, which only is the gift of Heaven, And though no science, fairly worth the seven: A light, which in yourself you must perceive: Jones and Le Notre have it not to give. [...] To build, to plant, whatever you intend, To rear the column, or the arch to bend, To swell the terrace, or to sink the grot; In all, let Nature never be forgot. But treat the goddess like a modest fair, Nor over-dress, nor leave her wholly bare; Let not each beauty everywhere be spied, Where half the skill is decently to hide. He gains all points, who pleasingly confounds, Surprises, varies, and conceals the bounds. [...] Consult {{the genius of the}} place in all; That tells the waters or to rise or fall, Or helps the ambitious hill the heavens to scale, Or scoops in circling theatres the vale; Calls in the country, catches opening glades, Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades; Now breaks, or now directs, the intending lines; Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs. [...] Still follow sense, of every art the soul, Parts answering parts shall slide into a whole, Spontaneous beauties all around advance, Start even from difficulty, strike from chance; Nature shall join you; Time shall make it grow A work to wonder at--perhaps a Stowe. [...] Without it, proud Versailles, thy glory falls; And Nero's terraces desert their walls: The vast parterres a thousand hands shall make; Lo! Cobham comes, and floats them with a lake: Or cut wide views through mountains to the plain, You'll wish your hill or sheltered seat again. Even in an ornament its place remark, Nor in a hermitage set Dr. Clarke. [...] Behold Villario's ten years' toil complete: His quincunx darkens, his espaliers meet; The wood supports the plain, the parts unite, And strength of shade contends with strength of light; A waving glow the bloomy beds display, Blushing in bright diversities of day, With silver-quivering rills meandered o'er-- Enjoy them, you! Villario can no more; Tired of the scene parterres and fountains yield, He finds at last he better likes a field. [...] Through his young woods how pleased Sabinus strayed, Or sat delighted in the thickening shade, With annual joy the reddening shoots to greet, Or see the stretching branches long to meet! His son's fine taste an opener vista loves, Foe to the Dryads of his father's groves; One boundless green, or flourished carpet views, With all the mournful family of yews; The thriving plants, ignoble broomsticks made, Now sweep those alleys they were born to shade. [...] At Timon's villa let us pass a day, Where all cry out, [...] "What sums are thrown away!" [...] So proud, so grand; of that stupendous air, Soft and agreeable come never there. Greatness, with Timon, dwells in such a draught As brings all Brobdingnag before your thought. To compass this, his building is a town, His pond an ocean, his parterre a down: Who but must laugh, the master when he sees, A puny insect, shivering at a breeze! Lo, what huge heaps of littleness around! The whole, a laboured quarry above ground; Two Cupids squirt before; a lake behind Improves the keenness of the northern wind. His gardens next your admiration call, On every side you look, behold the wall! No pleasing intricacies intervene, No artful wildness to perplex the scene; Grove <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> grove, each alley has a brother, And half the platform just reflects the other. The suffering eye inverted Nature sees, Trees cut to statues, statues thick as trees With here a fountain, never to be played; And there a summer-house, that knows no shade; Here Amphitrite sails through myrtle bowers; There gladiators fight or die in flowers; Unwatered see the drooping sea-horse mourn, And swallows roost in Nilus' dusty urn. [...] My lord advances with majestic mien, Smit with the mighty pleasure to be seen: But soft--by regular approach--not yet-- First through the length of yon hot terrace sweat; And when up ten steep slopes you've dragged your thighs, Just at his study door he'll bless your eyes. [...] His study! with what authors is it stored? In books, not authors, curious is my lord; To all their dated backs he turns you round: These Aldus printed, those Du Sueil has bound, Lo, some are vellum, and the rest as good For all his lordship knows, but they are wood. For Locke or Milton 'tis in vain to look; These shelves admit not any modern book. [...] And now the chapel's silver bell you hear, That summons you to all the pride of prayer; Light quirks of music, broken and uneven, Make the soul dance upon a jig to heaven. On painted ceilings you devoutly stare, Where sprawl the saints of Verrio or Laguerre, On gilded clouds in fair expansion lie, And bring all Paradise before your eye. To rest, the cushion and soft Dean invite, Who never mentions hell to ears polite. [...] But hark! the chiming clocks to dinner call; A hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall: The rich buffet well-coloured serpents grace, And gaping Tritons spew to wash your face. Is this a dinner? this a genial room? No, 'tis a temple, and a hecatomb. A solemn sacrifice, performed in state, You drink by measure, and to minutes eat. So quick retires each flying course, you'd swear Sancho's dread doctor and his wand were there. Between each act the trembling salvers ring, From soup to sweet-wine, and God bless the King. In plenty starving, tantalised in state, And complaisantly helped to all I hate, Treated, caressed, and tired, I take my leave, Sick of his civil pride from morn to eve; I curse such lavish cost and little skill, And swear no day was ever past so ill. [...] Yet hence the poor are clothed, the hungry fed; Health to himself, and to his infants bread The labourer bears; what his hard heart denies His charitable vanity supplies. [...] Another age shall see the golden ear Embrown the slope, and nod on the parterre, Deep harvests bury all his pride has planned, And laughing Ceres re-assume the land. [...] Who then shall grace, or who improve the soil? Who plants like Bathurst, or who builds like Boyle. 'Tis use alone that sanctifies expense, And splendour borrows all her rays from sense. [...] His father's acres who enjoys in peace, Or makes his neighbours glad, if he increase: Whose cheerful tenants bless their yearly toil, Yet to their lord owe more than to the soil; Whose ample lawns are not ashamed to feed The milky heifer and deserving steed; Whose rising forests, not for pride or show, But future buildings, future navies, grow: Let his plantations stretch from down to down, First shade a country, and then raise a town. [...] You too proceed! make falling arts your care, Erect new wonders, and the old repair; Jones and Palladio to themselves restore, And be whate'er Vitruvius was before: 'Till kings call forth the ideas of your mind (Proud to accomplish what such hands denied) Bid harbours open, public ways extend, Bid temples, worthier of the god, ascend; Bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain, The mole projected break the roaring main; Back to his bounds their subject sea command, And roll obedient rivers through the land: These honours peace to happy Britain brings, These are imperial works, and worthy kings.|$|E
