Scully suddenly feels nauseous, much to Billy's concern, but she quickly shakes it off. Later, while investigating the reported crash site, Scully is lifted and shaken just as Gary was. Mulder finds her nearly passed out on the ground.|$|E
500|$|According to Yorke, Radiohead {{hoped to}} achieve an [...] "atmosphere that's perhaps a bit {{shocking}} when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds." [...] They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. The exploratory approach was summarised by Jonny Greenwood as [...] "when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> they're gonna play on it." [...] One reviewer characterised OK Computer as sounding like [...] "a DIY electronica album made with guitars".|$|E
500|$|John Lennon once {{described}} {{his wife as}} [...] "the world's most famous unknown artist: everybody knows her name, but <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> she does."

In addition to Mekas, Maciunas, Young, and Warhol, she has also collaborated with DeAsis, Yvonne Rainer, and Zbigniew Rybczyński.|$|E

500|$|Michigan's defense forced three turnovers, sacked the Illinois quarterback four times, {{and held}} Illinois' offense to 37 rushing yards on 33 {{attempts}} {{for an average}} of 1.1 yards per carry. Mike Martin led the defense with nine tackles. After the game, Michigan's defensive coordinator Greg Mattison became emotional as he told reporters: [...] "That was a Michigan defense. ... <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> went on inside of these guys and for them to stick together and to play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it says a lot about them." [...] Defensive end Ryan Van Bergen, who recorded 2.5 sacks, three tackles for loss and seven tackles overall, was named the Big Ten's Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, the band were approached by their management about whom they wanted to produce their debut full-length album. They requested Colin Richardson; initially sceptical about their chances, Richardson agreed to collaborate after he listened to their demos. Fightstar entered studios in west London and Surrey with Richardson in October 2005. Richardson, who had previously produced albums for Funeral for a Friend, Machine Head and Fear Factory, was meticulous during pre-production and took five days to tune the drums. When recording began, he called the band [...] "very focused" [...] and {{said that there was}} a [...] "real buzz because <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> to expect." [...] Grand Unification is a loose concept album, influenced by and based on the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series. With lyrics loosely based on the personal experiences of Charlie Simpson and Alex Westaway, its underlying concept revolves around two people who experience the last few days of their lives {{before the end of the}} world.|$|E

Stasz notes that in his memoirs, Chaney refers to London's mother Flora Wellman as having been his [...] "wife"; he also cites an advertisement in which Flora called herself [...] "Florence Wellman Chaney".|$|E

2500|$|While doing {{press for}} Twin Peaks, he was again {{asked if he}} was retired from film and {{confirmed}} that he had made his last feature film, responding, [...] "Things changed a lot... So many films were not doing well at the box office even though they might have been great films and the things that were doing well at the box office weren't the things that I would want to do". Lynch later clarified that this statement had been misconstrued, and reiterated [...] "I did not say I quit cinema. Simply that <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> the future holds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Mbocor was sacrificed {{in order}} to bring animal life on Earth, the {{narrative}} is imprecise on the identity of this animal. Some postulates that it was probably the largest animal in Africa, perhaps a pachyderm such as: hippopotamus, rhinoceros, elephant, etc. The word Mbocor means [...] "The Mother" [...] (or [...] "Mother" [...] in old Serer) [...] − mother of all animals except the jackal. It is also probable that Mbocor is the same as Ɓoxo-koƥ (the dog of the forest − [...] "jackal"). However, at present, <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> kind of animal Mbocor was. In any case, the Ɓoxo-koƥ (i.e. the jackal) is believed by most Serers who adhere to the tenets of Serer religion to be the first living thing that the deity Roog (or Koox) put on Earth ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Joshua that from the day that the Temple was destroyed, there was no day without a curse, the dew had not descended for a blessing, and the flavor had {{departed}} from fruits.. Rava said that in addition, the curse of each day was severer than that of the preceding day, as [...] says, [...] "In the morning you shall say: Would God it were evening! And in the evening you shall say: Would God it were morning." [...] The Gemara asked which morning they would long for. If it would be the morning of the next day, <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> that will be like. Therefore, reasoned the Gemara, {{it must have been the}} morning of the previous day (because the previous day would have been less severe than the current day, and therefore they longed for its return)..|$|E

2500|$|Following a bye week, Michigan {{returned}} home to face Purdue in its homecoming game. Michigan handily defeated Purdue, 36–14. Michigan then traveled to Iowa City, Iowa to face Iowa. Michigan suffered its second and final defeat of the season, losing 24–16. Michigan then traveled to Champaign, Illinois for its final road game to face Illinois. Michigan won 31–14, with the defense performing in a matter that made Greg Mattison, Michigan's defensive coordinator, emotional as he told reporters: [...] "That was a Michigan defense. ... <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> went on inside of these guys and for them to stick together and to play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it {{says a lot about}} them."

2500|$|In 1917, Michigan {{was short}} of backfield talent, and Coach Yost moved Wieman again, {{this time from}} tackle to fullback. [...] With his weight {{increased}} to 194 pounds, Wieman played eight games at fullback and one at left tackle, and [...] "starred in each position." [...] An October 1917 newspaper account described Wieman's value to the team as follows:"Yost's one lucky move seems to hinge on the recent change of 'Tad' Wieman from tackle to fullback. [...] Wieman is a giant who musters nearly 200 pounds of actual muscle. [...] This is only his third year in the university, but he already was talked of a sure all-American tackle. [...] Shifting him to fullback may have ruined his chances of making Camp's all-American this year, but it undoubtedly will save the Michigan team. [...] The whole Michigan offense will be built around Wieman. [...] He has developed the plunging habit that results in big gains every time he tries it in scrimmage. [...] Wieman also is a lad who can use his head. [...] <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> Yost would do if Wieman got laid out, {{but he is not}} the type of man that is likely to spend any time flat on his back. [...] As a kicker, Wieman is beginning to shine too, scoring from drop and place kicks in scrimmage after only a few days of practice in the toe art." ...|$|E
