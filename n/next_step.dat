5|$|After the 1922 elections, Cotillo {{became the}} {{chairman}} of the influential State Senate Judiciary Committee, a sign of his rising authority. The post helped him to get ready for a <b>next</b> <b>step.</b> In 1924, he was the first Italian-born to become Justice of the New York Supreme Court, First District, where he would he remain until his death. He was elected with the endorsement of the Tammany Hall political machine, many social welfare organizations and organized labor, the Citizen's Union and several bar organizations.|$|E
5|$|Dividing a(x) by b(x) {{yields a}} {{remainder}} r0(x) = x3 + (2/3) x2 + (5/3) x − (2/3). In the <b>next</b> <b>step,</b> b(x) is divided by r0(x) yielding a remainder r1(x) = x2 + x + 2. Finally, dividing r0(x) by r1(x) yields a zero remainder, indicating that r1(x) {{is the greatest}} common divisor polynomial of a(x) and b(x), consistent with their factorization.|$|E
5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization and in the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Hans Kelker {{succeeded in}} synthesizing a {{substance}} that had a nematic phase at room temperature, MBBA, {{which is one of}} the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> {{was to take}} an oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, {{at the age of}} 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E

5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the <b>next</b> <b>step,</b> the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E

The 48-bit machine they completed in November 1953 was the world's first transistor computer, with 550 diodes and 92 transistors, and was manufactured by STC. An improved version completed in April 1955 had 1,300 diodes and 200 transistors, and was sold by Metropolitan-Vickers as the Metrovick 950.|$|E
5|$|Emma's ghost {{appears to}} Craven {{and tells him}} {{of a time when}} black flowers grew, warming the Earth and {{preventing}} life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland {{with the rest of the}} plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity.|$|E

5|$|Prior to any {{transfer}} of cargo, the chief officer must develop a transfer plan detailing {{specifics of the}} operation such as how much cargo will be moved, which tanks will be cleaned, and how the ship's ballasting will change. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> before a transfer is the pretransfer conference. The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic {{projection}} neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate {{as opposed to the}} inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps, each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the <b>next</b> <b>step,</b> Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell. Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Fort Mohave {{began the process}} of military subjugation of the Mohave, and the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> was the establishment of reservations. In 1863, Charles Debrille Poston, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the US against the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed {{an important step in}} establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave.|$|E

5|$|The new route turned {{west from}} Muong May, at the {{southern}} end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually, this network extended past Siem Prang and reached the Mekong River near Stung Treng. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> was the seizure of the town of Kratie, in east central Cambodia, on 5 May. The 470th cleared the population out of the Mekong River town and turned it into its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains and then east again to cross the border.|$|E

On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
