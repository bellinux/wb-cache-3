40|$|The {{employment}} structure in Britain has been changing rapidly {{over the last}} two decades, with the growing importance of <b>non-manual</b> <b>work,</b> the expansion of the service sector, the rapid spread of new technology, the increase in women's employment and the re-emergence of mass unemployment. These developments have altered fundamentally the research agenda of the sociology of employment. At the same time, there has been a major shift in the theoretical approaches to the employment relationship. There has been a movement away from the "closed system" assumptions of traditional industrial sociology and a growing awareness of the central importance of the values and beliefs of employers and employees, the pattern of industrial relations and the structure of the labour market...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{document}} {{changes in the}} distribution of employment in the UK labour market in the 1980 s. I use two longitudinal data sources, an industry-level panel data set between 1979 and 1990 and the panel component of the 1984 and 1990 establishment-level Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys. There is evidence of a considerable shift towards the increased relative use of what may be termed more skilled labour (i. e. towards <b>non-manual</b> <b>work,</b> away from manual work and towards more highly educated labour). This seems to be principally driven by within-industry and establishment factors rather than by industry/establishment shifts in product demand. There is some support for the notion that manual employment saving changes, perhaps due to the increased use of computer technology and/or innovation, are of empirical importance. To form a more complete picture, however, one probably needs to look wider than this...|$|E
500|$|Because {{records from}} the period are {{incomplete}} and inconsistent in format, {{the total number of}} bal maidens working in this period is unclear. Estimates for the total number employed {{at the end of the}} 18thcentury range from 1,200 to 5,000, with women and children constituting up to half the total number of people working in copper mining and a lower proportion in the less labour-intensive tin mining. Mayers(2008) estimates that at a minimum 55,000 women and girls in total worked as bal maidens between 1720 and 1921, based on an estimate of each working an average of 10 years, with the number peaking in the early 1860s at at least 7,000. The actual figures are likely to have been considerably higher; not all mines recorded male and female workers separately, and after 1872 there may have been deliberate under-reporting of the [...] number of children working, owing to legal restrictions on their employment. These estimates do not include female workers performing <b>non-manual</b> administrative <b>work</b> at the mines, nor those in related industries such as slate and [...] quarrying.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on two {{important}} questions. First, how can we explain changes in the employment position of England's racialized minority groups {{over the past three}} decades? And second, why have these changes taken place at a different pace for different minority groups? It is argued that much of the increase in Asian self-employment represents working-class accommodation to the inferior conditions of employment available under neo-liberal modernity rather than evidence of upward social mobility as current orthodoxy claims. It is also contended that the growing representation of minorities in junior <b>non-manual</b> <b>work</b> was driven by anti-racist activism around a racialized 'black' identity & confirms the continuing significance of 'race' in the English labour market. By unravelling the complex relationship between the geographical distribution of different minority groups, their educational qualifications, anti-racist activism, & racism, the study establishes why such employment change has taken place at a different pace for different minority groups...|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} carpal tunnel syndrome in candidates for bariatric surgery comparing with the non-obese population and verify the effects on it of bariatric treatment. Methods:We studiedthree groups of individuals: 1) patients waiting for bariatric surgery (preoperative); 2) individuals who had already undergone the procedure (postoperative); and 3) control group. We collected demographic and clinical data of carpal tunnel syndrome. The Ultrasound examination was carried out to diagnose the syndrome by measuring the median nerve area. Results:We included 329 individuals (114 in the preoperative group, 90 in the postoperative group and 125 controls). There was a higher prevalence of paresthesias (p= 0. 0003), clinical tests (p= 0. 0083) on the preoperative group when compared with controls (p< 0. 00001). There were lowe levels of paresthesias (p= 0. 0002) and median nerve area (p= 0. 04) in postoperative patients but with {{no significant difference in}} general.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the gender differences in association of some behavioural and socioeconomic factors with obesity indices in a population-based sample of 12, 514 Iranian adults. The mean body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were significantly higher in women than in men. Current and passive smoking had an inverse association with BMI among males whereas current smoking, transportation by a private car, and longer duration of watching television (TV) had a positive association with BMI among females. Current and passive smoking, cycling, and Global Dietary Index (GDI) had an inverse association with WC among males. Higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, current and passive smoking, duration of daily sleep, and GDI had an inverse association with WC among females. Using a private car for transportation had a significant positive association with WHR among both males and females. Living in an urban area, being married, and having a higher education level increased the odds ratio of obesity among both the genders. <b>Non-manual</b> <b>work</b> also increased this risk among males whereas watching TV and current smoking increased this risk among females. Such gender differences should be considered for culturally-appropriate interventional strategies to be implemented at the population level for tackling obesity and associated cardiometabolic risk factors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMeasurement {{of middle}} class {{is not an easy}} task due to several reasons. Firstly, it impose the {{elaboration}} of a classification of population into social classes, for which it is necessary to take into consideration some objective criteria, as level of incomes, occupation or level of education, skills or others, but also subjective criteria as the prestige of the profession or company, manual or <b>non-manual</b> character of <b>work,</b> social category of family or residential area where person was born. Bigger the number of criteria taken into account is, bigger the subjectivity of the classification is. Another difficult issue is related to the availability of data sources allowing the estimation of middle class. Ordinary data sources, namely the sample surveys, use major classifications’ classes, which make less detailed the analysis. This article proposes to present a first perspective, strictly quantitative, regarding the measurement of middle class in Romania, through the indicator of population's incomes. The authors use two approaches in order to estimate middle class: an absolute one and a relative one. In the relative approach, the {{middle class is}} defines as the category of persons which represents one third from the total population, that third which carry-out the median part of the income distribution. On the contrary, in the absolute approach, the middle class contains the persons which have the incomes included in the second interval of the income distribution. For each of those two approaches, the article presents the main characteristics of the persons defined as middle class. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{goals of}} this study were to {{establish}} the occupational outcome after surgery in patients with a rotator cuff tear from a work-related injury (WRI) or occupational disease (OD) and determine which factors and conditions affected return to work. Hypothesis: return to work was possible for this type of patient. This questionnaire-based study comprised 262 shoulders in 254 patients with a WRI/OD who had surgery performed on their shoulder between 2000 and 2005. The average age was 50. 5 ± 6. 4 years. The following variables were analysed: employment status (private sector, self-employed, government employee), type of <b>work</b> (<b>non-manual,</b> manual, heavy manual labour), nature of tendon injury and surgical technique (open, mini-open and arthroscopy). Return to work occurred in 59. 5 % of the cases. Factors that prevented return to work (40. 4 % of the cases) included retirement (14. 1 %), an unrelated medical condition (10. 3 %), and the outcome of the operated shoulder (16. 0 %). Age had an impact on return to work (P< 5 × 10 − 4). The type of work and nature of tendon injury did not affect return to work, but did affect time away from work. Employment status and surgical technique had an effect on return to work, but not on time away from work. Age was a decisive factor for return to work. Retirement seemed to be the most common choice starting at 55 years of age. Arthroscopy seemed to have reduced the impact of the WRI on the results, particularly on the time away from work. A preoperative evaluation of the patient's probability of returning to work should be done based on occupational and injury features. There may be a longer delay in returning to work for certain profiles of work (manual labour) and tendon injury. Patient management can be improved by knowing the factors and conditions that influence return to work. Level of evidenceLevel IV - Retrospective study...|$|R
40|$|Middle {{childhood}} (6 to 12 {{years of}} age) {{is a crucial}} period of lifespan career development. Children in this age span are capable of understanding the occupational world in a relatively realistic way and have begun {{to learn about the}} world of work and to develop stereotypical career perspectives. Parents {{play a significant role in}} children’s career development. However, compared with adolescents and adults, much less research has been conducted on child career development, let alone on how parents influence such development. Furthermore, most extant research and theories in the field of child career development are based on western contexts, which may limit their application to other cultural contexts, including mainland China. Compared with western cultures, the emphasis of xiao (孝: filial piety), a core concept in Confucian culture, in addition to the one-child policy in mainland China makes the only child the focus of family attention, which suggests that Chinese parents may be more influential in the career development of their children than their western counterparts. Such a unique cultural context demonstrates the significance of examining child career development and the influence of parents in mainland China. The aim of this study was to explore mainland Chinese children’s career development, in particular career knowledge and career aspirations, and how parents influence children’s career development in middle childhood. The exploratory nature of the research and the focus on the process of how parents influence children’s career development justified the use of a qualitative research approach. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as a qualitative research approach allows the researcher to gain indepth understanding of the participants’ lived experience through interpretation of the participants’ sense making of their experiences and by focusing on a small homogenous sample. Based on IPA, 10 fifth-grade Chinese children and both of their biological parents were recruited through a key public school in Beijing. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, supplemented by a demographic questionnaire to collect background information from both children and parents. Each child was invited to do a drawing of the career they aspired to in order to stimulate their interest in the research topic and thus to elicit rich data. A one-to-one interview was conducted with each child, each father and each mother. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis followed guidelines suggested for researchers using IPA and was conducted one interview at a time by coding themes and superordinate themes. The researcher then identified patterns (superordinate themes) first across children and then across parents, after which a comparison were made to identify the commonalities and differences between the parents and the children. The results show that the mainland Chinese children, like their western counterparts, were capable of understanding the world of work. They gained knowledge of work activities, career rewards, career requirements, work conditions and career gender appropriateness. Based on such knowledge, they envisioned their future in the world of work by matching their intrapersonal characteristics and values and beliefs to the careers. Their interests, as well as the value of education, were the primary reason for aspiring to a career while gender was an important reason to rule out careers. The children demonstrated agency in learning about careers from their parents, especially their mothers. The parents generally considered it was too early to think about their children’s future careers and thus did not perceive their role as an intentional influence on child career development. Even so, they admitted they have played a role in their children’s career development. They encouraged their children to make independent career decisions based on their interests as well as other intrapersonal characteristics; they conveyed their values and beliefs, especially the importance of education for future career pursuits, and their career expectations for children to engage in high-income, <b>non-manual</b> and non-tiring <b>work.</b> The mainland Chinese parents therefore, on the one hand, paid great attention to the intrapersonal characteristics of their children; on the other hand, they conveyed parental expectation for children to pursue high-status careers, especially by repeatedly emphasising education. Such influence reflects a mix of western and eastern ideologies, and could lead to internal conflict in the children’s future career decision making. The findings suggest a need to support mainland Chinese children’s career development learning through systematic career learning programs, as well as the possibility of applying western theories to mainland Chinese children’s career development. Meanwhile, the findings emphasise the importance of cultural influence in career development and reinforce the need for the internationalisation of career development theory, research and practice...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Aims: Since the 1990 s {{illicit drug}} use death rates in Australia have {{increased}} markedly. There is a notable gap in knowledge about changing socio-economic inequalities in drug use death rates. Some limited Australian and overseas data point to higher rates of drug death in the lowest socio-economic groups, but the paucity of available studies and their sometimes conflicting findings need to be addressed. Design and Methods: This paper uses data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to examine changes in age-standardised drug-induced mortality rates for Australian males over the period 1981 – 2002. Socio-economic status was categorised as manual or <b>non-manual</b> <b>work</b> status. Results: With the rapid increase in drug-induced mortality rates in the 1990 s, there was a parallel increase in socio-economic inequalities in drug-induced deaths. The decline in drug death rates from 2000 onwards {{was associated with a}} decline in socio-economic inequalities. By 2002, manual workers had drug death rates well over twice the rate of non-manual workers. Discussion: Three factors are identified which contribute to these socio-economic inequalities in mortality. First, there has been an age shift in deaths evident only for manual workers. Secondly, there has been an increase in availability until 1999 and a relative decline in the cost of the drug, which most often leads to drug death (heroin). Thirdly, there has been a shift to amphetamine use which may lead to significant levels of morbidity, but few deaths. [Najman JM, Toloo G, Williams GM.

40|$|The {{internet}} and mobilisation {{of information and}} communication technologies (ICTs) have made <b>non-manual</b> <b>work</b> increasingly portable and remotely accessible. As a result, a considerable number of employees use their ICTs to engage in work-related tasks during designated non-work time, even without contractual obligation. However, existing research on such voluntary work-related ICT use remains fragmented and spread across disciplines. We conducted a narrative review of 56 studies to identify themes in existing research, synthesise the evidence base, as well as identify gaps in our understanding. We identify five themes, namely: (1) Social-normative organisational context, (2) Job-related characteristics and work processes, (3) Person characteristics, (4) Designated non-work time and well-being, and (5) Empowerment/Enslavement Paradox. A conceptual model of voluntary ICT use is developed by integrating the identified themes with existing organisational research, outlining the relationships between the identified themes and voluntary ICT use. In the discussion, we emphasise the need for more conceptual clarity on voluntary ICT use and related constructs, and for the integration of different disciplines and methodological approaches to advance knowledge in the field. We further identify person-centred research as critical future avenue to explore different ICT user types. Additionally, more research into the mechanisms and moderating influences regarding voluntary ICT use and its outcomes is considered advisable to advance our knowledge on the Empowerment/Enslavement Paradox and its potential resolution. We conclude with preliminary implications to inform practice, addressing the need for employers to provide control over voluntary ICT use, as well as employees enacting this control...|$|E
40|$|Two {{logistic}} binomial {{models for}} neonatal mortality (under 1 month) and post-neonatal mortality {{were used to}} determine the probability of dying among families in Malawi. Data was obtained from 3043 women aged 15 - 54 years on 6258 births, which occurred 0 - 15 years before the survey, from the 1988 Malawi Traditional and Modern Methods of Child Spacing Survey. Mortality included 211 post-neonatal deaths, 147 toddler deaths, and 172 child deaths. Missing information or date of death missing information pertained to 182 reported deaths that were excluded from the analysis. Logistic models were run with the complete sample and the sub-sample and found to have similar results. Findings showed that children born in homes with electricity had 34 % lower risk of dying than children born in homes without electricity. Preceding birth interval was unrelated to neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality rates were significantly higher in Chiradzulu rural area, which was found to have a lower proportion of mothers with five or more years of education. The random term, which was high, suggested a high familial correlation with neonatal mortality risk. Findings showed that families with favorable characteristics living in the Chiradzulu area had a probability of 0. 005 of a neonatal death. Low risk families in unfavorable circumstances had lower probabilities of child loss than high risk families with favorable conditions. Significant determinants of post-neonatal mortality were preceding birth interval, maternal education, father's occupation, and geographic area. Women with 9 or more years of education had lower infant mortality risks. Family effects were significant, even after controlling for socioeconomic conditions. The most favorable conditions for child survival were: no preceding child; a preceding birth interval of 19 months or longer; maternal education of 9 or more years; and paternal employment in <b>non-manual</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E

Method As part of a community-based study called Isfahan Healthy Heart Program, we studied 17 593 individuals older than 19 living in {{the central part of}} Iran. Demographic and socioeconomic factors (age, sex, occupation status, marital status, and educational level) and lifestyle variables (smoking status, leisure time physical activity, and psychological distress), and coping strategy were recorded. Data were analyzed by Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression. Results Not smoking (women β = - 11. 293, P < 0. 001; men β = - 3. 418, P = 0. 007), having leisure time physical activity (women β = 0. 017, P = 0. 046; men β = 0. 005, P = 0. 043), and higher educational level (women β = 0. 344, P = 0. 015; men β = 0. 406, P = 0. 008) were predictors of adaptive coping strategies, while smoking (women β = 11. 849, P < 0. 001; men β = 9. 336, P < 0. 001), high stress level (women β = 1. 588, P = 0. 000; men β = 1. 358, P < 0. 001), and lower educational level (women β = - 0. 443, P = 0. 013; men β = - 0. 427, P = 0. 013) were predictors of maladaptive coping strategies in both sexes. <b>Non-manual</b> <b>work</b> was a positive predictor of adaptive (β = 4. 983, P < 0. 001) and negative predictor of maladaptive (β = - 3. 355, P = 0. 023) coping skills in men.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the {{morbidity}} and mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in obese individuals, as measured by different obesity measurements, and to explore how the CVD risk related to obesity was modified by other biologic and socio-demographic circumstances. Data from two population-based cohort studies was used. The Malmö Preventive Project included 22 444 middle-aged men, with a mean follow-up of 17. 7 years. In a subcohort of 6193 men, information on inflammatory proteins was available. The Malmö Diet and Cancer Study included 28 098 men and women, with a mean follow-up of 7. 6 years. National and local registers were used to follow the incidence of coronary events (CE), stroke and mortality. Body mass index (BMI) was an independent risk factor for CE and mortality in men. However, the risk associated with obesity was increased by exposure to other atherosclerotic risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia), of which smoking {{seemed to be the}} most important. Obesity was more prevalent in men with manual work and in men living alone, than in men with <b>non-manual</b> <b>work</b> and in cohabiting men. Adjusted for lifestyle and biological risk factors, the increased risk of CE and death for obese men with manual jobs was applicable only to those who were single. There was a positive interaction between obesity and living alone for incidence of CE. Increased BMI was related to plasma levels of inflammation-sensitive proteins (ISP) in men. The CVD risk varied widely between obese or overweight men with high and low ISP. Body fat percentage (BF%), measured by bioelectrical impedance method, was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in men and women. BF% was a stronger CVD risk factor in women than in men. The raised CVD risk associated with high BF% was reduced by physical activity. Body fat distribution as measured by waist hip ratio (WHR) was associated with increased CVD risk. WHR added to the CVD risk in women at all levels of BMI and in men with normal weight. It is concluded that the susceptibility to CVD in obese people differs substantially according to subsets of other biologic and socio-demographic circumstances...|$|E
