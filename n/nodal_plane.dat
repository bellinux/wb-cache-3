For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate <b>nodal</b> <b>plane</b> was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} imprint of <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> in {{high-order}} harmonic spectra from aligned diatomic molecules in intense laser fields whose components exhibit orthogonal polarizations. We show that the typical suppression in the spectra associated to <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> is distorted, and that this distortion can be employed to map the electron's angle of return to its parent ion. This investigation is performed semi-analytically at the single-molecule response and single-active orbital level, using the strong-field approximation and the steepest descent method. We show that the velocity form of the dipole operator is superior to the length form in providing information about this distortion. However, both forms introduce artifacts that are absent in the actual momentum-space wavefunction. Furthermore, elliptically polarized fields lead to larger distortions in comparison to two-color orthogonally polarized fields. These features are investigated in detail for O_ 2, whose highest occupied molecular orbital provides two orthogonal <b>nodal</b> <b>planes.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{properties}} of incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) {{order in the}} Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is studied by solving the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equations. The relationship between the electronic structure and the magnetic structure is clarified. We find that the magnetic structure in the AFM-FFLO state includes three cases. (I) In the strongly localized case, the AFM staggered moment is confined into the FFLO <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> where the superconducting order parameter vanishes. (II) In the weakly localized case, the AFM staggered moment appears in the whole spatial region, and its magnitude is enhanced around the FFLO <b>nodal</b> <b>planes.</b> (III) In the extended case, the AFM staggered moment is nearly homogeneous and slightly suppressed {{in the vicinity of}} FFLO <b>nodal</b> <b>planes.</b> The structure of Bragg peaks in the momentum resolved structure factor is studied in each case. We discuss the possibility of AFM-FFLO state in the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn 5 by comparing these results with the neutron scattering data of CeCoIn 5. Experimentally the magnetic structure and its dependence on the magnetic field orientation in the high field superconducting phase of CeCoIn 5 are consistent with the case (II). 1...|$|R
40|$|In many situations, it is {{difficult}} to identify confidently the fault plane from among the two <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> of an earthquake focal mechanism solution because of the symmetry of elastic wave radiation from a double-couple mechanism. Occasion-ally, the selection of the fault plane can be made from the orientation of a surface scarp, the alignment of aftershocks along one of the <b>nodal</b> <b>planes,</b> or directivity studies. In this paper, we demonstrate that an accurate knowledge of stress in a region also may constrain the choice of the fault plane since, in many cases, only one of the <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> and its associated slip vector is consistent with a given set of principal stress directions. In assessing regional stresses from focal mechanisms it is often assumed that the P, B, and T axes coincide with the al, a 2, and a 3 directions, respectively; this choice is convenient because it doesn't require specification of the fault plane. However, as many others have recognized (e. g., McKenzie, 1969; Raleigh et al., 1972; Sbar, 1982), the P and T axes actually indicate principal shortening and lengthening (strain) directions which may deviate significantly from the principal stress axes. ...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, we {{can compare}} the two optimal focal {{mechanisms}} of the tremors to the focal mechanisms of shallow crustal earthquakes studied by Matsumoto et al. (2013). We found {{that one of the}} <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> has a similar strike angle to that of the shallow earthquakes. Considering the principal stress directions estimated by Matsumoto et al. (2013) shown in Fig.  6 a, the similar <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> of the tremors and crustal earthquakes are favorably oriented under the current stress field. This could imply that both the shallow earthquakes and the tremors in this region are generated under the same tectonic stress conditions. In addition, the Hinagu fault zone at the surface has similar strike direction to one of the <b>nodal</b> <b>planes</b> of optimal focal mechanisms estimated in this study. This implies the possibility that the tremors occurred on a fault plane forming a downward extension of the Hinagu fault zone. The similarity of strike angles of the fault planes suggests that the active fault, the shallow earthquakes, and the tremors represent a fault system reaching from the surface to the lower crust as described in Iio et al. (2004). This geometrical relationship indicates that the tremors are a phenomenon reflecting the loading process of the crustal earthquakes.|$|R
