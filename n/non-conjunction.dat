5000|$|To {{solve the}} paradox we say: {{we should not}} concede that if it is false then one of his {{sentences}} (kalām) is true. For its being true is taken to be the conjunction of its being true and being false. Therefore its being false necessitates the <b>non-conjunction</b> of its being true and being false. And the <b>non-conjunction</b> of its being true and being false does not necessitateits being true.|$|E
5000|$|The stroke {{is named}} after Henry M. Sheffer, who in 1913 {{published}} a paper in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society (Sheffer 1913) providing an axiomatization of Boolean algebras using the stroke, and proved its equivalence to a standard formulation thereof by Huntington employing the familiar operators of propositional logic (and, or, not). Because of self-duality of Boolean algebras, Sheffer's axioms are equally valid for either of the NAND or NOR operations {{in place of the}} stroke. Sheffer interpreted the stroke as a sign for nondisjunction (NOR) in his paper, mentioning <b>non-conjunction</b> only in a footnote and without a special sign for it. It was Jean Nicod who first used the stroke as a sign for <b>non-conjunction</b> (NAND) in a paper of 1917 and which has since become current practice. Russell and Whitehead used the Sheffer stroke in the 1927 second edition of Principia Mathematica and suggested it as a replacement for the [...] "or" [...] and [...] "not" [...] operations of the first edition.|$|E
30|$|Participants’ {{assessments}} of comprehensibility showed {{a main effect}} of congruity, F(1, 27)[*]=[*] 20.72, p[*]<[*] 0.001 : incongruous sequences were viewed as less comprehensible than congruous ones. A main effect of Structure, F(1, 27)[*]=[*] 5.8, p[*]<[*] 0.05, and a Structure[*]×[*]Congruence interaction, F(1, 27)[*]=[*] 8.6, p[*]<[*] 0.01, arose because Incongruous <b>Non-Conjunction</b> sequences (M[*]=[*] 0.58, SD[*]=[*] 0.11) were less comprehensible than Incongruous Conjunction sequences (M[*]=[*] 0.65, SD[*]=[*] 0.1). However, no difference in comprehensibility appeared between Congruous <b>Non-Conjunction</b> (M[*]=[*] 0.81, SD[*]=[*] 0.07) and Congruous Conjunction (M[*]=[*] 0.80, SD[*]=[*] 0.07) sequences. In posttest questionnaires, 61 % of participants (17 of 28) without prompting noted that characters disappeared/changed in the sequence (i.e., congruous vs. incongruous). No participants explicitly distinguished Conjunction and <b>Non-Conjunction</b> sequences.|$|E
30|$|The similar P 600 amplitudes for Congruous Conjunctions and Incongruous <b>Non-Conjunctions</b> are {{consistent}} with equivalent updating processes triggered by an unexpected character change. In the case of Congruous Conjunctions, the panels shift from one character to another while maintaining sequence congruity. In the case of Incongruous <b>Non-Conjunctions,</b> a character, incongruous with the prior expectations established by the sequence, {{is added to the}} scene. The even larger P 600 to Incongruous Conjunctions indicates that more effortful or substantive updating may be required when character changes co-occur with the need to draw inferences, in this case about a common spatial environment. Such a response may also indicate an interaction between spatial/referential updating and reanalysis for the narrative structure. Overall, the P 600 findings accord with ongoing mental updating of referential and spatial information, consistent with both VNG (Cohn, 2014 a; Cohn & Kutas, 2015) and models reliant on perceptuo-semantic information (Bateman & Wildfeuer, 2014; Magliano & Zacks, 2011).|$|R
30|$|As predicted, at the {{critical}} panel, we observed an ERP index of mental model updating in a late (400 – 900  ms) posterior positivity (Brouwer et al., 2012; Donchin & Coles, 1988). In line with reports of P 600 s to referential changes in discourse (e.g., Nieuwland & Van Berkum, 2005; Van Berkum et al., 2007), {{we also found}} that the P 600 s were modulated both by conjunctions and referential incongruities. We take the larger positivity to Congruous Conjunctions than <b>Non-Conjunctions</b> as indexing the mental updating process of incorporating each character into a common space, and/or the revision of the narrative structure (Cohn et al., 2014; Cohn & Kutas, 2015), consistent with the reanalyses of syntactic structure in language (Brown & Hagoort, 2000; Brown et al., 2000; Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992) and music (Patel et al., 1998).|$|R
30|$|A {{posterior}} positivity (P 600) began around 400  ms {{and lasted}} past 900  ms (see Fig.  5), peaking near 550  ms. Conjunctions were more positive than <b>Non-Conjunctions,</b> and, with this same pattern, Incongruities were more positive than Congruities. This effect {{had a slight}} left posterior distribution. The start of this posterior effect in the 300 – 500  ms epoch was suggested by an interaction by Congruence and AP Distribution, F(3, 81)[*]=[*] 3.98, p[*]<[*] 0.05. In both the 500 – 700  ms and 700 – 900  ms epochs, we found a main effect of Congruence (all F[*]>[*] 6.4, all p[*]<[*] 0.05), along with interactions between Congruence and Laterality (all F[*]>[*] 4.2, all p[*]<[*] 0.051), and between Structure, Hemisphere, AP Distribution, and Laterality (all F[*]>[*] 5.4, all p[*]<[*] 0.005). In the 700 – 900  ms epoch, we also found an interaction between Congruence and Structure with AP Distribution, F(3, 81)[*]=[*] 6.6, p[*]<[*] 0.01, and Laterality, F(3, 81)[*]=[*] 4.6, p[*]<[*] 0.05.|$|R
3000|$|To {{examine the}} effect of comic reading {{experience}} on conjunction processing, we compared the responses to the panels in Conjunction and <b>Non-Conjunction</b> sequences collapsed across congruity after averaging the amplitudes across all four scalp quadrants. Regression analysis for the 300 – 500  ms epoch indicated that the frequency of reading Japanese manga while growing up was the only reliable predictor (β[*]=[*]– 0.57, p[*]<[*] 0.05); no other predictor approached significance (all p[*]>[*] 0.183).

30|$|We {{examined}} ERPs to {{the critical}} panel in the binned epochs of 300 – 500  ms, 500 – 700  ms, and 700 – 900  ms. Our omnibus within-subjects ANOVA looked for main effects and interactions of Structure (Conjunction vs. <b>Non-Conjunction)</b> and Congruence (Congruous vs. Incongruous) across 16 electrode sites that evenly divided eight electrodes each into factors of Hemisphere (left, right), Anterior–Posterior Distribution (prefrontal, frontal, parietal, and occipital) and Laterality (lateral, medial), as depicted in Fig.  4. We used a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} comic reading experience, we calculated the mean amplitude of the Conjunction minus <b>Non-Conjunction</b> sequences (collapsed across congruity) and averaged across all 16 electrodes from all four quadrants of the scalp (Fig.  4). We used a logistic regression to analyze these means by setting participants’ frequency ratings for reading habits of specific types of comics as predictors (see Table  1). We performed the same analysis for congruency (Incongruous minus Congruous). We followed significant findings by again running our ANOVA, but also including the measurements for any significant predictors as covariates.|$|E
30|$|We created 100 {{sequences}} 5 – 7 {{panels in}} length using wordless images from The Complete Peanuts by Charles Schulz (1952 – 1974), as in prior research (e.g., Cohn et al., 2014; Cohn & Maher, 2015; Cohn, Paczynski, et al., 2012 a). Sequences began {{with at least}} one panel introducing both characters within the same spatial environment, as in Fig.  3. Congruous <b>Non-Conjunction</b> (CNC) sequences then showed both characters again in an initiating state (Initial), followed by a critical panel “zooming in” on only the second character (Fig.  3 a). Congruous Conjunction (CC) sequences divided this Initial panel, by showing the first character in one panel and the second character in the subsequent critical panel (Fig.  3 b). Incongruous sequences started by substituting a different character for the one ultimately appearing in the critical panel. Incongruous <b>Non-Conjunction</b> (INC) sequences began with different characters, which then changed in the critical panel (Fig.  3 c), while Incongruous Conjunction (IC) sequences began with two characters, showed the first character, and then switched in the critical panel (Fig.  3 d). Thus, the same critical panels appeared across all sequence types, either at the third or fourth position in the sequence. Sequences were counterbalanced in a Latin Square Design into four lists such that no list repeated strips. One hundred filler sequences featured varying degrees of coherence to further increase the heterogeneity of the stimuli and reduce the possibility of participants detecting our experimental manipulations.|$|E
40|$|Human vision often {{needs to}} encode {{multiple}} characteristics of many {{elements of the}} visual field, for example their lightness and orien-tation. The paradigm of visual search allows a quantitative assessment of {{the function of the}} underlying mechanisms. It measures the ability to detect a target element among a set of distractor elements. We asked whether Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients are particularly affected in one type of search, where the target is defined by a conjunction of features (orientation and lightness) and where performance depends on some shifting of attention. Two <b>non-conjunction</b> control conditions were employed. The first was a pre-attentive, single-feature, “pop-out” task, detecting a vertical target among horizontal distractors. The second was a single-feature, partly attentive task in which the target element was slightly larger than the distractors—a “size ” task. This was chosen to have a similar level of attentional load as the conjunction task (for the control group), but lacked the conjunction of two features. In an experiment, 15 AD patients were compared to age-matched controls. The results suggested that AD patients have a particular impairment in the conjunction task but not in the single-feature size or pre-attentive tasks. This may imply that AD particularly affects those mechanisms which compare across more than one feature type, and spares the other systems and is not therefore simply an ‘attention-related ’ impairment. Additionally, these findings show a double dissociation wit...|$|E
40|$|THE {{origin of}} species is {{the origin of the}} {{difference}} between two species. The existence of a peculiar difference between good species, which does not exist between varieties, has long been realised by systematists and others. This essential difference expresses itself, in part, in flowering plants, in the abortion of pollen and ovules in the hybrids, which springs, in typical cases: (a) from a different distribution of genes between two or more chromosome pairs; so that vital genes are omitted after the reduction division in {{some or all of the}} groups of chromosomes of the F 1 of the cross. An example of this is probably afforded by the crosses of certain species of Stizolobium (Mucuna) (Zeitsch. f. ind. Abst. u. Vererb., pp. 303 - 342, 1914), two non-homologous chromosomes appearing to have interchanged genes in one of the species. In the second case (b) the attraction between chromosomes which should be homologous fails in the reduction divisions of the F 1 plant, so that <b>non-conjunction</b> (Journal of Genetics, 1925) takes place with regard to one or more pairs. Thus there is an absence of vital chromosomes or the presence of extra chromosomes in some of the pollen and ovules. This is illustrated by the two cannas ``Austria'' and ``Italia'', which belong no doubt, as their history states, to the F 1 of species crosses. In `` Austria'', for example, the 18 single chromosomes show only 1 - 3 pairs at the reduction divisions. All the other chromosomes segregate at random, so that no more than one pollen-grain or embryo-sac out of thousands contains only the 9 chromosomes from one parent, and survives. In the cross of radish and cabbage, as Karpechenko (Journal of Genetics, vol. 14, pp. 375 - 396, 1924) has lately shown, chromosome conjugation is absent. This has also been shown in certain Digitalis crosses...|$|E
