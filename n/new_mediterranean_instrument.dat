Highly appreciated folk instruments are the txistu (a tabor pipe similar to Occitanian galoubet recorder), alboka (a double clarinet played in circular-breathing technique, similar to other <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>instruments</b> like launeddas) and txalaparta (a huge xylophone, similar to the Romanian toacă and played by two performers in a fascinating game-performance). As {{in many parts of the}} Iberian peninsula, there are ritual dances with sticks, swords and arches made from vegetation. Other popular dances are the fandango, jota and 5/8 zortziko.|$|R

40|$|On 8 February 1937 the 23 -year-old Albert Camus gave an inaugural lecture {{for a new}} Maison de la culture, or {{community}} arts centre, in Algiers. Entitled 'La nouvelle culture méditerranéenne' ('The <b>New</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Culture'), Camus's lecture has been interpreted in radically different ways: while some critics have dismissed it as an incoherent piece of juvenilia, others see it as key to understanding his future development as a thinker, whether as the first expression of his so-called 'Mediterranean humanism' or as an early indication of what is seen as his essentially colonial mentality. These various interpretations are based on reading the text of 'The <b>New</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> Culture' in a single context, whether that of Camus's life and work as a whole, of French discourses on the Mediterranean or of colonial Algeria (and French discourses on that country). By contrast, this study argues that Camus's lecture - and in principle any historical text - needs {{to be seen in}} a multiplicity of contexts, discursive and otherwise, if readers are to understand properly what its author was doing in writing it. Using Camus's lecture as a case study, the book provides a detailed theoretical and practical justification of this 'multi-contextualist' approach...|$|R

40|$|High-biomass blooms of A. taylori Balech have {{recently}} been spreading over <b>new</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> areas, with evident adverse effects on the marine ecosystem. In 1999 - 2000, a <b>new</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> locality was affected by blooms of A. taylori: the West Bay of Vulcano (Aeolian Islands, Tyrrhenian Sea), with maximum cell densities of 1. 2 x 10 (7) cells 1 (- 1) in August 1999 and 4. 0 x 10 (6) cells 1 (- 1) in August 2000 observed together with yellowish water discoloration. The seawater samples contained high concentrations of nutrients as DIN (Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen), especially NH 3 -N with values of 14. 4 mu M and TOT-P (Total Phosphorus) with values of 3. 2 mu M due to the anthropic presence and discharge of untreated sewage. The climatic conditions also seem to influence the occurrence and spreading of the A. taylori blooms in the Vulcano Bay. Clonal cultures of A. taylori, established from Italian and Spanish seawater samples, {{were used for the}} sequence analyses of the 5. 8 S rDNA gene and ITS regions in order to study the genetic variability of different geographical populations of Alexandrium species in the Mediterranean area and to further develop the molecular markers for HAB key-species...|$|R

Grand Admiral Haus wholly supported the proposal, but Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin had misgivings, as did the emperor, Charles I of Austria. Haus and the German delegates finally won the debate, partly by listing several instances where Allied submarines had sunk unarmed Austro-Hungarian ships in the Adriatic. The negotiations over {{the terms of the}} <b>new</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> submarine campaign were aided by the fact that Italy had declared war on Germany on 28 August 1916, making it no longer necessary for German U-boats to masquerade as Austrian vessels when attacking Italian shipping.|$|R

However, the dangers that still lurk in the mare nostrum could still have sizeable negative effects on the Community.
