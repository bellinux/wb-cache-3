40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) <b>non-wovens</b> were modified by a dielec. barrier discharge in air, helium and argon at medium pressure (5. 0 kPa). The helium and argon discharges contained {{a fraction of}} air smaller than 0. 1 %. Surface anal. and characterization were performed using XPS, liq. absorptive capacity measurements and SEM (SEM). The <b>non-wovens,</b> modified in air, helium and argon, showed {{a significant increase in}} liq. absorptive capacity due to the incorporation of oxygen-contg. groups, such as C-O, O-C=O and C=O. It was shown that an air plasma was more efficient in incorporating oxygen functionalities than an argon plasma, which was more efficient than a helium plasma. SEM pictures of the plasma-treated <b>non-wovens</b> showed that the hydrophilicity of the <b>non-wovens</b> could be increased to a satn. value without causing phys. degrdn. of the surface. The ageing behavior of the plasma-treated textiles after storage in air was also studied. It was shown that during the ageing process, the induced oxygen-contg. groups re-orientated into the bulk of the material. This ageing effect was the smallest for the argon-plasma treated <b>non-wovens,</b> followed by the helium-plasma treated <b>non-wovens,</b> while the air-plasma treated <b>non-wovens</b> showed the largest ageing effect...|$|R
