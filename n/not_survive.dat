5|$|A-line. Founded by Anselmo, born 1926. One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} lines today, descendants include the second-largest number of stallions at stud.

5|$|As ABC's {{overexposure}} of the primetime Millionaire led {{the public}} to tire of the show, there was speculation that the show would <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> beyond the 2001–02 season.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which meant that it did <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> Henry's death.

5|$|German {{astronomer}} Johann Bode {{defined the}} constellation Lochium Funis, the Log and Line—a nautical device once used for measuring speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 star atlas, but the depiction did <b>not</b> <b>survive.</b> In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E

Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E
