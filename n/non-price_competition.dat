Competing in areas such as product features, customer support, delivery time, and brand image isn't likely to be as damaging to profits because it will increase customer value in the product or service and may help establish customer loyalty. This in turn can improve industry profitability through increasing value relative to substitutes and raising the barriers of entry for new potential competitors.|$|R

The firm can also distinguish its product offering through quality of service, extensive distribution, customer focus, or any sustainable competitive advantage other than price. It can be contrasted with price competition, which is where a company tries to distinguish its product or service from competing products on the basis of low price. <b>Non-price</b> <b>competition</b> typically involves promotional expenditures (such as advertising, selling staff, the locations convenience, sales promotions, coupons, special orders, or free gifts), marketing research, new product development, and brand management costs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacturing}} sector is increasingly looking to innovation to ensure productivity growth, especially in high-cost operating environments to achieve <b>non-price</b> based <b>competition.</b> The paper {{begins with an}} overview of regulatory, technological and consumer trends and developments impacting manufacturing. It considers the shifting balance between fragmenting and concentrating forces of global supply chains, and how manufacturing firms themselves are changing. This overview {{is followed by a}} discussion of the pivotal constituents of success for firms operating in high-cost environments, and concludes with the fundamental importance of innovation as a basis for success. The paper then discusses value creation, value appropriation, and design-based innovation, and argues that manufacturers need to understand key differences between these paradigms. In particular, the difference between art and design is articulated, to avoid an otherwise common confusion between the two. The importance of an inter- and trans-disciplinary approach to innovation is emphasized, including the use of four value creation strategies—science and technology, design, art, and reverse-hermeneutic innovation. The paper concludes that the design-based innovation paradigm is increasingly important within the manufacturing industry, but that its benefit can only be maximized if it is integrated with the other three value-creating approaches to innovation...|$|R
40|$|Up to now, few {{analytical}} {{models have}} studied the incentives for cooperation in quality improvements among hospitals. Only those dealing with reimbursement systems have shown that, {{from the point of}} view of individual or competing hospitals, retrospective reimbursement is more likely to encourage quality improvements than prospective financing, while the reverse holds for efficiency improvements. This paper studies the incentives to improve the quality of hospital care, in an analytical model, taking into account the possibility of cooperative agreements, price besides <b>non-price</b> (quality) <b>competition</b> and quality improvements that may simultaneously increase demand, increase or reduce costs and spill over to rival hospitals. In this setting quality improvement efforts rise with the rate of prospective reimbursement, while the impact of the rate of retrospective reimbursement is ambiguous, but likely to be negative for quality improvements that are highly cost-reducting and create large spillovers. Cooperation may lead to more or less quality improvement than non-cooperative conduct, depending on the magnitude of spillovers and the degree of product market competition, relative to the net effect of quality on profits and the share of costs that is reimbursed retrospectively. Finally, the stability of cooperative agreements, supported by grim trigger strategies, is shown to depend upon exactly the opposite interaction between these factors. status: publishe...|$|R

Textile and clothing competition is possible only if the following factors are taken into account: price, as the factor that usually stands out, and non-price factors such as product quality, design, rich assortment, top-line standardisation, and market organisation and delivery term. Due to nonprice factors, many companies in textile industry from developed countries acquire high competition.

50|$|Maximum {{and minimum}} price-fixing may have {{different}} consequences in many situations. But schemes to fix maximum prices, by substituting the perhaps erroneous judgment of a seller for {{the forces of the}} competitive market, may severely intrude upon the ability of buyers to compete and survive in that market. Competition, even in a single product, is not cast in a single mold. Maximum prices may be fixed too low for the dealer to furnish services essential to the value which goods have for the consumer or to furnish services and conveniences which consumers desire and for which they are willing to pay. Maximum price-fixing may channel distribution through a few large or specifically advantaged dealers who otherwise would be subject to significant <b>non-price</b> <b>competition.</b> Moreover, if the actual price charged under a maximum price scheme is nearly always the fixed maximum price, which is increasingly likely as the maximum price approaches the actual cost of the dealer, the scheme tends to acquire all the attributes of an arrangement fixing minimum prices. It is our view, therefore, that the combination formed by the respondent in this case to force petitioner to maintain a specified price for the resale of the newspapers which he had purchased from respondent constituted, without more, an illegal restraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman Act.|$|E

50|$|Baran and Sweezy {{highlighted}} five {{aspects of}} the surplus absorption problem. First, that capitalist class luxury consumption could not rise {{as fast as the}} available surplus and monopoly conditions limited outlets for productive investment. Second, spending on the sales effort was an important outlet for surplus as large firms engaged in <b>non-price</b> forms of <b>competition</b> and sought to enlarge demand. However, such marketing expenditures (advertising, sales promotion, excessive model changes, etc.) do not provide any additional use-value and therefore may be treated as waste. Third, capitalist opposition to civilian spending as a threat to their class interests and class power limited the ability of such spending to provide effective demand. Fourth, military spending does not compete with capitalist interests {{in the same way as}} civilian spending and through imperialism serves to enhance those interests. Therefore, military spending is able to expand to a degree civilian spending is not, providing an important outlet for surplus absorption. Fifth, spending on finance can serve to absorb a portion of the surplus and boost the economy, at the expense of greater debt expansion and long-term instability.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the nature of}} competition between national brands and store brands (otherwise known as private label or own label goods). We expound an analytical framework that allows for both price and <b>non-price</b> (quality) <b>competition</b> and use this to see how these different forms of rivalry interact in a setting where a leading retailer offering a store brand acts as both a customer and competitor to a national brand producer. This relationship thus entails both vertical and horizontal competition. We show that generally the retailer will seek to position its store brand {{as closely as possible}} to the national brand, by seeking to minimise the quality gap, but price the two goods very differently, with a wide price gap, as a means to segment consumers. Store brand introduction can lead to overall higher prices, so be against consumers’ interest, unless there is intense head-to-head rivalry for value-conscious consumers. Intense rivalry is more likely to happen if the national brand producer can exercise some control over its own product’s retail price (e. g. by being allowed to use maximum resale price maintenance) and has protection against copycat (lookalike) store brands ensuring a degree of differentiation between the competing products. Accordingly, we suggest that there are horizontal competition benefits on top of the usual vertical (alleviating double marginalisation) and intellectual property (to encourage brand investments) reasons to support respectively a more lenient policy stance towards RPM and a tougher stance against parasitic copycatting. The mix of horizontal and vertical aspects has important implications for undertaking market definition analysis in CPG markets, and specifically testing whether store brands and national brands are in the same product market. We highlight the considerable care needed in applying and interpreting the usual price and demand elasticity analysis used in market definition tests because of how segmentation and item-by-item retail pricing can distort demand and sales patterns...|$|R
5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributions}} of Monopoly Capital is its application {{of the concept of}} economic surplus. The economic surplus is most simply the difference between “what a society produces and the costs of producing it. The size of the surplus is an index of productivity and wealth, of how much freedom a society has to accomplish whatever goals it may set for itself. The composition of the surplus shows how it uses that freedom: how much it invests in expanding its productive capacity, how much it consumes in various forms, how much it wastes and in what ways.” [...] Although some scholars viewed the introduction of this concept as a break with the Marxist approach to value, later publications by Baran and Sweezy, as well as other authors, have continued to establish the importance of this innovation, its consistency with Marx's labor concept of value, and supplementary relation to Marx's category of surplus value.Baran and Sweezy argue that under the oligopolistic conditions of modern economies—dominated by big business—the surplus tends to rise. The vast extent of this increasing actual and potential surplus is visible in the underutilization of productive capacity, the level of unemployment, the waste embodied in the sales effort, and military spending. This is because monopoly/oligopoly conditions result in both insufficient opportunities for profitable reinvestment of the surplus (which shows up as excess capacity and unemployment) and forms of <b>non-price</b> <b>competition</b> involve large amounts of unproductive labor (e.g. in the sales effort and product differentiation). The overall result is a tendency toward economic stagnation and increased unproductive expenditures as a response.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether American hospitals continued {{to engage in}} <b>non-price</b> or quality <b>competition</b> over the recent past as health care markets underwent fundamental structural changes and the economic incentives facing hospital managers were correspondingly altered. It also investigates {{the degree to which}} such rivalrous behavior contributes to losses in economic welfare. An econometric model of quality competition is specified that tests, among other things, for the effect of spending by the hospital to enhance the quality of output on annual changes in its share of the local (inpatient) market as well as the effects of competitive conditions in the local market on the annual sum spent on quality enhancement. The model is estimated with the panel data on 195 acute care hospitals in the State of Florida for the years 1982 - 1988. The results suggest that quality competitive behavior continued unabated over this period and that it was stimulated as much by the growth in physician supply and alternative delivery mechanisms as it was by other competing hospitals in the local market. Furthermore, the results show that quality competition yields some inefficiency or waste, but much of it also meets the test of the market. hospital competition hospital costs demand for hospital services hospital markets...|$|R

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webvii, 95 leaves, bound 29 cmIn Part One, I investigate {{whether the new}} order handling rules implemented on the NASDAQ, in 1997, negatively affected quote competition because of a sustained high level of preferenced trading. With the new rules in place, quote-competition oriented positions made substantial improvement in relative quote competitiveness but did not gain additional share volume. In contrast, preferencing oriented positions were able to maintain share volume with deteriorated relative competitiveness. The consequences are: (i) reduced share volume sensitivity to relative quote competitiveness; (ii) reduced (increased) quote effectiveness for quote-competition (preferencing) oriented positions; and (iii) net entries (exits) of quote-competition (preferencing) oriented positions. Empirical evidence is consistent with these three negative consequences and is robust to different measures of relative quote competitiveness with or without taking into account quote competition from limit orders. These results suggest that more quote competition does not necessarily promote quote <b>competition</b> when <b>non-price</b> based <b>competition</b> strategy, such as preferencing, is available. In Part Two, I examines {{whether there was a}} trading volume migration from non-NYSE markets towards the NYSE after decimalization, and finds that the NYSE's percentage share of small size trading volume increased by approximately 20 percentage points between June 2000 and August 2001, across stocks of all market capitalizations. This paper shows that the trading volume migration was the result of decimalization. Empirical evidence suggests that the NYSE gained market share in small size trades after decimalization through two channels. The first is a reduction in preferenced trading; the second is the NYSE's improved relative competitiveness after decimalization. Further investigation reveals that these two channels have different importance for the trading volume migration for large and small capitalization stocks. The reduction in preferenced trading plays a more important role in the trading volume migration for large capitalization stocks; whereas the improvement in the NYSE's relative competitiveness plays a more important role in the trading volume migration for small capitalization stocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} export process in smaller firms and to provide a benchmark against which export strategy and pricing policies can be assessed, particularly in the context of the impact of floating currencies on exporters. The study consists, firstly, of a literature survey in the fields of pricing and export management, drawing on some 600 sources. Primary data were collected through a small number of depth interviews with export executives and a postal questionnaire survey of 250 medium-sized exporting manufacturers in the North of England, drawn from the Clothing. Furniture, Chemicals and Scientific Instrumentation industries. The theory of export strategy is reviewed, particularly in the context of key market concentration, as the foundation for export policies, including export pricing on which attention is focussed here. Challenges are offered to the arguments and empirical evidence on which the key market philosophy is founded and an alternative strategy proposed: market spreading. Empirical evidence is produced to show the existence of both concentration and spreading strategies in practical exporting, and to assess the underlying logic of market spreading as an alternative to market concentration, together with the situational cues associated with each. From general pricing theory and methods, attention is directed to the more specialised problems of export pricing. Consideration is given to the relationship between domestic market and export prices and pricing methods, and the existence and form of discriminatory pricing in exporting. The emphasis placed on price in the export marketing programme is analysed in the context of the debate on price versus <b>non-price</b> aspects of <b>competition</b> in international markets. Lastly, arising out of export pricing policy is the key issue of pricing currency, particularly as the mediator of the impact of floatation on the exporter.
