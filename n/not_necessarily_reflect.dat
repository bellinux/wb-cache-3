25|$|The {{name that}} appears in the {{machine-readable}} zone {{at the bottom of}} the visa represents the holder’s Cyrillic name mapped into the Roman alphabet.

As a result, the spelling of a name in the machine-readable zone does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> its spelling in the visa’s name field. For example, the name “Christoph” would appear in the field as “Kpиcтoф/Christoph”, but the MRZ would contain the name “Kristof”.|$|E

25|$|These standings do <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> a skater/couple's capabilities. Due to {{limits on}} entries to events (no {{more than three}} from each country), and varying numbers of {{high-level}} skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find {{it more difficult to}} qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB but from a country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB but from a country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.|$|E
25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy {{mentioned in this article}} may or may <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|E

50|$|Imposition of the Soviet model {{introduced}} a chronic inflationary bias into the Czechoslovak economy, although the inflation was <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflected</b> in prices. Control of prices (only private food produce, especially fruit and vegetables, were priced freely) repeatedly produced inflationary manifestations in other areas, such as shortages {{in the market}} and increased savings by the population. Although officials generally limited the rise in prices (causing price indexes to advance slowly), by the mid-1970s prices had to be adjusted upward more frequently. This trend continued into the 1980s, and major food price increases occurred in 1982.|$|R
