5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange</b> that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E

During the early Cold War, this policy was maintained even though Sweden's leaders understood that neutrality would probably fail in a third world war.

The Kaleds, {{with their}} stylised salutes and authoritarian political structure, were thinly veiled analogues of the Nazis. In this serial, it was the Kaleds who waged war on the Thals. The Daleks originate during the Kaled-Thal War, which is portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of attrition, fought with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, with weapons becoming progressively less sophisticated as resources became scarcer, not the short <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange</b> previously described.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, William J.

25|$|Exercise Hard Rock was a {{combined}} communications and civil defence exercise planned for September and October 1982. It assumed a conventional war in Europe lasting {{two to three}} days, during which the UK would be attacked with conventional weapons, then a limited <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange,</b> with 54 nuclear warheads used against military targets in the UK. 250,000 people protested against the exercise and 24 councils refused to participate. The limited scenario still assumed casualties of 7.9 million dead and 5 million injured. The scenario was ridiculed by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the exercise was postponed indefinitely. The New Statesman later claimed the Ministry of Defence insisted on having a veto over proposed targets in the exercise and several were removed to make them politically more acceptable; for example, the nuclear submarine base HMNB Clyde {{was removed from the}} target list.|$|E
25|$|When McNamara {{took over}} the Pentagon in 1961, the United States {{military}} relied on an all-out nuclear strike {{to respond to a}} Soviet attack of any kind. This kind of strike would lead to the death of Soviet military forces and also civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this kind of action. He sought for other options after seeing how this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. McNamara’s alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange</b> by targeting only enemy military forces. This concept would be used to prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow up strike. McNamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but likely to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.|$|E
25|$|The Organization then uses {{both their}} {{southern}} Californian {{base of operations}} and their nuclear weapons to open a wider war in which they launch nuclear strikes against New York City and Israel, initiate a <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange</b> between the US and the Soviet Union, and plant nuclear weapons and new terrorist cells throughout North America. Many major U.S. cities are destroyed, including Baltimore and Detroit. As the United States undergoes a nuclear civil war, governments {{all over the world}} begin to fall one after the other, and violent anti-Jewish riots break out in the streets. After the nuclear launches against Israel, the Arabs take the advantage of the opportunity and proceed to swarm into Israel, mostly armed with clubs and knives, and kill all of the Israelis. The governments of France and the Netherlands collapse, and the Soviet Union falls apart while seeing a surge in anti-Semitic violence. Meanwhile, the United States is put in a state of absolute martial law and transformed into a military dictatorship. When the United States government decides to launch an invasion against the Organization's stronghold in Southern California, Earl Turner is ordered on a suicide mission; he flies a crop duster equipped with a nuclear warhead and destroys the Pentagon before the invasion can be ordered.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the danger}} of the {{unbearable}} catastrophe of nuclear war, NATO in the mid- 1950 s abandoned any war aim of achieving victory in an all-out war with the Soviet Union or the Warsaw Treaty Organisation.

By contrast, the WTO clung on to the war aim of victory - expressed even in terms of the survival of slightly more Soviet citizens than NATO citizens, after unprecedented losses of life in <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchanges</b> - until the mid- 1980 s when under Gorbachev the concept of victory in nuclear war was abandoned...|$|R

2500|$|The {{conventional}} war {{situation in}} Europe turning {{against them and}} their strategic situation increasingly bleak due to the drawdown on national oil reserves resulting in a crippled economy, Alekseyev sends Major Sergtov to inform his father that the war has been lost, and that one final offensive could allow the Soviets to negotiate a ceasefire on favorable terms. Knowing that the situation would force the Politburo to execute Alekseyev, Minister Sergetov refuses, and agrees to support a coup d'etat planned by Kosov. Major Sergetov convinces Alekseyev to lead the coup after convincing him that the Politburo has become inept and corrupt. Meanwhile, the Politburo is moved to consider the use of tactical nuclear weapons at the front to regain the initiative. Alekseyev, realizing that a tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange</b> would almost certainly lead to a strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange,</b> seeks and obtains control of his theatre's nuclear weapons {{as part of their}} planning, ostensibly for practical matters of tactical targeting but in reality to ensure they are never used. The decision is met with opposition from Bromkovskiy and Agriculture Minister Filip Moiseyevich Krylov, who gains Sergetov's trust after informing him that grain production has drastically increased due to the implementation of private plots in the kolkhoz system. In the face of impending mutually assured destruction, the coup plot advances with the aid of the 77th Motor-Guards Division under the command of Major Arkady Semyonovich Sorokin and Alekseyev. The troops easily overtake resistance from the poorly trained Taman Guards and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and arrest the Politburo. [...] After the victory, Kosov is suddenly summarily executed by Major Sorokin, whose daughter Svetlana was one of the children killed in the Kremlin bombing. A troika is formed under Krylov, the new Defense Minister Bromkovskiy, and the new General Secretary Sergetov.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{publication}} of [...] "Twilight at Noon" [...] in 1982, the TTAPS team {{have said that they}} began the process of doing a 1-dimensional computational modeling study of the atmospheric consequences of nuclear war/soot in the stratosphere, though they would not publish a paper in Science magazine until late December 1983. The phrase [...] "nuclear winter" [...] had been coined by Turco just prior to publication. In this early paper, TTAPS used assumption based estimates on the total smoke and dust emissions that would result from a major <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange,</b> and with that, began analyzing the subsequent effects on the atmospheric radiation balance and temperature structure {{as a result of this}} quantity of assumed smoke. To compute dust and smoke effects, they employed a one-dimensional microphysics/radiative-transfer model of the Earth's lower atmosphere (up to the mesopause), which defined only the vertical characteristics of the global climate perturbation.|$|E

2500|$|Given the {{problems}} of the proton–electron model, it was quickly accepted that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, although the precise nature of the neutron was initially unclear. Within months after the discovery of the neutron, Werner Heisenberg and Dmitri Ivanenko had proposed proton–neutron models for the nucleus. Heisenberg's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics. While Heisenberg's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a [...] "major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system," [...] he still assumed the presence of nuclear electrons. In particular, Heisenberg assumed the neutron was a proton–electron composite, {{for which there is no}} quantum mechanical explanation. Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus. Heisenberg introduced the first theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>exchange</b> forces that bind the nucleons. He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear isospin quantum numbers.|$|E
