40|$|Dimethyl ether (DME) is an {{alternative}} fuel which, of late, has shown tremendous potential in reducing the pollution emissions of automobiles. Simultaneously, electronic actuated fuel injectors, {{with the use of}} solenoids, have repeatedly demonstrated superior performance with respect to needle movement control. This thesis, in order to combine the advantages of both electronic actuation and DME fuel, presents an adaptation of the novel use of solenoid operated fuel injectors with DME. The thesis also sets to reduce injector <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> wear, by reducing the bouncing of the injector needle at the bottom of its stroke. The injector design presented incorporates a lengthened elastic rod, a new driving circuit for the solenoid, and incorporates them into a common rail system. The thesis also presents, {{for the first time in}} the literature, a methodology for measuring the force acting on the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> in injector closing. Through modeling, simulation and testing, an injector compatible with DME fuel was designed, where injector needle movement was properly controlled, and <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> force reduced. As such, an important step has been taken in developing technology allowing DME to be a more common alternative fuel in automobiles...|$|R
40|$|The near nozzle exit {{flow and}} spray {{structure}} generated by an enlarged {{model of a}} second generation pintle type outwards opening injector have been investigated under steady flow conditions {{as a function of}} flow-rate and needle lift. A high resolution CCD camera and high-speed video camera have been employed in this study to obtain high-magnification images of the internal nozzle exit flow in order to identify the origin of string ligaments/droplets formation at the nozzle exit. The images of the flow around the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> area showed clearly that air was entrained from outside into the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> area under certain flow operating conditions (low cavitation number, CN); the formed air pockets inside the annular nozzle proved to be the main cause of the breaking of the fuel liquid film into strings as it emerged from the nozzle with a structure consisting of alternating thin and thick liquid filaments. As the flow rate increased, the air pockets were suppressed, reduced in size and pushed towards the exit of the nozzle resulting in a smoother spray. The results showed that the number of strings increased linearly, within the measured range, with liquid exit velocity and that the spray cone angle was smaller or larger than the nominal value depending on the attachment of air pockets to the cartridge or needle surfaces, respectively; these two distinct small and large cone angles were found to be dominant at low and high lifts. Increasing the flow rate further so that CN exceeds the critical value, gave rise to pockets of vapour that started to emerge in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> region and disintegrated rapidly as they were convected towards the nozzle exit. The analysis of the near nozzle flow visualizations has shown the existence of air entrainment and cavitation as two different phenomena occurring under different operating condition...|$|R
40|$|Pelton turbine is {{an engine}} that {{facilitates}} continuous {{power as a}} wheel or a rotor continually turns due to the pressure of fast moving water through the bucket, where a bucket receives water from the surging nozzle. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume, bucket angle attack, <b>nozzle</b> needle <b>seat</b> ring, and <b>nozzle</b> needle <b>seat</b> tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University. The comparative study among the different parameters shows that the value of maximum efficiency was 21. 65 %, which was obtained at 90 ° needle seat ring and 45 ° needle seat tip, and + 15 % bucket size and 92 ° angle of attack. It was gained likely due to the lightness of the + 15 % bucket compared to the standard bucket and the collision produced by the jet water {{in the middle of the}} bucket, in which the water loading occupied the large area on the surface of the bucket and promoted the increasing speed. It is expected that the result on the appropriate size and angle attack of bucket at specific <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> ring and seat tip of this experiment can be manufactured commercially in the future for achieving maximum Pelton turbine efficiency...|$|R
