40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of allocating bandwidth to two transmitters/queues with arbitrary arrival processes, so as to minimize the total expected (discounted) holding cost of backlogged packets in the system over a finite (infinite) horizon. The bandwidth {{is in the form}} of time slots in a TDMA schedule. Allocation decisions are made based on the queue backlog information, which is delayed. In addition, the allocation is done <b>in</b> <b>batches,</b> <b>in</b> that a queue can be assigned any number of slots not exceeding the total <b>number</b> <b>in</b> a <b>batch.</b> <b>In</b> this paper we show that if the packet holding cost as a function of the packet backlog in the system is non-decreasing, supermodular and superconvex, then (1) the value function (or the cost to go) at each time slot will also satisfy these properties; (2) the optimal policy for assigning a single slot is of the threshold type; and (3) optimally allocating M slots at a time can be achieved by repeatedly using a policy that assigns each slot optimally given the previous allocations. Thus the problem of finding the optimal allocation strategy for a batch of slots reduces to that of optimally allocating a single slot, which is typically much easier to obtain. We provide sufficient conditions for the same results to hold in the case of discounted cost over an infinite horizon and in the case of average cost criterion.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of allocating bandwidth/server to multiple user transmitters/queues with identical but arbitrary arrival processes, to minimize the total expected holding cost of backlogged packets in the system over a finite horizon. The special features of this problem are that (1) packets continuously arrive at these queues regardless of the allocation decision, (2) {{there is a large}} delay between when the allocation decision is made and when the allocation is used, thus decisions can be viewed as based on delayed or obsolete state information/observations; and (3) the bandwidth allocation is <b>in</b> <b>batches</b> of time slots so that each queue can be assigned any number of slots not exceeding the total <b>number</b> <b>in</b> a <b>batch.</b> This problem is motivated by channel allocation in a communication system involving large propagation delay, e. g., a typical satellite data communication scenario. This problem can be cast as a special case of the restless bandit problem with multiple plays with the additional properties that the state observation is imperfect and that each queue can be served multiple times in between two decision epochs. We identify two sufficient conditions which jointly define a class of policies that are optimal. We further show that under very mild assumptions on the arrival process these two conditions are also necessary for the optimality of a policy. Without these assumptions on the arrival process the two conditions are not in general necessary, which we show via two examples...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a product using {{alternative}} red meat species, aquatic and terrestrial mammals, which would be acceptable to the consumer and suitable from a food safety aspect. Many of these alternative species are harvested seasonally. A product which is shelf stable needs to be developed to provide a supply of this meat all year round. The species used in this investigation were the Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), the Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) from the northern hemisphere, the Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), horse, beef, mutton, blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas phillipsi) and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis). Muscle (m. pectoralis) of Cape fur seal pups has a higher percentage fat (4. 2 g/ 100 g) than the bulls (2. 4 g/ 100 g), but similar levels of protein (23. 2 g/ 100 g). Bull blubber samples have a higher percentage protein (26. 6 g/ 100 g) than the pups (14. 6 g/ 100 g), but a lower fat percentage (67. 1 g/ 100 g) compared with the pups (77. 2 g/ 100 g). In the Cape fur seal bull meat, saturated fatty acids (SFA) contribute 33 mg/ 100 g, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) 29 mg/ 100 g and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 38 mg/ 100 g of the total fatty acid content. In pups, the three fractions are 39, 30 and 31 mg/ 100 g for SFA, MUFA and PUFA, respectively. Salami,prepared using exclusively seal meat, or seal meat with beef and pork, was produced in a pilot study, using two commercially available starter cultures. The pH values of all three batches started off at ca. 5. 6, and dropped to 4. 3. Water activity readings started off at 0. 96 and dropped to 0. 91 after 21 days. Salami produced from the meat of the Grey (Havert) seal and Minke whale, using three starter cultures, had recorded pH values (in both species), which started off between 5. 68 and 5. 92, and dropped to between 4. 5 and 4. 8 over the 21 days. Water activity showed an initial value of 0. 96, which dropped to 0. 90 after 21 days. The final force (N/cm 2) that was needed to compress the salami samples was double that of the initial force required for the same species and starter culture combination. The raw seal meat contained 349. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) SFA, 271. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) MUFA and 175. 8 (mg/ 100 g sample) PUFA, whilst the raw whale meat contained 312. 3, 251. 9 and 179. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) SFA, MUFA and PUFA respectively. Fifteen batches of salami were made from horse, beef, mutton, blesbok and springbok, respectively, and starter cultures of Lactobacillus curvatus DF 38 (batch I), active bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus plantarum 423 (batch II) and then a mutant variation of Lactobacillus plantarum 423 m, which did not produce the bacteriocin (batch III). Batch I had a higher final pH value (4. 66), after 23 days, whereas the values for batches II and III were similar (4. 42 and 4. 46 respectively). On day 23 the water activity value was 0. 90 for all starter cultures. Horse salami, <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> I, was the leanest in terms of fat content (34. 34 g/ 100 g salami), with mutton salami having the highest fat content (37. 52 g/ 100 g salami). Blesbok salami had the highest fat content <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> II (42. 77 g/ 100 g meat), with beef the leanest (35. 71 g/ 100 g meat). Salami made from horse and springbok proved to be the most desirable in terms of chemical composition, especially fatty acid profiles, with regard to P: S and n- 6 : n- 3 ratios. Similar growth patterns in colony forming units (cfu) were recorded for L. plantarum 423, L. plantarum 423 m and L. curvatus DF 38 in MRS broth (Merck) at 30 oC, although batch I reached asymptotic growth earlier. The percentage of L. plantarum 423 compared with the total population of microflora in mutton salami remained almost the same (80 - 95 % variety) during the entire fermentation and maturation process. In horse salami, L. plantarum 423 was present at relatively low cell numbers (55 - 50 % on day 1 and before smoking), but increased to 70 % after smoking and stabilized to 70 - 80 % for the remaining fermentation period. In beef salami, cell <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> II decreased slightly during the first five days (from 95 to 70 %), followed by an increase to 90 %. In springbok salami, cell <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> II remained fairly stable at 80 - 90 %. <b>In</b> blesbok salami, <b>batch</b> II slowly decreased during the first three days, from 88 % to 70 %, then increased to 92 % after 12 days and stabilized for the rest of the fermentation period. Similar results were recorded for batch I. Analytical sensory evaluation concluded that the salami prepared using starter culture I resulted in end products with lower sensory qualities. Salami prepared using blesbok and mutton also resulted in end products with lower sensory qualities and was perceived as significantly lower in salami flavour (P≤ 0. 05) and higher in venison-like and mutton-like flavour respectively. The blesbok samples were rated significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) in sour meat aroma, sour meat flavour and venison-like flavour than the rest of the samples. The blesbok salami was rated significantly lowest for colour compared with the rest of the samples. The tastes of the springbok and horse salami were significantly (P≤ 0. 05) more acceptable than those of the beef and blesbok salami...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{batching}} and scheduling n identical jobs of F, F ≥ 2, part types {{in a shop}} made up of F + 1 machines is studied. The processing of each job comprises two stages.
