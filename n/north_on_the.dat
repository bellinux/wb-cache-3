Without asking permission from Schuyler, he moved 1,200 men <b>north</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> schooner Liberty and the sloop Enterprise.

5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut <b>North</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the point}} MD 2 merges onto the John Hanson Highway, {{the road is}} eight lanes wide. The road heads through wooded areas, {{narrowing}} to six lanes, before coming to an interchange with MD 70 (Rowe Boulevard). At this interchange, the unsigned I-595 designation ends, while US 50, US 301, and MD 2 continue northeast on the John Hanson Highway. The route passes under MD 436 (Ridgely Avenue) and runs near residential neighborhoods before crossing over the Severn River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. After crossing the Severn River, the road comes to an interchange with the Governor Ritchie Highway. Here, MD 2 leaves US 50/US 301 by heading <b>north</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Governor Ritchie Highway while MD 450 continues south into Annapolis on that road.|$|E
5|$|British {{forces were}} ordered {{withdrawn}} {{a few days}} later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the <b>north</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of 3/4 June, and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems {{in the early evening}} despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This {{was the first time that}} high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of the Korean People's Army, the Korean War appeared to be all but over. United Nations (UN) forces advanced rapidly into North Korea {{with the intention of}} reuniting North and South Korea before the end of 1950. North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN forces into two groups. The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced <b>north</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} {{between the}} North Koreans and the ROK Capital Division {{on the hills}} bordering the valley from An'gang-ni to Kyongju. The 3rd Battalion, US 19th Infantry, became involved there just after midnight on September 8–9. A North Korean force attacked K Company and drove it from Hill 300, a defensive position midway between An'gang-ni and Kyongju. North Koreans held the hill during September 9 against counterattack. Farther <b>north,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{left side of the}} valley, the ROK 17th Regiment attacked and, {{with the support of the}} US 13th Field Artillery Battalion, captured Hill 285 and held it against several North Korean counterattacks. On the opposite, east side of the valley the ROK 18th Regiment made limited gains. These battles took place in drenching typhoon rains. Low-hanging clouds allowed very little air support. The rains finally ceased on September 10.|$|E
5|$|Following Burges's death, further {{areas of}} the castle were {{developed}} along the lines he had set by, amongst others, William Frame. This included extensive reconstruction of {{the walls of the}} original Roman fort. The Animal Wall, completed in the 1920s by the 4th Marquess, originally stood between the castle moat and the city and has nine sculptures by Thomas Nicholls, with a further six sculpted by Alexander Carrick in the 1930s. The Swiss bridge, which once crossed the moat to the pre-Raphaelite garden encompassed by the Animal Wall, was removed in the 1930s. The stables, which lie to the <b>north,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of Bute Park, were designed by Burges in 1868–69.|$|E

5|$|From here, I-695 heads {{northeast}} as {{an eight}} lane road and enters Pikesville, where it intersects MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at a single-point urban interchange. A short distance later, the road {{comes to a}} partial interchange with MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue), with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. I-695 heads east to another partial interchange with Stevenson Road, which has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. The Baltimore Beltway passes through heavily forested land as it encounters Greenspring Avenue. Past this interchange, I-695 continues northeast through woodland before coming to an interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway). The interchange includes connections to MD 25 (Falls Road), which heads into the open countryside north of Baltimore. Within this interchange, I-83 forms a concurrency with I-695 and the roadway widens to ten lanes, with six for the Beltway and four for I-83. After running concurrently, I-83 splits from I-695 by heading <b>north</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Harrisburg Expressway at a directional interchange.|$|E
5|$|I-280 {{continues}} to run {{just north of}} the railroad as a six-lane freeway through Harrison, reaching an interchange with CR 508. The road continues southeast through urban surroundings before turning east and passing to the north of a railroad yard, splitting from the railroad line as it runs into Kearny and enters the New Jersey Meadowlands. At the final interchange with CR 508, I-280 has access to the Holland Tunnel via Route 7, US 1/9 Truck and Route 139. Past CR 508, the freeway narrows to four lanes and comes to the toll plaza for the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at exit 15W, at which point I-280 ends. Full access is provided with the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, which carries through I-95 traffic; ramps to and from the <b>north</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike allow for access to the Lincoln Tunnel via Route 495.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, {{following}} John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in October 1859, a Virginia uniformed volunteer military company {{known as}} the Frontier Riflemen was formed with White as commanding officer in the rank of Captain. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Governor John Letcher ordered the Frontier Riflemen to report to Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson at Harpers Ferry. White and his unit marched to Harpers Ferry on May 18, 1861. He and his unit traveled <b>north</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline at Green Spring, then to Harpers Ferry. Following their arrival, White's company was reassigned as Company I of the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment commanded by Colonel A. P. Hill. The company marched from Harpers Ferry to Winchester and returned to Romney in June 1861, at which time they occupied the town for several days.|$|E
