5000|$|Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.'s lottery paradox [...] {{arises from}} {{considering}} a fair 1000-ticket lottery that has exactly one winning ticket. If {{this much is}} known about the execution of the lottery it is therefore rational to accept that some ticket will win. Suppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99. On these grounds it is presumed rational to accept the proposition that ticket 1 of the lottery will <b>not</b> <b>win.</b> Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will <b>not</b> <b>win</b> either—indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket i of the lottery that ticket i will <b>not</b> <b>win.</b> However, accepting that ticket 1 will <b>not</b> <b>win,</b> accepting that ticket 2 will <b>not</b> <b>win,</b> and so on until accepting that ticket 1000 will <b>not</b> <b>win</b> entails that it is rational to accept that no ticket will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contradictory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins.|$|R
50|$|Between 1947 and 1968, the Australian Capital Territory did <b>not</b> <b>win</b> the Mack Gilley Shield. They {{finally broke}} their losing streak by winning in 1978, 1979 and 1980. They did <b>not</b> <b>win</b> again between 1981 and 1994.|$|R

5|$|As title holders, Manchester City were {{entitled}} to defend the Cup Winners' Cup in the 1970–71 season. Had they <b>not</b> <b>won</b> the trophy, they would still have been qualified for European competition, as City's victory in the 1970 League Cup granted {{a place in the}} Fairs Cup. As a UEFA-organised competition, the Cup Winners' Cup took precedence over the Fairs Cup, and so the club took a place in the former. In the first round Manchester City almost suffered an upset at the hands of Linfield, from Belfast. City held a one-goal lead after the first leg, but Linfield twice took the lead in the second leg. The match finished 2–1 to Linfield, and Manchester City progressed on the away goals rule. Honvéd were the opposition in the second round. Manchester City won both legs, the score 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|Both Democrats and Republicans were {{concerned}} about the presence of S. Brewer Erwin, nominee of the newly formed Populist Party, in the race; he enjoyed strong support for a third-party candidate, despite the fact that many believed his party's platform was too radical. Democrats, who were used to carrying the agrarian vote by a wide margin, were especially concerned that the Farmers' Alliance, consisting of over 125,000 members in Kentucky, would endorse Erwin. This did not occur, however, and in the general election, Brown defeated Wood by a vote of 144,168 to 116,087. Though he won the election, Brown had <b>not</b> <b>won</b> a majority of the votes; Populist Erwin captured 25,631 votes – 9 percent of the total cast – and a Prohibition candidate received 3,292 votes.|$|E
5|$|Brazil was {{hosting the}} FIFA World Cup {{for the second}} time (after 1950), and had won the tournament on five {{previous}} occasions.
