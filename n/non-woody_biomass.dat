40|$|The ambitious {{targets of}} the European Union in {{increasing}} the use of renewable energies to 20 % of Europe’s energy needs, call for urgent changes, including in the biomass sector. The share of solid biomass for heating purposes could be further increased by replacing oil- and gas-fired furnaces with biomass boilers and by expanding the spectrum of biomass raw materials for small-scale combustion systems. The interest in using <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels for heat production has been increasing in Europe due to two main factors. First, the market for fossil fuels is unstable and their prices are continuously rising. Second, the increase competition for woody biomass between the heating sector and other industries, have increased the price of wood. As a result, the interest for alternative biomass fuels is growing rapidly, covering woody materials of low quality, energy crops and forest residues. The present work aims at investigating the technical feasibility of using <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels in existing small-scale combustion appliances developed for burning wood. Therefore, combustion tests with different <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels and in different combustion appliances were performed in standard laboratory conditions and in households under real life conditions (field tests). The laboratory tests were performed using eight different fuels (straw, Miscanthus, maize, vineyard pruning, hay, wheat bran and Sorghum) while in the field tests straw, Miscanthus and maize were burned. The gaseous and particle emissions, the slag tendency and {{the efficiency of the}} combustion systems operated with <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels were analysed and when possible compared with the legal requirements defined in FPrEN 303 - 5. The limitations of the investigated combustion appliances when operated with <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels were analysed and discussed. <b>Non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels could be used for heat production in existing combustion appliances as long as the systems are adapted for burning high ash content fuels. Among the investigated fuels, Miscanthus, vineyard pruning and hay could be burnt in most of the tested combustion appliances while fulfilling the legal European requirements (defined in FprEN 303 - 5) in terms of emissions and efficiency. The <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels showed problems with ash accumulation and slag formation and could only be burned without unwanted shutdowns in combustion appliances adapted to manage high ash content fuels. Straw, wheat bran and maize were the most problematic fuels regarding slagging. The combustion appliances require appropriate technological developments to manage the strong variability in terms of chemical and thermal properties of the <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels. The results of the laboratory tests were generally in agreement with the field test results.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to compare mass loss and chemical evolution of the solid phase, versus time, during dynamic torrefaction {{of different types of}} biomass. For this purpose, two experiments, ThermoGravimetric Analysis and solid-state 13 C Cross-Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, were run on four representative biomasses. Overall mass loss and chemical evolution of the solid phase were followed, respectively, as a function of temperature and time. Thanks to this coupled information, it was shown that the knowledge of both solid mass loss and chemical evolution is necessary to characterize torrefaction severity. Moreover, biomasses containing higher proportions of xylan lost mass faster than those containing lower proportions. Lignin showed a protecting role towards cellulose, which would lead to a faster degradation of <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomasses</b> in comparison with woody biomasses. Three parameters would have an influence on solid chemical evolution during torrefaction: xylan content in hemicellulose, lignin content in biomass, and cellulose crystallinity.

Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising technology for CSS that can be integrated into the new and the current fleet of power plants.

The net energy content in Ocimum canum was found to be slightly higher than that in Tridax procumbens.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} pyrolysis {{was employed}} to produce solid fuel biochars from woody (pine wood) and <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> (coconut fiber) in the present study. Chemical evolution of biomass under pyrolysis conditions was determined and fuel qualities of the biochars were evaluated including energy densities, ash-related problems and combustion behaviors. The results showed that dehydration reaction of the biomass had same preference with decarboxylation reaction under pyrolysis conditions. The hemicellulose and cellulose in <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> showed faster decomposition than those in woody biomass. The biochars derived from coconut fiber showed lower energy densities and energy yields than those from pine wood under identical conditions. All major ash forming metals originally contained in raw biomass were accumulated in the resultant biochars and more serious slagging and fouling problems were present during combustion of pyrolytic biochars compared to raw biomass. The reactivity of biomass decreased and the main mass loss shifted to elevated temperature zone with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, indicating increased thermal efficiency and environmental benefits were achievable during biochar combustion compared to raw biomass combustion. Taking into account combustion characteristics and energy yield, optimal pyrolysis temperatures for solid fuel production were around 300 degrees C for coconut fiber and 330 degrees C for pine wood.

The analysis considered the establishment, harvest, storage and drying costs of the feedstock’s on-farm, together with transportation costs to the processing plant and {{the costs associated with}} the pelleting process. Capital and operating costs of the pelleting process were estimated at several plant capacities – 6 t / h, 8 t / h and 10 t / h. The pellet production cost for the base case scenario of 8 t / h was 102 / t of pellets produced. By decreasing production capacity to 6 t / h an increase in the production cost of 10 / t was experienced while increasing capacity to 10 t / h resulted in a decrease of 6 / t in the production cost of pellets. The cost of the raw material is the largest cost component (66 %) of the total pellet production cost. Other major cost factors include pelleting and cooling plant (11 %), straw grinding plant (10 %) and personnel costs (9 %).

Therefore, the present study evaluated the proximate, ultimate, chemical, and fuel characteristics of wood and charcoal of three invasive non-forest tree species in Saudi Arabia: Calotropis procera, Rhazya stricta, and Phragmites australis, which were compared with the wood of Acacia tortilis, a preferable local fuelwood. All these data were discussed to investigate the possibility of using the invasive plants for energy production. The thermal behavior of wood was analyzed using thermo-gravimetric and derivative thermo-gravimetric methods. Overall, compared with the wood of A. tortilis, the woods of R. stricta and P. australis are suitable for energy production.

It {{is a type of}} thermo-chemical pre-treatment process applicable to biomass in order to convert it into compatible energy fuels. Torrefaction has favorable effects on biomass, which includes increasing its energy density and eliminating problems commonly associated with raw biomass such as high moisture content, hygroscopic behavior and low calorific value. In this study, torrefaction of agricultural residue, oil palm frond (<b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass)</b> and short rotation energy crop, Leucaena Leucocephala (woody biomass) were conducted in a horizontal tube furnace at five temperatures and holding time of 60 min. High heating values, elemental and proximate analyses results, thermal degradation profiles of torrefied fibrous products were compared to its raw forms. It was concluded that as torrefaction conditions became more severe, this led to a more qualified and energy-dense solid fuel with higher fixed carbon content, increased calorific values and reduced hydrogen and oxygen contents. The results gained from this study may provide basic information for torrefied products application in combustor and/or gasifier design...|$|E

The fixed bed gasification systems are classified as updraft, Imbert downdraft, throatless downdraft, crossdraft and two stage gasifiers. Updraft gasifiers are suitable for gasification of biomass containing high ash (up to 15 %) and high moisture content (up to 50 %) and generate producer gas having high tar content (50 – 100 g/Nm 3). The high temperature (830 oC) air gasification of biomass in updraft gasifiers increase the lower calorific value of producer gas and reduce the tar content.

Unfortunately, the heavy reliance on this form of energy is a threat to forest ecosystems and a recipe for accelerated land resource degradation.

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the supply and consumption patterns of fuel biomass and estimate the amount of nutrients that could be lost from burning <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> energy sources.

The florafuel process used here is comprised of size reduction followed by washing and subsequent mechanical dewatering of the biomass. Densification of the upgraded biomass into standardized pellets (Ø 6 mm) enables an application in existing small-scale boilers. The presented combustion trials investigated the performance of pellets made from leached grass, foliage and a mixture of both in two small-scale boilers (< 100 kWth) with slightly different technology (moving grate versus water-cooled burner tube) during a 4 -h measurement period.

40|$|Background: Biorefining of {{lignocellulosic}} biomass {{has become}} one of the most valuable alternatives for the production of multi-products such as biofuels. Pretreatment is a prerequisite to increase the enzymatic conversion of the recalcitrant lignocellulose. However, there is still considerable debate regarding the key features of biomass impacting the cellulase accessibility. In this study, we evaluate the structural and chemical features of three different representative biomasses (Miscanthus x giganteus, poplar and wheat straw), before and after steam explosion pretreatment at increasing severities, by monitoring chemical analysis, SEM, FTIR and 2 D NMR. Results: Regardless the biomass type, combined steam explosion pretreatment with dilute sulfuric acid impregnation resulted in significant improvement of the cellulose conversion. Chemical analyses revealed that the pretreatment selectively degraded the hemicellulosic fraction and associated cross-linking ferulic acids. As a result, the pretreated residues contained mostly cellulosic glucose and lignin. In addition, the pretreatment directly affected the cellulose crystallinity but these variations were dependent upon the biomass type. Important chemical modifications also occurred in lignin since the beta-O- 4 ' aryl-ether linkages were found to be homolytically cleaved, followed by some recoupling/recondensation to beta-beta' and beta- 5 ' linkages, regardless the biomass type. Finally, 2 D NMR analysis of the whole biomass showed that the pretreatment preferentially degraded the syringyl-type lignin fractions in miscanthus and wheat straw while it was not affected in the pretreated poplar samples. Conclusions: Our findings provide an enhanced understanding of parameters impacting biomass recalcitrance, which can be easily generalized to both woody and <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> species. Results indeed suggest that the hemicellulose removal accompanied by the significant reduction in the cross-linking phenolic acids and the redistribution of lignin are strongly correlated with the enzymatic saccharification, by loosening the cell wall structure thus allowing easier cellulase accessibility. By contrast, we have shown that the changes in the syringyl/guaiacyl ratio and the cellulose crystallinity do not seem to be relevant factors in assessing the enzymatic digestibility. Some biomass type-dependent and easily measurable FTIR factors are highly correlated to saccharification...|$|E

The Industrial Revolution brought about a heavy demand for wood charcoal, and up until the late 1800 s the largest volume was used by the iron industry. Today, coal derived cokes are used and wood carbonization, and use of distillates, is practiced more in developing countries. Despite the decline of the traditional wood pyrolysis industries, a great deal of technical information regarding cellulose (and lignocellulosic) decomposition kinetics, mechanisms, thermodynamics and byproducts has been acquired using modern analytical techniques. Several different markets provided motivation for the pursuit of this information. Those markets include: activated carbons, textiles, composite materials, fire retardant wood products and energy from biomass and refuse. While much information is available from these works, there exists a gap in knowledge regarding monolithic carbonized wood. Specifically, no studies have been found relating to methods. Biomass, especially wood, has traditionally been an important source of energy particularly attractive nowadays because of its inherent nature of being environmentally friendly and renewable The aims of the present project work have been to characterize the proximate analysis and calorific value of different components of BANMICHAI (non woody biomass species). The second aim was to carbonize the different components in the temperature range of 300 - 900 °C From the experiments we observed that there is {{a significant increase in the}} calorific value with increase in the carbonization temperature. Therefore it is evident that for higher carbonization temperature the biomass species i. e. BANMICHAI can suitably be preferred over other conventional sources of energy.

The net energy content in Sida is the highest. Xanthium biomass species appears to have slightly higher calorific values in its components than those of Anisomeles and Eupatorium. The pattern of variation of calorific value in the components like stump, branch, leaf and bark is not identical for all the presently studied biomass species. In all these studied biomass species, the calorific values of leaves, in general, are after stump and branch. The data for proximate and ultimate analysis of the components of these species are very close to each other and hence {{it is very difficult to}} draw a concrete conclusion. However, it appears from the present work that Eupatorium and Xanthium biomass species have the highest fixed carbon and lowest volatile matter contents in their stumps than the stumps of the others. As for ash fusion temperature The Sida biomass species has the highest values of IDT, ST, HT and FT (7860 - 1490 ˚C) for its ash, followed by Anisomeles (740 - 1441 ˚C). Xanthium and Eupatorium have lower values for IDT, ST, HT and FT (670 - 1244 ˚C) for their ashes.

Biomass is a well-known waste material that has heterogeneous nature. This complicated nature poses a barrier on the competitiveness of biomass in the energy generation market. One of the methods is through the hydrothermal carbonization process. It is also proven through various experiments that the hydrothermal carbonization process {{has the ability to}} convert different type of biomass into higher carbon products. However, the complexity of biomass in nature shows that various chemical and physical characteristics were reported. Therefore, in this study, a comparison between carbon products from woody and non-woody agricultural waste via hydrothermal carbonization was done. Wood chips (WC) were chosen for the woody type of biomass, while for the non-woody, the oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) was chosen. The hydrothermal carbonization process occurs in the excess water with the addition of citric acid as the catalyst. The reaction process occurs in a pressure vessel for temperature, 220 °C at different operating time. The chemical (elemental analysis, proximate analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermagravimetric analysis (TGA),) and physical characteristic (field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) andgas pyconometer) ratio) of the carbon products were verified. The hydrothermal carbonization process converts the EFB and WC into higher percentage of carbon content solid products. The carbon conversion of EFB‟s carbon increased for 20 % compared to the raw EFB (43. 8 % of carbon). Based on the FESEM pictures, the formation of globular structure on the EFB biocarbons‟ surface area can be seen, while, severe damages on the fibres can be observed on the morphology of WC biocarbons. In general, carbon products from hydrothermal carbonization process have the ability to produce more energy compared to their raw materials. However, the <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass</b> product has higher carbon conversion and combustion ability compared to the woody biomass‟ carbon...|$|E

This study aims at discussing the problems and the sustainability of the energy system in one rural settlement in the southern Rwanda, called Ngera. The settlement is one of the villages that were built after the genocide in 1994 to manage and resettle the returnees. Through interviews, observations, participatory exercises and quantitative measurements, a description of the energy resources and energy system was achieved, and the processes biomass production, collection, combustion and energy services were understood and analysed. Woody biomass is the main energy resource in Rwanda. For domestic use it serves as energy for food preparation, water heating, space heating, lighting and clothes washing. There is no electricity in the village and the inhabitants mostly collect and use trees and tree litter from nearby public forests and tree plots. The biomass of the woody plants in the forest where most of the villagers fetch fuel is 50 - 300 t/ha, depending on how dense the trees grow. The villagers spend in average one hour in the forest every day to collect and transport fuelwood to their homes. Through combustion of the fuelwood in a traditional Kinyarwanda three-stones stove or a fuel-economic stove called rondereza, the villagers get energy. After combusting the fuel the ash is put on arable plots to serve as fertilizer. Other energy carriers that the villagers use are <b>non-woody</b> <b>biomass,</b> fossil fuels like kerosene and diesel, as well as galvanic batteries and solar cells. They are used to get light or to use equipment such as radios and watches. The Kinyarwanda stove is the most common in the village and has an efficiency of 16 - 21 %. Although the rondereza is well promoted by the government there are only two households in the settlement that have invested in it. There are some possible reasons for that; firstly, traditions keep people to what they are accustomed to, and secondly, {{there is a lack of}} both skills and monetary means. Thirdly, there are reasons such as lack of information, since the settlement is segregated from other villages, and participation in the training and education is scarce. Education is often dictated by men for men, and since men are not using the stove they are not keen on replacing stoves. Fourthly, Rwandan traditions say that one should not talk about family matters outside the family and therefore the knowledge is spread slowly. The organic law, implemented in 2005, aims at protecting the environment. It forbids people to cut or harm trees. The law has led to an increase in labour input for the inhabitants to find fuel. Even though it is a good initiative in the long run, it affects and worsens especially the women’s situation in Rwanda. They have to spend more time away from home, less time on their children, education and income work...|$|E
