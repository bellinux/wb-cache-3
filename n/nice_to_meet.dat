2500|$|As soon as {{he became}} a {{cardinal}}, François de Tournon was drawn into {{the affairs of the}} King of England. [...] Henry VIII wanted a divorce from the Emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon. The one person who {{might have been able to}} manage the intricacies of the Roman Curia on his behalf, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, [...] had been imprudently cast aside. [...] Henry desperately needed someone else to deal with the Curia for him. [...] He tried getting a cardinal of his own: the Bishop of Worcester, Girolamo Ghinucci; [...] Gregory di Casale; Giambattista Casale; Giovanni Matteo Giberti, Bishop of Verona; and Stephen Gardiner. [...] The King was successful with none of them, facing opposition from the Emperor, the Curia, and even the families of the would-be cardinals. [...] Finally Henry realized that he would have to rely on someone else's resources, and he turned to King Francis I. [...] A meeting between the two monarchs took place at Boulogne on 20 October 1532, in which it was agreed that the two new French cardinals, Gramont and Tournon, should be sent to Rome to publicize the new rapprochement between England and France, to remove opposition to 'the King's great matter', and to bring about an alliance between France and the Papacy through the marriage of the Pope's niece and the King's son. [...] Pope Clement was to be invited to <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with King Francis, and perhaps with Henry VIII.|$|E
2500|$|After her {{elimination}} from American Idol, Miller {{announced plans}} to launch a music career as soon as possible, {{as well as an}} eventual acting career. Of her intents for her debut studio album, Miller has revealed that she would like to write or co-write all material and intends to show all sides to her personality in an intricate and artistic manner which she feels current mainstream music largely lacks. She further explained, [...] "I want to have music that has meaning and is real. I don't want to have dance-party music, but at the same time, I don't want to put people to sleep. I want to incorporate the soulful piano sound with a lot of edge. I know the message that I want to send out, and I know the music I want to do. I can't wait to show it to people." [...] The top three finalists – Miller, Candice Glover and Harrison – recorded background vocals on a song for judge Mariah Carey's fourteenth studio album, though it is yet to be confirmed whether it will be on the final track listing. On May 17, 2013, subsequent to the series' finale, Miller released her debut single [...] "You Set Me Free" [...] to digital retailers via her American Idol contract with 19 Recordings. On May 22, 2013, reports surfaced that Miller had signed a publishing contract with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG), and is in midst of searching for a record deal. In June 2013, Miller confirmed she was co-writing with Toby Gad, Autumn Rowe, David Hodges, Adam Watts and his Red Decibel team and recording demos in Los Angeles, California through social media. Along with the remainder of the Top 11 from season twelve, Miller embarked on the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2013, where she showcased original music, from July to August 2013. Later that year she also joined Jessie J at a concert of her <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> You Tour in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Nice, {{now back}} in the first division, stunned many when the club won the Coupe de France. The victory did not, however, shock most French {{football}} enthusiasts mainly due to the club's competition in the run up to the final, in which Nice faced only Division 2 clubs, excluding first division club Bastia. In the final, Nice defeated Guingamp 5–4 on penalties to earn cup success. On a sourer note, however, Nice were relegated from the first division only days after winning the Coupe de France in dead last in the league. The club spent five seasons in Ligue 2 and returned to Ligue 1 for the 2001–02 season. In the lead up <b>to</b> the season, <b>Nice</b> failed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the financial requirements set by the DNCG and were, subsequently, relegated to the Championnat National, the third level of French football. However, after achieving stability, mainly due to selling a few players, Nice were allowed in Ligue 1 after successfully appealing.

40|$|The {{concept of}} form (shape) in {{industrial}} design includes final and overall outer {{appearance of a}} product which is manufactured in series. Form {{is an element of}} industrial design of a product and it is determined by material, methods of manufacturing, colour and very often by certain ornaments. All these elements contribute to aesthetic value of the product. The aim of industrial design as a creative branch is not to make the product look <b>nice,</b> but <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the requirements such as: functionality, economity, psychological adaptability to men, creating and ensuring harmony between the product and the man, as its user. Ecological and aesthetic requirements are equally important. Technological suitability of shaping is achieved through adjusting construction details to the need of simpliflying manufacturing procedure, taking into account not to impair the function, hardness, appearance or some other characteristic of a machinery part. The shape of the machinery part must be adjusted to manufacturing technology, which means that it also depends on the technological level of the manufacturer. The aim {{of this paper is to}} establish the connection between the shape of the machinery part and manufacturing technologies...|$|R
