Following the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, however, the annual renewal of China’s MFN status became a source of considerable debate in the Congress; and legislation was introduced to terminate China’s MFN/NTR status or to impose additional conditions relating to improvements in China’s actions on various trade and non-trade issues. Agricultural interests generally opposed attempts to block MFN /NTR renewal for China, contending that several billion dollars annually in current and future U.S. agricultural exports could be jeopardized if that country retaliated.

The commission voted 5-0 that the U.S. industry was being harmed by the import of circular steel pipe from China. The decision marked the first time a U.S. industry has won a decision to impose tariffs on a Chinese product based on the argument that the Chinese government was unfairly subsidizing a Chinese industry. The ruling means penalty tariffs ranging from 99 percent to 701 percent will be imposed on Chinese imports of circular welded pipe. For more than two decades, the U.S. government had refused to consider subsidy cases against the Chinese government because China was classified as a <b>non-market</b> <b>economy.</b> However, the Bush administration, facing increasing anger over soaring trade deficits with China, reversed course in late 2007 and announced it would treat China {{in the same way as}} other countries in disputes involving government subsidies ("US Steel Industry Wins Trade Case against China", Associated Press, June 20, 2008).|$|E

50|$|U.S. - Vietnam Trade Relations {{refer to}} the {{bilateral}} trade relationship between the United States of America (U.S.) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) from 1990s to 2012. After {{more than two decades}} of no economic relationship {{since the end of the}} Vietnam War, the two governments reestablished economic relationship during the 1990s. The bilateral trade between the U.S. and Vietnam grew slowly afterwards, and it has developed rapidly after the signing of the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement in December 2001. Total bilateral trade turnover has increased 1200% from $1.5 billion in 2001 to over $20 billion in 2011. The bilateral trade relations further developed after the U.S. granted Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status as part of Vietnam’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007. The U.S. and Vietnam also came to a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in 2007. Vietnam was recently the United States' 26th largest goods imports partner with $17.5 billion in 2011, and was the 45th largest goods export market with $3.7 billion in 2010. Vietnam with six other partners are now in the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations with the U.S. The growth in bilateral trade has also been accompanied by issues and problems, e.g. anti-dumping cases, worker’s rights, <b>non-market</b> <b>economy,</b> Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection and Vietnam’s exchange rate policy.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the U. S. placed more {{antidumping}} duties against China {{than any other}} country. This paper analyzes the U.

Detailed antidumping data show {{that the number of}} antidumping cases initiated against China was not proportional to the amount of trade between the U. S. and China. Further, industries that were more likely to file and win antidumping cases were not industries dominated by Chinese imports. Instead, China’s status as a <b>non-market</b> <b>economy</b> explains the number of U. S. antidumping cases filed against China. In the sections of the antidumping process where <b>non-market</b> <b>economy</b> status is considered, the U.

Further, in non-market economies the fair price of the disputed good is always constructed, and countries are more likely to be found to be dumping when the fair price is constructed.

40|$|PhDIn November 2001, the WTO members {{allowed the}} People's Republic of China, a {{formerly}} planned {{economy that is}} going through different stages of domestic economic and related legal restructuring, to accede to the WTO. This accession {{is believed to be}} necessary for the WTO to become a truly international organisation in the post-Cold War era, along side of the IMF and the World Bank, and for China to become an integrated member of the international economic community. Although the end of the Cold War has changed European trade policy profoundly, the European Community (EC) " has maintained a traditionally bifurcated trade policy, in which planned economies, also referred to as "non-market economies", are given treatment different from market economies in trade policy instruments, such as the EC emergency safeguards provisions and EC anti-dumping regulation. The EC perceives the Chinese domestic legal and economic reforms as unfinished; and, although the treatment of Chinese products under the EC import and anti-dumping regulations has been liberalised in recent years, China is still generally considered to be a <b>non-market</b> <b>economy.</b> It is questionable whether in light of China's WTO accession such a non-market approach vis-Ã¤-vis China, as approved in the Chinese Protocol of Accession, is justified. This thesis argues that the non-market approach for China, as it stands today, should be adjusted for two basic reasons. First, this approach does not allow China to benefit fully from its WTO accession {{for a number of years}} to come. Second, as long as the period allowing <b>non-market</b> <b>economy</b> treatment continues, the danger exists that the <b>non-market</b> <b>economy</b> trade policy, especially as far as anti-dumping is concerned, may tend to be abused for protectionist purposes by the EC. Protectionist abuse would be harmful for China because its export-oriented growth is necessary to advance the country's domestic legal and economic reforms. Protectionism, equally, would be harmful for the EC because it prevents the Community industry from adjusting itself to face the challenge of increased Chinese competition. Because there is no satisfactory methodological solution to deal with the new variant of non-market economies, and because it is impossible for China - despite all good intentions - to implement fully the WTO accession requirements by the time they must phase in, the suggested approach is for the EC to show restraint in employing these trade policy instruments against China. As far as emergency safeguards are concerned, this restraint is already a fact. Nonetheless, some holdovers from the Cold War should be put up for change.

The first three parts argue about the problem traditional historiography encounters when studying innovations under the socialist <b>non-market</b> <b>economy</b> because of the inherently theoretical load of the very concept of innovation. They apply Joseph Schumpeter approach to the innovation in <b>non-market</b> <b>economy,</b> developed further by Peter Murrell (Murrell 1990), and critically adapted by the author {{in the light of the}} achievements of French sociology of innovation (techno-economic networks approach of Michel Callon) and theory of 'second networks' of socialism, developed by Czech sociologist Ivo Mozni and Bulgarian sociologists A.

The second part of the paper discusses the empirically observed patterns of innovation under the socialist economy and analyses the activities of one key figure of Bulgarian industrial development in the second half of XXth century – Prof. Ivan Popov (Chairman of the State Committee of Science and Technical Progress, Minister of Electronic Industry, Minister of Machine-Building Industry and member of Bulgarian Communist Party Politburo, founder of Bulgarian Scientific and Technical Intelligence Service). The analysis, which is based predominantly on oral interviews, memories, and archival sources, outlines a distinct type of 'socialist entrepreneur' defined by the specific resources he has mobilized to introduces the corresponding innovations, some in the scale of entire industrial branches. This provides a ground for further comparisons with other possible types of 'socialist entrepreneurship', so that we could be able to better understanding of the peculiarities of the socialist economic environment, including the 'deficit' of entrepreneurial motivation and the necessity of its 'import' from abroad (capitalist countries).
