5000|$|As {{a result}} of fight of supply and high {{operating}} rates in May 1997, two chlorine producers took the bold initiative of calling for an average price rise of $25 per short ton. Other producers were considering bringing the total price increase for the 1997 product year to date of up to $80 per short and fob ton, from $45-$50 per short and fob ton in May 1996. This occurred as both rapidly ascending demand from the vinyl polymer chain market and the unusually strong seasonal demand and <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>production</b> capacity on the immediate horizon coincided. The price increase had its firm foundations in the incumbent bullish market dynamics of the mid-2000s.

5000|$|After the East German {{television}} stopped broadcasting in 1991, {{there were}} <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>productions</b> for television. Since 1993, {{there have been}} live performances featuring the original puppet characters, nearly only in the formerly East German states of Germany. The show, commonly known under the names Zu Besuch im Märchenland and Pittiplatsch und seine Freunde ("Pittiplatsch and his friends"), is run by Show-Express-Könnern. The puppeteers Heinz Schröder and Bärbel Möllendorf performed live along with the musician Henry Kaufmann, whose role {{was taken over by}} Helmut Frommhold in 2005. Schröder's death on April 22, 2009 put the show on hold. In August 2009, it continued under the name Wenn der Zirkus kommt ("When the circus comes"), with a new focus on circus elements. Pittiplatsch was absent, and other classic puppet characters were added instead, including Moppi. In November of the same year, Pittiplatsch returned. The show's name was changed to Pittiplatsch auf Reisen (roughly [...] "Pittiplatsch is travelling"). The first performance with Pittiplatsch after Schröder's death took place on November 7. Pittiplatsch was then puppeteered and voiced by Norbert Schwarz. The ensemble stated that they chose him for the role since his voice was [...] "very similar" [...] to the original voice of Pitti. In May 2010, it was reported that Pittiplatsch's puppeteer had changed again. Christian Sengewald took over the role after he replied to a want ad.

50|$|When about a {{third of}} the oldest leaves become discolored, the spear leaf will die, {{displaying}} a tan, rather than green color. The spear leaf is the youngest leaf, generally seen in the center of the canopy. In obvious situations, the dead spear life can be seen hanging down or broken off of the canopy. This indicates that the apical meristem is dead and there will be <b>no</b> <b>new</b> leaf <b>production</b> or growth. In most cases, without close examination, the spear leaf will not be easy to find or observe if it is still alive. Occasionally, when the spear leaf dies, some palms experience root rot. This is a major symptom that differentiates TPPD from lethal yellowing, since LY does not experience root decay.|$|R

Along with developments in relevant technologies such as solar panels, gives incentives to think in new ways on shelters and hall systems for disaster aid. W. Giertsen Hallsystem AS (WGH) have long traditions on delivering equipment for disaster aid, and is currently one of the suppliers to NOREPS permanent stock of equipment used in case of emergencies world wide. NOREPS is a Norwegian organization which provides relief agencies with immediate support during emergency operations. WGH wants to investigate if there is new potential for their hall systems, based on the new developments in this market. Background information concerning WGH and its competitors is presented. Background is also given on the context where the hall systems are used. Based on the context study, the assembly crew is chosen as the user-group to focus on. Interviews with assembly crew and designers at WGH are done. Participation {{on the construction of}} an NG 3 hall in Bergen is done to get practical experience with the challenges of setting up a larger hall. Based on these findings, several possible projects are listed. A focus on rainwater harvesting with its untapped potential is chosen for further study. The product to base a future solution on is chosen to be the NG 1 system. A literature study gives further background on rainwater harvesting. A collection of existing products gives inspiration to new ideas. Through brainstorming and idea generation using sketches, two concepts stand out as good candidates for detailing. One concept prepares the existing hall systems for rainwater harvesting. The other concept presents an option of redesigning the typical hall-structure, making it more adapted to auxiliary systems such as rainwater harvesting (RWH), solar power and ventilation. A gutter solution is chosen as the concept to be detailed. The result is a simple yet efficient add-on for the NG 1 system. The solution takes advantage of the existing supply chain of WGH and its sub-contractors. Materials are chosen so <b>no</b> <b>new</b> <b>production</b> technologies are needed. All the vital tools for assembly are already in place. The RWH system that is suggested has many positive side-effects, most importantly it increases the availability of potable water in a situation where infrastructure and supplies presents a challenge that needs to be solved. </p...|$|E

40|$|The U. C. Berkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer has {{measured}} the mid-infrared visibilities {{of the carbon}} star IRC + 10216 and the red supergiant VY CMa. The dust shells around these sources have been previously shown to be time-variable, and these new data are used to probe {{the evolution of the}} dust shells on a decade time-scale, complementing contemporaneous studies at other wavelengths. Self-consistent, sphericallysymmetric models at maximum and minimum light both show the inner radius of the IRC + 10216 dust shell to be much larger (150 mas) than that expected from the dust condensation temperature, implying that dust production has slowed or stopped in recent years. Apparently, dust does not form every pulsational cycle (638 days), and these mid-infrared results are consistent with recent near-IR imaging which indicates little or <b>no</b> <b>new</b> dust <b>production</b> {{in the last three years}} (Tuthill et al. 2000).

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{is a human}} herpesvirus {{which causes}} little or no disease in the immunocompetent. However, in immunocompromised individuals, neonates, or patients on immune suppressive therapies, HCMV can cause significant morbidity and mortality in some patient groups. As with all herpesviruses, HCMV has two life cycle phases: a productive phase, where new virions are produced and a latent phase {{where there is a}} restricted gene transcription profile and <b>no</b> <b>new</b> virion <b>production.</b> Currently available antivirals target the productive phase of HCMV infection and, although these have greatly decreased the severity of HCMV-induced disease in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals, they often have associated toxicities, routinely result in selection of drug resistant viral mutants, and, importantly, they do not target cells latently infected with virus. Thus, there is a real need to derive novel antiviral therapies which, not least, are also able to target latent infection. In this paper, we describe recent work which has begun to analyse changes in the cell associated with latent infection and the possibility that these latency-associated changes in cell phenotype could be targeted by novel chemo- or immunotherapeutic strategies in order to diminish, or even clear, latent infection at least in some specific clinical settings.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} basis for analyzing <b>new</b> <b>production</b> of upwelling centers {{under various conditions}} and for comparing the relative performance of different upwelling centers has been developed using the concept of shift-up or acceleration of N 03 - uptake.

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>production</b> in the Irminger basin {{over the}} annual cycle 2001 – 2002 is {{estimated}} by considering changes in inorganic nutrient standing stocks between April and August 2002, with additional terms for nutrient fluxes across the thermocline and atmospheric deposition. <b>New</b> <b>production</b> before April and after August is argued to be negligible, and we estimate an annual <b>new</b> <b>production</b> rate of 36 gC m− 2 year− 1 within the basin. Approximately 30 % of the nitrogen removed in <b>new</b> <b>production</b> accumulates as total organic nitrogen {{and is not}} exported over seasonal time scales. No systematic spatial variability in export was observed, probably due to smoothing by mesoscale activity and the widely spaced observations. Examination of satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll levels and vertical nutrient data suggests that production begins {{at the margins of}} the basin, in particular on the Greenland shelf where it is dominated by non-siliceous phytoplankton, and then spreads to its centre. Our value for <b>new</b> <b>production</b> is lower than estimates predicted from satellite images of chlorophyll, but consistent with estimates from temperature/nitrate (T/N) regressions and Argo float data. Interannual variability in mixed layer depth is unlikely to be the source of this discrepancy, suggesting that factors not considered in the algorithms to derive export production from satellite chlorophyll concentrations, such as species succession, may {{play an important role in}} high latitudes. Satellite ocean colour data show persistently high chlorophyll concentrations from June–August suggesting that <b>new</b> <b>production</b> may follow a similar seasonality. However, T/N relationships suggest that most nitrate is removed before surface seawater temperature reaches 6 °C, a situation which satellites and Argo floats suggest occurs by the end of May; thus, most <b>new</b> <b>production</b> is likely to occur before this time. Nitrate/silicate drawdown ratios, cross-thermocline fluxes and initial pool sizes suggest that <b>new</b> <b>production</b> is likely to have been dominated by diatoms which become silicate limited with <b>new</b> <b>production</b> failing to exhaust nitrate stocks for, as yet, unclear reasons...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of annual potential <b>new</b> <b>production</b> at a regional scale for {{the decade of}} the 1980 s provides the main focus of this thesis. <b>New</b> <b>production</b> is the proportion of total primary production which relies on the uptake of NO₃-N by the phytoplankton while potential <b>new</b> <b>production</b> assumes that all the NO₃-N available to primary producers is assimilated. The Redfield ratio between carbon and nitrogen in the marine environment was used to express rates of potential <b>new</b> <b>production</b> in terms of carbon. In order to arrive at annual estimates of potential <b>new</b> <b>production</b> it was necessary to progress from the event-scale to the annual scale. This was achieved by the adoption of two novel methods of approach. Event-scale estimates of potential <b>new</b> <b>production</b> were made by assessing the amount of NO₃-N present in the nominal euphotic zone as a result of upwelling. Remotely-sensed images of sea surface temperature (SST) coincident with or shortly after upwelling events were used in combination with a derived relationship between SST and NO₃-N concentrations integrated over the depth range of the productive surface layer in the southern Benguela region. In this way it was possible to overcome the main shortcoming of passive satellite imagery by quantifying a sub-surface variable. The event-scale estimates of potential <b>new</b> <b>production</b> were extrapolated to the annual-scale by taking into account the dynamics of the system. Sea level fluctuation at the coast preceding upwelling events was found {{to be related to the}} event-scale estimates of introduced NO₃-N and hence used as a proxy for upwelling. Using a ten year record of sea level, estimates of annual potential <b>new</b> <b>production,</b> spanning the period June to May inclusive, were made for the period 1980 / 81 to 1989 / 90.
