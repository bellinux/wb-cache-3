5|$|When the United States entered World War II, the {{military}} {{was in need of}} nurses. Hispanic female nurses wanted to volunteer for service, however they were not accepted into the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many women went to work in the factories which produced military equipment. As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces, a need for bilingual nurses became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic nurses. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses. Thirteen women submitted applications, were interviewed, underwent physical examinations, and were accepted into the ANC. Eight of these <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the Army Post at San Juan, Puerto Rico where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero in Puerto Rico. One of these nurses was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler.|$|E

5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{plans for}} both his {{marriage}} to Mary and his appointment as Viceroy of Ireland were under discussion, Albert Victor fell ill with influenza in the pandemic of 1889–92. He developed pneumonia and died at Sandringham House in Norfolk on 14 January 1892, {{less than a week}} after his 28th birthday. The Prince and Princess of Wales, Princesses Maud and Victoria, Prince George, Princess Mary, the Duke and Duchess of Teck, three physicians (Alan Reeve Manby, Francis Laking and William Broadbent) and three <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> present. The Prince of Wales's chaplain, Canon Frederick Hervey, stood over Albert Victor reading prayers for the dying.|$|E

This qualitative study seeks to gain an understanding of the perceptions of active nurses in Pakistan about nursing art and yields four major themes: artful <b>nursing</b> <b>is</b> embedded in humane responsiveness, artful nursing has healing power, artful <b>nursing</b> <b>is</b> a satisfying experience, and artful <b>nursing</b> <b>is</b> invisible in <b>nursing</b> practice.

Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{was also}} the first {{conflict}} in which women, other than <b>nurses,</b> <b>were</b> allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many of the island's women work force migrated to the mainland U.S. to work in the factories which produced military equipment. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not {{have to deal with the}} language barriers. Among them was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler, who became one of the first Puerto Rican female military officers.|$|E
5|$|The Faroese Nursing School was {{established}} in 1960 by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs; it traces its roots back in 1910 when <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> trained in the hospital of Tórshavn.

Jacobsen, a Dane, was appointed as the first lecturer in 1970 to teach courses for the examen philosophicum, a prerequisite {{at the time to}} pursue higher education in Denmark. After Denmark abandoned the examen philosophicum in 1971, on the initiative of Jacobsen and Kjartan Hoydal the university accepted its first full-time science students in the autumn of 1972. Education in the Faroe Islands was administered by Denmark under the Home Rule Act, until in the late 1990s its administration was transferred to the Faroese government as a matter of local interest.|$|E

40|$|David E VanceThe University of Alabama School of Nursing, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USAAbstract: Many of {{us think}} of nurses as people who provide direct care to us and our loved ones. And that is true. Images of a selfless person such as Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War running from one wounded soldier to another {{providing}} care inspires the imagination of what a <b>nurse</b> <b>is</b> and can be. Based on that image, a <b>nurse</b> <b>is</b> anyone who cares (and from a spiritual or philosophical perspective, that may <b>be</b> true). But <b>nursing</b> as a profession is so much more. <b>nurse</b> <b>is</b> someone with a very selective skill set {{that can only be}} developed and honed by intense training, education, and discipline while being used in a proscribed ethical manner. With such a combination of skills, ethics, and caring, <b>nurses</b> <b>are</b> the backbone of health care settings, tending to the individual needs of the patients; however, many nurses also function outside such traditional settings and perform numerous functions. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> educators and provide data to the public designed to improve health literacy and promote physical and mental wellness. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> computer and organizational specialists who provide hospitals and institutions with the technologies for keeping, maintaining, and analyzing records. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> clergy, psychologists, and philosophers providing a direction and a moral compass in how to are for patients and each other. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> researchers investigating everything from developing medication for Alzheimer&# 39;s disease to improving crop yields to reduce hunger. Finally, <b>nurses</b> <b>are</b> advocates and leaders petitioning for justice and beneficence of all regardless of gender, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, and nationality; and as such, <b>nursing</b> <b>is</b> political and has a global impact. <b>Nursing</b> <b>is</b> global in nature and is facing global, as well as country specific, problems.

5|$|They {{were not}} the first Australians {{to serve on the}} Western Front. An Australian Voluntary Hospital had been formed in England in August 1914 from Australian expatriates. All medical {{practitioners}} in the unit were Australians and although women were not allowed to serve as doctors, Australian <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> accepted. The unit left for France in August 1914 and from October was based at Wimereux, where the 2nd General Hospital joined it in June 1916. In July 1916, the Australian Voluntary Hospital was absorbed into the British Army. Another group of Australians had also arrived in France before I Anzac Corps. In June 1915, the 1st Siege Artillery Brigade was formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Adams Coxen, the Australian Army's Director of Artillery, for service on the Western Front. About half the men in the unit were permanent gunners of the Garrison Artillery. The brigade departed Melbourne for England on 17 July 1915 and landed in France on 27 February 1916. Its 54th Siege Battery was equipped with 8 inch howitzers and its 55th Siege Battery with 9.2 inch howitzers.|$|E
5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E

In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating the wounded in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided the wounded and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where {{it would be easier to}} provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her <b>nurses</b> <b>were</b> accompanying the wounded on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December where she and her nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake.
