5|$|Also cast {{as part of}} Eden Sinclair's {{team were}} Adrian Lester as Sergeant Norton, Chris Robson as Miller, and Leslie Simpson as Carpenter. The names Miller and Carpenter were <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> {{directors}} George Miller and John Carpenter, whose films influenced Marshall's Doomsday. Sean Pertwee and Darren Morfitt portrayed the team's medical scientists, Dr Talbot and Dr Stirling, respectively. MyAnna Buring portrayed Kane's daughter Cally. Emma Cleasby played Eden's mother {{at the start of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|Rocky Balboa gives <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> {{previous}} installments via the casting. The {{most obvious}} is {{the return of}} Stallone, Young, and Burtonthe only actors to portray the same characters in all six installments. Tarver's appearance in the film marks the sixth time an active professional boxer {{has appeared in the}} series. Previously, Joe Frazier (Rocky), Pedro Lovell (Rocky), Roberto Dur√°n (Rocky II), Tommy Morrison (Rocky V), and Michael Williams (Rocky V) have appeared in the series. Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones, Jr. to portray Dixon, but after Jones did not return Stallone's phone calls, he tapped Antonio Tarver to fill the role. Tarver accidentally knocked out Stallone during the filming of one of the segments of the fight.|$|E
5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted {{that it was not}} as good as the opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New Order, and The Specials.|$|E

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
5|$|The {{company that}} {{produced}} Another World, Delphine Software, has since gone into administrative receivership and Another World remains their most recognized game. Paul Cuisset's best-selling 1992 game Flashback, also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi, features similar gameplay and graphics {{and makes a}} few <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> Another World, {{including the use of}} personal force fields in combat, a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene, and an almost exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene. A very similar plot premise was used in 1999's Outcast by Infogrames Entertainment, too from France. The game also had a big influence on several other game designers, especially in Japan. Fumito Ueda cited Another World as an inspiration for his creation of Ico. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series, said {{it was one of the}} five games that influenced him the most. Video game designer Goichi Suda called it his favourite game.|$|E
5|$|Completed scripts {{were sent}} to Studio B for {{pre-production}} and animation using Macromedia Flash Professional 8. Thiessen's production team was also allowed to select key personnel subject to Hasbro's approval; one of those selected was art director Ridd Sorensen. The Studio B team would storyboard the provided scripts, incorporating any direction and sometimes managing to create scenes that the writers had believed impossible to show in animation. The animators would then prepare the key character poses, layout, background art, and other main elements, and send these versions back to the production team in Los Angeles for review by Hasbro and suggestions from the writers. Thiessen credited much of the technical expertise in the show to Wooton, who created Flash programs to optimize the placement and posing of the pony characters and other elements, simplifying and economizing {{on the amount of}} work needed from the other animators. For example, the ponies' manes and tails are generally fixed shapes, animated by bending and stretching them in curves in three dimensions and giving them a sense of movement without the high cost of individual animated hairs. The storyboard artists and animators also need to fill in background characters for otherwise scripted scenes as to populate the world. According to writer Meghan McCarthy, many of the small <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> the fandom, pop culture references, or other easter eggs would be added at this point by the studio. Once the pre-production work was approved and completed, the episode would then be animated. Though Studio B performed the initial animation work, the final steps were passed to Top Draw Animation in the Philippines, an animation studio that Studio B had worked with in the later part of season one and beyond.|$|E

25|$|Although {{marketed as}} a family film, it was notably darker than the creators' {{previous}} material, and incorporated several <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> the new age movement. The animatronics used in the film were considered groundbreaking. The primary concept artist was the fantasy illustrator Brian Froud, famous for his distinctive fairy and dwarf designs. Froud also collaborated with Henson and Oz for their next project, the 1986 film Labyrinth.|$|E
25|$|Enka {{suggests}} a traditional, idealized, or romanticized aspect of Japanese culture and attitudes. Enka singers, predominantly women, usually perform in a kimono or in evening dress. Male enka performers tend to wear formal dress, {{or in some}} performances, traditional Japanese attire. <b>Nods</b> <b>to</b> traditional Japanese music are common in enka. The melodies of enka are fundamentally Western harmonies, and electronic instruments are used, such as synthesizers and electric lead guitar with plenty of distortion, but its musical instruments also include traditional Japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi and the shamisen.|$|E

25|$|Subaru's {{character}} has received positive critical response by publication from manga and anime {{ever since his}} introduction in Tokyo Babylon. Anime News Network listed him as the best anime exorcist based on the cases he deals with across the series. Mike Dungan from Mania Entertainment noted that Subaru's relationship with Seishiro carried <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> Clamp's doujinshi fan-base. While reviewing the Tokyo Babylon OVAs, Chris Beveridge from the same site found Subaru's portrayal interesting and recommended it to X fans to explore the character more. On the other hand, Stig Hogset from THEM Anime Reviews criticized Subaru for being unfitting for his job due to his quiet personality.|$|E
25|$|The 1662 Book of Common Prayer did {{not specify}} a {{particular}} rite to be observed on Good Friday but local custom came to mandate an assortment of services, including the Seven Last Words from the Cross and a three-hour service consisting of Matins, Ante-communion (using the Reserved Sacrament in high church parishes) and Evensong. In recent times, revised editions of the Prayer Book and Common Worship have re-introduced pre-Reformation forms of observance of Good Friday corresponding to those in today's Roman Catholic Church, with special <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> the rites that had been observed in the Church of England prior to the Henrican, Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms, including Creeping to the Cross.|$|E
25|$|The Time Ships, by Stephen Baxter, first {{published}} in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original's publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller's desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted {{by the fact that}} he has changed history (by telling his tale to his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the multiverse as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind's far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> the prehistory of Wells's story in the names of characters and chapters.|$|E

25|$|While {{the feature}} film {{made use of}} new sets and props, Dwyer reused {{previous}} Star Trek props or made new ones out of premade materials where possible rather than {{spend more money on}} entirely new items: a chair used to torture LaForge was created using a birthing chair, nosehair clippers and flashlights for accents; packing materials formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran's missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements. The Amargosa stellar observatory set was filled with reused props from The Next Generation, with others added in deliberate <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> past episodes. In addition to sets used on The Next Generation, other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for , and ribbed plastic walls in the Jefferies tubes were repurposed from the sets of The Hunt for Red October. Other set pieces and props were original; these included paintings of Picard's ancestors and a cowboy for the locations in the Nexus.|$|E
500|$|K-9's only {{appearances}} in the show's first two series were a cameo in the special and an appearance in the last episode of the first series. This {{was due to the}} concurrent development of the independently produced children's series, K-9, which features a remodelled version of K-9 with only indirect <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> Doctor Who.s Sarah Jane Gets Own Show ...|$|E
500|$|A special Sniper Wolf {{character}} card {{appears in}} the non-canon spin-off game Metal Gear Acid 2 (2005). Some other developers have also given homage type <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> the character, such as with an item [...] "MGS Sniper Wulf Mk. II" [...] in EA Montreal's Army of Two (2008) and a weapon [...] "MG-S1 Sniper Wolfe" [...] in the PlayStation 3 version of Visceral Games' The Godfather II (2009).|$|E
50|$|Other teams {{still exist}} in the area {{including}} the Tampa Yankees and Dunedin Blue Jays (named after their MLB affiliates), the Clearwater Threshers (after the thresher shark), the Bradenton Marauders (a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> their MLB affiliate, the Pittsburgh Pirates), and the Lakeland Flying Tigers, who similarly named as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> their MLB affiliate, the Detroit Tigers.|$|R
5000|$|As for the band's name, Tuchscherer said in 2010: [...] "It‚Äôs a {{reference}} to The Byrds. Their Sweetheart of the Rodeo is the definitive country rock album, and they obviously spelt their name with a ‚ÄòY‚Äô. So essentially it‚Äôs a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> them. However, in a 2008 interview the band said {{it was also a}} <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> The Yardbirds.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to in publications as BMF, as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> Backus-Naur form. Facetiously it is {{also referred to as}} Squiggol, as a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> ALGOL, which was also in the remit of WG 2.1, and because of the [...] "squiggly" [...] symbols it uses. A less-used variant name, but actually the first one suggested, is SQUIGOL.|$|R
500|$|The album {{received}} a 3 out of 5 review from Allmusic, who described the album as having [...] "a slightly different spin, mixing indie {{with the more}} expected punk, emo, and metal". Mike Diver at the BBC wrote an unfavorable review of the album, stating that [...] "This assortment of acts says nothing of its parent film, beyond the occasional reference to school days and <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> something nasty coming this way".|$|E
500|$|Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} the word DJ in [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] does not signify a real DJ but another figure. He {{compared}} [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] to [...] "The Static Age", a song on Green Day's album 21st Century Breakdown (2009), which was [...] "a foaming-at-the-mouth guitar rant that everyone‚Äîpundits, politicians, celebrities‚Äîshould stop babbling and shut up". He added, [...] " [...] drops some cursory <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> war and religion in the opening bars, but soon brings the imagery of waterboarding and torture straight into the dance club".|$|E
500|$|Faust and the {{production}} team have acknowledged some of the fandom and fan-created elements of the show and incorporated them into the animation. Though Hasbro's priority is to deliver a child-friendly show, the writers and production staff, according to Linda Steiner, {{senior vice president of}} Hasbro Studios, [...] "We will certainly, for fun, do the 'bronie' check to see if this could pass with them, but our job is to deliver to the kids first." [...] Margaret Loesch, {{president and chief executive of}} Hub Network, said that they have kept their <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> the fandom to subtle hints. She added, [...] "We haven't driven this movement, the fans have, and we don't want to get ahead of that. We want to nourish this phenomenon, not manipulate it." [...] A writer for the show, Meghan McCarthy, said, [...] "Some pop culture-y things are thrown in, but we don't want to do anything that's too 'wink wink'. It detracts from the story that we're trying to tell". Many of the <b>nods</b> <b>to</b> the older audience are drawn in by the storyboard artists and animators, who are challenged to populate scripted scenes with background ponies; McCarthy points the example of ponies fashioned after the main characters from The Big Lebowski due to having to fill in space for scenes set in a bowling alley for the episode [...] "The Cutie Pox".|$|E
