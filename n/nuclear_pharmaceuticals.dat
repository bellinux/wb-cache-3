When one reactant diffuses through the interface, the coupling between the chemical reaction and buoyancy-driven flows gives rise to complex spatio-temporal fingering near the interface.

This control process gives a bright example of cooperative phenomena between chemistry and hydrodynamics and offers promising technological applications.

40|$|The precautionary {{principle}} has been highly influential in legal systems {{all over the}} world. In its strongest and most distinctive forms, the principle imposes a burden of proof on those who create potential risks, and it requires regulation of activities even if it cannot be shown that those activities are likely to produce significant harms. Taken in this strong form, the {{precautionary principle}} should be rejected, not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all. The principle is literally paralyzing-forbidding inaction, stringent regulation, and everything in between. The reason {{is that in the}} relevant cases, every step, including inaction, creates a risk to health, the environment, or both. This point raises a further puzzle: Why is the precautionary principle widely seen to offer real guidance? The answer lies in identifiable cognitive mechanisms emphasized by behavioral economists. In many cases, loss aversion plays a large role, accompanied by a false belief that nature is benign. Sometimes the availability heuristic is at work. Probability neglect plays a role as well. Most often, those who use the precautionary principle fall victim to what might be called 2 ̆ 2 system neglect, 2 ̆ 2 which involves a failure to attend to the systemic effects of regulation. Examples are given from numerous areas, involving arsenic regulation, global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, <b>nuclear</b> power, <b>pharmaceutical</b> regulation, cloning, pesticide regulation, and genetic modification offood.

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the environmental effects associated with activities undertaken and {{influenced by the}} health care service sector. It is {{one part of a}} larger study to better understand the environmental effects of service sector activities and the implications for management strategies. Considerable analysis has documented the service sector's contribution to domestic economic conditions, yet little analysis has been performed on the broad impacts service firms have on environmental quality. For this study the authors developed a framework to examine the nature of service sector industries' influence on environmental quality. Three primary types of influence were identified: direct impacts, upstream impacts, and downstream impacts. In addition, indirect impacts induced by service sector activities include their influence over settlement patterns and indirect influences over other sectors of the economy. In their initial analysis, the authors noted that many functions performed in the service sector also are commonly found in other sectors. The impacts of these activities have been analyzed separately from those unique to the health care sector, as they present different challenges. Health care {{is one of the largest}} U. S. industries, employing one in nine workers and costing one in seven dollars generated in the economy. Functions performed in the industry that are common in other sectors include: transportation; laundry; food services; facility cleaning; heating and cooling; and photographic processing. Activities unique to the health care industry include: infectious waste generation and disposal; medical waste incineration; equipment sterilization; dental fillings; ritual mercury usage; x-ray diagnosis; <b>nuclear</b> medicine; <b>pharmaceutical</b> usage and disposal; and drinking water fluoridation. The industry has considerable leverage upstream on its suppliers, which is important to managing risks from the use of goods commonly used in the industry, including: mercury-containing products, polyvinyl chloride plastics, latex gloves, and syringe needles. The authors identified a number of areas for potential environmental management initiatives: controlling emissions from on-site "production" type functions; mercury use; the environmental consequences of infection control measures; pollution prevention through substitution of alternative health care services; and research and data collection. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mixing of}} complex fluids in stirred {{reactors}} is widly {{used in many}} industries. Mechanically agitated vessels are widely used in these industries such as wastewater treatment, <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>nuclear</b> and food processing. Complex fluids are frequently encountered in these industries. There is growing interest in developing and studying these fluids, especially for those of shear thickening (ST) behaviour, due {{to the importance of}} their industrial applications such as flexible body armor and force damping applications which can protect a person from danger or risk and ultimately saveone’s life. Little work has been done to understand how to mix complex fluids effectively, mainly because of their opaque nature.

The flow field in an opaque ST fluid was determined experimentally using the positron emission particle tracking (PEPT). In addition, the performance of axial, radial and mixed flow impellers in mixing complex fluids have been also studied using different experimental techniques and the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Moreover, for the first time, PEPT has been used to investigate the flow field of floating particles in a stirred vessel.

India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars but had limited success. Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying nuclear weapons and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, Chandrayaan I (Sanskrit चंद्रयान-1), which literally means [...] "Moon Craft," [...] is an unmanned lunar mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; Chang'e I, China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe.

30|$|The {{membrane}} segregation {{processes are}} extensively employed {{for the water}} treatment in various industries such as chemical, food, <b>nuclear,</b> and <b>pharmaceutical</b> productions. The membrane processes offer an attractive alternate to the traditional systems for the ultra pure water production, desalination, pathogen exclusion from water, and solid–liquid isolation in water treatment. The membrane technology is an attractive method in water purification industries (Arockiasamy et al. 2013). The membrane separation process has high functional stability and is easy to control and integrate in larger industrial practices (Kumar et al. 2013). The important types of membrane processes presently employed are ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO). Generally, the RO technique is based on salt ion repellent capacity of thick membrane, so, allowing {{the flow of water}} molecules (Greenlee et al. 2009). The process is usually controlled through solution-diffusion with a sufficiently large external pressure to overcome the salt water osmotic pressure (Evuti and Lawal 2011). On the other hand, UF membranes permit the separation of intermediate molecular weight pollutants and certain heavy metals. The effectiveness of both the membrane processes depends on their design and properties (Yuan and Zydney 2000). Among them, NF technique is known for smaller pore size of membrane and optimal purification efficacy (Dalwani et al. 2010). At present, there are two extensively used categories of membranes for water detoxification, i.e., polymeric membranes (polysulfone, polyamide, polyfurane, etc.), and ceramic/inorganic composite (Bowen et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2001). The polymeric membranes are of primary significance due to their flexibility and low costs. However, these membranes experience the lack of thermal and chemical stability. In this regard, the hybrid polymeric membranes are well established in desalination due to straightforward module design, improved selectivity, and permeability (Bowen and Mohammad 1998; Bowen and Welfoot 2002). The desalination operates through various transference mechanisms depending mostly on the membrane pore sizes. The hybrid membranes are quite robust to process conditions such as long-term stability at elevated temperature under hydrothermal conditions, continuous operation over prolonged time periods without any decline of selectivity, and acid stability of the material. Therefore, the beneficial use of hybrid polymer/inorganic materials has been exploited in membrane technology (Gevers et al. 2005). In this area, various inorganic fillers such as titania (Ebert et al. 2004), silica (Sadeghi et al. 2008), and carbon molecular sieves (Vu et al. 2003) were employed to fabricate hybrid thin films. For the removal of pollutants from ground water, hybrid nanofiltration seems to be a suitable method capable of removing hardness, sulfates, chlorides, and bacteria.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas‐solid {{reactors}} used {{to achieve}} {{a wide range of}} materials processing. They are used in operations such as mixing, heating, cooling, or reacting of coarse, free‐flowing or cohesive solids in the chemical, cement, <b>pharmaceutical,</b> <b>nuclear,</b> food, or waste process industries for example. They mainly consist of a cylindrical shell usually inclined, into which the solid charge is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. They can be fitted with lifters, and/or dam(s) at the kiln end(s). They are classified into two main heating modes: either direct heated or indirect heated, depending on the heating source location with respect to the solids. They are convenient reactors with intensive heat and mass transfer, capable of handling large amount of materials. Heat transfer in rotary kilns is very complex and may involve the exchange of energy via all the fundamental physical transfer mechanisms, i. e., conduction, convection, and radiation. In particular, despite several studies on this field, the heat transfer between the wall and the particles is not yet fully understood, especially for flighted rotary kilns. Therefore, this study aimed at experimentally investigating the wall‐to‐solids heat transfer coefficient (whtc). An indirect heated, continuously fed pilot scale rotary kiln, that could be equipped with lifters (one‐section or two‐section) and fitted with a dam at the outlet end was used. For the longitudinal evaluation of inner (bulk bed, freeboard) and external (wall) temperatures, the equipment includes thermocouples positioned in‐and outside along the kiln tube at five sections. The solid material used was quartz sand with a narrow distributed size fraction around 0. 5 mm. The whtc was determined from the heating of the bulk bed using the measure of heat supply for low and medium temperatures (100 °C, 300 °C and 500 °C). The effects of operational parameters such as the filling degree, the rotational speed, the lifter profile and the temperature set at the wall on the heat transfer coefficient were analyzed in this study. Certain strategies and some assumptions were made on few parameters; a sensitivity analysis examines their effects on the whtc. The wall‐to‐solids heat transfer coefficient was lower in presence of lifters, and lowest for the two‐section lifters compared with the case without lifters. The whtc was also found to increase with the filling degree and the temperature set at the wall. The whtc was also influenced by the rotational speed when keeping a constant filling degree...|$|R
