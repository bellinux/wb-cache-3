25|$|What {{disturbs}} Delano are incidents {{he observes}} among the hatchet polishers, oakum pickers, {{such as when}} a black boy stabs a white one. Apparently Cereno does not care about this behavior, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> Atufal, a regal-looking slave appears in chains but still refusing to humble himself. The whispering between Cereno and Babo makes Delano feel uncomfortable. Gradually his suspicions increase, as he notes Cereno's sudden waves of dizziness and anxiety, the crew's awkward movements and whisperings, and the unusual interaction of the slaves and the whites. Yet Delano answers Cereno’s questions about the crew, cargo, and arms aboard the Bachelor’s Delight without reserve, reasoning that the innocent are protected by the truth. When The Rover arrives with the supplies, Delano sends her back for more water while he continues to observe curious incidents.|$|E
25|$|At art {{exhibitions}} {{the visitor}} usually {{is not allowed}} to touch the displayed objects, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> they clearly have a functional background like an artistic chair or jewellery. Therefore, Noten used a funfair machine he called Mr Claw to offer visitors the opportunity to actually touch works of art. Mr Claw contains plastic bubbles with small pieces of jewellery inside the visitor can attempt to grab by using the machine's remote-controlled grabber. As a special attraction Noten put a 1kg silver bar inside as well (unfortunately this item is too heavy to be lifted by the grabber). Mr Claw was used at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit exhibition on contemporary jewellery in 2004, and at the Icon Experiment 2008 exhibition in London, UK.|$|E
25|$|At Guildford, Surrey {{opted to}} bat first against league-leaders Kent, and despite losing Richard Clinton for a ten-ball duck early on, {{the first day}} belonged to Surrey. Three batsmen passed 90 - Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash and Ali Brown, who top-scored with 107 having been 101 not out {{overnight}} - as Surrey eased their way to 452 for 8 declared, never really bothered {{by any of the}} Kent bowlers. Kent were not daunted by Surrey's high score, however, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> Robert Key and Darren Stevens departed in quick succession to see Kent to 202 for 4, but Matthew Walker and Justin Kemp added 233 for the fifth wicket, both making centuries. Kemp was eventually bowled by Azhar Mahmood for 124, but Walker went on to make 173 as Kent racked up 572, a lead of 120.|$|E

500|$|The {{dopamine}} system plays {{a crucial}} role in several aspects of addiction. [...] At the earliest stage, genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain can predict whether a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive. [...] Consumption of stimulants produces increases in brain dopamine levels that last from minutes to hours. [...] Finally, the chronic elevation in dopamine that comes with repetitive high-dose stimulant consumption triggers a wide-ranging set of structural changes in the brain that are responsible for the behavioral abnormalities which characterize an addiction. Treatment of stimulant addiction is very difficult, because even if consumption ceases, the craving that comes with psychological withdrawal does <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> the craving seems to be extinct, it may re-emerge when faced with stimuli that are associated with the drug, such as friends, locations and situations. Association networks in the brain are greatly interlinked.|$|E
500|$|The Berlin Wall, {{like the}} much longer inner German border between East and West Germany, was {{designed}} with two purposes in mind: to obstruct would-be border-crossers and to enable border guards {{to detect and}} stop illegal border crossings. In its final form, the [...] wall consisted of inner and outer concrete walls separated by a [...] "death strip" [...] some [...] to [...] wide. [...] It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches. [...] The shooting orders, or Schießbefehl, issued to the border guards instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals, and {{that the use of}} deadly force was required to deal with them: [...] "Do not hesitate to use your firearm, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used". [...] Some guards have since claimed that the motto at the time was [...] "a dead refugee is better than an escaped one". At first, wounded or shot refugees were left out in the open until they were removed, so that people from West Berlin and the western press could see them as well. After the reactions to the public death of Peter Fechter, border guards were ordered to move any casualties out of West Berlin's field of view. Negative reporting was sought to be prevented. Because of this, border guards often pulled people down into the car-moat {{that was part of the}} whole border security system. In some cases, the removal of the body was done only after nightfall.|$|E

2500|$|But Shea {{was not an}} {{advocate}} of sympathy strikes, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> they meant one unit of Teamsters would be supporting another unit of Teamsters. In November 1903, Teamsters employed by the Chicago City Railway went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other Teamster locals in the city but failed. However, three Teamster locals in the city—the truck, ice wagon, and coal wagon drivers, which together represented about half the Teamster membership in Chicago—refused to violate their contracts and walk off the job. The three locals went even further, and disaffiliated from the Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago. Furious, Shea called them [...] "cowards and traitors". [...] His outburst only angered his opponents in the union. In mid-December, Shea was confronted in his office by Teamster leader who shot at him four times and forced him to dance a jig before fleeing.|$|E

Mandela never knelt in his fight against Apartheid, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> he was deprived of freedom for 27 years. The long years of suffering neither weakened Mandela, nor killed his spirit. On the contrary, they filled him with the desire for reconciliation and understanding among people. He and his dream triumphed. His vision and kindness saved the South African people from suffering and hardships. Nelson Mandela with his unstoppable run towards freedom left to humanity a heritage of immense and eternal value, the model of transformation of an epoch and of a life of goodness and wisdom. In my name and on behalf of the Albanian people I would like to extend our deep condolences to his spouse, Graça Machel, to his entire family and to the people of South Africa. We, Albanians join the South African people and whole world in this grief." [...] (spelling and grammar corrected) ...|$|E
2500|$|García Moreno {{came to the}} {{presidency}} of a country with an empty treasury and an enormous debt. To overcome this, he placed the government on stringent economy and abolished many positions, as well as cutting out the corruption which siphoned off tax money. As a result, {{he was able to}} provide Ecuadoreans with more for less. [...] This improved the financial status of the country and attracted foreign investment. The army was reformed, with officers being sent to Prussia to study, and illiterate recruits taught basic skills. Houses of prostitution were closed, and hospitals opened in all the major towns. Railroads and national highways were built, the telegraph extended, and the postal and water systems improved. City streets were paved and local bandits suppressed. These public works projects were accomplished in part through the use of revenues obtained from the trabajo subsidario tax, a tax initially created to aid the funding of local works projects. The trabajo subsidario tax in many ways mirrored the colonial mita labor requirements demanded of Indians by Spaniards. [...] The voluntary contributions law and trabajo subsidario tax, revived in 1854, required that every citizen contribute four days of unpaid work to the state yearly or its monetary equivalent to promote the nation's public works projects. Like its mita precursor, the trabajo subsidario obligation fell most heavily on Ecuador's indigenous populations since these groups were unable to pay to avoid labor. [...] Estate-bound peons were able to find protection from these laws through the help of hacendado or essential paternal landlords. [...] In 1862, in a somewhat contentious move, García Moreno demanded control of these revenues of this tax in order to direct funds towards his ambitions for major infrastructural reform. This created a great deal of local discontent, as this meant diverting funds from more locally based public works projects. [...] Using these funds, García Moreno began his famous highway system project, contracting workers from the trabajo subsidario requirement to build these roads. [...] Although the ultimate results of the project are often praised, García Moreno has been criticized for his use of [...] "forced" [...] labor to build these highways and the overall discriminatory and abusive treatment of indigenous workers during the process of construction. [...] In his chronicle, Four years among the Ecuadorians, Friedrich Hassaurek describes witnessing the building of the road from Quito to Guayaquil. [...] He describes the [...] "lamentable sight" [...] of Indians laboring to build the roads without sufficient tools. [...] Hassurek writes, [...] " [...] does not work voluntarily, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> paid for his labor, but is pressed into the service of the government for a length of time, at the expiration of which he is discharged and another forced into his place. [...] He works unwillingly, is kept to his task by the whip of the overseer. [...] It is evident that but little progress could be made under these circumstances." [...] Along with a variety of notable public works programs, García Moreno reformed the universities, established two polytechnic and agricultural colleges and a military school, and increased the number of primary schools from 200 to 500. The number of primary students grew from 8000 to 32,000. To staff the enormously expanded health-care and educational facilities, foreign religious were brought in. All of this was done while expanding the franchise and guaranteeing equal rights under the law to every Ecuadorean.|$|E
