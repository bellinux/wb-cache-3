25|$|In Ireland, bachelor's degrees are {{commonly}} {{three to four}} years in duration; master's and doctoral degrees are basically similar to those in the UK. Bachelor's degrees are first-cycle qualifications. Except for the MA at the University of Dublin, a master's degree is always a postgraduate degree (teaching or research). The generic outcomes for Irish degrees are laid out in the 2003 <b>National</b> <b>Framework</b> of Qualifications. In 2006, Ireland was the first country to verify the compatibility of its <b>national</b> <b>framework</b> with that of the EHEA.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} state funded further {{education}} colleges exist - which offer vocational {{education and training}} {{in a range of}} areas from business studies, I.C.T to sports injury therapy. These courses are usually 1, 2 or less often 3 three years in duration and are validated by FETAC at levels 5 or 6 or for the BTEC Higher National Diploma award - validated by Edexcel which is a level 6/7 qualification. There are numerous private colleges (particularly in Dublin and Limerick) which offer both further and higher education qualifications. These degrees and diplomas are often certified by foreign universities/international awarding bodies and are aligned to the <b>National</b> <b>Framework</b> of Qualifications at level 6, 7 and 8.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, the {{educational}} standard {{is a graduate}} degree in nursing. The Canadian Nursing Association (CNA) notes that advanced practice nurses must have {{a combination of a}} graduate level education and the clinical experience that prepare them to practice at an advanced level. Their education alone does not give them the ability to practice at an advanced level. Two national frameworks have been developed in order to provide further guidance for the development of educational courses and requirements, research concepts, and government position statements regarding APRNs: The CNA's Advanced Nursing Practice: A <b>National</b> <b>Framework</b> and the Canadian Nurse Practitioner Core Competency Framework. All educational programs for NPs must achieve formal approval by provincial and territorial regulating nurse agencies {{due to the fact that}} the NP is considered a legislated role in Canada. As such, it is common to see differences among approved educational programs between territories and provinces. Specifically, inconsistencies can be found in core graduate courses, clinical experiences, and length of programs. Canada does not have a national curriculum or consistent standards regarding advanced practice nurses so all APRNs must meet individual requirements set by the provincial or territorial regulatory nursing body where they are practicing. In conclusion, the completion of a graduate education, a passing of an exam through the CNA Nurse Practitioner Exam Program, and a successful registration within the appropriate territory or province is required in order to practice as a nurse practitioner in Canada.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) {{was one of}} {{the first}} laws ever written that {{established}} a broad <b>national</b> <b>framework</b> for protecting our environment.

[...] A project is federally controlled when it requires federal licensing, federal funding, or is undertaken by the federal government. [...] When such a project is determined to have significant effects on the human environment, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required. An EIS for a proposed project outlines in detail the proposed actions, alternative actions (including no action), and their probable environmental ramifications. The environmental impact statements must cover plausible bases, which are generally determined by the rule of reason.|$|E
