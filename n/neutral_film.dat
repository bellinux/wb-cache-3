40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} contextual memory under different emotional stimuli. Participants {{were asked to}} watch films on mute. These films were pre-categorized as different emotions(happy, neutral, arousing, negative, and sexual). At the same time, they were presented with neutral words on an mp 3 player auditorily. In the end, {{they were asked to}} recall as many words as possible. The words recalled were then matched with the scenes it belonged to and calculated for statistical significance. An ANOVA revealed statistical significance across films, most significantly when comparing negative to <b>neutral</b> <b>films,</b> and negative to sexual films.

50|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} on emotional memory is {{on the role of the}} amygdala. In one study participants watched either an emotionally arousing film or a <b>neutral</b> <b>film.</b> Results of a PET scan showed correlation between right Amygdaloid Complex (AC) activity and recall for emotional elements of the film when participants were asked to remember the film a few weeks later. Although this study demonstrates the involvement of the AC, it offers no insight as to the specific role of the amygdala. McGaugh and colleagues posit that although electrical and pharmaceutical stimulation directly to the amygdala can enhance or decrease memory, the amygdala is not the main site for any long-term memory storage. Rather, the amygdala acts as a modulator for storage processes occurring in other areas of the brain. Long-term memories are not created automatically, they must be consolidated over time. Research indicates that it is this consolidation process in which the AC plays an assisting role (there is no evidence that it aids in retrieval). Specifically, McGaugh suggests that emotional arousal activates the amygdala, which regulates the strength of a memory, lending to enhanced memory for emotionally charged events.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{modulation}} of spinal tendinous (T) reflexes {{by sexual}} stimulation was investigated. T reflexes are augmented in states of appetitive and defensive action and modified by differences in arousal intensity. Reflexes {{were expected to}} be facilitated by both pleasant (sexual) and unpleasant (anxiety) stimuli. Subjects were exposed to a sexual, an anxiety-inducing, a sexually threatening, and a <b>neutral</b> <b>film</b> excerpt. Genital arousal, emotional experience, subjective action tendencies, and T reflexes were monitored. Self-report and genital data confirmed the affective states as intended. T reflex amplitude significantly increased during viewing of emotionally arousing film excerpts as compared with a <b>neutral</b> <b>film</b> excerpt. T reflexes were facilitated by the sex stimulus to the same extent as by the anxiety and sexual threat stimuli. The results support the view of sexual arousal as an emotional state, generating sex-specific autonomic and general somatic motor system responses, which prepare the organism for actio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Unexplained {{neurological}} symptoms ("somatoform dissociation") {{are common}} in health care settings and associated with disproportionately high levels of distress, disability, and resource utilization. Theory suggests that somatoform dissociation is associated with disturbed attentional processing, {{but there is a}} paucity of research in this area and the available evidence is contradictory. METHODS: We compared undergraduate participants (n= 124) with high and low scores on the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ- 20) on a tactile cueing paradigm measuring the time course of attention to touch, following either a <b>neutral</b> <b>film</b> or a film designed to simulate the emotional effects of trauma exposure. RESULTS: Following the <b>neutral</b> <b>film,</b> high SDQ- 20 participants exhibited delayed disengagement from tactile cue stimuli compared to the low SDQ- 20 group. Following the "trauma" film, however, the high SDQ- 20 group showed attentional effects suggesting avoidance of the tactile stimuli in this condition. Early attention to tactile cues following the trauma film predicted film-related intrusive thoughts after the experiment. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that both body vigilance and body avoidance may be involved in the expression of somatoform dissociation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Lavender odour is {{commonly}} used to alleviate mild anxiety. Double blind studies are difficult to conduct with odours, and there are few reliable investigations of lavender's efficacy. Method: Orally administered lavender capsules (placebo, 100, 200 [*]µl) were tested in a randomised between-subjects (n[*] =[*] 97) double-blind study. Film clips were used to elicit anxiety. Measures included anxiety, State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), mood, positive and negative affect scale (PANAS), heart rate (HR), galvanic skin response (GSR), and heart rate variation (HRV). Following baseline measurements capsules were administered. Participants viewed a <b>neutral</b> <b>film</b> clip, then an anxiety-provoking and light-hearted recovery film clip. Results: For the 200 [*]µl lavender dose during the <b>neutral</b> <b>film</b> clip there was a trend towards reduced state anxiety, GSR and HR and increased HRV. In the anxiety-eliciting film, lavender was mildly beneficial in females but only on HRV measures. In males sympathetic arousal increased during the anxiety film (GSR). HRV significantly increased at 200 [*]µl during all three film clips in females, suggesting decreased anxiety. Conclusion: These findings suggest that lavender has anxiolytic effects in humans under conditions of low anxiety, but these effects may not extend to conditions of high anxiety...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{excitement}} {{can be seen}} as {{an action}} disposition. In this study sexual arousal was expected to generate sexual action and to increase interest and responsiveness to sexual stimuli. In two experiments, male and female participants were exposed to a neutral or a sexual film. We measured genital and subjective responses to the film, and sexual behavior following the laboratory visit. In Experiment 2, film exposure was followed by a task in which participants rated the sexual arousability of neutral and sexual pictures. Rating time of the sexual pictures served as an index for sexual interest. Responsiveness to the sexual pictures was measured by modulation of spinal tendinous (T) reflexes. Sexual activity, but not sexual desire, was higher for participants in the sexual film condition than for participants in the neutral condition. Sexual interest and responsiveness to still pictures were not higher for participants in the sexual film condition than for those in the <b>neutral</b> <b>film</b> condition. In addition, men who saw the <b>neutral</b> <b>film</b> showed a greater responsiveness to still pictures than men who saw the sexual film.

40|$|According to {{the dual}} {{representation}} theory of PTSD, intrusive trauma images and intrusive verbal thoughts {{are produced by}} separate memory systems. In a previous article it was shown that after watching an aversive film, participants in non-movement conditions reported more intrusive images than participants in a free-to-move control condition (Hagenaars, Van Minnen, Holmes, Brewin, & Hoogduin, 2008). The present study investigates whether the experimental conditions of the Hagenaars et al. study had a different effect on intrusive thoughts than on intrusive images. Experiment 2 further investigated the image-thoughts distinction by manipulating stimulus valence (trauma film versus <b>neutral</b> <b>film)</b> and assessing the subsequent development of intrusive images and thoughts. In addition, both experiments studied the impact of peri-traumatic emotions on subsequent intrusive images and thoughts frequency across conditions. Results showed that experimental manipulations (non-movement and trauma film) caused higher levels of intrusive images relative to control conditions (free movement and <b>neutral</b> <b>film)</b> {{but they did not}} affect intrusive thoughts. Peri-traumatic anxiety and horror were associated with subsequent higher levels of intrusive images, but not intrusive thoughts. Correlations were inconclusive for anger and sadness. The results suggest intrusive images and thoughts can be manipulated independently and as such can be considered different phenomena...|$|E

The current study examined whether individuals with remitted bipolar I disorder (n 23) and healthy controls (n 23) differ {{in their ability to}} use one effective and common form of emotion regulation, cognitive reappraisal. Positive, negative, and <b>neutral</b> <b>films</b> were used to elicit emotion, and participants were cued to watch the film carefully (i. e., uninstructed condition) or reappraise while measures of affect, behavior, and psychophysiology were obtained. Results showed that reappraisal was associated with reductions in emotion reactivity across subjective (i. e., positive and negative affect), behavioral (i. e., positive facial displays), and physiological (i. e., skin conductance) response domains across all participants. Results suggest that reappraisal may be an effective regulation strategy for both negative and positive emotion across both healthy adults and individuals with bipolar disorder.

40|$|Eran Eldar and Ori Ganor contributed {{equally to}} this work. Emotions are often object related—they are about someone or {{something}} in the world. It is yet an open question whether emotions and the associated perceptual contents that they refer to are processed by {{different parts of the}} brain or whether the brain regions that mediate emotions are also involved in the processing of the associated content they refer to. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that simply combining music (rich in emotion but poor in information about the concrete world) with <b>neutral</b> <b>films</b> (poor in emotionality but rich in real-world details) yields increased activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and lateral prefrontal regions. In contrast, emotional music on its own did not elicit a differential response in these regions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} under experimental conditions whether the self-concepts of adolescents could be improved through the use of assertiveness training in the classroom. Additionally, shifting of locus of control from external to internal was measured. Pioneering aspects of the present study included the use of assertiveness training as an independent variable and the presentation of a brief treatment paradigm within a normal educational setting. The twenty-eight subjects were all sophomore and junior students at the General H. H. Arnold High School. The study was conducted during the spring of 1978. An intact group, pre-test post-test design was used. The students in one classroom were used as an experimental group and the students in the other classroom were used as a control group. The two groups were demographically equivalent. Subjects in the experimental condition participated in six assertiveness training sessions over a three-week period. The assertiveness training included exercises intended to produce increased levels of insight, training in both verbal and nonverbal behavioral components of assertion, United States Military Community, Wiesbaden, West Germany and role playing in which both oppositional and commendatory assertive behaviors were practiced. Additionally, experimental subjects received training in coping with possible adverse consequences of their assertive behavior. Experimental subjects also received education in the occasional appropriateness of not asserting one's self, as well as instruction in correcting one's own errors. The appropriate receiving of assertive responses from others was also discussed and demonstrated. Subjects in the control condition viewed <b>neutral</b> <b>films</b> during the same time period as the experimental group. Both groups of subjects were debriefed by the experimenter at the end of treatment. The measures used for each subject were the Total Positive score of the Tennessee Self Concept Scale and the Rotter Internal-External Scale, which was scored in the direction of externality. Both instruments were administered as pre-test and post-test measures. The effects of the treatment were analyzed through the use of multivariate and unvaried analyses of covariance with pre-test scores serving as covariates. The two hypotheses of differences between mean treatment group scores on the Total Positive score of the Tennessee Self Concept Scale and the Rotter Internal-External Scale were first tested simultaneously using a multivariate analysis of covariance. The null hypothesis stated that there would be no difference between the treatment and control group vectors of means based on the Total Positive score of the Tennessee Self Concept Scale and the Rotter InternalExternal Scale. The multivariate F value was computed as. 1770 (p <. 8390). Therefore, the null hypothesis was not rejected. Subsequent computation of univariate F values also yielded statistically nonsignificant results. Under the constraints of the present study, the following conclusions were made: (1) Assertiveness training did not produce more positive self concept than did the <b>neutral</b> <b>films</b> in the control condition. (2) Assertiveness training did not produce less externality of locus of control than did the <b>neutral</b> <b>films</b> in the control condition. Implications of these findings suggest short-term assertiveness training is ineffective for modifying self-concept and locus of control, at least within the adolescent population sampled. Future research of a similar nature should therefore focus on: (1) isolating the minimal effective treatment time, (2) additional control variables such as the measurement of effectiveness of the assertiveness training methodologies with adolescent populations, (3) comparisons between the experience levels of the subjects used, and (4) the use of assertiveness training as a technique integrated into a psychotherapeutic modality rather than as a separate and distinct methodology.

40|$|AbstractIn {{everyday}} life, {{the experience}} of an emotional state changes our perception of time. When we are sad and depressed, we feel that time passes more slowly. Every hour seems like an eternity. However, the feeling of fear seems to accelerate time. An hour seems to be nothing. Previous research into emotion and time perception {{has been designed to}} study the time percept of emotional events themselves (e. g., facial expression) using normative stimuli from databases (Coan & Allen, 2007). However, these studies have investigated the timing of emotional events themselves rather than the effect of emotional states (mood). The non-temporal characteristics of the emotional stimuli have been interfering with the processing time. Our aim was to investigate the effect of emotions per se on the subsequent time judgment of a neutral event. We used an induction technique of emotion that had not been used in studies of the perception of time. The participants were presented with films inducing a specific mood and were given two temporal bisection tasks, before and after viewing the film. Three emotional films validated by Schaefer et al. (2011) were used: eliciting fear, sadness, and neutral. In addition, the direct mood experience was assessed using the Brief Mood Introspective Scale (BMIS) that was administered to the participants at {{the beginning and the end}} of the session. Our hypothesis was that after having watched <b>neutral</b> <b>films,</b> the perception of time will not change. In contrast, presentation times will be perceived as longer after watching films of high arousal (fear) and as shorter for low arousal (sadness) clips. The results showed that timing did not change after viewing either the <b>neutral</b> or sad <b>film,</b> even though participants reported being sadder and less aroused after viewing. In contrast, the stimulus durations were judged longer after viewing the frightening films that were judged to increase the emotion of fear and the level of arousal.

Since dream content is influenced by memories or experiences which arouse or involve in a personal way, mass media presentations should influence those dreams. Three studies were conducted to compare the effects of viewing a highly charged, emotionally arousing film and viewing a <b>neutral,</b> pleasant <b>film.</b> All of these studies used natural communication situations, instead of sleep laboratories as in previous studies in dream research. Study# 1 attempted to obtain dream reports by phoning subjects the morning after viewing a film. This study was unsuccessful due to faulty methodology. Study# 2 obtained dream reports from subjects waiting to see two films at a local theater. Study# 3 obtained dream reports from diaries kept by college students who were randomly exposed to either of two films or no film.
