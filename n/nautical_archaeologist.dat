5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship.

Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by <b>nautical</b> <b>archaeologist</b> Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E

40|$|Throughout the ages, countless shipwrecks {{have left}} behind a rich {{historical}} and technological legacy. In this context, <b>nautical</b> <b>archaeologists</b> study the remains of these boats and ships and the cultures that created and used them. Ship reconstruction {{can be seen as}} an incomplete jigsaw reconstruction problem. Therefore, I hypothesize that a computational approach based on digital libraries can enhance the reconstruction of a composite object (ship) from fragmented, incomplete, and damaged pieces (timbers and ship remains). This dissertation describes a framework for enabling the integration of textual and visual information pertaining to wooden vessels from sources in multiple languages. Linking related pieces of information relies on query expansion and improving relevance. This is accomplished with the implementation of an algorithm that derives relationships from terms in a specialized glossary, combining them with properties and concepts expressed in an ontology. The main archaeological sources used in this dissertation are data generated from a 17 th-century Portuguese ship, the Pepper Wreck, complemented with information obtained from other documented and studied shipwrecks. Shipbuilding treatises spanning from the late 16 th- to the 19 th-centuries provide textual sources along with various illustrations. Additional visual materials come from a repository of photographs and drawings documenting numerous underwater excavations and surveys. The ontology is based on a rich database of archaeological information compiled by Mr. Richard Steffy. The original database was analyzed and transformed into an ontological representation in RDF-OWL. Its creation followed an iterative methodology which included numerous revisions by <b>nautical</b> <b>archaeologists.</b> Although this ontology does not pretend to be a final version, it provides a robust conceptualization. The proposed approach is evaluated by measuring the usefulness of the glossary and the ontology. Evaluation results show improvements in query expansion across languages based on Blind Relevance Feedback using the glossary as query expansion collection. Similarly, contextualization was also improved by using the ontology for categorizing query results. These results suggest that related external sources can be exploited to better contextualize information in a particular domain. Given the characteristics of the materials in nautical archaeology, the framework proposed in this dissertation can be adapted and extended to other domains...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nautical</b> <b>archaeologists</b> and {{scholars}} often try to recreate how ships were built and maneuvered. Due to the delicate nature of older wooden vessels, {{there is often}} little archaeological evidence remaining to aid in these studies, and researchers must supplement what little they have with other resources, such as texts. By using computer programs to synthesize and enhance {{the information in the}} texts, scholars can better understand the vessel and explore questions that even hull remains {{may not be able to}} address. During the High to Late Middle Ages, Venice was a key city for trade and commerce. Its location on the Adriatic Sea connected merchants throughout mainland Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. Since its founding in the low Middle Ages, Venice has been connected to the sea, leading to a long history of seafaring and shipbuilding. By the end of the Middle Ages, Venice had established several trade routes throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and one long sea route into the Atlantic, to Lisbon, Flanders, and London. Although no archaeological evidence of these galleys have been found, several contemporary texts describe the merchant galleys of the 15 th century. Two of these texts, dating to the first half of the 15 th century discuss the dimensions the galley: The book of Michael of Rhodes and the book of Giorgio "Trombetta" da Modone. Perhaps complementary copies of the same original, these texts contain enough information to reconstruct a 3 -dimensional model of the galley of Flanders's hull, in this case using off-the-shelf software ((Rhinoceros). From this computer model the vessel can then be analyzed for volumetric information in order to better understand the hull capacity and how the ship was laden...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish warship Vasa sank in Stockholm harbor after sailing {{less than}} one {{nautical}} mile (1. 85 km) on its maiden voyage in 1628. The hull was raised in 1961, and after a lengthy conservation and reconstruction process, went on display in a state-of-the-art museum in 1990. The hull {{is estimated to be}} 98 % intact, making it the oldest intact wooden ship recovered to date. The recovery and remarkable preservation of the hull presents unparalleled archaeological research opportunities. This dissertation recovers and analyzes the methods of naval architecture used to design the hull of Vasa as evidenced in its intact structure. Digital 3 D solid modeling software is used to virtually deconstruct the hull to facilitate a nuanced understanding of the design principles that guided the construction of the ship Although Vasa was a Swedish warship constructed in Stockholm, it was designed and built by Dutch shipwrights. In the early 17 th century, the Dutch rose to prominence as the premier shipbuilders in Europe. The quality and character of Dutch-built vessels were renowned and Dutch shipwrights were hired to build the merchant fleets and navies throughout Europe. Limited scholarly attention has been given to the methods of naval architecture by which Dutch shipwrights designed their ships. Dutch shipwrights designed and built ships according to orally transmitted principles of design and therefore left little written evidence for their tradition of naval architecture. Vasa presents an unprecedented opportunity to examine the methods used by Dutch shipwrights to design large vessels as they are evident in an intact hull. The results of the analysis contained in this dissertation suggest that Vasa was designed according to proportional and arithmetical methods of naval architecture. The methods are identical or very similar to those described in Nicolaes Witsen?s 1671 treatise on Dutch shipbuilding. While many aspects of Vasa?s hull appear to be derived according to the tradition of naval architecture described by Witsen, certain significant deviations resulted in an atypically narrow hull. The methods of analysis in this dissertation, which highlight digital 3 D visualization, mark an attempt to expand the range of analytic and explanatory tools available to <b>nautical</b> <b>archaeologists</b> in the 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|Pictorial {{graffiti}} representing {{ships from}} prehistory, protohistory {{and the early}} medieval period are frequently examined by <b>nautical</b> historians and <b>archaeologists</b> seeking information about ancient ship technology. Examples of the academic discussion and interpretation of these images may be found from the nineteenth century to the present day, {{in a wide range}} of studies. Many of these works reflect their writers' casual, even disdainful attitudes to ancient graffiti. This may be seen in their approach to the information which these images appear to contain, which may concentrate, for example, on the certain aspects of particular subjects without reference to details in their immediate or wider contexts, which may have a bearing on the images' form and meaning. In a similar vein, other writers have interpreted ancient ship graffiti using concepts of art, such as the assumption of realism of depiction, which may be inappropriate to some early visual imagery. This thesis argues that ancient ship graffiti need a more detailed and systematic interpretation as both art and artefact before their contribution to nautical history may be more reliably evaluated. In order to explore the many challenges which these graffiti offer, a multi-disciplinary approach is used, to consider aspects of the relationship between formal art and graffiti, the psychology of image making, symbolism, the philosophy of interpretation, archaeology, and the social meaning of physical context. Following these theoretical discussions, five case studies from a number of different regional and chronological groups have been chosen to provide some examples of many of the issues which were considered. It is hoped that this study demonstrates that an approach to the interpretation of ancient ship graffiti which avoids a narrow concentration on nautical technology may reveal more of their potential as evidence, not only for the form and use of early ships, but also for other aspects of life in the past...|$|R
