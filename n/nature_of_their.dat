It {{is unlikely that the}} Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E

40|$|Aspect-oriented {{programming}} {{is an extension}} to object-oriented programming. It introduces new constructs called “aspects” for representing crosscutting concerns in a system development.

While working on the modeling of new design techniques for aspect oriented technology, we have come across some unresolved modeling issues and some misconceptions about the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> aspects and <b>their</b> representation in software design.

40|$|A lack of {{dependence}} of the Raman frequency of optical vibrational modes on excitation wavelength in polar nanosemiconductors was observed.

This difference has been ascribed to the different crystallographic <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Raman spectra: crystalline for nonpolar and amorphous for polar nanosemiconductors. The result has been explored theoretically to the Raman spectra being insensitive to sample sizes and thus indicates that the size confinement effect, a basic effect in nanomaterials, does not exhibit in the optical vibrational modes of polar nanosemiconductors.

5|$|After {{leaving his}} former label Flying Dutchman Records, Gil Scott-Heron {{signed with the}} New York City jazz-based Strata-East label in early 1973, {{accompanied}} by jazz keyboardist and songwriter Brian Jackson, {{with whom he had}} worked with on his previous studio albums, Pieces of a Man (1971) and Free Will (1972). While some sources allege this may have been over financial or creative differences, Scott-Heron maintained the switch was due to producer Bob Thiele's unwillingness to give Jackson co-billing. By the time of their move to Strata-East, Scott-Heron and Jackson had achieved underground notice among R and soul music listeners, particularly for the political and social <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> music's themes, as well as Scott-Heron's emphasis on African-American culture and social plight in his compositions. Their musical fusion of jazz, blues, soul and spoken word styles helped them earn some notice among less-mainstream black music listeners at the time.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} supports {{the existence of}} humans in the region since prehistoric times. The region formed {{a part of the}} Kuru and the Panchal kingdoms (mahajanpads) during the Vedic age of Ancient India. Among the first major dynasties of Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism. Ashokan edicts at Kalsi show the early presence of Buddhism in this region. During the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Kumaon Kingdom and Garhwal Kingdom. In 1816, most of modern Uttarakhand was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals, the proximity of different neighboring ethnic groups and the inseparable and complementary <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> geography, economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions which further strengthened during the Uttarakhand movement for statehood in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, Fraser had {{successfully}} passed her medical examinations and become licensed. Two years later, Fraser became a part-time lecturer {{and then in}} 1934 was promoted to full-time lecturer in the department. Around the same time, in 1933, Williams moved to the farm full-time, returning to Toronto only on weekends. In 1937, she was finally accepted into the Ontario Veterinary College and that same year, Fraser's mother died. Williams graduated in 1941 and she began practicing as a veterinarian. For the first time, the two women acquired a home together, living in Toronto. They took in a foster child, Jenny Rodd, a war refugee from England, who remained with them until the war ended. Rising homophobia during the war-years, which carried into the 1950s and 1960s led the couple to hide the intimate <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationship from their ward and present an ambiguous relationship to the greater society, limiting their social life to those who knew them best.|$|E

40|$|Studies on Mycoplasma pulmonis and Mycoplasma neurolyticum mitogenesis {{demonstrated}} that macrophages are not {{essential for the}} interactions of M. neurolyticum with B lymphocytes, whereas M. pulmonis that stimulates B and T lymphocytes depends on macrophages to fully exert its mitogenic effects. Membranes of both species carry the mitogenic as well as pathogenic potentials. However, M. neurolyticum major mitogens are biochemically distinct from those of M. pulmonis. Furthermore, M. pulmonis mitogenesis is directly correlated to the mycoplasmal-induced pathogenic effects, while no such correlation could be established with M. neurolyticum. It was, therefore, concluded that M. pulmonis and M. neurolyticum differ in the biochemical and biological <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mitogens...|$|R

5|$|Dromaeosaurids {{share many}} {{features}} with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationship to birds {{has undergone a}} great deal of study, and hypotheses about that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E

Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body and parts of the house, including the daughters' rooms, with gasoline. While tied to their beds, both daughters had been doused with gasoline; each had her head covered with a pillowcase. A fire was started, and Hayes and Komisarjevsky fled the scene. Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
