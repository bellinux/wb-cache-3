5|$|Donayre's {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{of the army}} was {{controversial}} from the start due to corruption allegations and an international incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular because at that time he was <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> as general {{of any of the}} three major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused of acquiring 50,000 American-made MREs— military rations— to supply troops deployed against Shining Path guerrillas in the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead of acquiring cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Misch was {{transferred}} to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war. When <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause Misch some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether recommendations could be made for colonial troops <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> with British troops was not asked in New Zealand, but in 1881, the question was asked in South Africa. Surgeon John McCrea, {{an officer of the}} South African forces was recommended for gallantry during hostilities which had not been approved by the British Government. He was awarded the Victoria Cross and the principle was established that gallant conduct could be rewarded independently of any political consideration of military operations. More recently, four Australian soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross in Vietnam although Britain was not involved in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|For the {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, his regiment {{was attached to the}} XIII Army Corps, a part of the 8th Army. Near Warsaw on 24 September, he was one of four men selected by his company commander, then SS-Hauptsturmführer Wilhelm Mohnke to negotiate the surrender of Polish troops during the Battle of Modlin. He was picked because of his ability, although very limited, to speak Polish. After the negotiations failed, the Germans headed back to their lines. When they were about 80 metres from the fort, firing began. Several rounds struck Misch, who fell down and lost consciousness. Some German soldiers carried him to an aid station. Later, he was transferred to two different hospitals. Thereafter, he spent six weeks at a convalescent home. For his actions, Misch was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. As Misch was the last living member of his Lower Silesian family, Mohnke recommended him for the Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). This was made up of SS members, including men from the LSSAH, who were <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> on the front lines.|$|E

25|$|King {{was not a}} pacifist, but {{he showed}} little enthusiasm for the Great War; he faced {{criticism}} for <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> in Canada's military and instead working for the Rockefellers. But he was nearly 40 years old when the war began, and was not in good physical condition. He never gave up his Ottawa home, and travelled to the United States on an as-needed basis, performing valuable service by helping to keep war-related industries running smoothly.|$|E
25|$|Sampras was an all-court {{player who}} would often serve and volley. Possessing an {{all-around}} skill, {{in the early}} years of his career, when <b>not</b> <b>serving,</b> his strategy was to be offensive from the baseline, put opponents in a defensive position, and finish points at the net. In his later years, he became even more offensive and would either employ a chip-and-charge strategy or try to hit an offensive shot on the return and follow his return to the net.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Marsh was {{involved}} in a brokerage bid rigging scandal that plagued much of the insurance industry, including brokerage rivals Aon and Willis Group, and insurer AIG. In a lawsuit, Eliot Spitzer, then New York State’s attorney general, accused Marsh of <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> as an unbiased broker, leading to increased costs for clients and higher fees for Marsh. In early 2005, Marsh agreed to pay $850 million to settle the lawsuit and compensate clients whose commercial insurance it arranged from 2001 to 2004.|$|E

Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than ten days {{before the start of}} the tournament. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 6 hours before their first game.

25|$|Burns, who {{has since}} been {{discharged}} from hospital, invites Rivers to visit him at his family home in seaside Suffolk. Rivers finds Burns alone. They spend a few days together. One night, during a severe thunderstorm, Burns walks outside and suffers flashbacks to his experiences with trench warfare in France. The trauma facilitates' Burn's ability {{to talk about his}} frontline experience. The experience also helps Rivers decide to take the job in London, and notifies his commander at Craiglockhart. When Rivers returns, Sassoon describes his recent hallucinations of dead friends knocking on his door. Sassoon admits to guilt for <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> the soldiers and decides to return to the trenches.

25|$|Despite being {{a staunch}} {{practicing}} Maronite, Mokarzel had often criticized and {{clashed with the}} Maronite clergy especially al-mursaloon (the dispatched) who collected funds {{for the purpose of}} building or renovating churches in Lebanon. The Maronite clergy members were not accustomed to accountability or reproach of their actions, and thus Mokarzel's criticisms and accusations of corruption made them irate. He was subsequently accused by members of the clergy of being a Freemason. Instead of building more places of worship, Mokarzel pressed in a 1904 article for building more public and secular schools in which the clergy and religion had no influence, arguing that the priests were <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> their community. In a 1923 article, Mokarzel reasserted that secular schools were necessary to avoid sectarian antagonism and aversion between the people of the same nation.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader in}} the fight to end private control of the water supply was Fred Eaton. Eaton {{proposed}} that tax revenues would enable the city of Los Angeles to provide water to its residents without charging them {{for the use of}} water directly. Eaton’s views were especially powerful because of his distinguished record of achievement in both the private and public sector. During Eaton’s nine-year term as the superintending engineer of the Los Angeles City Water Company, he headed a large expansion of the company’s water system. Eaton left his position in 1886 when he was elected City Engineer. In his new public position, Eaton devoted his time to updating and expanding the sewer system. Eaton felt that the Los Angeles City Water Company was <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> the citizens of Los Angeles well because of high rates, and because the company frequently paid dividends to its stockholders instead of improving the water system. In early 1897, city engineers began creating plans for an updated water system while the city council informed the Los Angeles City Water Company that its lease would not be renewed beyond its expiration date, July 21, 1898. In early 1898, the city began talks with the Los Angeles City Water Company about taking over the company’s current water system.|$|E

By this time, Time magazine [...] had dubbed Massino as [...] "the Last Don", in reference to his status as the only New York boss <b>not</b> <b>serving</b> a prison sentence at that point.
