25|$|A {{particular}} {{problem is that}} of <b>non-response.</b> Two major types of <b>non-response</b> exist: unit nonresponse (referring to lack of completion of {{any part of the}} survey) and item <b>non-response</b> (submission or participation in survey but failing to complete one or more components/questions of the survey).|$|E
25|$|Weights {{can also}} serve other purposes, such as helping to correct for <b>non-response.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-response</b> or Participation bias: Failure {{to obtain}} {{complete}} data from all selected individuals.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, {{the present}} study obtains item-specific response-time {{thresholds}} by conditioning proportion correct on response time. We consider all response behavior with a response time below the threshold as disengaged, that is, rapid responses and rapid <b>non-responses</b> (omissions), while response behavior above the threshold {{was considered to be}} engaged, that is, slow responses and slow <b>non-responses</b> (Goldhammer et al. 2016; Wise and Gao 2017). Note that slow (<b>non-)responses</b> are not necessarily engaged responses (see “Discussion” section).|$|R
30|$|Alternatively, {{disengaged}} responses can {{be identified}} after the assessment and taken into account when estimating test scores and population parameters (e.g., Rios et al. 2017). For instance, the effort-moderated IRT model proposed by Wise and DeMars (2006) applies a 3 -parameter logistic (PL) IRT model for responses given in the solution behavior mode, while a constant probability model is applied for rapid-guessing behavior. Information on disengagement {{can also be used}} to fine-tune the scoring of response behavior. In the PIAAC, fast <b>non-responses</b> that can be understood as disengaged responses were classified as not attempted items, while <b>non-responses</b> taking more than 5  s were considered wrong responses (OECD 2013 b).|$|R
30|$|Sample {{attrition}} {{can lead}} to biased estimates when conducting causal inference, especially when observations are not missing at random (RAM). However, when <b>non-responses</b> {{are assumed to be}} MAR, the attrition bias disappears albeit with an effective reduction in sample size.|$|R
25|$|A 2009 {{study in}} Norway {{reported}} prevalence rates for ASD ranging from 0.21% to 0.87%, depending on assessment method and assumptions about <b>non-response,</b> suggesting that methodological factors explain large variances in prevalence rates in different studies.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the margin}} of error only {{accounts}} for random sampling error, so it is blind to systematic errors that may be introduced by <b>non-response</b> or by interactions between the survey and subjects' memory, motivation, communication and knowledge.|$|E

40|$|For questionanswer {{sequences}} in Australian Aboriginal talk, it {{has been}} claimed that answers are not necessarily a required response. This would contrast with findings reported in recent cross-linguistic work on such sequences. In a corpus of 62 question sequences from conversations in two Garrwa communities {{on the west side}} of the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia, 34 questions were answered, and a further 12 dealt with the question in some other way. Sixteen received no response in the proximally subsequent talk. Whilst most of these questions were answered, the offset time between question and response was long compared to previous studies. There was also a higher rate of non-answers and <b>non-responses.</b> For some cases of <b>non-responses,</b> contingent factors easily explained the lack, but in a few the reasons were not so apparent. It is argued that a significant factor in the relatively long silence between question and answer, and the relatively high rate of non-answers or <b>non-responses,</b> is that the parties in the talk spend much of the time in ‘continuing states of incipient talk’, rather than in tightly focused and temporally bound conversation, which may help to account for the apparent relaxation of gap minimization and response mobilization.

25|$|What greatly {{facilitates}} statistical accuracy {{by reducing}} <b>non-response</b> bias is that answering questions is sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates <b>non-response</b> bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers), and improves accuracy. For example, for the General Social Survey, people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal {{questions such as}} wage and salary information. But people must answer these questions and won't be paid for their time. It's required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person doesn't get a census survey for any reason, {{he or she is}} still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government can't be held accountable for mixing up an address. Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.|$|E
25|$|Mammals have {{demonstrated}} grief-like states, especially between {{a mother and}} her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's <b>non-response.</b> For example, some deer will often sniff, poke, and look at its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a lioness, will pick up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "... this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic <b>non-response</b> in which the accused tried to {{undercut}} the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth." [...] He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: [...] " [...] {{to be taken seriously}} when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'". Furthermore, Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it [...] " [...] and [...] with thousands of regulations worldwide", writing: ... the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle — or realizes a battle can't be won — then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.|$|E
500|$|During the fleet's construction, Arnold {{ordered the}} arrest and trial of Hazen for {{dereliction}} of his duty {{with respect to}} the incident at Chambly. [...] Hazen, a politically well-connected figure (his commission to lead the 2nd Canadian came after appearing before Congress following the Battle of Quebec), turned the proceeding on its head, countercharging that Arnold had stolen the goods in question, and that the officer responsible for transporting them, a Major Scott, had damaged them in transit. [...] Major Scott's testimony was questioned and eventually rejected by the court martial, [...] which acquitted Hazen and ordered Arnold's arrest. [...] General Horatio Gates, then in command at Ticonderoga, dissolved the arrest warrant, citing the desperate need for Arnold's services against the expected British attack. [...] Arnold's silence in response to Hazen's accusation probably confirmed and deepened the opinions people already held of him; those favorably disposed to him perceived it as a dignified <b>non-response</b> to a ridiculous accusation, while those who disliked him saw it as the reaction of a man whose hand had been caught in the till. [...] Historians continue to debate whether Arnold was actually engaged in anything illegal. [...] In the aftermath of these incidents, Congressman Samuel Chase warned Arnold that [...] "your best friends are not your countrymen".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Researchers {{frequently}} have to analyze scales {{in which some}} participants have {{failed to respond to}} some items. In this paper we focus on the exploratory factor analysis of multidimensional scales (i. e., scales that consist of a number of subscales) where each subscale is made up of a number of Likert-type items, and the aim of the analysis is to estimate participants' scores on the corresponding latent traits. We propose a new approach to deal with missing responses in such a situation that is based on (1) multiple imputation of <b>non-responses</b> and (2) simultaneous rotation of the imputed datasets. We applied the approach in a real dataset where missing responses were artificially introduced following a real pattern of <b>non-responses,</b> and a simulation study based on artificial datasets. The results show that our approach (specifically, Hot-Deck multiple imputation followed of Consensus Promin rotation) was able to successfully compute factor score estimates even for participants that have missing data...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{the victorious}} Allies of World War I had {{prohibited}} {{the union of}} Austria and Germany, their reaction to the Anschluss was mild. Even the strongest voices against annexation, particularly those of Fascist Italy, France and Britain (the [...] "Stresa Front") were not backed by force. In the House of Commons Chamberlain said that [...] "The hard fact is that nothing could have arrested what has actually happened [...] unless this country and other countries had been prepared to use force." [...] The American reaction was similar. The international reaction {{to the events of}} 12 March 1938 led Hitler to conclude that he could use even more aggressive tactics in his plan to expand the Third Reich. The Anschluss paved the way for Munich in September 1938 because it indicated the likely <b>non-response</b> of Britain and France to future German aggression.|$|E
2500|$|The WRR authors {{issued a}} series of {{responses}} regarding of the claims of MBBK, including the claim that no such tuning did or even could have taken place. An earlier WRR response to a request by MBBK authors presented results from additional experiments that used the specific [...] "alternate" [...] name and date formats which MBBK suggested had been intentionally avoided by WRR. Using MBBK's alternates, the results WRR returned showed equivalent or better support {{for the existence of}} the codes, and so challenged the [...] "wiggle room" [...] assertion of MBBK. In the wake of the WRR response, author Bar-Natan issued a formal statement of <b>non-response.</b> After {{a series of}} exchanges with McKay and Bar-Hillel, WRR author Witztum responded in a new paper claiming that McKay had used smoke screen tactics in creating several straw man arguments, and thereby avoided the points made by WRR authors refuting MBBK. Witztum also claimed that, upon interviewing a key independent expert contracted by McKay for the MBBK paper, that some experiments performed for MBBK had validated, rather than refuted the original WRR findings, and questioned why MBBK had expunged these results from their paper.|$|E
2500|$|Roderick Hindery {{reported}} {{that a number of}} Western Catholics have voiced significant disagreement with the Church's stance on contraception. In 1968, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops issued what many interpreted as a dissenting document, the Winnipeg Statement, in which the bishops recognized that a number of Canadian Catholics found it [...] "either extremely difficult or even impossible to make their own all elements of this doctrine" [...] (that of Humanae vitae). Additionally, in 1969, they reasserted the Catholic principle of primacy of conscience, a principle that they said should be properly interpreted. They insisted that [...] "a Catholic Christian is not free to form his conscience without consideration of the teaching of the magisterium, in the particular instance exercised by the Holy Father in an encyclical letter." [...] Catholics for a Free Choice claimed in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in their}} lives and that 72% of U.S. Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. According to a nationwide poll of 2,242 U.S. adults surveyed online in September 2005 by Harris Interactive (they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to sampling errors, <b>non-response,</b> etc.), 90% of U.S. Catholics supported the use of birth control/contraceptives. A survey conducted in 2015 by the Pew Research Center among 5,122 U.S. adults (including 1,016 self-identified Catholics) stated 76% of U.S. Catholics thought that the Church should allow Catholics to use birth control.|$|E
