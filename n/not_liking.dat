5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first episodes was negative, with many reviewers <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> the characters and finding the comedy drama format unusual. As the series progressed, critics' opinions became more positive; the production values rated highly and the fantasy scenes, which became a hallmark of Cold Feet, were well received. An average of eight million viewers watched the series each week. The following year it won awards from the Royal Television Society, the Broadcasting Press Guild and the British Comedy Awards. It was also nominated for the Rose d'Or and a Banff Rockie Award. All six episodes have been released on VHS, DVD and internet media formats.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Gravel was {{challenged}} for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, {{the grandson of}} the man Gravel had defeated in a primary 12 years earlier. Several factors made Gravel vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base. <b>Not</b> <b>liking</b> to hunt or fish, he was also always culturally suspect in the state. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against Gravel, with Gravel's actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue, especially given that the latter's dénouement happened but {{a week before the}} primary. The sources of Gravel's campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees outside the state, also became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska's blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.|$|E

25|$|While {{commonly}} {{believed that}} lesbian sexual practices involve cunnilingus {{for all women}} {{who have sex with}} women, some lesbian or bisexual women dislike cunnilingus due to <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> the experience or due to psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean. Other lesbian or bisexual women believe that it is a necessity or largely defines lesbian sexual activity. Lesbian couples are more likely to consider a woman's dislike of cunnilingus as a problem than heterosexual couples are, and it is common for them to seek therapy to overcome inhibitions regarding it.|$|E

By the end of the season, Yates has the first chapter written and Frank, <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> the direction the book is taking, fires Yates. By the season finale, tensions between the Underwoods reach a point where Claire states her intent to leave Frank.|$|E

The mansions walls are being renovated as the funds are available, being painstakingly removed by a scalpel, carefully not to damage the original layer.

25|$|Croatian {{pop music}} is fairly often listened to in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia {{due to the}} union of Yugoslavia that existed until the 1990s. Conversely, Bosnian singers like Dino Merlin and Serbian Đorđe Balašević have an {{audience}} in Croatia, {{as well as some}} others. More recently the Turbo folk– frowned upon by the establishment some music critics and social commentators– has been popular amongst some sections of Croatian youth. A general resentment to Turbo folk remains as it is not broadcast on state radio and TV. Where on private outlets it may be transmitted, it normally triggers a strong negative reaction from those <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> it. Croatian singers that are using elements of Turbo folk are Severina and Jelena Rozga.|$|E

25|$|When {{the second}} superhero Civil War began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro {{disagreed}} on which side was right - Pietro <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> {{the idea of}} profiling people {{based on what they}} might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past - past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could be more dangerous than the existing situation, and she resented Pietro still trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the Red Skull, acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.|$|E
