25|$|Since {{harassment}} neutralized many of {{the traditional}} media outlets, anonymous blogs like Blog del <b>Narco</b> took {{on the role of}} reporting on events related to the drug war. The drug cartels responded by murdering bloggers and social media users. Twitter users have been tortured and killed for posting and denouncing information of the drug cartels activities. In September 2011, user NenaDLaredo of the website Nuevo Laredo Envivo was murdered allegedly by the Zetas.|$|E

This is in contrast to the somewhat glorified war narrative of ‘good versus bad’ that <b>Narcos</b> imposes on the events that occurred in early 1980 s Colombia. The show’s perpetuation of the War on Drugs supply-side logic, the juxtaposition of narcotrafficantes with communism, and the demonization of the <b>narcos</b> all serve to justify the suspension of morality in the war against the <b>narcos...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{first time}} the U.S. Coast Guard found one {{containing}} drugs, authorities dubbed it Bigfoot because they had heard rumors that such things existed, but none had actually been seen. In late 2006 a Bigfoot was seized 145km southwest of Costa Rica carrying several metric tonnes of cocaine. In 2006, US officials say they detected three; in 2008, they were spotting an average of ten per month, but {{only one out of}} ten was intercepted. Few were seized, as their crews scuttle them upon interception and they sink within a minute or so. By 2009, the U.S.A. detected as many as 60 <b>narco</b> submarine related events, and it was calculated that they were moving as much as 330 metric tonnes of cocaine per year.|$|E
25|$|The accused duo {{were brought}} to the Directorate of Forensic Sciences in Gandhinagar city in order to undergo brain mapping and {{polygraph}} tests on 4 January 2007 and <b>narco</b> analysis five days later. The police director told the scribes that both the accused had been cooperative during the tests and examinations. A senior director of the institute announced the conclusion of the extensive tests and declared that a conclusion had been drawn. Surinder Koli had confessed to the crimes and had given his employer a clean chit saying that he was unaware of Koli's doings. Surinder Koli also revealed that all deaths had taken place through strangulation. He would then rape them before taking the bodies to his personal washroom and dismembering them. Pandher was declared to be a womaniser and depressed.|$|E
25|$|Illicit drugs {{also are}} smuggled into and through Texas via {{commercial}} aircraft, cars, buses, passenger trains, pedestrians, and package delivery services. Narcotics are also smuggled through the railroads that connect the U.S. and Mexico. Moreover, the Mexican drug traffickers often use small boats to transport drugs through the coastal areas of South Texas, usually operating {{at night to}} prevent them from being spotted by law enforcement officials. Another avenue that they have implemented is to construct underground tunnels to get their product across the border. By constructing a tunnel, the cartel is able to get their product across the tight border security with the possibility of no detection. Apart from using these common ways, once the product is across the border, common cars and trucks are utilized for faster distribution in different cities. In an effort to use the seas, the cartel also implemented the use of <b>narco</b> submarines.|$|E

25|$|Activities and {{functions}} of R are highly confidential and declassification of past operations are uncommon unlike agencies like CIA, MI6 and Mossad who have many of their activities declassified. The Secretary (R) reported to the Vohra Committee that R offices abroad have limited strength and are largely geared to the collection of military, economic, scientific and political intelligence. R monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad only insofar {{as they relate to}} their involvement with <b>narco</b> terrorist elements and smuggling arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India. It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements. However, if there is evidence to suggest that certain organisations have links with Intelligence agencies of other countries, and that they are being used or are likely to be used by such countries for destabilising India's economy, it would become R's responsibility to monitor their activities.|$|E
25|$|The Cadereyta Jiménez {{massacre}} {{occurred on}} the Mexican Federal Highway 40 on 13 May 2012. Mexican officials stated that 49 people were decapitated and mutilated by members of Los Zetas drug cartel and dumped by a roadside {{near the city of}} Monterrey in northern Mexico. The Blog del <b>Narco,</b> a blog that documents events and people of the Mexican Drug War anonymously, reported that the actual (unofficial) death toll may be more than 68 people. The bodies were found in the town of San Juan in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León at about 4a.m. on a non-toll highway leading to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The forty-three men and six women killed had their heads, feet, and hands cut off, making their identification difficult. Those killed also bore signs of torture and were stuffed in plastic bags. The arrested suspects have indicated that the victims were Gulf Cartel members, but the Mexican authorities have not ruled out the possibility that they were U.S.-bound migrants. Four days before this incident, 18 people were found decapitated and dismembered near Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2011, {{violence}} erupted between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel in Veracruz, {{a strategic}} smuggling {{state with a}} giant gulf port. Two trucks containing 35 dead bodies were found at an underpass near a shopping mall in Boca del Río, having reportedly been abandoned there by armed men {{in the middle of}} the highway. All of the victims were alleged to be members of Los Zetas, but it was later proven that only six of them had been involved in minor crime incidents, and none of them were involved with organized crime. The Blog del <b>Narco</b> reported on 21 September 2011 that the message left behind was supposedly signed by Gente Nueva, an enforcer group of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the top boss of the Sinaloa cartel; However, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel also claimed responsibility, and announced they were planning to take over Veracruz. On 6 October 2011, again in Boca del Río, 32 bodies were found by the Mexican authorities in three different houses. Four further bodies were confirmed separately by the state government of Veracruz. The discoveries led to the resignation of Reynaldo Escobar Pérez, the State Justice Attorney General. One day after the resignation, 10 more bodies were found throughout the city of Veracruz. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel was also responsible for 67 killings in Veracruz on 7 October 2011.|$|E
