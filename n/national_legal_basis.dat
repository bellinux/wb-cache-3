40|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of scientists have concluded {{that global warming is}} unequivocal. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth report in 2013 concluded that the challenge of climate disruption to human beings is even more imperative than the previous report claimed, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions have extremely likely been the dominant causes of the observed global warming since the mid- 20 th century. Anthropogenic GHGs emissions have many implications, including more intensive, extreme meteorological events, spreading of diseases, and threatening human health and life. Climate change also causes injustice in human society because of the dislocation of the consequences from it in time and space for the affected people. As a response, a variety of policies and laws have been initiated from regions and nations. Among them, economic incentive instruments are employed to combat global warming, including a carbon emission trading system (ETS) and a carbon tax. Carbon emission trading as a market means has its advantages, such as political feasibility and certainty for environmental benefits. Its volatility of carbon price could be avoided by a proper design, for instance, a price containment mechanism. In contrast, a carbon tax is less politically feasible and also may have an effect on trade and market distortion, such as border and tariff adjustments (BATS). Allowing parties to buy CERs from CDM and Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) projects will be conducive to carbon emissions reduction. The European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) is the largest and most successful market based system in the world. The lessons learned in its development, detailed in the body of this thesis, set invaluable examples from which other market based systems can greatly benefit. The Regional GHG Initiative (RGGI), the first mandated cap-and-trade program for GHGs, is another pioneer cap and trade program herein discussed in depth. It is a regional program of Northeastern U. S. states. RGGI is regarded as an effective and efficient system. It successfully decoupled economic growth and the reduction of carbon emissions. RGGI states surpassed other states in economic growth and the decline of carbon emissions simultaneously. RGGI‘s challenges and shortcomings are also documented. Thus RGGI encountered carbon leakages through importing electricity from non-RGGI states. The Cost Containment Reserve also needed improvement. When reserve allowances were sold, additional emissions tended to inflate the original cap. To avoid this scenario, some portion of allowances needed to be held back in the allowance reserve. Another pioneer U. S. cap and trade initiative, The Western Climate Action Initiative, is a unique multi-jurisdictional program among western U. S. states and Canadian provinces. In one element of it, California and Quebec have created the first international cap-and-trade system of sub-national jurisdictions. It is the most ambitious program in North America, but it encountered difficulties from the dramatic change in the political landscape accompanying the 2008 economic crisis and the change in U. S. administrations. The emission trading systems of a number of other nations that are experimenting with emission trading systems are also covered in depth, including the Korea Emission Trading System begun in South Korea in 2015 and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government cap-and-trade program which was the first mandatory ETS in Japan, begun in 2010. The China approaches to these issues and their prospects are a major focus of this study. China officially launched seven state pilot ETS programs starting in 2013 and plans to initiate a national ETS this year in 2017. The many accumulated experiences from the pilot programs include such findings as the importance of setting realistic targets balancing the needs for carbon reductions with those of economic growth and pollution control and the need for legislation specifying the actions to be taken, provisions for disclosure, allowance allocations, offsets, infrastructure building, monitoring reporting and verification, and adoption of a compliance mechanism. Deficiencies in the pilot programs are evaluated, such as those derived from lack of a <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and unified rules for the carbon market, an excess of free allocation of allowances, a lack of liquidity of the market, lenient punishment for non-compliance, and absence of a sound monitoring and regulatory mechanism. The requisites for sound market based programs are described, with particular emphasis on the need for a comprehensive legal basis on which programs can be built. The pluses and minuses of cap and trade market based programs versus carbon taxes are explored in depth, including the possibilities of combining the two systems. Various bottom up and top down approaches are explored and the key elements of success and failure. From the perspective of international cooperation under the Paris Agreement in the long run, it is concluded {{that it is necessary to}} identify a formula to link the domestic carbon markets to those in other jurisdictions. A multi-lateral club approach is suggested. The role of the judicial branch in carbon emission reduction is explored with several recent relevant cases described. Conclusions of the study seek to identify what alternative systems of carbon emission controls are being applied throughout the world, what lessons can be learned from them, and what are the important elements needed for successful programs...|$|E

The presented research {{was based on a}} thorough examination of <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> acts, which constitute both legal background and foundation of farmer’s unions’ activities and internal structure. The author tries to introduce both the individual legal and system guarantees which are dedicated to farmers’ organization and which exact acts shall be considered as the direct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> of the guarantees. Having regard to the fact that even the Polish Constitution introduces transparent and direct legal frameworks for functioning of farmers’ trade unions, the author intends to prove that individual farmers’ unions’ operations should be considered as a fundamental and basic feature of the national agricultural system. The presented work should be also considered as thorough examination of legal provisions presented in the Act on individual farmers’ trade unions of 7 th April 1989 (Ustawa…, 2015 b), which is direct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for functioning guarantees of the agricultural unions.

What are the physical and emotional effects of the widespread use of rape as a weapon of war? In what way are women objectified and how are the implications of this projected into the social reference group? In order to answer these questions, first, a review is made of the international standards of legal protection against sexual violence. Then two case studies are analysed: Sepur Zarco in Guatemala and Manta and Vilca in Peru. In these cases,for the first time, <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> systems, based on international humanitarian law, have established a <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to punish sexual violence crimes within armed conflict contexts as crimes against humanity...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structure}} of legal bases according to competences, instruments, and procedures; as well as <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in the European Union {{before and after the}} introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of general criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation as they have been developed under supranational EU law. It discovers several flaws inherited in the quest for the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> on the grounds of overlapping competences, divergent inter-institutional interests, and inconsistencies in the courts’ judgements. In addition, the previous pillar structure of the EU has also led to cross-pillar litigation which is particularly the case in the area of external relations. With the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the previous pillar structure has been abolished and the former third pillar has been integrated into the realm of supranational EU law. While the intergovernmental sphere is thus minimised to the area of common foreign and security policy, <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> conflicts will continue to occur between this area and the TFEU as well as within the TFEU itself. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty has even created new problems concerning the choice of the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> most notably as regards the newly codified competence categories as well as the new hierarchy of legal instruments. This may require the development of new criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in order to guarantee legal certainty in these areas for future cases...|$|R
