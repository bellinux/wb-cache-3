5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate, <b>none</b> <b>have</b> been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|As {{the major}} {{defining}} characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin {{has been the subject}} of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although <b>none</b> <b>have</b> yet earned widespread support.|$|E

50|$|There were 3 {{households}} out {{of which}} <b>none</b> <b>had</b> {{children under the age}} of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, <b>none</b> <b>had</b> a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. Individuals make up 33.3% of all households, and <b>none</b> <b>had</b> someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.67 and the average family size was 2.00.|$|R

5|$|Other Iowa Early Paleoindian points include Gainey, a {{point that}} appears to be {{intermediate}} between Clovis and Folsom. Gainey points were also recovered at Rummells-Maske.

5|$|Paleontologists today {{agree on}} the overall {{structure}} of the ceratopsian family tree, although there are differences on individual taxa. There have been several cladistic studies performed on basal ceratopsians since 2000. <b>None</b> <b>have</b> used every taxon listed above {{and many of the}} differences between the studies are still unresolved.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{commercial}} varieties available from Australian retail nurseries; however <b>none</b> <b>have</b> yet been registered under plant breeders' rights legislation, and only one ('Limelight') is registered with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority. The lack of official names has led to some varieties bearing several different names.|$|E
5|$|Additional live {{specimens}} {{recovered in}} 2010 and 2011 from Oregon were all found deep inside caves. Except {{for a single}} juvenile specimen recovered from the understory debris of old growth redwood forests of northwest California, <b>none</b> <b>have</b> been found outside the caves. This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and may represent a new undescribed species.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), <b>none</b> <b>have</b> been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E

5|$|Currently, curium is {{not used}} as a nuclear fuel owing to its low {{availability}} and high price. 245Cm and 247Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore {{could be used in}} portable nuclear weapons, but <b>none</b> <b>have</b> been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 would be highly suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.|$|E
5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; <b>none</b> <b>have</b> yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} caught by a fishing rod.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though <b>none</b> <b>have</b> yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E

5|$|Houses found {{today in}} Zeeland are closer in {{appearance}} {{to the fine}} Dutch brick houses of New York than are houses {{from other parts of}} the Netherlands. Brick farm houses built separately from barns are found in Zeeland, but <b>none</b> <b>have</b> survived in other locations. Unlike the common practice in New York, the farm houses in Zeeland do not have separate outside doors for each room. The Dutch also used bricks to pave the roads, or chaussees, in the Netherlands.|$|E
