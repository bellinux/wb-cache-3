The lawsuit was settled in October 2007, with Intel agreeing to pay US$150million initially and US$20million {{per year for}} the next five years. Both companies agreed to drop lawsuits against each other, while Intel was granted a perpetual <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>license</b> to use current and future patented Transmeta technologies in its chips for 10 years.|$|E

The Army chose Ford as the second supplier, building Jeeps to the Willys' design. Willys supplied Ford with a complete set of plans and specifications.

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of {{cassette}} tape technology in the 1970s, {{a number of companies}} began selling copies of the 1950 Scourby recordings without permission, assuming that they were in public domain. In the 1980s, a Florida company, Neva Products, sought to sell these recordings via TV direct-response advertisements. Prior to doing this however, Neva commissioned a law firm to research whether or not the recordings were in the public domain. The legal opinion came back that they were not in the public domain and that certain rights were associated with the recordings that could be protected. Based upon this legal opinion, Neva Products contacted Scourby and negotiated a <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>license</b> agreement and agreed to pay him a royalty on all sales. The television promotion went very well. However, some companies continued marketing the recordings without authorization, even though they were contacted by Neva informing them that the recordings were still under copyright and to cease and desist.|$|E

The benefit of the rights-retention clause is that neither the author, nor the institution, need negotiate open access with the publisher; the policy itself allows open access to the article. Upon acceptance or publication, the author or their representative deposits the article into their institutional repository.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} patent {{marketplace is}} a complex ecosystem comprised of innovators and manufacturers who are often connected by a varied group of intermediaries. While {{there are a variety}} of intermediary business models—such as patent assertion entities and defensive aggregators—each facilitates a variant of a similar licensing transaction, connecting a set of patents held by a patent owner with a product or service offered by a prospective licensee. One explanation for the prevalence of intermediaries is that they engage in practices tantamount to arbitrage, acquiring patents and then licensing them at a profit because they enjoy greater success in patent litigation than patent holders would on their own. This paper advances an additional explanation: some intermediaries may serve a function analogous to a platform trading in <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licenses,</b> overcoming search and valuation costs to facilitate licensing. This paper focuses on the use of two contract terms in intermediaries’ dealings with technology market participants: revenue sharing in patent acquisition and <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licensing.</b> The Federal Trade Commission’s Patent Entity Activity Study reported that intermediaries used both of these terms. Building on those findings, this paper argues that intermediaries that use both provisions may, under some conditions, operate in a manner analogous to a two-sided platform. First, this paper examines how participants in a technology market would value <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licenses</b> granted ex post, after the licensed product is already on the market. The paper argues that—in addition to the avoidance of litigation costs— the reduction of uncertainty can also drive licensee demand. Next, the paper proposes that use of revenue sharing allows patent holders to experience network effects from the number of prospective licensees accessed through the intermediary, which may make the intermediary more attractive than licensing unilaterally. Finally, this paper argues that the conduct of a patent licensing intermediary using these contract features can be analogized to the practices of other licensing intermediaries such as performing rights organizations and patent pools. These observations suggest that one explanation for the success of some intermediary models—as well as one aspect of their conduct that may influence competition in technology markets—is their ability to connect patent holders and prospective licensees with a greater number of potential trading partners than they would otherwise be able to connect with on their own...|$|R
