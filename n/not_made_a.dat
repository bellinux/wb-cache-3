5|$|Chamberlain was <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> Privy Councillor. He also spurned {{advice from}} Lloyd George about {{his choice of}} advisors (apart from James Stevenson from the Ministry of Munitions who was briefly Deputy for Civil Recruiting), instead {{appointing}} cronies from Birmingham who were as out of their depth as he was. Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when, having not been told or consulted, he read in the newspapers {{that he had been}} given a new Parliamentary Secretary.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's Natural History {{became a}} model for later encyclopedias and {{scholarly}} works {{as a result of}} its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, a son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus's reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He began it in 77, and had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> final revision at the time of his death during the AD79 eruption of Vesuvius.|$|E

5|$|The Mystic Seaport Light {{is subject}} to United States Coast Guard {{regulations}} to become operational, {{and because it is}} a full-sized replica of a lighthouse, requirements include supervisory schedules and installation of an emergency, backup light.

5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether there should be a ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> station on the Ring Line, noise shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being a U.S. citizen, Lin is by descent through his parents a national of Taiwan; Lin would qualify for a Taiwan passport although there is no record of him having done so. Lin has been invited to play for the Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team in FIBA competitions. On July 28, 2010 while in Taipei to play in Yao Ming's charity game, Lin said he had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> decision yet on whether he would represent Chinese Taipei (the name used by Taiwan in international sporting competitions). In June 2011, the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) included Lin in its preliminary squad of 24 players for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. The next month, however, the CTBA announced that Lin would not be included on their roster due to a knee injury.|$|E
5|$|Stalin died in March 1953, {{and in the}} {{reorganisation}} that followed, the Presidium was abolished and {{a smaller}} Politburo reconstituted. Although Brezhnev was <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> Politburo member, he was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Army and the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant-General, a very senior position. Brezhnev's patron Khrushchev succeeded Stalin as General Secretary, while Khrushchev's opponent Malenkov succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Brezhnev sided with Khrushchev against Malenkov, but only for several years. On 7 May 1955, Brezhnev was made General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. On the surface, his brief was simple: to make the new lands agriculturally productive. In reality, Brezhnev {{became involved in the}} development of the Soviet missile and nuclear arms programs, including the Baykonur Cosmodrome. The initially successful Virgin Lands Campaign soon became unproductive and failed to solve the growing Soviet food crisis. Brezhnev was recalled to Moscow in 1956. The harvest in the years following the Virgin Lands Campaign was disappointing, which would have hurt his political career had he remained in Kazakhstan.|$|E

5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the sluice gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the sluice gates was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cars}} {{waited for the}} restart, work on the cars was allowed and Hamilton's front wing was changed, while Rio Haryanto ended his race. As the race resumed behind the safety car, both Ferrari drivers were running on the super-soft tyre compound, with both Mercedes now {{equipped}} with mediums, which were set to last {{for the rest of}} the race. The running order at the restart was: Vettel, Rosberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Hamilton, Massa, Grosjean, Bottas. Grosjean in ninth was the only driver who had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> pit stop before the red flag was shown, which allowed him to save one pit stop and change his tyres during the break.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} to establish himself at Crewe Alexandra, Roberts spent time on loan with Merseyside based outfit Southport. Roberts made his Southport debut {{just three days}} after signing for the club, playing the whole match in a 4–0 away defeat to Accrington Stanley. He featured {{in a total of}} six games for Southport, before then opting to join Chester City on a one-month loan deal. Roberts only started one game for Chester in a 5–0 defeat at Carlisle United, and did not feature again for the Cheshire side subsequent to this match. After his unsuccessful loan spell at Chester, Roberts was loaned out to Southport for a second time in March 2006, making his second debut for the club in a 2–1 win away to Forest Green Rovers, in which he was sent off in the 88th minute for two bookable offences. He returned to first team action in Southport's 1–1 draw against Altrincham, before playing the whole match in a 2–0 victory against Accrington Stanley at Haig Avenue. He played 12 times during his second loan spell at the club, playing his final game in Southport's 1–0 home loss against Aldershot Town in April 2006. Despite still being on the books at Crewe, Roberts had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> first team appearance for the club since 2004 and was again loaned out ahead of the 2006–07 season, this time to Yorkshire-based Conference National side Halifax Town. He played his first game for Halifax in the club's first game of the 2006–07 campaign, starting in a 2–0 away defeat to Oxford United. He scored his first goal for Halifax in a 2–1 victory over Cambridge United, the first goal of the game. Roberts featured in a total of thirteen games for the Halifax, scoring once, before ending his loan spell at the club.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
5|$|On 29 October 1918, the Croatian Sabor {{declared}} {{independence and}} decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The Treaty of Trianon was signed in 1920, {{at the end of}} World War I, between the Allies of World War I and Hungary as one of the successor states to Austria-Hungary. The treaty established the southern border of Hungary along the Drava and Mura rivers, except in Baranya, where only {{the northern part of the}} county was kept by Hungary. The territorial acquisition in Baranya was <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> part of Slavonia, even though adjacent to Osijek, because pre-1918 administrative divisions were disestablished by the new kingdom. The political situation in the new kingdom deteriorated, leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929. The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution transferring executive power to the king, and changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia. The Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 created the autonomous Banovina of Croatia incorporating Slavonia. Pursuant to the agreement, the Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed 'Ban'.|$|E
