40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the {{population}} and domestic industrialization activities have resulted in wastewater production; one of the significant harmful impacts towards the environment. Textile industries have been recognized to be among the largest water consumers amid the industries, as well as hazardous wastewater generators. Furthermore, as a result of regional cultural preferences, popular particular textile industries like batik, in South East Asian regions especially in Malaysia, discharge untreated wastewaters, which contain mainly wax, resin, dyes and fixing agents (sodium silicates) directly to the environment. Accordingly, this study has been conducted to investigate the application of hybrid membrane filtration to treat batik wastewaters. This study consists of the combination of two main treatments namely; the baffle separation tank pre-treatment followed by ultra and <b>nano</b> <b>filtration</b> membranes. The former was applied to remove all undesired physical contaminants from batik wastewaters before the main conventional treatment technique – the hybrid membrane treatment – for removing chemical and physical contaminants from different simulated batik wastewaters. Single and multi-premixed textile fibre reactive dyes namely Remazol turquoise blue 15, Remazol red 194, Remazol yellow 14, Reactive orange 16 and Reactive black 5 with invariant value concentration (16 mg/L), constant value of paraffin wax and resin (7. 7 g/L) and sodium silicate (1 g/L) were used. The performance of the hybrid system was evaluated based on wax and heavy metal removal efficiency (%) and rejection of dyes and sodium silicate using COD, pH and conductivity as the indicator parameters. Membrane flux and fouling behaviour in both ultra and <b>nano</b> <b>filtration</b> were investigated. The membrane surface was observed using FESEM technique. Moreover, HPLC tests were used to help verify the achieved results from other analytical methods. The results showed that wax removal efficiency achieved in all the samples from pre-treatment and UF stages was more than 99 %. Complete dye rejection in all dye solution samples was achieved. The sodium silicate rejection rate in both single and mixture dye samples were in the range of 45 % - 60 %. Concentration of heavy metals and COD values in the permeates declined significantly (reached almost total rejection) as compared to the feed solution. The comparison of pH and conductivity values between the feed and permeate samples after each treatment cycle represented distinct decline changes, which were in agreement with the other achieved results (range between 7. 2 and 7. 7; and < 90. 3 S/cm respectively). The achieved results concluded that the presented hybrid membrane treatment technique leads to a higher efficiency rate while remarkably reducing the operational processing time.

They enter the environment in different ways, including agricultural runoff, direct discharge of urban wastewater treatment or human waste, direct disposal of medical, veterinary industrial waste and to name but a few. Antibiotics have been able to influence the microbial population. Their continuous presence in the environment can lead to bacterial resistance and in recent years, the issue has caused serious concerns in the scientific community. Materials and Methods: Unfortunately, in spite of the extensive investigations, there is still a considerable lack of integrated and classified information to assess the environmental risks of antibiotics. Therefore, in the current study, the removal of these compounds from aqueous solutions was studied. This study was carried out on the basis of surveys accomplished in recent decades and also the ones published in databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Elsevier, Scopus, Springer, Magiran and SID using anti-bacterial agents, antibiotic, wastewater and removal methods as the keywords.

The numerous “known ” parameters, “known-unknowns”, and “unknown-unknowns ” that have to be eliminated to meet discharge standards. The state-of-art Electro Contaminant Removal (ECR) system adopts electrocoagulation principle and is a process of removing the contaminants in water with the passage of electricity. This process destabilizes suspended, emulsified, or dissolved contaminants in an aqueous medium. The electromotive force provided drives the chemical reactions and compound will approach the most stable state. Generally, this stable state is a solid that is less colloidal, less emulsifiable, or less soluble than the element or compound at equilibrium values. As this occurs, the contaminants form hydrophobic entities such as precipitates or phase separations that can easily be removed by a number of secondary separation techniques.

The introduction of a dimensionless hydraulic permeability, Lp"+, allows the correlation use for membranes ranging from porous (U F) to dense (R O) ones. The steric pore flow model {{is based on the}} membrane morphological and chemical characteristics, pore radius and membrane - solute - water chemical interactions. The membrane morphological characterisation by optical polarizing studies and IR spectroscopy showed the existence of areas of preferential permeation, being the polymer molecular arrangement at the membrane surface connected with the quantity and mobility of the water sorbed on the membrane. The pore radius was found to be a global parameter related to the polymer molecular arrangement responsible for the diffusive and convective steric hindrances and the membrane-solute-water chemical interactions.

40|$|The {{filtering}} {{properties of}} membranes in the ultra and <b>nano</b> <b>filtration</b> range cannot only {{be derived from}} a pure sieving effect. With decreasing membrane pore size the surface charge of the membranes and the charge d. {{become more and more}} important with regard to its retention and selectivity. Typical parameters like permeate flux and retention of salt ions, particles or mols. are governed by a so-called effective pore diam. depending on the surface charge and the thickness of the electrochem. double layer on the pore walls. Fouling mechanisms, i. e., cake forming and pore blocking, which cause a permeate flux decline in the filtration process are also strongly influenced by the surface charge of the membrane. In the case of liq. satd. oxide ceramic membranes, a surface charge results from dissocd. surface groups and adsorbed charge-detg. ions. Ceramic ultrafiltration membranes made of TiO 2, ZrO 2,. alpha. - and. gamma. -Al 2 O 3 were investigated by streaming potential measurements. For these measurements an Electrokinetic Analyzer EKA from Anton Paar, Austria, was used. The membranes were characterized by a tangential flow method, i. e., an electrolyte soln. is forced through a narrow slit formed by the surfaces of two similar membranes which are positioned facing one another. In this way the dependence of the surface charge on the pH was shown. Using the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation the surface charge d. can be expressed by the. zeta. -potential. The permeate fluxes of polyethylenimine solns. and dextrane solns. through the membranes in a dead-end filtration process at different pH-values were investigated by means of a filtration testing device. The pH values chosen for these expts. result either in a high pos., a high neg. or in a net zero charge of the appropriate membrane material. The abs. permeate flux and its drop with increasing filtering time strongly depend on the charge conditions of the membrane surface and the charge of the particles, mols. or ions in the feed soln.

40|$|Microbial {{activity}} in raw repurposed waters from {{oil and gas}} operations is known to cause enhanced corrosion in flow lines and downhole fouling in the reservoir if left un-treated. For this reason, shale operators prefer to use biocides or mobile treatment units to treat raw production waters. Unfortunately, field experience has shown that biocide treatments alone are ineffective and costly. In addition to these findings, produced water stability during storage is not yet well documented due to difficulty in obtaining timely and accurate microbial levels. Concluding an extensive literature review, industry inquiry, and referencing three levels of scale up testing (laboratory, pilot, and field scales), water treatment studies identified three low cost, real time analysis technologies. Using the identified technologies, membrane filtration was evaluated as a technique to reduce microbial activity and primary microbial metabolites in raw produced waters. Filtration treatment does efficiently reduce biomass levels in produced water. Using a two-stage filtration scheme with micro and <b>nano</b> <b>filtration</b> membranes, a significant reduction of divalent ion species and of biological activity is observed in permeate waters. Monovalent species were {{not found to be}} directly affected by filtration treatment. Metabolically active monovalent ions including: nitrate, ammonia, ammonium and nitrite were found to be reduced by microbial {{activity in}} permeate during temporary storage. Additional metabolically active ions including: soluble iron, sulfate, manganese, and dissolved organic carbon were found to be reduced by filtration treatment. Their divalent nature and organic compound molecular weight are thought to be the source.

Food waste management is important topic for several reasons: the diversity of these wastes and upward trend, environmental restrictions for disposal of these wastes, big potential for material and energy recovery, {{a whole range of}} disturbances in the waste management operating system, resulting in deviations from the stated goals. For the first time in master’s thesis, a possibility on how to manage food wastes at the cafeteria was analyzed. In master‘s thesis, analysis of scientific literature, legislation, food waste streams and management was carried out. There was assessed the most recent food waste management options, methods of prevention and food waste streams. In legislation overview there was identified that one of the priorities of the European Union is that biodegradable waste management should be carried out in cost-effective manner, while maintaining a high level of environmental protection. In scientific work in Telšiai district municipality, biodegradable waste management system was analyzed, special attention was given to the food waste streams. It was found that in the municipality 7448. 87 t/y. of biodegradable waste from municipal solid waste stream is generated, 1082. 83 t/y. by-products from the municipal slaughterhouse and 137040 m 3 /y. of whey. Municipal waste, together with the biodegradable fraction is treated in regional MBT. After the waste treatment, along with remaining municipalities solid waste stream is landfilling with the capacity of 12171, 25 t/y. For a part of these wastes, alternatives are proposed. First one – MBT optimization, which allows to enlarge biogas production by 133100 m 3 /y. and produce 1206, 9 t/y. of biocompost by using source segregated food wastes from blocks of flats, other organizations, accommodation and catering facilities.

40|$|<b>Nano</b> <b>Filtration</b> (NF) is an {{advanced}} treatment {{process that is}} able to remove molecules and ions from water using special, synthetic, membrane modules. Under high pressure the so– called feed water enters the membrane module. Part of the water, the permeate, passes through the membrane wall while the rejected ions and molecules are flushed out {{with the rest of}} the water, the concentrate. However, the ratio between product; the permeate, and waste; the concentrate, that can be attained with NF treatment is limited by the concentration of sparingly soluble salts in the feed water. When too much permeate is produced the concentrate stream becomes supersaturated, causing the salts to start precipitating on the membrane surface, a process called scaling. The scaling causes an increase in membrane resistance, necessitating a higher pressure, and thus more energy, to treat the same amount of water. There are several strategies to control scaling in membrane filtration installations such as feedwater alteration and antiscalant dosing, all of which aim to keep the salts dissolved for as long as possible. In this thesis a different approach to prevent scaling is proposed, aiming to promote precipitation instead, albeit in a controlled manner: precipitative antiscalants. Instead of precipitating on the membrane wall, the salts precipitate on special particles, which are transported out of the system with the waste stream. The dosing of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH) 2, was investigated as precipitative antiscalant for CaCO 3 scaling. Ca(OH) 2 particles exhibit a dissolve–precipitate effect, where CaCO 3 precipitates on the dissolving particles, slowing down further dissolution. This effect is unwanted during application in other processes, but may prove of use as anti scaling mechanism. To better understand the mechanisms and kinetics involved with Ca(OH) 2 dissolution in carbonate containing solutions a soft–sensor, capable of converting measured pH and EC to total calcium and carbonate, was developed and validated. Using this sensor it was found that, for high dosages of Ca(OH) 2, the formed layer of CaCO 3 was unstable. After a certain length of time the covering layer breaks open, allowing the dissolution reaction to continue at its original rate. To investigate whether Ca(OH) 2 dosing could function as antiscalant a pilot–plant installation, capable of simulating scaling on a flat–sheet polymeric NF membrane, was constructed. Dosing of Ca(OH) 2 particles in combination with using a feed spacer proved problematic, as the particles got lodged between the spacers and could not be adequately removed. Without a feed spacer installed Ca(OH) 2 dosing as antiscalant was a limited success. With little surface scaling taking place the runtime of the experiment could be extended from a mere 4. 5 hours to over 24 hours. Excessive particulate fouling inside the pilot–plant, however, forced the experiment to be halted prematurely. In the end, although theoretically possible, the problems associated with feed spacers, the necessity of an intermittent cleaning cycle and substantial particulate fouling inside the system make the use of precipitative antiscalants for use with conventional spiral–wound polymeric membranes an unattractive option compared to more traditional anti-scaling measurementsCivil Engineering and GeosciencesWater ManagementSanitary Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|PepT 1 (Peptide Transporter 1, SLC 15 A 1) is a proton-coupled peptide {{transporter}} {{responsible for}} uptake of short peptides and peptide-like drugs from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes. A PepT 1 -type transporter {{has recently been}} sequenced for Atlantic cod and found to be expressed along the whole post-gastric intestine including pyloric caeca. In the present thesis the effect of dietary inclusion of peptides and amino acids on expression of PepT 1 mRNA in different regions of juvenile Atlantic cod intestine was investigated. Five groups of cod weighing 10 - 15 grams were fed for 46 days with a diet containing approximately 42 % crude protein, either as fishmeal (FM diet) or 30 % of the fish meal substituted by either whole fish hydrolysate (FH diet), retenate after ultra filtration of fish hydrolysate (UFR diet), retenate after <b>nano</b> <b>filtration</b> of fish hydrolysate (NFR diet) or a mix of free amino acids (FAA diet). After 14 days (T 1) {{and at the end}} of the experiment (46 days; T 3), three fish were sampled from each group and the intestine divided into five segments, namely pyloric caeca (S 1) and the remainder of the intestine from the pyloric caeca to the anus divided into four equally long segments (S 2 to S 5). Total RNA isolated from each segment was subjected to a two-step quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR green and Atlantic cod elongation factor 1 alpha as reference gene. For all diets PepT 1 was found to be expressed in all segments, suggesting that for juvenile Atlantic cod the whole intestine is involved in peptide absorption. The different groups of fish showed a similar PepT 1 mRNA expression in all segments, but differences in regional expression were found. At T 3 the regional expression profile showed statistical differences in PepT 1 expression between segments in the FAA and UFR fed fish (diets included amino acids or larger sized peptides). Both groups had a higher expression in S 2 and S 3 (mid intestine) then pyloric caeca (S 1) and S 5. A similar trend was also observed for the UFR at T 1, while the FAA fed fish had a low and stable expression in all segments at T 1. No significant differences in PepT 1 expression were found between segments in the FM, FH or the NFR fed group for any time. These results suggest that for diets where 30 % of the fish meal has been replaced by fish hydrolysate containing short peptides (FH and NFR) the involvement of the pyloric caeca in peptide absorption is similar to the remainder of the intestine, while diets with no or low amounts of short chained peptides included (FAA and UFR) have a lower involvement of pyloric caeca in peptide absorption compared to mid intestine. A general higher expression of PepT 1 was found at T 3 then at T 1 in all segments except S 4, but no interaction between time and diet was found, indicating that some developmental or growth related changes in PepT 1 expression occurs during this life stage of Atlantic cod. These results suggest that dietary peptides of various chain lengths as well as free amino acids affect the regional expression of PepT 1 mRNA in the intestine of juvenile Atlantic cod. The signaling pathways responsible for PepT 1 regulation still remains to be described...|$|E

Membrane operations are often confronted with challenges associated with periodic maintenance of membranes due to significant material build-up on the surfaces. Operational issues arising from scaling and fouling primarily include: increased membrane resistance, decreased permeate flow, increased energy requirement and decreased membrane life. These issues have been addressed by several researchers, in a limited way, by proposing better pre-treatment processes or by alternative membranes through experimental and modelling studies. However, there appears a need to change membrane secondary structures to alter the flow patterns associated with fluids within the membrane module. In spiral wound modules, net-type spacers are introduced to develop feed channel, by keeping the membrane surfaces apart. Presence of feed spacers generate secondary flow patterns within the membrane module which may lead to enhance mass transport of the solute away from the membrane to minimize concentration polarization, which is a desirable feature for efficient membrane operations. However, the undesirable features associated with their use are increased pressure drop and development of fluid stagnant zones. Therefore, the efficiency of a membrane module depends largely on the efficacy of the spacers to increase mass transport away from the membrane surface into the bulk fluid at moderate pressure loss. Literature review reveals that a number of experimental studies were conducted in past to shed light on the role of feed spacers in membrane modules. However, due to difficulty in applying flow visualization and measuring techniques in experimental studies, an in-depth understanding of the flow and concentration patterns generated within the modules was not possible. The flow visualization was made possible with the development of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques, but was restricted to two-dimensional analyses due to computational constraints and provided useful information regarding hydrodynamics prevailing in spacer filled narrow channels. With the ongoing developments in CFD techniques and computational resources three-dimensional studies are being conducted, which can provide in-depth analysis of concentration patterns and hydrodynamics in membrane modules. In this thesis three-dimensional modelling of flow through spacer filled narrow channels is carried out using CFD package ANSYS FLUENT to investigate the impact of feed spacer filament orientation on shear stress exerted on membrane surfaces and Power number. The impact of dimensionless filament spacing on mass transport, shear stress, pressure drop and friction factor is also investigated using a systematic approach by hooking a User Defined Function (UDF) to ANSYS FLUENT. The predicted results showed excellent agreement with the previous experimental and other numerical studies revealing that CFD predicts hydrodynamics and mass transport within feed channel of spacer obstructed membranes quite accurately. These investigations are new to membrane related studies which shed light on spacer impact on performance of RO operations. Post processing of the results revealed the complex flow patterns generated within the spacer filled narrow channels and showed that the alignment of the feed spacers with the flow direction have great influence on the generation of secondary flow patterns through the spacer filled channels. Pressure drop and Power number in spacer filled SWM appears to depend largely on the filament orientation based on current investigations. Pressure drop and power number will be higher if the filaments are inclined more towards the channel axis and vice versa. For ladder type spacers wall shear stress at the top membrane surface is always higher (approximately 3 to 8 times for the spacer arrangements considered in the study at Reh= 100) than that for the bottom wall, but interestingly the mass transfer coefficient values for the two walls are not significantly different for spacer arrangement having low to moderate bottom filament spacing (L 2 = 2 to 4). However, when the bottom filament spacing is further increased (L 2 = 6), there is a sharp decline in the pressure drop but the area weighted mass transfer coefficient for the top membrane wall showed a sharp reduction compared to the bottom membrane wall suggesting high fouling propensity of the top membrane wall which is not a desirable feature in membrane operations. Different spacer arrangements considered in this work are compared on the basis of Spacer Configuration Efficacy (SCE), which in this thesis is defined as the ratio of Sherwood number to Power number. Spacer having higher SEC values would lead to higher mass transport of the solute away from the membrane walls to the bulk of the solution at moderate pressure losses. It has been concluded by carrying out mass transfer simulations for different spacer arrangements that the spacer arrangement having top and bottom filament dimensionless ratio equal to 4 performs better than all the other considered arrangements for hydraulic Reynolds number up to 200. The results emanated out of the current study are considered to be of practical significance and could potentially lead to the development of efficient membrane modules with optimum spacer arrangements for RO operations...|$|E
