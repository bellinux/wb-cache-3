However, identifying and classifying the instruments remains a challenge {{due to the lack of}} artistic interpretations. For example, stringed instruments of uncertain design called nevals and asors existed, but neither archaeology nor etymology can clearly define them. In her book A Survey of Musical Instruments, American musicologist Sibyl Marcuse proposes that the nevel must be similar to vertical harp due to its relation to <b>nabla,</b> the Phoenician term for [...] "harp".|$|E

50|$|Del, or <b>nabla,</b> is an {{operator}} used in mathematics, {{in particular in}} vector calculus, as a vector differential operator, usually represented by the <b>nabla</b> symbol &nabla;. When applied to a function defined on a one-dimensional domain, it denotes its standard derivative as defined in calculus. When applied to a field (a function defined on a multi-dimensional domain), del may denote the gradient (locally steepest slope) of a scalar field (or sometimes of a vector field, as in the Navier-Stokes equations), the divergence of a vector field, or the curl (rotation) of a vector field, depending on {{the way it is}} applied.|$|E
5000|$|After {{receiving}} Smith's suggestion, Tait and James Clerk Maxwell {{referred to}} the operator as <b>nabla</b> in their extensive private correspondence; most of these references are of a humorous character. C. G. Knott's Life and Scientific Work of Peter Guthrie Tait: It was probably this reluctance {{on the part of}} Maxwell to use the term <b>Nabla</b> in serious writings which prevented Tait from introducing the word earlier than he did.
