5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa {{stays in}} a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>special</b> about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E

In his last years at {{university}} Verhoeven also attended classes at the Netherlands Film Academy.

Engel would later comment that he was glad Gayle had not followed his instructions.|$|E

25|$|Sammartino also {{wrestled}} NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz {{twice in}} Canada. One match {{ended in a}} draw {{and the other with}} Thesz scoring a fluke pin after a collision, despite Sammartino controlling the 20 minute match from the beginning. Like Thesz's win over Buddy Rogers, this match was booked by NWA kingpin Sam Muchnick as a preliminary to the forming of the WWWF, to ensure the dominance of the senior organization and its championship. Thesz recounted the matches as <b>nothing</b> <b>special.</b>|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the main}} C API of QuickTime {{where it is}} {{necessary}} to call MoviesTask in a loop to load a media file, DirectShow handles all of this in a transparent way. It creates several background threads that smoothly play the requested file or URL without much work required from the programmer. Also in contrast to QuickTime, <b>nothing</b> <b>special</b> is required for loading a URL instead of a local file on diskDirectShow's filter graph abstracts these details from the programmer, although recent developments in QuickTime (including an ActiveX control) have reduced this disparity.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{defended the}} Honinbo title once more, which {{would lead to}} him {{defending}} {{it again and again}} until 1999. He did terribly (in Cho terms) due to not making it through to the Meijin. In the same year, more international tournaments come to be. These include the Tong Yang Cup and the Fujitsu Cup. Cho wasn't very successful in these, winning only one in 1991, the Fujitsu Cup. He lucked out in the 1991 Fujitsu Cup because his opponent Qian Yuping had health issues to pay attention to and couldn't compete in the final. He lost the Judan once more and lost the play-off of the Kisei. His record looked better when he ended with 30 wins and 17 losses. 1992 was <b>nothing</b> <b>special.</b> The only events to note are his defending of the Honinbo and losing the semi-final of the Ing Cup. Remnants of the old Cho were coming back with his 31–16 record.|$|E
25|$|TS (transfer to storage): Store {{register}} A at {{the specified}} memory address. TS also detects, and corrects for, overflows {{in such a}} way as to propagate a carry for multi-precision add/subtract. If the result has no overflow (leftmost 2 bits of A the same), <b>nothing</b> <b>special</b> happens; if there is overflow (those 2 bits differ), the leftmost one goes the memory as the sign bit, register A is changed to +1 or −1 accordingly, and control skips to the second instruction following the TS. Whenever overflow is a possible but abnormal event, the TS was followed by a TC to the no-overflow logic; when it is a normal possibility (as in multi-precision add/subtract), the TS is followed by CAF ZERO (CAF = XCH to fixed memory) to complete the formation of the carry (+1, 0, or −1) into the next higher-precision word. Angles were kept in single precision, distances and velocities in double precision, and elapsed time in triple precision.|$|E

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>special</b> or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E

In December 2004, he was elected Commander of his local POW chapter, the Tidewater ex-POW Association. In 2008, he was also serving as the head of a Virginia state ex–POW association. Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples. Coker still has nightmares from his time as a POW. Reflecting on his wartime experiences in a Veterans Day tribute to POWs, he said [...] "If you're never tested, you don't know...You're capable of a great deal more than you realize, if you really set your mind to it.

According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger saw {{potential}} in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman {{felt that it was}} bland and <b>nothing</b> <b>special.</b> The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even remember the last time I saw something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E
500|$|Coming out of college, Bavaro {{was known}} mostly for his {{blocking}} ability and {{was expected to}} play the role of a run blocking tight end as a professional. He earned the nickname [...] "Rambo" [...] early in his rookie season due to his intense playing style, quiet personality, and physical resemblance to Sylvester Stallone. After starting tight end Zeke Mowatt suffered a season-ending injury before the start of the 1985 season, coach Bill Parcells, who had called Bavaro the most impressive rookie during training camp, installed Bavaro as the starter. Bavaro finished his rookie season with 37 receptions, 511yards, and 4 touchdowns. He also set a team record with 12 receptions in one game during quarterback Phil Simms' 513yard passing effort against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13, 1985.* [...] , databasefootball.com, accessed May 14, 2007. After the game, which the Giants lost 35–30, Bavaro responded in the low-key manner that would typify his career, [...] "t was <b>nothing</b> <b>special,</b> the plays were the same stuff. I don't know what they did. I just caught a lot of balls. I'd rather win, that's all." [...] Bavaro was named to the NFL All-Rookie team for his performance during the season.|$|E
