25|$|Milton {{attended}} {{church at}} All Hallows and {{was influenced by}} the minister Richard Stock, a Puritan who was anti-Catholic and emphasised the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible. In addition to his time at church, {{he spent most of his}} early life near St. Paul's Cathedral and was privately tutored. From the ages of 5 and 7, Milton was taught how to read and write in English and Latin, along with arithmetic. Milton was provided with several tutors between the ages of 7 and 12, but one in particular, Thomas Young, would prove influential. Young was a Scottish Presbyterian who had moved south, was highly educated and respected by his peers. Young's religious views affected Milton, and he adopted both Puritan appearances and ideas during his tutoring. Young was not the only major figure in Milton's early education; Milton acknowledged his father's care in teaching him many languages, including French, Italian, and Hebrew.|$|E
25|$|The Wii U GamePad was {{described}} as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the TV screen while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface.|$|E

Several lines, including [...] "Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves" [...] and [...] "The next will be chemical but they will never learn", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est.

2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways.

Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different.

30|$|The above {{performance}} {{result is}} {{perhaps because of}} the effective optimization in the use of global memory by minimizing the number of memory transactions. In both the naive version and the CDP version, each thread <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the coordinates of all data points; in other words, the coordinates of all data points are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>read</b> n times, where n is the number of predication points. In contrast, the coordinates of all data points are only <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>read</b> (n/threadsPerBlock) times due to accepting the optimization strategy “tiling”. Thus, there are much more global memory accesses in both the naive and the CDP versions than that in the tiled version. And the impact of optimizing the use of global memory by minimizing the number of transactions on a larger number of global memory accesses is obviously more significant than that on a smaller number of global memory accesses.|$|R
