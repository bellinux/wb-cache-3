50|$|An {{anti-ballistic missile}} is a missile {{which can be}} {{deployed}} to counter an incoming <b>nuclear</b> <b>or</b> <b>non-nuclear</b> ICBM. ICBMs can be intercepted in three regions of their trajectory: boost phase, mid-course phase or terminal phase. Currently the US, Russia, France, India and Israel have developed anti-ballistic missile systems, of which the Russian A-135 anti-ballistic missile system, US Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, Systems {{have the capability to}} intercept ICBMs carrying nuclear, chemical, biological, or conventional warheads.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} nuclear {{non-proliferation}} emerged after the Second World war {{when the world}} saw the disaster caused by the atomic bomb. A number of plans were discussed and an international consensus was reached on a treaty for controlling {{the spread of nuclear}} weapons in the world. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) was not initially signed by many states but gradually received universally acceptability. States entered into the treaty as either <b>nuclear</b> weapon <b>or</b> <b>non-nuclear</b> weapon states. Three non-signatory states were India, Pakistan and Israel Located in Asia. The thrust of US nuclear non-proliferation policy was in South Asia where two major non-signatory states were situated bordering each other. India reached the level of a nuclear power in 1947 while Pakistan started its program about the same time. The US initially pressurized Pakistan to stop its nuclear program but the situation changed after the Soviet military intervention of Afghanistan in 1979. Until the late eighties, the US exempted Pakistan from all restrictions and supplied significant military aid. After 1990, it reverted back to its strict policy towards Pakistan. During the same period, it continued to neglect Indian nuclear program in order to bring India closer to the US and away from the Soviet Union. This dissertation is an attempt to highlight important events of theUS nuclear non-proliferation policy towards India and Pakistan in the period 1947 - 1990. The purpose of this research is to compare the US policy towards these two countries and to demonstrate its uneven and contradictory approach as far as the issue of nuclear non-proliferation is concerned...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Estrogen	action	is	mediated	through	several	types	of	receptors	(ERs),	 such	as	ERα,	 ERβ	and	putative	membrane ERs. Oxytocin	receptor	(OTR) 	 and	ER	expression	levels	in	the	rat	uterus	are	regulated	by	estrogen;	 however,	 which	types	of ERs are	involved	has	not	been	elucidated. This	study	examined	OTR,	 ERα	and	ERβ	levels	in	ovariectomized	rats	treated	with 17 β-estradiol (E 2),	 an	ERα	agonist	(PPT),	 an	ERβ	agonist	(DPN) 	 or	estren	(Es). 	E 2 	and	PPT	increased	OTR	mRNA	levels and decreased	ERα	and	ERβ	mRNA	levels	 3 	and	 6 	h	posttreatment. DPN	decreased	ERα	and	ERβ	mRNA	levels	at	 3 	and	 6 	h, while OTR	mRNA	levels	increased	at	 3 	h	and	decreased	at	 6 	h. 	OTR	mRNA	levels	increased	 3 	h	after	the	Es	treatment	and then declined	until	 6 	h. 	ERα	and	ERβ	mRNA	levels	decreased	by	 3 	h	and	remained	low	until	 6 	h	posttreatment	with	Es. 	The ER antagonist	ICI 182, 780 	(ICI) 	 suppressed	the	increases	in	OTR	mRNA	levels	induced	 3 	h	after	the	Es	treatment. However, ICI and	tamoxifen	(Tam) 	 had	no	significant	effect	on	ERα	and	ERβ	mRNA	levels	in	the	Es-treated	or	vehicle-treated	group. In intact rats,	 proestrus-associated	increases	in	OTR	mRNA	levels	were	antagonized	by	both	ICI	and	Tam. However,	 {{decreases}} in ERα	and	ERβ	mRNA	levels	were	not	antagonized	by	Tam	and	ICI,	 respectively. Therefore,	 uterine	OTR	gene	expression	is upregulated by	estrogen	through	the	classical	<b>nuclear</b>	(<b>or</b>	<b>non-nuclear)</b> 	 ERs,	 ERα	and	ERβ,	 while	the	levels	of	these	ERs	are downregulated by	estrogen	through	multiple	pathways	including	Es-sensitive	nonclassical	ERs...|$|E

40|$|We use the {{extensive}} public archive of ROSAT High Resolution Imager (HRI) observations {{to carry out}} a statistical investigation of the X-ray properties of nearby galaxies. Specifically we focus on the sample of 486 bright (B_T 10 ks) exposure. The X-ray sources detected within the optical extent of each galaxy are categorised as either <b>nuclear</b> <b>or</b> <b>non-nuclear</b> depending on whether the source is positioned within or outside of a 25 arcsecond radius circle centred on the optical nucleus. A nuclear X-ray source is detected in over 70 % of the galaxies harbouring either a Seyfert or LINER nucleus compared to a detection rate of only ~ 40 % in less active systems. The correlation of the H alpha luminosity with nuclear X-ray luminosity previously observed in QSOs and bright Seyfert 1 galaxies appears to extend down into the regime of ultra-low luminosity (L(x) ~ 10 ^ 38 - 10 ^ 40 erg/s) active galactic nuclei (AGN). The inferred accretion rates for this sample of low-luminosity AGN are significantly sub-Eddington. In total 142 non-nuclear sources were detected. In combination with published data for M 31 this leads to a luminosity distribution (normalised to an optical blue luminosity of L(B) = 10 ^ 10 L(solar)) for the discrete X-ray source population in spiral galaxies of the form dN/dL 38 = 1. 0 +/- 0. 2 L 38 ^- 1. 8, where L 38 is the X-ray luminosity in units of 10 ^ 38 erg/s. The implied L(x) /L(B) ratio is ~ 1. 1 x 10 ^ 39 erg/s/(10 ^ 10 L(solar)). The nature of the substantial number of ``super-luminous'' non-nuclear objects detected in the survey is discussed.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies have {{concluded}} that the United States is vulnerable to attack from terrorists armed {{with weapons of mass destruction}} (WMD). Depending on the circumstances, a terrorist attack with <b>nuclear</b> <b>or</b> radiological weapons could cause more destruction and casualties than one with other types of WMD. Four strategies for improving U. S. capabilities to counter <b>nuclear</b> <b>or</b> radiological terrorism are often proposed: (1) to improve intelligence capabilities to gain better knowledge of terrorist intentions and capabilities; (2) to improve security measures in nuclear facilities throughout the former Soviet Union (FSU) and elsewhere, so terrorists will have more difficulty acquiring nuclear materials; (3) to deter terrorists from conducting <b>nuclear</b> <b>or</b> radiological attacks, particularly in the United States; and (4) to improve America's response capabilities to terrorists that have already acquired <b>nuclear</b> <b>or</b> radiological weapons. This thesis evaluates current U. S. capabilities and activities in each of these areas and provides recommendations for improving America's counter-terrorism strategies to defend against terrorists armed with <b>nuclear</b> <b>or</b> radiological weapons.
