6000|$|... "'Cause I don't {{think it}} would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> God before strangers, Anne. Dora can say hers to Mrs. Lynde if she likes, but I won't. I'll wait till she's gone and then say 'em. Won't that be all right, Anne?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{she lived}} at Simla, the summer {{capital city of}} the British Raj, when in India. It was there that she entertained E. M. Forster in 1912. He noted a {{characteristic}} ambivalence in her manner, saying that she was [...] "clever and odd - times very (crossed out) <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> alone, but at times the Social Manner descended like a pall".|$|R
5000|$|Tyson is {{mentioned}} in the third verse of Nas' original It Ain't Hard to Tell demo, in the line: [...] "Move like a maniac, Nas is <b>nice</b> son, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your conscience and hit like Tyson" ...|$|R
5000|$|Odd shows {{followed}} in 2002 through 2005, which {{eventually led to}} a brand new studio album, <b>Nice</b> <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> Me, released on September 13, 2005. The single [...] "Can't Kick the Habit" [...] was included on the soundtrack to the movie Grandma's Boy. It received moderate radio airplay, along with the songs [...] "Margarita" [...] and the title track [...] "Nice Talking to Me". While the record received good reviews, follow-up proved difficult when the record company that released it went out of business.|$|E
50|$|White {{quit the}} Spin Doctors in 1999 and the bass tracks on Here Comes the Bride were {{completed}} by Comess. Soon after, the band stopped touring because Barron suffered from vocal fold paresis. In 2001, Barron and Schenkmen put aside their differences for a one-time {{show at the}} historic venue the Wetlands before it closed permanently. White joined them for this reunion, which gradually turned into an unofficial reunion tour. This {{marked the beginning of}} the band's reformation. The reunited Spin Doctors went on to release the albums <b>Nice</b> <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> Me in 2005 and If the River Was Whiskey in 2013 through RuffNation Records.|$|E
5000|$|Dust to Dust is {{an album}} by former 3rd Bass members, Pete Nice (Prime Minister Pete Nice) and DJ Richie Rich (Daddy Rich). The album was {{released}} on July 13, 1993 for Def Jam Recordings and was produced by Pete Nice, DJ Richie Rich, KMD and Psycho Les. Dust to Dust was released {{a year after the}} breakup of 3rd Bass and featured many disses toward their former bandmate MC Serch. Dust to Dust found limited success, peaking at #171 on the Billboard 200, #50 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and #3 on the Top Heatseekers. Two singles were released: [...] "Rat Bastard" [...] and [...] "Kick The Bobo," [...] both apparent disses against former bandmate MC Serch. The video for [...] "Rat Bastard" [...] starts out as a recreation of a scene from the 1987 film The Untouchables, with Pete Nice beating an MC Serch lookalike to death with a baseball bat. The video for [...] "Kick the Bobo" [...] starts out as a recreation of a scene from the 1983 film Scarface, with Pete <b>Nice</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a Tony Montana lookalike. This album also marks the professional debut of Indie Rap artist, Cage Kennylz. The album is now out of print.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth Compton {{was about}} to protest, but there was {{something}} about the way in which the stranger went at the job that indicated that he would probably finish it if he wished to, in spite of any arguments she could advance to the contrary. As he worked she talked with him, discovering not only that he was a rather nice person to look at, but that he was equally <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For Record Store Day, [...] "Mirror in the Bathroom" [...] and [...] "Too <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> To" [...] {{are getting}} re-released as a limited edition 7".|$|R

6000|$|... 'You are a <b>nice</b> fellow <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{of flying}} off, Steerforth, who are always running wild on some unknown {{expedition}} or other!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A <b>nice</b> way <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{your sister}} when {{you may be}} dead in an hour's time!" [...] {{retorted}} Felicity, in tears between her anger and her real alarm about Dan.|$|R
6000|$|... "A <b>nice</b> way <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your father," [...] Old Man Tarwater censured mildly. [...] "My father'd have walloped the tar {{out of me}} with a single-tree if I'd {{spoke to}} him that way." ...|$|R
5000|$|The single was re-released on 21 April 2012 for Record Store Day 2012 as {{a limited}} edition 750 run of 7" [...] copies. Its B-side is [...] "Too <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> To".|$|R
6000|$|... "Very much, in a way," [...] was the {{somewhat}} hesitating reply. [...] "Of course, nothing really counts until Dick comes back, {{but it is}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with some one who knows him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no, {{perhaps not}} exactly that," [...] I said; [...] "but I think it much jollier--much more pleasant, I mean--to {{have some very}} <b>nice</b> person <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to." ...|$|R
6000|$|That season {{came up to}} Simla one {{of these}} crazy people with only a single idea. These are the men who make things move; {{but they are not}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> This man's name was Mellish, and he had lived for fifteen years on land of his own, in Lower Bengal, {{studying}} cholera. He held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool-flake. The germ could be rendered sterile, he said, by 'Mellish's Own Invincible Fumigatory'--a heavy violet-black powder--' the result of fifteen years' scientific investigation, Sir!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true, {{she was a}} waitress," [...] Granser acknowledged. [...] "But {{she was a good}} woman, {{and your}} mother was her daughter. Women were very scarce {{in the days after the}} Plague. She was the only wife I could find, even if she was a hash-slinger, as your father calls it. But it is not <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about our {{progenitors}} that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|She begged that {{he might}} come after church on All Saints' day. He came, and after his first {{greeting}} of peace, Mrs. Edmonstone signed to him to read at once, instead of speaking to her. The beautiful lesson for the day overcame Mrs. Edmonstone {{so much that she}} was obliged to go out of Amabel's sight, but as the words were read, Amy's face recovered once more the serenity that had been swept away by the sight of the flowers. Peace had returned, and when the calm every-day words of the service were over, {{she held out her hand}} to Mr. Ross, and said, 'Thank you, that was very <b>nice.</b> Now <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Garland's {{daughter}} Lorna Luft, {{who wrote}} her own Garland biography, criticized Clarke's book. [...] "I didn't {{like that one}} at all. If you're {{going to write a}} biography of somebody, it'd be <b>nice</b> if you'd <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> their family. The man never picked up a phone and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me. Then he had the nerve, when I said certain things weren't right in it, to say I wouldn't know. He never spoke to me." [...] Clarke claimed that none of Garland's children cooperated with him.|$|R
50|$|Stranded prepositions {{can also}} arise in passive voice constructions and other uses of passive past participial phrases, where the {{complement}} in a prepositional phrase can become zero {{in the same}} way that a verb's direct object would: it was looked at; I will be operated on; get your teeth seen to. The same can happen in certain uses of infinitive phrases: he is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to; this is the page to make copies of.|$|R
6000|$|... "If this cruise don't end {{pretty soon}} {{we shall have}} a reg'lar cripples' crew aboard. Here's me, who come from the Mary Walker; you, that never belonged to any craft; the old Bonita, with nobody to work her; Bob, as a remnant of the Trade Wind, an' now another feller with a sinkin' tug. It's a <b>nice</b> crowd <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about salvage when they can't help theirselves!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Beat, {{consisting}} of Dave Wakeling (vocals, guitar), Ranking Roger (vocals), Andy Cox (guitar), David Steele (bass), Everett Morton (drums), and Saxa a.k.a. Lionel Augustus Martin (saxophone), released three studio albums {{in the early}} 1980s: I Just Can't Stop It (1980), Wha'ppen? (1981) and Special Beat Service (1982), {{and a string of}} singles, including [...] "Mirror in the Bathroom", [...] "Too <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> To", [...] "Can't Get Used to Losing You", [...] "Hands Off, She's Mine" [...] and [...] "All Out to Get You".|$|R
50|$|Dolores {{returns to}} Morgans {{house and the}} two {{sit down and talk}} again. The {{conversation}} turns to the topic of Dolores getting an abortion and while initially defensive against Morgan, Dolores becomes touched by her advice and opinions. Stating that she does {{not have the right to}} govern Dolores' actions, Morgan also notes that she believes Dolores doesn't truly want to get rid of her baby. In return, Dolores asks about Constantinople and what Morgan was feeling. Morgan admits it is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about him and the two share an intimate embrace.|$|R
5000|$|Carlisle {{signed with}} Mercury Records and {{continued}} to release novelty song hits in the 1950s, such as [...] "Too Old to Cut the Mustard", a top ten country hit in 1951 later covered by artists including Rosemary Clooney. Other hits included the number one smash [...] "No Help Wanted" [...] (their biggest) and the top ten [...] "Taint <b>Nice</b> (<b>To</b> <b>Talk</b> Like That)", both 1953. That year the Carlisles were {{invited to join the}} Grand Ole Opry. In the mid-1950s, Carlisle was a regular performer on ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee.|$|R
60|$|Professor Calderwood {{has such}} an {{exceptional}} {{interest in his}} students that he asks {{every one of them}} to his house. This is but one of many things that makes him generally popular; he also invites his ladies' class to meet them. The lady whom you take down to supper suggests Proposition 41 as a <b>nice</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, and asks what you think of the metaphysics of ethics. Professor Calderwood sees the ladies into the cabs himself. It is the only thing I ever heard against him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can only}} stay a moment, my dear; your papa is coming up; but I must {{just tell you}} that I have been having such a <b>nice</b> <b>talk</b> with dear Guy. He has behaved beautifully, and papa is quite satisfied. Now, darling, I hope you will not lie awake all night, or you won't be fit <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him to-morrow.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What a Feeling" [...] is an up-tempo song. It {{features}} vocals from Kelly Rowland. It {{was written}} by Gaudino, Giuseppe D'Albenzio, Jenson Vaughan, Emmanuel Mijares, Rowland and Joseph [...] "Lonny" [...] Bereal. In {{an interview with the}} News of the Worlds Dan Wootton, Gaudino spoke of how amazing it was to work with Rowland on the song. [...] "Kelly's an amazing artist, so down to earth, <b>nice</b> and fierce. <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> her you feel on the same level whoever you are." [...] Rowland replied, during an interview on the video shoot, to questions {{about what it was like}} working with Gaudino. She said [...] "I'm so excited to be collaborating together for the first time. He is the nicest person and so talented." ...|$|R
5000|$|What Is Beat? - The Best of The Beat is a {{greatest}} hits album by the ska band The Beat released in 1983. The original vinyl release included an additional [...] "free album" [...] of extended remixes entitled Frebe. Several songs had previously only been released as singles and B-sides. These include [...] "Too <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> To", [...] "March of the Swivelheads" [...] and [...] "Psychedelic Rockers".

The song accompanies the film's climax. The question of the album's title was answered {{on the back of}} the original sleeve, [...] "This is Beat!!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I don't mean {{to stay at}} home {{any longer}} than I can help; only it's no good going out into life"--this phrase she often used--"till you know where you are. In my profession, one has to be so careful. Of course, people think it's worse than it is; father gets fits sometimes. But you know, Mrs. Fiorsen, home's awful. We have mutton--you know what mutton is--it's really awful in your bedroom in hot weather. And there's nowhere to practise. What I should like would be a studio. It would be lovely, somewhere down by the river, or up here near you. That WOULD be lovely. You know, I'm putting by. As soon as ever I have two hundred pounds, I shall skip. What I think would be {{perfectly}} lovely would be to inspire painters and musicians. I don't want to be just a common 'turn'--ballet business year after year, and that; I want to be something rather special. But mother's so silly about me; she thinks I oughtn't to take any risks at all. I shall never get on that way. It IS so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, Mrs. Fiorsen, because you're young enough to know what I feel; and I'm sure you'd never be shocked at anything. You see, about men: Ought one to marry, or ought one to take a lover? They say you can't be a perfect artist till you've felt passion. But, then, if you marry, that means mutton over again, and perhaps babies, and perhaps the wrong man after all. Ugh! But then, on the other hand, I don't want to be raffish. I hate raffish people--I simply hate them. What do you think? It's awfully difficult, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's so <b>nice,</b> Bertie, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> {{somebody}} who really takes a sensible view {{about this man}} Glossop. Mother says he's a good chap, which is simply absurd. Anybody can see that he's absolutely impossible. He's conceited and opinionative and argues all the time, even when he knows perfectly well that he's talking through his hat, and he smokes too much and eats too much and drinks too much, and I don't like the colour of his hair. Not that he'll have any hair {{in a year or}} two, because he's pretty thin on the top already, and before he knows where he is he'll be as bald as an egg, and he's the last man who can afford to go bald. And I think it's simply disgusting, the way he gorges all the time. Do you know, I found him in the larder at one o'clock this morning, absolutely wallowing in a steak-and-kidney pie? There was hardly any of it left. And you remember what an enormous dinner he had. Quite disgusting, I call it. But I can't stop out here all night, talking about men who aren't worth wasting a word on and haven't even enough sense to tell sharks from flatfish. I'm going in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{there any}} limit, I wonder, to the brutish stupidity of some men? I thought I had {{discovered}} Armadale's limit when I was his neighbor in Norfolk; but my later experience at Naples shows me that I was wrong. He is perpetually {{in and out}} of this house (crossing over to us in a boat from the hotel at Santa Lucia, where he sleeps); and he has exactly two subjects of conversation--the yacht for sale in the harbor here, and Miss Milroy. Yes! he selects ME as the confidante of his devoted attachment to the major's daughter! 'It's so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a woman about it!' That is all the apology he has thought it necessary to make for appealing to my sympathies--my sympathies!--on the subject of 'his darling Neelie,' fifty times a day. He is evidently persuaded (if he thinks about it at all) that I have forgotten, as completely as he has forgotten, all that once passed between us when I was first at Thorpe Ambrose. Such an utter want of the commonest delicacy and the commonest tact, in a creature who is, to all appearance, possessed of a skin, and not a hide, and who does, unless my ears deceive me, talk, and not bray, is really quite incredible when one comes to think of it. But it is, for all that, quite true. He asked me--he actually asked me, last night--how many hundreds a year the wife of a rich man could spend on her dress. 'Don't put it too low,' the idiot added, with his intolerable grin. 'Neelie shall be one of the best-dressed women in England when I have married her.' And this to me, after having had him at my feet, and then losing him again through Miss Milroy! This to me, with an alpaca gown on, and a husband whose income must be helped by a newspaper! ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} For Friends & Colleagues Volume II: Reflections on My Profession, Mark Dvoretsky {{described}} [...] "There {{is an excellent}} trainer Vladimir Grabinsky in Lvov, who has brought up a number of leading Ukrainian young players. Some of them are grandmasters now, the most well-known being Andrey Volokitin. Grabinsky’s approach to chess is not dissimilar to my own. We had a <b>nice</b> <b>talk</b> discussing various training problems. In most cases, our opinions were the same, though we had our differences too. I felt {{from the very start}} that I was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a professional of the highest level." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed you are, then!" [...] {{her mother}} retorted. [...] "Do you think I would leave you {{here all day}} with that fellow? A <b>nice</b> <b>talk</b> we should make!" ...|$|R
