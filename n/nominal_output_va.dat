40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{monetary}} changes on the U. S. economy. The emphasis is on establishing a causal flow from the money supply (nominal variable) to the two components of <b>nominal</b> <b>output</b> [...] the price level and real output (real variable).

This impact is positive with respect to both of these variables. ...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical discussions {{involving}} {{the relationship between}} the money supply and an economy 2 ̆ 7 s output has dominated the field of monetary economics for many years. Theoretically, the resolution of two separate issues is crucial - (1) the question of causality in the money-income relationship and (2) the effects of monetary changes on the two components of nominal output; i. e., the price level and real output. Two major opposing views can readily be identified: the monetarist view and the keynesian view. The monetarists 2 ̆ 7 view is based on the postulates of the Quantity Theory of Money. In their view, the money supply is exogenously determined. Furthermore, according to the monetarists, there exists a direct causal flow from money to <b>nominal</b> <b>output.</b> 3 Consequently, changes in the money supply dominate movements in <b>nominal</b> <b>output.</b> Some monetarists allow for a feedback from <b>nominal</b> <b>output</b> to the money supply, but even then, monetary changes are considered the major factors determining nominal Qutput...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{study how}} {{fluctuations}} in money growth correlate with fluctuations in real and <b>nominal</b> <b>output</b> growth and inflation. We pick cycles from each time series that last 2 to 8 (business cycles) and 8 to 40 (longer-term cycles) years, using band-pass filters. We employ a data set from 1880 to 2001 for eleven countries, without gaps. Fluctuations in money growth do {{not play a}} systematic and important role at the business cycle frequency. However, money growth leads or contemporaneously affects <b>nominal</b> <b>output</b> growth and inflation in the longer run. This result holds despite differences in policies and institutions across countries. JEL Classification: E 32 to 8 year cycles, 8 to 40 year cycles, Band-pass filters...|$|R
50|$|It {{depends on}} the {{technical}} state of the engine, especially of the injection system. The typical Diesel / Gas ratio is 40/60% for the high-speed engines. If the operating {{output of the engine}} is constant and between 70-80% of <b>nominal</b> <b>output,</b> than it is possible to reach up to 30/70% ratio. If the operating output is lower (for example 50% of the <b>nominal</b> <b>output)</b> or if there are variations, the rate is about 45/55% (more of diesel is used).For Low Speed conversions it is possible to reach the Diesel/gas ratio up to 10/90%. Generally, {{it is not possible to}} guarantee an exact diesel/gas ratio without a test being done after the conversion.|$|R

5000|$|All {{electrochemical}} cell batteries deliver a changing voltage as their chemistry changes from [...] "charged" [...] to [...] "discharged". A <b>nominal</b> <b>output</b> voltage and a cutoff voltage are typically specified for a battery by its manufacturer. The output voltage {{falls to the}} cutoff voltage when the battery becomes [...] "discharged". The <b>nominal</b> <b>output</b> voltage is always less than the open-circuit voltage produced when the battery is [...] "charged". The temperature of a battery can affect the power it can deliver, where lower temperatures reduce power. Total energy delivered from a single charge cycle is affected by both the battery temperature and the power it delivers. If the temperature lowers or the power demand increases, the total energy delivered {{at the point of}} [...] "discharge" [...] is also reduced.|$|R
