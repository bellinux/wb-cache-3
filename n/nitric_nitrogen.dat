Through the {{experiment}} of different Irrigation Amounts with urea applied, the paper studied {{the influence of}} Irrigation Amounts on soil <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> dynamical changes under film hole irrigation and the <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content of the growing period was determined. The result showed: different irrigation amount in the profiles being 3 cm and 8 cm away from the film hole center, it appeared <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> accumulation peaks, increased the irrigation amount promoted the transformation of urea, increased the transformed <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content and distribution of nitric nitrate {{and the risk of}} nitric nitrate leaching. In the profiles being 3 cm away from the film hole center, the <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> accumulation peak significantly reduced at harvest stage, but it reduced in the profiles being 8 cm away from the film hole center at milky stage. The milky stage was the maximum period when the corn uptook nitrogen at different irrigation amount. Increased irrigation amount lower the accumulation content of <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> near the film hole center after harvest, and higher the accumulation content of <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> far away from the film hole center.

This observation allows us to conclude that organic phosphorus is not very important in these soils; intensive crops prefer the storage of phosphorus in mineral form (Brossard and Laurent 1988). Nitric and ammoniacal nitrogen is unstable. For Oued Besbes and Sebkha, the NO 3 − values are largely superior to those of NH 4 +. This is the phenomenon of the nitrification process which is the consumption of ammonium by microbial activity in soil and its transformation into <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> For the other points, there is a phenomenon of denitrification where <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is transformed into nitric gas N 2.|$|E

40|$|Adaptation of {{agricultural}} practices according to {{requirements of the}} Nitrates Directive and validation through nitrates leaching follow up thanks to lysimeters. Since six years <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> lixiviation is followed in six fields located in a silty area in Hesbaye (Belgium), mainly dedicated to vegetable crops. Open-field lysimeters are used, with the aim not to impede agricultural operations. These lysimeters allow the quantitative follow-up of the nitrate lixiviation below the root zone. The aims of the project are the setting up of better agricultural practices with regard to water quality on the one hand, and the adjustement of fertilization advice and {{the assessment of the}} impacts on yields, nitrogen remainder, and nitrate concentration in the water collected {{at the bottom of the}} lysimeter on the other hand.

Finally, individual yields on the different subparcels are quantified to take the economic impact of the agricultural practices modification into account. During this test, the impact of a fertilization level reduction was just observed on the yields during double vegetable growing, only on the second crop.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} Alfisols in South-West France to assess the agronomic and environmental impacts of a single application of heat-dried sludge pellets at 11. 1 Mg dry matter ha- 1. The sludge pellets, with a moisture level of 9. 5 %, were spread on an irrigated crop of maize (Zea mays L.). This treatment was compared with inorganic fertilization (urea and diammonium phosphate mixed with KCl). Soil properties, yield and the composition of maize {{and the quality of}} drained water were monitored over 1 year to detect any changes resulting from sludge application. Amongst several determined soil properties, only two were significantly modified by the sludge application: The <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> stock of the soil was higher in the inorganic fertilized plot, whereas Olsen-P soil content was higher in the sludge-amended plot. Agronomic recovery rates of N and P added by sludge were high: For the first crop following application, total amounts of N and P supplied by the sludge had the same efficiency as approximately 45 % of the N and P amounts supplied by inorganic fertilizer. This ratio was 7 % for the N uptake by the second maize crop. The quality and quantity of maize were equally good with both types of fertilization. During the 2 years following sludge spreading, N leaching remained as low in the sludged plot as in the inorganically fertilized one. The Cu, Zn, Cr, Cd, Pb and Ni composition of the drainage water was affected by neither of the types of amendment.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a constructed surface flow wetland in reducing diffuse N pollution coming from croplands is being investigated in an ongoing experiment, begun in 1998 in NE Italy. The 0. 32 ha wetland is vegetated with Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. and Typha latifolia (L.). It receives drainage water from 6 ha of land managed for an experiment on drainage systems, where maize, sugarbeet, winter wheat and soybean are cultivated. During the period 1998 – 2002, the wetland received from 4698 to 8412 mm of water per year (on average, about 9 times the environmental rainfall); its water regimen was discontinuous and flooding occurred on a variable number of days per year (from 13 to 126). <b>Nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{was the most important}} form of element load. Its concentration in the inflow water over time was rather discontinuous, with median values ranging from 0. 2 (in 2001) to 4. 5 (in 2000) mg L− 1. Inflow nitric N concentrations were occasionally in the 5 – 15 mg L− 1 range. Concentrations reduced passing through the wetland, with a more evident effect in the last year. Over 5 years, the wetland received slightly more than 2000 kg ha− 1 of nitrogen, 87 % in nitric form mostly from farmland drainage. The remaining 13 % of N was applied as organic slurry directly onto the wetland, with 5 distributions during 1998 to assess wetland performance in treating occasional organic loads.

40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} soil element content {{determination}} based on laboratory analyses are costly and time-consuming. A soil reflectance spectrum {{is an alternative}} approach for soil element content estimation with {{the advantage of being}} rapid, non-destructive, and cost effective. Visible/near-infrared spectra (350 nm to 2500 nm) were measured from 105 soil samples originating from 30 apple orchards on the jiaodong peninsula. The Savitzky-Golay (FD-SG) technique for spectral data was implemented to reduce the signal noise. Logarithm of the reciprocal of reflectance (logR(- 1)) and the first derivative transformation (DR) were used to accentuate the features and to prepare the data for use in quantitative estimation models. The SI (sum index), DI (difference index), PI (product index), RI (ratio index), and NDI (normalized difference index) were calculated to extract sensitive waveband combinations that are significantly related to soil element contents. Soil element contents were retrieved based on sensitive waveband combinations by multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) and partial least square (PLSR) models. The results showed that DR performed better than logR- 1 in eliminating the interfering factors of soil particle size and spectral noise. The MLSR and PLSR calibration models based on PI performed better than those based on SI or DI did. The MLSR performed better than PLSR in estimating soil elemental content. The contents of total nitrogen (TN), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) could be estimated well using MLSR and PLSR calibration models developed with PI. The MLSR calibration-model developed with PI performed well in estimating available potassium (A-K) content. However, the contents of available phosphorus (A-P), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 +-N), <b>nitric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (NO 3 [...] N), and soil organic matter (SOM) could not be estimated using MLSR or PISR calibration models. These outcomes will provide the theoretical basis and technical support for estimations of soil element content using visible/near-infrared spectra. Although they were shown to be useful in apple orchards of the jiaodong peninsula, these models and methods should be further tested in soil samples from other regions and countries to prove their validity.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the livestock sector in North-East Italy directly affects water (nitrates accumulation and eutrophication). Through the “Nitrate Directive” (91 / 676 /EEC), the EU aims to reduce water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources. Disposal of animal wastewater is a common problem among local farmers. Land spreading is the usual disposal method but requires sufficient land area {{in close proximity to}} the farm. Problems associate with animal wastewater treatment and land application has prompted an urgency to find alternative treatment systems that are technically feasible and economically viable. Hybrid constructed wetlands (HCW) are being considered as an alternative method for livestock wastewater disposal which could reduce the amount of land necessary for terminal land application. This work presents the results of monitoring a full-scale hybrid wetland system operating on a swine farm. The HCW system was composed of three vertical-subsurface flow wetlands (VF) in parallel with a total area of 30 m 2, followed by one horizontal-subsurface flow wetland (HF) connected in series (100 m 2). During the experimentation (2010 - 2012), HCW operated under different conditions: seasonal variations (temperature), pollutants concentrations, hydraulic loading rate (HLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), feeding mode and operational regimes. During the first period (April 2010 -July 2010) the system was loaded with 5 m 3 /d of pre-treated piggery wastewater and VF system worked like a “biological filter”. During the second period (October 2010 -April 2011), the system was loaded with 5 m 3 /d of raw piggery wastewater, a sequential batch (feed-stay-drain-rest) feed mode in VF system was used. To determine if winter climate conditions influence treatment effectiveness, during the third period (May 2011 -July 2012) the system was loaded with 1. 7 m 3 /d of synthetic wastewater. VF system was fed with sequential batch mode with two different operational regimes.
