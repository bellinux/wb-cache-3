As required by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) must prioritize transit projects for funding by evaluating, rating, and recommending projects on the basis of specific financial commitment and project justification criteria, such as cost-effectiveness, economic development effects, land use, and environmental benefits.

This testimony discusses the (1) key challenges associated with the <b>New</b> <b>Starts</b> program and (2) options that could help expedite project development in the <b>New</b> <b>Starts</b> program.

Already famous for having written Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), Stowe came to Florida after the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865). She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a <b>new</b> <b>start</b> in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year.

After completing his injury rehab in his native Australia, Kisnorbo returned to pre-season training for Leeds United a week later than his team mates. After returning from his long injury lay off, and proving his fitness, Kisnorbo signed a new two-year contract at Leeds on 10 July. Kisnorbo revealed he wouldn't be wearing his iconic head bandage for the 2011–12 season as he wanted it to represent a <b>new</b> <b>start</b> for him. Kisnorbo scored the opening goal in the pre-season friendly victory against Newcastle United. Kisnorbo started for Leeds on the opening day of the season as they suffered a 3–1 defeat against Southampton.

The <b>New</b> <b>Starts</b> program serves as an important source of federal funding for the design and construction of transit projects throughout the country. SAFETEA-LU requires GAO to report each year on FTA's <b>New</b> <b>Starts</b> process. As such, GAO examined (1) the number of projects that were evaluated, rated, and proposed for FFGAs for the fiscal year 2007 evaluation cycle and the proposed funding commitments for the fiscal year 2007 budget; (2) procedural changes that FTA proposed for the <b>New</b> <b>Starts</b> program beginning with the fiscal year 2008 evaluation cycle; and (3) changes SAFETEA-LU made to the <b>New</b> <b>Starts</b> program and FTA's implementation of these changes.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) authorized a significant level of investment [...] over $ 52 billion [...] for federal transit programs.
