The method {{is applied to the}} tall-grass prairie of the 16 x 16 sq km FIFE site (First ISLSCP Field Experiment) of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project.

Linear regression equations relating potential evapotranspiration and pan evaporation were derived for five stations in Arizona from January to December, 1983. Five climatological models (temperature, temperature-radiation, <b>net</b> <b>radiation,</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> and Penman combination) were applied to data collected from Mesa, Tucson (Campus Agricultural Center and UA 1), Oracle Agricultural Center, and Yuma. At each site high correlations were found between predicted values and open pan evaporation when data were grouped into monthly and weekly periods, although coefficients of variation were markedly different. Of the five methods, the net radiation equation, which required local calibration showed the poorest agreement between the empirical and measured values.

Glaciers in {{northern}} and southern Norway are subject to different daily and seasonal cycles of incoming solar radiation, which is presumably reflected {{in the importance of}} <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in their surface energy balance. We present a 3 year continuous record from an automatic weather station in the ablation zone of the ice cap Langfjordjøkelen, one of the most northerly glaciers of mainland Norway. Despite its location at 708 N, Langfjordjøkelen was found to have a maritime climate, with an annual mean air temperature of – 1. 08 C, frequent cloud cover and end-of-winter snow depths over 3 m in all three years. The main melt season was May–October, but occasional melt events occurred on warm, cloudy winter days. Net solar and longwave radiation together accounted for 58 % of the melt energy, with a positive contribution by net longwave radiation (7 %). The sensible and latent heat fluxes supplied the remainder of the melt energy. Cloud optical thickness over Langfjordjøkelen was larger than on two glaciers in southern Norway, especially in the summer months. This resulted in a smaller contribution of <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> to surface melt on Langfjordjøkelen; the effect of the higher latitude on <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> was found to be small...|$|E

40|$|Deforestation in the Amazon {{region will}} {{initially}} impact the energy balance at the land surface through changes in land cover and surface hydrology. However, continuation of this human activity will {{eventually lead to}} atmospheric feedbacks, including changes in cloudiness which may {{play an important role}} in the final equilibrium of solar and terrestrial radiation at the surface. In this study, the different components of surface radiation over an undisturbed forest in the Amazon region are computed using data from the Amazon region micrometerological experiment (ARME). Several measures of cloudiness are defined: two estimated from the terrestrial radiation measurements, and one from the solar radiation measurements. The sensitivity of the surface fluxes of solar and terrestrial radiation to natural variability in cloudiness is investigated to infer the potential role of the cloudiness feedback in the surface energy balance. The results of this analysis indicate that a 1 % decrease in cloudiness would increase <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> by ca. 1. 6 W/m 2. However, the overall magnitude of this feedback, due to total deforestation of the Amazon forest, is likely to be of the same order as the magnitude of the decrease in <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> due to the observed increase in surface albedo following deforestation. Hence, the total change in <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> is likely to have a negligible magnitude.

In order to place the emission of this anthropogenic heat in context, it was thus compared against the <b>net</b> short wave <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> captured within the urban environment. This study provides a preliminary analysis of the spatial and temporal anthropogenic heat emissions from buildings across London as part of the urban climate modelling element of the LUCID (&# 039;The Development of a Local Urban Climate Model and its Application to the Intelligent Design of cities&# 039;) project.

40|$|Abstract Energy {{and labor}} {{are the two}} largest {{expenditures}} of greenhouse operations. High energy cost and large CO 2 footprint associated with greenhouse heating have motivated research activities {{in the areas of}} energy conservation and alternative energy. Dutch researchers have demonstrated energy saving potential of closed greenhouse operation in the Netherlands. This study hypothesized that semi-closed operation was better suited for Ohio and other US northern climate regions. A decision support tool has been developed to assess energy recovery potential and other benefits of semi-closed operations. The results showed that a greenhouse can be closed 90 % of the time using only 50 % of the maximum cooling capacity required to keep a greenhouse closed 100 % of the time. Also, heat recovered from cooling operations of a closed greenhouse in Ohio can contribute 23 - 98 % of total annual heating needs. This study also found large disagreement when using a commonly used tool for heat loss calculation. The tool performed poorly with a 30 % error under nighttime clear sky conditions. The evaluation suggested that accurate estimation of <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> transmittance is important, e. g. a 5 % change of the transmittance caused a 9 % prediction performance shift. In addition to the originally designed functions, the decision support tool is extended to predict the performance of external shade curtains for cooling purposes. The development of this tool has established a solid foundation for the evaluation of greenhouse energy management strategies, including feasibility studies of alternative energy sources, and of sizing of greenhouse heating and cooling equipments. 2.

40|$|Rates of {{snowmelt}} distributed across Emerald Lake watershed, an alpine basin {{located in}} the Sierra Nevada, California, were estimated for water year 1987 using a point snowmelt model applied to regions that were classified based on distributed snow water equivalence and <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> (NSR). A 5 -m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and a 5 -m classified digital terrain model of snow water equivalence (SWE) were resampled to coarser resolutions (25 -m, 30 -m, 50 -m, and 100 -m) using the nearest neighbor approach. These images were used to define other snowmelt physical parameters and the initial state of the snowpack before melting. Topographic parameters calculated at 50 -m and 100 -m resolution exhibited significant differences in their histogram distribution {{as compared to the}} 5 -m DEM. The most important were variations in slope, aspect, sky view factor, and terrain configuration factor, which influenced radiation calculations and the definition of distributed parameters for snowmelt calculations. Elevations, however, did not change significantly from one resolution to the other. The distribution of topographic parameters modeled at 25 -m and 30 -m, remained almost unchanged. Four, seven and ten classes of snow water equivalence and <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> were combined using a band interleave process to determine the maximum number of combined classes. The point snowmelt model was then applied to these areas, which shared similar SWE and NSR characteristics, to obtain hourly melt rates.

There was good agreement for resolutions S-, 25 -, 30 -, and 50 -m but not for the 100 -m OEM, as modeled <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> was too high and water was released from the basin too early. Model performance using three tests (Nash-Sutcliffe criteria, sum of squares of the deviations and the sum of the absolute differences between observed discharge and computed melting) showed that the 30 -m resolution OEM with combined classes of 7 SWE and 7 NSR provided the best snowmelt performance for this distributed approach.

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of solar flux {{at the top}} of the atmosphere (TOA), which can only be made from satellite observations, is essential for climate studies. In the present study, we developed a new technique to derive the solar fluxes at the TOA and at the surface from operational meteorological satellites.

We developed a new NTB conversion algorithm from ScaRaB observations and radiation transfer model simulations. In deriving the <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> fluxes at the surface from TOA measurements, the effects of absorbing aerosols have been investigated. The technique described above has been applied to AVHRR data to derive a dataset of solar flux in the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) for the Canadian GEWEX Enhanced Study (CAGES) period from June 1998 to September 1999. The derived <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> fluxes at the surface were evaluated with the surface measurements in the basin and good agreement was achieved. Radiation fields from two atmospheric models used in the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS) project, the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) and the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model, were evaluated against satellite retrievals of radiation fluxes in the present study. It was found that the CRCM simulated the TOA reflected flux well in the MRB for the summer of 1994, but large biases were found in the partition of absorbed <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> between the atmosphere and the earth's surface. The <b>net</b> surface <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> was found to be overestimated by about 15 % in the CRCM. Evaluation of the preliminary output from the new version of CRCM shows substantial improvement.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Solar</b> <b>Net</b> <b>Radiation</b> (Rn) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} component which influences soil heat flux, evapotranspiration rate and hydrological cycle. This parameter (Rn) is measured based on the difference between downward and upward shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) irradiances reaching the Earth’s surface. Field measurements of Rn are scarce, expensive and difficult due to the instrumental maintenance. As a result, in most research cases, Rn is estimated by the empirical, semi-empirical and physical radiation models. Almorox et al.

Data were taken during the periods from May 26 to October 16, 1987, May 10 to September 18, 1988, and July 21 to August 13, 1989. The station site locations were selected to represent burned and unburned treatments on ridges, valley bottoms, and slopes with various aspects. The measured variables were (1) air and wet bulb temperatures at two heights, (2) <b>net</b> <b>radiation,</b> (3) <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> (up and down), (4) total hemispherical radiation (up and down), (5) diffuse radiation, (6) soil heat flow and soil temperature, (7) wind speed, (8) wind direction, and (9) precipitation.

Validation of the heat fluxes against in-situ ones, which are estimated from in-situ observation in HE sampling conditions, shows the accuracies (bias +/- RMS error) of net shortwave radiation, net long wave radiation, latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are 20 +/- 45. 0 W m(- 2), - 9 +/- 12. 3 W m(- 2), - 2. 3 +/- 31. 5 W m(- 2) and 1. 5 +/- 5. 0 W m(- 2), respectively. Statistical analyses of HEs show that, during these events, <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> remains high and then decreases from 246 to 220 W m(- 2), while latent heat is low and then increases from 100 W m(- 2) to 124 W m(- 2).

40|$|Question: Predictive {{vegetation}} modelling {{relies on}} the use of environmental variables, which are usually derived from a base data set with some level of error, and this error is propagated to any subsequently derived environmental variables. The question for this study is: What is the level of error and uncertainty in environmental variables based on the error propagated from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and how does it vary for both direct and indirect variables? Location: Kioloa region, New South Wales, Australia. Methods: The level of error in a DEM is assessed and used to develop an error model for analysing error propagation to derived environmental variables. We tested both indirect (elevation, slope, aspect, topographic position) and direct (average air temperature, <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> and topographic wetness index) variables for their robustness to propagated error from the DEM. Results: It is shown that the direct environmental variable <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> is less affected by error in the DEM than the indirect variables aspect and slope, but that regional conditions such as slope steepness and cloudiness can influence this outcome. However, the indirect environmental variable topographic position was less affected by error in the DEM than topographic wetness index. Interestingly, the results disagreed with the current assumption that indirect variables are necessarily less sensitive to propagated error because they are less derived. Conclusions: The results indicate that variables exhibit both systematic bias and instability under uncertainty.

For calculations over a specified area, it employs table look-up procedures, so that computation speed for the spectral model approaches that for a lumped model. Thus {{it may be useful}} as part of a snow surface en-ergy budget calculation over a drainage basin...|$|R
40|$|Shading the {{greenhouses}} {{is necessary}} in summer to reduce the <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> load. This however generates {{a considerable amount of}} thermal radiation heat load that needs to be removed via cooling systems. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different shading configurations on the <b>solar</b> and thermal <b>radiation</b> in a greenhouse. Nets at four different locations were employed to shade the roof and side-walls of a polycarbonate, mechanically ventilated greenhouse. The spectral radiative properties of all these plastic materials were measured in short and long wave spectrum bands. The <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> and thermal <b>radiations</b> and air temperature were measured outside and inside two identical shaded and unshaded greenhouses. The results showed that external roof-shading is desirable, as it reduced the generated thermal radiation in the greenhouse by 21 % and 15 % during the day and night time, respectively and reduced the greenhouse air temperature during the day. The internal shading (roof and side walls) is undesirable, since it drastically increased the generated thermal radiation in the greenhouse by 147 % and strongly increased the greenhouse air temperature during the day. Shading the side-walls is not recommended because it significantly reduces the transmitted <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in the morning and afternoon (when the outside irradiance is low) and is useless at around noon when the outside irradiance is extremely high...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{variations}} in surface albedo across {{a large area}} cause difficulty in estimating regional <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> and atmospheric absorption of shortwave radiation when only ground point measurements of surface albedo are used to represent the whole area. Information on spatial variations and site-wide averages of surface albedo, which vary with the underlying surface type and conditions and the solar zenith angle, is important for studies of clouds and atmospheric radiation over a large surface area. In this study, a bidirectional reflectance model was used to inversely retrieve surface properties such as leaf area index and then the bidirectional reflectance distribution was calculated by using the same radiation model. The albedo was calculated by converting the narrowband reflectance to broadband reflectance and then integrating over the upper hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} cumulus {{cloudiness}} on the radiational heating and, on {{other aspects of}} the climate were simulated by the GLAS Climate Model. An experiment in which the cumulus cloudiness is neglected completely for purposes of the solar and terrestrial radiation parameterizations was performed. The results are compared with those of a control run, in which 100 % cumulus cloud cover is assumed. The <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> input into the Earth atmosphere system is more realistic in the experiment, and the model's underprediction of the global mean outgoing thermal radiation {{at the top of the}} atmosphere is reduced. The results suggest that there is a positive feedback between cumulus convection and the radiation field. The upper troposphere is warmer in the experiment, the surface air temperature increases over land, and the thermal lows over the continents intensity...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{observations}} during intense warm-air advection {{over the}} East Siberian Sea reveal {{a period of}} rapid sea-ice melt. A semi-stationary, high-pressure system north of the Bering Strait forced northward advection of warm, moist air from the continent. Air-mass transfor-mation over melting sea ice formed a strong, surface-based temperature inversion in which dense fog formed. This induced a positive net longwave radiation at the surface, while reduc-ing <b>net</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> only marginally; the inversion also resulted in downward turbulent heat flux. The sum of these processes enhanced the surface energy flux {{by an average of}} ~ 15 W m- 2 for a week. Satellite images before and after the episode show sea-ice concentrations decreasing from > 90 % to ~ 50 % over a large area affected by the air-mass transformation. We argue that this rapid melt was triggered by the increased heat flux from the atmosphere due to the warm-air advection...|$|E
40|$|The Arctic is a {{key element}} in {{determining}} the radiation budget of the earth. Within the polar regions, the <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> (incoming <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> minus outgoing infrared radiation) is negative. To understand the role this energy deficit plays in the overall radiation budget, one must examine the prevalent atmospheric features of the Arctic. One such feature is a persistent layer of low-altitude, stratiform clouds found over the central Arctic predominantly from April to September (Tsay et al. 1984). These Arctic stratus clouds (ASC) modulate the earth’s radiation budget by contributing to the vertical transport of heat (Curry 1986). It is, therefore, crucial to understand the radiative properties of Arctic stratus clouds. We believe that the radiative properties of ASC are strongly coupled with their cloud microphysics. Our aim is t...|$|R
30|$|The ForWaDy model simulates the hydrologic {{dynamics}} {{of a forest}} stand on a daily time step for a given set of climatic and vegetation conditions. It {{has been shown to}} perform well for predicting the effect of forest management on evapotranspiration (Seely et al. 2006) and temporal patterns in soil moisture content under field conditions (Dordel et al. 2011; Titus et al. 2006). The model represents potential evapotranspiration (PET) using an energy balance approach based on {{a modified version of the}} Priestley-Taylor equation (Priestley and Taylor 1972). This equation has shown to be effective in predicting evapotranspiration under a wide variety of forest types and conditions (Rao et al. 2011; Stagnitti et al. 1989; Sumner and Jacobs 2005). <b>Net</b> shortwave <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> interception is used to drive the PET calculations. It is calculated for each tree and plant species from the light competition submodel built into FORECAST (Kimmins et al. 1999) and surface albedo. ForWaDy includes a representation of the vertical flow of water through canopy and soil layer compartments. Storage and movement of water in and through each soil layer is regulated by physical properties that dictate moisture holding capacity, permanent wilting point moisture content, and infiltration rate.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} energy fluxes {{involved}} in the melting of snow. These fluxes can act in opposing directions, that is either delivering heat to or removing heat from the snowpack. Ground heat flux is the energy delivered to the snowpack from the soil below by conduction. Radiation inputs to the snowpack include <b>net</b> shortwave (<b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> including visible and ultraviolet light) and longwave (infrared) radiation. Net shortwave radiation is the difference in energy received {{from the sun and}} that reflected by the snowpack because of the snowpack albedo. Longwave radiation is received by the snowpack from many sources, including ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor present in all levels of the atmosphere. Longwave radiation is also emitted by the snowpack in the form near-Black-body radiation, where snow has an emissivity between 0.97 and 1.0. Generally the net longwave radiation term is negative, meaning a net loss of energy from the snowpack. Latent heat flux is the energy removed from or delivered to the snowpack which accompanies the mass transfers of evaporation, sublimation, or condensation. Sensible heat flux is the heat flux due to convection between the air and snowpack.|$|R
