5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} {{because they believe that}} the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> where <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> only, or c) determined by indeterministic <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophers}} chose a {{short history}} of scientific predecessors– Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally– as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons {{of history and the}} social structures built upon it could be discarded.|$|E
5|$|It was Newton's {{conception}} of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that {{became one of the}} seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E

5|$|American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism, {{political}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, {{the modern}} debate between rationalism and empiricism, {{and the influence}} of <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> as influences on the development of Kant's ethics. Other philosophers have argued that Kant's parents and his teacher, Martin Knutzen, influenced his ethics. Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher Jürgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive. Michael Stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship, while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations. The Catholic Church has criticised Kant's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics.|$|E
5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E

5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. <b>Natural</b> <b>law</b> (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a {{court that}} dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal {{principles}} based on <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the curia regis, or King's Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the curia during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16December 1880.|$|E
5|$|The {{canon law}} of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal {{principles}} made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission.

It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code, principles of legal interpretation and coercive penalties that are limited to moral coercion.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with common law, {{the two are}} distinct. Even though <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> theories have exercised a profound influence {{on the development of}} English common law, the latter is not based on inherent rights, but is the legal tradition whereby certain rights or values are legally recognized by virtue of already having judicial recognition or articulation. <b>Natural</b> <b>law</b> is often contrasted with the human-made laws (positive law) of a given state, political entity or society. In legal theory, the interpretation of a human-made law requires some reference to <b>natural</b> <b>law.</b> On this understanding of <b>natural</b> <b>law,</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> can be invoked to criticize judicial decisions about what the law says, but not to criticize the best interpretation of the law itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> was very {{important}} {{in the development of}} the English common law.

According to William Blackstone, however, <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of equity, but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication of <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> and advocates of legal positivism, like Jeremy Bentham, have also been staunch critics of the common law.|$|E

25|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> was {{inherently}} teleological, however, {{it is most}} assuredly not deontological. For Christians, <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> is how man manifests {{the divine}} image in his life. This mimicry of God's own life is impossible to accomplish except {{by means of the}} power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that man is made in God's image, man is empowered by God's grace. Living the <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> is how man displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within man's control, thus in <b>natural</b> <b>law,</b> actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the <b>natural</b> <b>law,</b> temporal satisfaction {{may or may not be}} attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by the <b>natural</b> <b>law,</b> is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.|$|E
40|$|A recent {{flurry of}} new <b>natural</b> {{resources}} <b>law</b> casebooks, coming a quarter-century since {{the publication of}} the last significant new teaching materials, is an occasion to revisit the boundaries that define the field. The similarities among the casebooks are stronger than their differences, and represent a consensus about what composes <b>natural</b> resources <b>law.</b> The published teaching materials as well as an informal poll of <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> professors show a substantial overlap between natural resources and environmental law course coverage. Administrative implementation of statutes dominates both subjects. Both courses typically cover environmental impact analysis and endangered species protection. The new casebooks broaden <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> coverage to include water rights, wetland development, and other subjects outside of public land management. Despite the common ground shared with environmental <b>law,</b> <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> retains a distinctive character. This article describes four attributes that justify separate pedagogical treatment of <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> as a stand-alone course in law schools. First, the in-situ character of extractive activities that dominate <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> raises special problems and generates place-based approaches to governance. Second, the deeper roots of <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> present particularly vexing interpretive issues for applying the old statutes, deeds, and doctrines to contemporary problems. Third, <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> has more experience with ecosystem management. Fourth, despite the now-paramount importance of administrative tools, <b>natural</b> resources <b>law</b> still displays a broader array of property interests that go beyond the variations studied in the first-year property class...|$|R
