5|$|An FAA {{study in}} 1968 {{had found that}} {{a quarter of the}} 2,230 <b>near-miss</b> {{aircraft}} encounters reported that year had involved a military aircraft. Following the in-flight collision of Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed to cut down on VFR flights and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>near-miss</b> and {{collision}} incidents presented further safety issues. Both {{were caused}} by failure of the same piece of equipment, the TORU manual docking system, which was undergoing tests at the time. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance docking in order to enable the cash-strapped Russians to remove the expensive Kurs automatic docking system from the Progress ships.|$|E
5|$|Gorgon was {{the first}} to go into action as she bombarded German {{artillery}} positions in Belgium at the end of July 1918. She bombarded the Snaeskerk bridge on 28 and 29 September, but produced a single <b>near-miss.</b> She fired at German artillery batteries again on 14 October, but had to retreat hurriedly when she was straddled by heavy German return fire and she was hit by splinters from near-misses. The next day she bombarded another bridge; the last rounds fired by a Royal Navy warship at targets in Occupied Belgium.|$|E
40|$|<b>Near-misses</b> occur {{across many}} forms of {{gambling}} and are rated as unpleasant while simultaneously increasing the motivation to continue playing. On slot machines, the icon position relative to the payline moderates the effects of <b>near-misses,</b> with <b>near-misses</b> before the payline increasing motivation, and <b>near-misses</b> after the payline being rated as aversive. <b>Near-misses</b> are also known to increase physiological arousal compared to full-misses, but physiological measures to date {{have not been able}} to dissociate positive and negative emotional responses. The present study measured facial electromyography at the corrugator (brow) and zygomaticus (cheek) sites, as well as electrodermal activity (EDA), following gambling outcomes on a two-reel slot machine simulation in 77 novice gamblers. Behavioral data was collected using trial-by-trial ratings of motivation and valence. Wins were rated as more pleasant and increased motivation to continue playing, compared to non-win outcomes. Wins were also accompanied by increased EDA and zygomaticus activity. <b>Near-misses</b> after the payline were rated as more aversive than other non-wins, and this was accompanied by increased EDA and zygomaticus activity. <b>Near-misses</b> before the payline increased motivation to continue playing, and were accompanied by increased EDA. Thus, both subjective and physiological responses to <b>near-misses</b> differ for events falling either side of the payline. The ‘near-miss effect’ is not a unitary phenomenon. Facial EMG has differential sensitivity to positive and negative valence and may be a useful measure for future studies of gambling behavior...|$|R
40|$|<b>Near-misses</b> in {{gambling}} {{games are}} losing events that {{come close to}} a win. <b>Near-misses</b> were previously shown to recruit reward-related brain regions including the ventral striatum, and to invigorate gambling behavior, supposedly by fostering an illusion of control. Given that pathological gamblers are particularly vulnerable to such cognitive illusions, their persistent gambling behavior might result from an amplified striatal sensitivity to <b>near-misses.</b> In addition, animal {{studies have shown that}} behavioral responses to near-miss-like events are sensitive to dopamine, but this dopaminergic influence has not been tested in humans. To investigate these hypotheses, we recruited 22 pathological gamblers and 22 healthy controls who played a slot machine task delivering wins, <b>near-misses</b> and full-misses, inside an fMRI scanner. Each participant played the task twice, once under placebo and once under a dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 [*]mg), in a double-blind, counter-balanced design. Participants were asked about their motivation to continue gambling throughout the task. Across all participants, <b>near-misses</b> elicited higher motivation to continue gambling and increased striatal responses compared with full-misses. Crucially, pathological gamblers showed amplified striatal responses to <b>near-misses</b> compared with controls. These group differences were not observed following win outcomes. In contrast to our hypothesis, sulpiride did not induce any reliable modulation of brain responses to <b>near-misses.</b> Together, our results demonstrate that pathological gamblers have amplified brain responses to <b>near-misses,</b> which likely contribute to their persistent gambling behavior. However, {{there is no evidence that}} these responses are influenced by dopamine. These results have implications for treatment and gambling regulation...|$|R

The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, <b>near-miss</b> situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years. These figures did not include the casualties from Flight 706.|$|E
5|$|The Nibiru cataclysm is a {{supposed}} disastrous encounter between the Earth {{and a large}} planetary object (either a collision or a <b>near-miss)</b> which certain groups believe {{will take place in}} the early 21st century. Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Planet X or Nibiru. The idea that a planet-sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has been rejected by astronomers and planetary scientists as pseudoscience and an Internet hoax.|$|E

30|$|With a {{long history}} of {{reported}} accidents and the highest number of reported <b>near-misses</b> for 2011, the LC at Wynnum Central has been identified by QR as one of the worst black spots in Brisbane. By far, the largest percentage of <b>near-misses</b> reported on the Cleveland line occurred at Wynnum Central (41  %), compared to Coorparoo accounting for 8.5  % and Cannon Hill accounting for 5  %, noting that the number of reported <b>near-misses</b> should only be considered as an approximate indication of the risk rate, given the reporting reliability issues that have previously been raised [18]. The most recent fatal collision with a pedestrian in Queensland occurred at Cannon Hill LC in January 2014, raising significant safety concerns among rail authorities. Finally, QR provided information about an increasing number of pedestrian violations at Coorparoo in recent years— 2013 / 2014.|$|R
5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the <b>near-miss</b> aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary cellular automata. However, a <b>near-miss</b> {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on the exclusive or function. In Rule 90, the state of each cell is the exclusive or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the exclusive or makes the transition rule locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a reversible cellular automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Morgan's battery departed for the Western Front in October 1914 as part of the 3rd (Lahore) Division. Morgan suffered a <b>near-miss</b> from a German 5.9-inch gun which blew him into the air and buried him in a shell hole, and he was evacuated to hospital in Boulogne with shell shock. He was granted a short sick leave in England only to be present when news reached his family that his brother had been killed in action. On returning to the front, Morgan became aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Edward Spencer Hoare-Nairne, the commander of the Lahore Divisional Artillery. The artillery remained on the Western Front when the bulk of the division departed for the Mesopotamian campaign. As it took longer to train artillery than infantry, the Lahore divisional artillery acted in turn as the artillery of the 2nd Canadian Division, 3rd Canadian Division, 4th Australian Division and finally the 4th Canadian Division until their own artillery was sufficiently trained to take over.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{examination}} of <b>near-misses</b> and mistakes {{that occur in}} occupational therapy has been a largely neglected research area. Most research regarding <b>near-misses</b> and mistakes comes from the fields of nursing and aviation. Objectives: This study explores the concepts of 'near-misses' and 'mistakes', specifically in relation to occupational therapy and patient safety. It then examines new graduate occupational therapists in Australia and New Zealand in relation to any <b>near-misses</b> and mistakes which they have experienced. This includes work settings as well as cultural and procedural arrangements for reporting or disclosing such events. Methods: All Australian and Aotearoa/New Zealand new graduate occupational therapists who completed studies in 2007 were eligible for inclusion in this research, undertaken in 2008. The sample comprised 178 Australian and 54 Aotearoa/New Zealand new graduates who completed an online survey tool developed for the study. The {{study was supported by}} the Council of Occupational Therapists Registrations Boards (Australia and New Zealand). Results: 17. 9...|$|R
5|$|Once {{the fleet}} was repaired, they sailed out on 20 October to Weihaiwei. While in the harbour, they found {{themselves}} under attack by the Imperial Japanese Army in January 1895 as the Battle of Weihaiwei commenced. As Japanese forces {{took control of the}} sea forts {{on either side of the}} harbour, the fleet found itself under bombardment during the day and torpedo boat attack during the night. One such attack during the night of 5 February saw Laiyuan sunk by a torpedo and capsized. Jingyuen was undamaged, but underwent a <b>near-miss</b> by a torpedo. On 9 February, while Jingyuen was operating in the eastern part of the harbour, was struck below the waterline and sank upright in shallow water. The shot was fired from one of the captured Chinese forts. To avoid eventual capture by the Japanese, Ruchang ordered for a naval mine to be placed below decks on Jingyuen and detonated later that day, destroying her. She was raised and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{ordered that}} the troops, but not their equipment, be {{unloaded}} from the cruisers {{on the evening}} of the 8th, and that the cruisers were to search forthwith for the German ships known to be at sea. This was later cancelled and the squadron was ordered to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet. Later that day, German bombers attacked the British ships and Devonshire suffered a <b>near-miss.</b> On the 11th, the squadron was detached on an unsuccessful search for German ships in the area around Trondheim and rejoined the fleet two days later. Cunningham's ships were then detached to Tromsø where he conducted negotiations with local officials to refuel there and to bring Norwegian troops west from Kirkenes. The squadron arrived there on the afternoon of the 15th and escorted Norwegian troopships back to Tromsø. Devonshire covered the evacuation of British and French troops from Namsos at the beginning of May and was nearly hit when the evacuation forces were attacked by German aircraft as they were withdrawing on 3 May.|$|E
5|$|The M40 motorway, {{which was}} nearing {{completion}} {{at the time}} of production, doubled for the fictitious M104. In the run-up to the filming of the plane's <b>near-miss</b> with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5, at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass, the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations, the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times. During a take, a crosswind sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would lose control of the Tiger Moth if it were to hit the ground. She therefore kept the plane in mid-air while passing under the bridge, clearing it by nine feet (2.7m) as originally planned. On another attempt, the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low-level glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming; subsequently, Hughes and production manager were arrested. Hughes, a pilot with more than three decades' flight experience by 1968, later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only {{the first time in her}} career that she had feared for her safety.|$|E
