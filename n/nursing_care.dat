5|$|Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners {{arrived on}} February 22–23, 1862. Many of the 2,398 Confederates {{in the first}} group were sick, ill fed, and without {{sufficient}} clothing for the cold, northern winters. The citizens of Indianapolis rallied to provide humanitarian aid for the prisoners, which included additional food, clothing, and supplies. Local doctors aided the sick and local women provided <b>nursing</b> <b>care.</b> The Athenaeum, {{at the corner of}} East Michigan Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and another local building were converted into hospitals to treat the Confederate prisoners. For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Cadet Nurses Corps was {{the largest}} of the federal nurse-training programs; it allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. It also {{influenced}} the way in which nurses would be educated and trained in the United States. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian <b>nursing</b> <b>care,</b> and commended them for replacing graduate nurses who enlisted in the armed forces during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of <b>nursing</b> <b>care,</b> such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
40|$|The paper subject covers <b>Nurse</b> <b>Care</b> Options for Incurables. A {{theoretical}} {{paper of}} the Diploma Thesis {{is something like}} a comprehensive summary of potential <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options for incurable people. Based on data gathered herein, I tried to create a schematic layout making the above options clearer. It forms the Annex No. 1 to the paper. A practical part is prepared as a quality [...] quantity survey. I concentrated on the Czech Republic legislative and statistic data related to the subject {{as well as the}} informedness level of patients/clients and general <b>nurse</b> of <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options for incurable people. One of hypotheses related to the issue determined by me ("The <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options for incurable people in the Czech Republic meet their needsq) was confirmed; other two options ("All <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options provided to incurable people are available to themq and "Incurable people are informed of the <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options available to them in the frame of their illnessq) were disproved. I determined three essential objectives in my paper: 1. Identify <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options for incurable people in the Czech Republic; 2. Determine the availability of the <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> for incurable people in the Czech Republic; and 3. Find the informedness level of incurable people regarding potential use of <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> suitable for them, that I met. My theoretical part defines <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options for incurable people in the Czech Republic; my quality and quantity survey resulted into a conclusion that the <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> availability for incurable people in the Czech republic doesn not meet their needs, and the informedness level of incurable people of suitable <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> availability to them is insufficient. The Diploma Thesis findings result into following recommendations: To continue in development of the palliative care and start to perceive it not only as care for oncology terminal ill people; aim to improvement in the informedness of incurable people of the <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> options available to them (currently a social nurse, general nurse, as well also voluntary workes, in the future a case manager nurse [...] advisor), and promote development of community nursery in the Czech Republic...|$|R

5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E

His health deteriorated severely in 1986, obliging him to abandon his home and spend several months in a Wareham hospital. In March 1987, together with his companion Reginald Norman Best (1909–1988), he moved into a two-room suite in Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh, where he was permanently chairbound and received daily <b>nursing</b> <b>care.</b> In June 1988 he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure on 15 October 1988 at a little after 7pm, at the age of 96.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between <b>nurse</b> <b>care,</b> attitude of patient and nurse with cancer patient satisfaction using the quantitative methodology. In Libya, the challenge of medical facilities and treatment is a current issue. Thus, {{this study was conducted}} to investigate the patients’ satisfaction at National Cancer Institute Misurata, Libya. The participants were 217 cancer patients of National Institute of Oncology located in Misurata, Libya. The study scale was adopted and adapted from that used by previous researchers to measure <b>nurse</b> <b>care,</b> <b>nurse</b> attitude, patient attitude, hospital service quality and patient satisfaction on a 5 -point Likert scale. The <b>nurse</b> <b>care,</b> <b>nurse</b> attitude and patient attitude are independent variables and cancer patient satisfaction is the dependent variable in this study. On the other hand, hospital service quality and patient characteristic are control variables. SPSS software was used to analyses the data collected. The analyses of this study included descriptive statistic, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. The study found that on the overall basis, there is a significant statistical relationship between <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> and cancer patient satisfaction, and there is a significant statistical relationship between attitude and cancer patient satisfaction. The sub-hypotheses show that there are no a relationship between interpersonal skills of <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> and efficiency of <b>nurse</b> <b>care</b> with cancer patient satisfaction which suggest there might be interactions between these variables. Result also shows that for the sub-hypotheses, only patient attitude and cancer patient satisfaction indicated significant relationship, while there is no significant relationship between nurse attitude and patient satisfaction. This also indicates of possible interactions between the variables. On an overall basis, it can be concluded that to increase in the satisfaction level cancer patient, the management do it by focusing on improving the level of <b>nurse</b> <b>care,</b> <b>nurse</b> attitude and patient attitude...|$|R

5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis, {{the state}} capital of Indiana, was a major base {{of support for the}} Union. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major {{supporter}} of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place to organize and train troops for the Union army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground to organize and train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union soldiers and their families as they passed through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided <b>nursing</b> <b>care,</b> and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Philipp {{participated in}} various {{sporting}} events {{organized by the}} Christlicher Verein Junger Männer (CVJM—the German equivalent of YMCA) such as hiking, bicycling, skiing, paddling and rowing. He also {{was a member of}} the Hitlerjugend (HJ—Hitler Youth) and received the HJ-Ehrenzeichen (Honor Badge). Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license, leading the local HJ-Fliegerschar (Flying Squad) in Meissen. Adolf Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe in March 1935. Following this event, Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not want to become a journalist. He passed his physical examination to become a pilot, observer, aircraft mechanic and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden. The financial situation of the Philipp family was always a cause for concern. When Alma's mother was paralyzed and required <b>nursing</b> <b>care,</b> the financial situation became severe. Alma's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden. She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived. By early 1935, the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935. Philipp's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds. Philipp's decision to opt for military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension. He was permitted to graduate, provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month.|$|E

40|$|MCur, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Background: A {{shortage}} of nurses is experienced in aged <b>care</b> as these <b>nurses</b> experience adverse working conditions. Resilience might empower these nurses to survive, thrive and even flourish. A paucity of research exists regarding resilience in <b>nurses</b> <b>caring</b> for older persons. Objectives: The {{purpose of this}} research was to investigate the level of resilience in <b>nurses</b> <b>caring</b> for older persons, and to explore and describe their strengths and coping abilities, in order to formulate recommendations to strengthen resilience in <b>nurses</b> <b>caring</b> for older persons. Method: An explorative, descriptive design with multiple phases was used. An all-inclusive sample of <b>nurses</b> <b>caring</b> for older persons in an urban setting in the North West Province was used. During phase one (sample size n= 43) the level of resilience, demographic information and narratives were obtained. During phase two (sample size n= 17) focus group interviews were conducted. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics and the qualitative data using content analysis. Results: The participants had a moderately high to high level of resilience. Participants did experience adverse working circumstances and they needed resilience due to a need for balance, the emotional nature of the work, work ethics and the work environment. <b>Nurses</b> <b>caring</b> for older persons use personal, professional, contextual and spiritual strengths to handle adverse working conditions. Conclusion: Recommendations to strengthen resilience in <b>nurses</b> <b>caring</b> for older persons were formulated in phase three of the research, focusing on strengthening nurses‟ personal, professional, contextual and spiritual strengths in order that they can handle adverse workplace conditions.

25|$|While {{the number}} of nurses {{providing}} patient care is recognized as an inadequate measure of <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> quality, there is hard evidence that nurse staffing {{is directly related to}} patient outcomes. Studies by Aiken and Needleman have demonstrated that patient death, nosocomial infections, cardiac arrest, and pressure ulcers are linked to inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios. The presence or absence of registered nurses (RNs) impacts the outcome for pediatric patients requiring pain management and/or peripheral administration of intravenous fluids and/or medications. These two indicators of pediatric <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> quality are sensitive measures of <b>nursing</b> <b>care.</b> Professional nurses {{play a key role in}} successful pain management, especially among pediatric patients unable to verbally describe pain.
