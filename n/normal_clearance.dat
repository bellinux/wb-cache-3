The methodology involved a chromatographic separation on a celite {{column in the}} presence of tritiated tracers, enzymic hydrolysis of the conjugates, and measurement of the E 3 moiety by a specific RIA. Preeclampsia (eight patients) was characterized by a significant decrease of renal clearance of all conjugates except E 33 G. In contrast to that pattern, a patient with cholestatic icterus had <b>normal</b> <b>clearances</b> except for E 33 G, which was reduced to less than 15 % of its normal mean value. Administration of ampicillin to a pregnant woman induced an important decrease of all E 3 clearances, especially for E 33 G which decreased to nearly 1 % of its initial value; <b>normal</b> <b>clearances</b> were resumed within a week {{after the end of the}} treatment.

40|$|In vitro {{studies were}} {{designed}} to investigate the influence of peak drug concentration (Cmax), the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and, consequently, the trough concentration on the bactericidal effects of gentamicin against Enterobacter cloacae (MIC, 0. 5 mg/liter) by simulating bolus versus infusion administration and bolus dosing with altered drug clearance. Bacteria in the lag phase were exposed to gentamicin concentration-time profiles modelling either bolus or infusion dosing (AUC constant, Cmax changing) with 30 -min postdose peak concentrations (Cpeak 30) of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/liter or bolus dosing with normal and double drug clearance (Cmax constant, AUC changing) corresponding to <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> profiles with Cpeak 30 of 6 and 8 mg/liter. Exposure to gentamicin caused early bactericidal effects apparent by 2 h, followed by variable bacteriostatic and recovery phases. Exposure to bolus profiles resulted in greater bactericidal activity than the corresponding infusion profile up to a Cpeak 30 of 8 mg/liter. At a Cpeak 30 of 10 mg/liter, {{there were no differences}} in bactericidal effect. Double clearance profiles had a reduced bactericidal effect at 6 mg/liter compared to the corresponding <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> profile, but no differences in bactericidal effect were observed for 8 -mg/liter double and <b>normal</b> <b>clearance</b> profiles. These results suggest that the initial exposure (i. e., 0 to 30 min) is a more important determinant for bacterial killing than the AUC or trough concentration for this bacterium. Subject to confirmation of these findings with other gram-negative bacteria, to optimize aminoglycoside efficacy the initial exposure (Cmax) should be maximized by giving higher doses or bolus administration at intervals which may not produce detectable trough concentrations. Clinical trials with a broad range of patients, especially those with higher clearance, would confirm these in vitro observations and define optimal dosing recommendations...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn network-centric warfare, access to critical information {{can result in}} a strategic advantage. During critical situations, a soldier using tactical devices may need transient access to information beyond their <b>normal</b> <b>clearances.</b> The Least Privilege Separation Kernel (LPSK) being developed at the Naval Postgraduate School, can be the basis of an extended multilevel security (MLS) system that can support and control such access. A Trusted Services Layer (TSL), which depends on the LPSK, provides support for various multilevel security services. Currently, the LPSK lacks a software network stack for networking communications. Without networking functionality, tactical devices cannot share vital situational updates and information superiority is unattainable. An Internet Protocol (IP) stack was proposed for the LPSK-based system. The IP stack is to be implemented {{in the context of the}} LPSK architecture, which uses modularity and layering to organize its software. Open source implementations of the IP stack were evaluated to leverage the common functionality required by all IP stacks.

In a large portion of persons with sleep disorders, perhaps as high as 30 %, GERD is a major causal or contributing factor.

Using a retrospective review of data from 500 hospital patients we calculated glomerular filtration rate according to Cockcroft-Gault equation (C-G), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI). We determined if results of these equations were compatible with creatinine clearance, and does stage of kidney disease, body-mass index (BMI), diabetes or old age {{have an impact on}} their ability to predict creatinine clearance. All of the equations showed high correlations with creatinine clearance, regardless of diabetes, overweight or old age. There was no statistical difference (p 65 years) and diabetics. The percentage of overweight subjects (BMI> 25) in false positives (subjects with <b>normal</b> creatinine <b>clearance</b> and decreased GFR) was 64. 8 % for C-G, 88. 6 % for MDRD and 88. 9 % for CKD-EPI. Large number of overweight subjects with <b>normal</b> creatinine <b>clearance</b> and decreased GFR would indicate that creatinine clearance overestimates GFR in overweight subjects. Passing-Bablok regression showed agreement between creatinine clearance and MDRD and creatinine clearance and CKD-EPI only in cases of severely decreased GFR (G 4 and G 5 stage of chronic kidney disease).
