40|$|The 1985 Food Security Act {{enshrined}} {{conservation in}} the Farm Bill. Already, Congress is discussing the 2018 Farm Bill, which {{will again be}} an important vehicle for encouraging on-farm conservation practices. On February 7, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Agricultural Act, or Farm Bill, of 2014 (Pub. L. 113 - 79), which extended the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 's broad work on agricultural research and opportunities for farmers, ranchers and growers. The 2014 Farm Bill authorized $ 489 billion in spending by USDA through 2018, with 80 percent of its outlays funding nutrition programs, eight percent going to crop insurance, six percent to conservation, five percent to commodities, and one percent to other programs. <b>National</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>programs</b> through the Farm Bill are {{an important component of}} effective, voluntary, farm-level conservation practices that provide multiple benefits both to rural and urban areas.

40|$|Land {{degradation}} is {{the major}} problem of Ethiopia undermining land productivity. The prob-lem is massive and extremely deep largely in the highlands of Ethiopia. More menacing is that the magnitude of land degradation occurrence is by far exceeding the conservation ac-tivities being carried out. In the past, little prior research was guiding <b>national</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>programs.</b> This study explores the factors affecting farm-households ’ decision to invest in land conservation and their decision on how much to invest in land conservation, {{the role played by}} poverty, land tenure [in]security and market access being the major focus of the study. The main source of data for this study is a primary data collected through interview of rural household surveys in East Gojam and South Wello zones of the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The regression analysis in this study consists of 6408 household-plot level observations and in-volves the use of double-hurdle model. This study demonstrates that the decision to adopt land conservation investment and the decision about how much to invest appear to be explained by different processes. The relevant policy and program tools for encouraging land conservation investment depends on whether or not farm-households are already convinced of the need t...|$|E
40|$|Endangered giant otters, Pteronura brasiliensis, {{are found}} along the Amazon and Orinoco rivers {{and most of}} their tributaries. Hunting in the mid- 1970 s pushed giant otter {{population}}s {{to the brink of}} extinction. We studied population structure and genetic diversity of giant otters from Colombia’s Orinoco basin using analyses of partial mitochondrial DNA control region sequences obtained from scat material. We collected and analyzed 54 scat samples from 22 latrines, 2 tissue samples primarily from captive giant otters and 2 from hunted animals near Puerto Carreño and Puerto Inírida (Colombian Orinoco), as well as one tissue sample from Puerto Leguizamo (Colombian Amazon). Thirty-nine partial control region sequences were obtained (258 bp), corresponding to 15 unique haplotypes. Most of these haplotypes, found in samples collected around Puerto Carreño, defined one phylogeographic group (phylogroup) not previously described. Higher genetic diversity in the Colombian Orinoco populations than in other South American populations suggests that this newly described phylogroup, as well as a second phylogroup defined from a few Colombian Orinoco and Amazon samples, should be considered distinct genetic management units. <b>National</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>programs,</b> particularly those aiming to establish protected areas...|$|E

40|$|The North American Monarch {{butterfly}} (Danaus plexippus) {{population has}} declined by 90 % {{in the last}} twenty years. Scientists cite {{a number of factors}} for their decrease, including changing pesticide use, weather, and habitat loss. In December 2014, the negative trend prompted the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to initiate a status review of the Monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act. Given their relatively large land-holdings in developed landscapes, parklands could serve as important habitat for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators. Park management and interpretive strategies can help shape public attitudes about the environment. This study uses stakeholder analysis to research perceptions and priorities for addressing pollinator conservation at Oakland County Parks and Recreation (OCPR). OCPR manages 13 parks encompassing 6, 701 acres, including 3, 146 acres of natural areas in southeastern Michigan. This research answers the following questions to assist OCPR in implementing conservation actions that appropriately engage internal and external stakeholders. 1. 	Who are the stakeholders involved with Monarch butterfly and pollinator conservation in Oakland County? 2. 	What is the extent of current Monarch butterfly and pollinator conservation both internally and externally? 3. 	What are external stakeholder perceptions for OCPR’s priorities in Monarch butterfly and pollinator conservation? 4. 	How can stakeholder values and interests be integrated into program design for an Oakland County pollinator conservation plan? 5. 	How do local park efforts relate to <b>national</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>programs?</b> The methods section reviews stakeholder theory and its application in natural resource management and program design. Past research indicates that stakeholder actions can be coordinated in ways to maximize the efficacy and efficiency of a system. Through an analytical categorization, stakeholders were segmented to show their relationship to the goal as well as their available resources to appropriately coordinate actions to achieve conservation objectives across the entire Oakland County park system. Assessing stakeholder power and influence revealed latent opportunities for enhanced communications and coordination. Data was collected through semi-structured phone interviews with internal and external stakeholders in regards to their knowledge, perceptions and priorities. Internal stakeholder interviews included ten staff persons across OCPR departments. External stakeholders included 12 representatives from pollinator conservation organizations at the local, state and national levels. Transcribed interviews were coded and ranked to reveal common themes in rationale, management strategies, and barriers that informed the analysis. Results indicate that many pollinator actions are in place, yet OCPR could coordinate them more purposefully through a cross-functional team to address education, management and communication facets of conservation issues. In addition, many external stakeholders lacked awareness of OCPR’s current pollinator management efforts. This reveals an opportunity for OCPR to lead by example through a two-year communications campaign around Monarch conservation to educate and drive public interest in natural resource management. Establishing new Monarch habitat rated highly among all stakeholders. They also thought parks {{played a critical role in}} public education and as a demonstration site. Results ranked the following stakeholder priorities highest: creating new habitat by seeding naturalized areas or no-mow zones with milkweed; certification of butterfly gardens, bioswales and other appropriate plantings as Waystations; training and encouraging park patrons to engage in conservation actions at their home; and continuing the North American Butterfly Association count and expanding citizen science efforts. Lastly, this research reveals opportunities at a national-level to engage parks in meeting conservation objectives through a voluntary environmental program around establishing habitat and public education. This study suggests that developing a “Monarchs in the Parks” certification program through the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) will multiply outreach efforts and habitat creation to engage parks in taking action to achieve conservation outcomes to meet objectives of the North American Monarch Conservation Plan...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Australia is {{a country}} of some 7, 700 million square {{kilometers}} {{with a population of}} about 22. 6 million. At present water security is a major challenge for Australia. In some areas the use of water resources is approaching and in some parts it is exceeding the limits of sustainability. A focal point of proposed <b>national</b> water <b>conservation</b> <b>programs</b> is the recycling of both urban stormwater and treated wastewater. But till now it is not widely practiced in Australia, and particularly stormwater is neglected. In Australia, only 4 % of stormwater and rainwater is recycled, whereas less than 1 % of reclaimed wastewater is reused within urban areas. Therefore, accurately monitoring, assessing and predicting the availability, quality and use of this precious resource are required for better management. As stormwater is usually of better quality than untreated sewage or industrial discharge, it has better public acceptance for recycling and reuse, particularly for non-potable us...|$|R

25|$|The Gishwati Area <b>Conservation</b> <b>Program</b> (GACP) {{began in}} 2007 with the {{collaboration}} of Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, and Great Ape Trust, founded by philanthropist Ted Townsend. The initiative {{began with the}} idea of creating a <b>national</b> <b>conservation</b> park in Rwanda to protect the biodiversity of the Gishwati Forest area and stop some of the rapid degradation. In 1930 the Gishwati Forest covered 70,000 acres but lost about 90 percent of its cover, this initiative aimed to restore the dramatic loss the area has seen over the last decade and therefore named the site the Forest of Hope. In 2011, the GACP was succeeded by a Rwandan non-governmental organization known as the Forest of Hope Association, which is currently managing the Gishwati Forest Reserve (GFR).|$|R

The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service {{has set a}} goal of enrolling 2 {{million miles}} of land in buffers by 2002 through the <b>National</b> <b>Conservation</b> Buffer Initiative <b>Program.</b> Buffers serve as {{effective}} measures in protecting water quality, providing wildlife habitat, preserving greenspace and enhancing recreational opportunities. Cost share programs, state initiatives and other conservation options can be utilized for increasing miles of riparian buffers in Georgia. These opportunities are discussed and current programs in other states that may serve as models are highlighted. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

Regarding occupational exposures to noise, a written hearing <b>conservation</b> <b>program</b> is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) [...] "whenever employee noise exposures equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average sound level (TWA) of 85 decibels measured on the A scale (slow response) or, equivalently, a dose of fifty percent." [...] This 8-hour time-weighted average is known as an exposure action value. While the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) also requires a hearing <b>conservation</b> <b>program,</b> MSHA {{does not require a}} written hearing <b>conservation</b> <b>program.</b> MSHA's hearing <b>conservation</b> <b>program</b> requirement can be found in 30 CFR § 62.150, and requires has almost the same exact requirements as the OSHA hearing <b>conservation</b> <b>program</b> requirements.
