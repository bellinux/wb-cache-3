5|$|During her premiership Thatcher had the second-lowest average {{approval}} rating (40%) of any post-war Prime Minister. Since {{the resignation of}} Nigel Lawson as Chancellor in 1989, polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party. A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted that she did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> about her poll ratings and pointed instead to her unbeaten election record.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian's {{candidacy}} {{for the head}} coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual {{because he was not}} a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925. Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> about Parseghian's religion, but simply wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.|$|E
5|$|Peter is {{disappointed}} since Francis did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> {{about him}} – so he gives up drinking and does crack instead.

When Peter goes to his mom, Thelma Griffin, about it, she reveals that she had an affair with an Irish man named Mickey McFinnigan and that Mickey is Peter's biological father.|$|E

Selena states that she stops herself from making a mistake that could hurt her. Torres and Selena repeat the song's chorus before the song concludes.|$|E
5|$|Yet Brooks did {{not always}} ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an interior designer whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E

5|$|After {{the trade}} Chamberlain {{found himself on}} a {{promising}} Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer, a future Hall-of-Famer, and talented role players Larry Costello, Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson. Cherry remarks {{that there was a}} certain tension within the team: Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot; however, as the season progressed, the three began to mesh better. Chamberlain did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for the Sixers' coach, Dolph Schayes, because Schayes, according to him, had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA.|$|E

In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E

Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does <b>not</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E

Several months later, at a gala wedding ball for Ella and her new husband, Prince Thomas (Tim Phillipps), Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas) congratulate the couple on their wedding, as does Rumpelstiltskin who tells Ella that he does <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for her riches or baubles, but instead shall claim her firstborn child.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the Republican party, to support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> whether they drank, but insisted they vote for dry laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E

For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys {{would not be a}} good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do <b>not</b> <b>care</b> who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does <b>not</b> <b>care</b> and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first.

Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
