50|$|<b>Nalmexone</b> (INN) (code names EN-1620A, UM-592), or <b>nalmexone</b> {{hydrochloride}} (USAN), is a semisynthetic, opioid partial agonist {{or mixed}} agonist-antagonist with both analgesic and narcotic antagonist properties {{that was never}} marketed. In clinical studies it {{was found to have}} comparable analgesic efficacy to morphine, though with several-fold reduced potency. In addition, nalmexone's side effects, the most common of which were sleepiness and sweating, were reported to be similar to those of morphine, albeit with a noticeably higher degree of incidence.|$|E
40|$|Compared with naloxone, two opiate antagonists (naltrexone and S- 20682) {{were tested}} in the intact dog in order to reverse {{respiratory}} depression, induced by fentanyl 5 Ongkg~ ' i. v. Respiratory rate and arterial blood-gases were measured at 5, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 24 Omin after the additional i. v. injection of the antagonist (1 jigkg" 1). Only S- 20682, but not naloxone or nalrxcxone, prevented late (240 min) fentanyl-induced depression of respiratory drive. A late respiratory depression coincided {{with an increase in}} amplitudes and a reduction of frequency in electrical cortical activity (EEG). Naltrexone exhibited an antagonistic effect of duration twice (60 min) that of naloxone. Four of the present "pure " opiate antagonists, naloxone, naltrexone, nalbuphine and <b>nalmexone</b> all have in common the feature of a hydroxyl-group in the position 14 (Blumberg and Dayton, 1974). Thus the OH-group seems to be responsible for the pure antagonistic effect and for the absence of dys-phoria, which often is noted after the administration of other opiate antagonists such as nalorphine an...|$|E
