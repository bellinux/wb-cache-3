Two aspects of the library are highlighted. First, modifications to message passing primitives to permit their use in a multithreaded environment. Second, modifications to basic linear algebra algorithms to improve their performance on <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> workstations. A model of distributed linear algebra on <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> workstations is developed, and used to predict the performance of the modified algorithms.

Altogether three Hungarian coopetitive <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> SMEs were found and analyzed longitudinally embracing 127 entrepreneurs thus 127 interviews and 127 questionnaires were conducted as well. Since the coopetitive <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> enterprises have territorial extension, the advanced methods <b>of</b> <b>network</b> science and spatial econometrics were combined. The key findings show that focal firm plays outstanding role in redistributing market information, organizing mutual transportation and guarantees robustness <b>of</b> the coopetitive <b>networks.</b> Finally, the coopetitive <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> SMEs determine significantly the new jobs creation and pay raise, in general, the accumulation of territorial capital at regional scale as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many {{engineering}} {{systems can}} be usefully mod-elled as <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> interacting, isomorphic, finite-state discrete-event systems. Examples include communication and transportation networks. For practical purposes, the number of subsystems is often arbitrary. In such cases, key problems of analysis are generally undecidable; however, inductive semide-cision procedures can be formulated for checking whether <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary size are equivalent to <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> bounded size. The appropriate notion of equivalence may vary, depending on the properties being analyzed. We examine a range of possible equivalences, identify system properties that they preserve, and show that semidecision procedures exist for checking these equivalences. On the other hand, we show that equivalence <b>of</b> <b>networks</b> to <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> bounded size is undecidable for {{a broad range of}} process equivalences, even for the simple <b>network</b> topologies <b>of</b> rings and line segments.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{the problem of}} clustering of moving objects in ad hoc wireless <b>networks.</b> The <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> moving objects include <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> flying objects, <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> cars and other vehicles, <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> people moving in the cities, and <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> robots sensing the environment or performing coordinated actions. Clustering of such objects increases the scalability <b>of</b> the <b>network</b> and improves efficiency, enabling the objects to simplify the communication with their peers. Clustering <b>of</b> static <b>network</b> objects has been analysed in great detail in the literature. While most of the clustering algorithms and protocols are applicable in the <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> moving objects, there are specific challenges produced by the mobility. This document will present a rich body of currently available scholarly work on clustering for moving objects, focusing on the case when all network nodes (both clusterheads and cluster members) are moving.

In particular, the Power method, deflation, Givens algorithm, Davidson methods and Jacobi methods are analized using PVM and MPI. The conclusion is that the solution of Eigenvalue Problems can be accelerated by using <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> processors and typical parallel algorithms, but the high cost of communications in these systems gives rise to small modifications in the algorithms to achieve good performance. ...|$|R
