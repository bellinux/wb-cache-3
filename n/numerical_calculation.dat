Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and Clairaut's theorem, and the other on the variation of gravity at {{the surface of the earth}} (1849)—also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847) and on the <b>numerical</b> <b>calculation</b> of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850) and his discussion of a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), research related to his evidence given to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures after the Dee bridge disaster of 1847.|$|E
2500|$|The Hertzian dipole or Elementary doublet {{refers to}} a {{theoretical}} construction, rather than a physical antenna design. It may {{be defined as a}} finite oscillating current (in a specified direction) of [...] over a tiny or infinitesimal length δℓ at a specified position. The solution of the fields from a Hertzian dipole can be used as the basis for analytical or <b>numerical</b> <b>calculation</b> of the radiation from more complex antenna geometries (such as practical dipoles) by forming the superposition of fields from a large number of Hertzian dipoles comprising the current pattern of the actual antenna. As a function of position, taking the elementary current elements multiplied by infinitesimal lengths [...] I(r)dℓ, the resulting field pattern then reduces to an integral over the path of an antenna conductor (modelled as a thin wire).|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} later in the 20th century that {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction. In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson published [...] "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process", after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a <b>numerical</b> <b>calculation</b> scheme that could be devised to allow predictions. Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results. Though numerical analysis later found that this was due to numerical instability.|$|E

60|$|But {{that which}} {{more than any other}} subject engaged his attention, was the late {{proceedings}} of the “Franee,” as he called the French, in the neighbouring bay of Nukuheva. This seemed a never-ending theme with him, and one concerning which he was never weary of interrogating us. All the information we succeeded in imparting to him on this subject was little more than that we had seen six men-of-war lying in the hostile bay at the time we had left it. When he received this intelligence, Mehevi, by the aid of his fingers, went through a long <b>numerical</b> <b>calculation,</b> as if estimating the number of Frenchmen the squadron might contain.|$|E

He could tell the exact {{latitude}} and longitude of almost every important and prominent part of the globe, and give the distance, pretty nearly, of any one place (on a large scale) from any other place. He could give the heights of all the chief mountains in the world to within a few feet, and could calculate, by merely looking at its current and depth, how many cubic feet of water any river delivered to the sea per minute. Length, breadth, and thickness, height, depth, and density, were subjects in which he revelled, and with which he played as a juggler does with golden balls; and so great were his powers of <b>numerical</b> <b>calculation,</b> that the sailors often declared they believed he could work out any calculation backwards without the use of logarithms! He was constantly instituting comparisons that were by no means what the proverb terms [...] "odious," [...] but which were often very astonishing, and in all his stories so many curious and peculiar facts were introduced, that, as we have already said, they were very much relished indeed.|$|E
