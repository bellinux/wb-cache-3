40|$|In general, {{the public}} view of otters is often {{described}} as playful, curious and that they are not known for aggressive towards humans. As well, otter attacks seem to be under reported both in the anecdotal reports or scientific publications. In light of recent otter attacks in Florida, we reviewed all evidence of otter attacks on humans for any geographical and temporal relationships from the earliest (1875) to the most recent (Dec 2010). There was a total 39 anecdotal articles and 4 scientific publications found dealing with violent human-otter interaction (bites, attacks, deaths). The majority of attacks dealt with the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis - 77 %) and geographically occurred most often in Florida (38 %). The greatest number of attacks occurred from 1990 to 2009 (51 %). Within the 39 documented anecdotal reports of otter attacks, rabies was confirmed in 24 to 66 % of the cases. Otters are known to be very territorial in nature and in North America, have had increases in population numbers. In certain areas where otters occur naturally (Florida), there has been a huge surge of human expansion, which has encroached upon the otter’s natural habitat. This encroachment into the otter’s habitat may be one reason for the recent increases of otter attacks upon humans...|$|E

40|$|Historically, <b>North</b> <b>American</b> river <b>otters</b> (Lontra canadensis) {{were widely}} {{dispersed}} throughout the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> continent. Trapping pressures and urbanization {{have led to}} regional exclusion of <b>North</b> <b>American</b> river <b>otter</b> populations from historic habitats, leading the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to spearhead conservation and captive breeding efforts to maintain genetic diversity of the aquatic mustelid. Difficulties in consistently breeding captive <b>North</b> <b>American</b> river <b>otters</b> have spotlighted a {{need to understand how}} geography and life history of adult individuals influence reproductive events. This study analyzed the AZA studbook records for all litters born in captivity from 2008 to 2014 (N = 47) to assess whether any correlations existed between historical data and timing of parturition events. ANOVA tests found significant differences in mean parturition date between litters by dam origin region (F = 6. 09, p-value = 0. 018) and by parturition location (F = 12. 73, p-value = 0. 001). A Mann-Whitney u test found a difference (p-value = 0. 0365) between median parturition dates of litters born in the north and those born in the south regions. PCA testing showed that the data form independent groups by both dam and sire origin latitudes, confirming the existence of a significant relationship between latitude and the timing of reproductive events. However, this study did not conclusively determine which latitude (the origin of the dam, origin of the sire, or latitude at the time of breeding) has the most influence on reproductive events among the captive <b>North</b> <b>American</b> river <b>otter</b> population. Future work should strive to identify other variables related to physiological condition and/or genetic variation between <b>North</b> <b>American</b> river <b>otter</b> subspecies. These factors may lead to more discreet groups and will likely aid {{in the development of a}} predictive model of parturition timing among the captive population using known life history data...|$|R
