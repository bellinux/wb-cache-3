5|$|The first World Championship {{to be held}} as an {{individual}} event was in 1930. Twelve different nations participated.

5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, Achebe again left Nigeria, {{this time}} {{as part of a}} Fellowship for Creative Artists awarded by UNESCO. He {{travelled}} to the United States and Brazil. He met with a number of writers from the US, including novelists Ralph Ellison and Arthur Miller. In Brazil, he met with several other authors, with whom he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese. Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Charles's chances of regaining the Crown at first seemed slim as Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son, Richard. However, the new Lord Protector had little {{experience}} of either military or civil administration. In 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled and Richard resigned. During the civil and military unrest that followed, George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> descend into anarchy. Monck and his army marched into the City of London and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament who had been excluded in December 1648 during Pride's Purge. The Long Parliament dissolved itself {{and for the first}} time in almost 20 years, there was a general election. The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications so as to ensure, as they thought, the return of a Presbyterian majority.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2012, Savage's {{talk show}} left the airwaves after {{he won a}} legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his {{longtime}} employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012. By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage <b>Nation,</b> <b>would</b> move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.|$|E

5|$|The end of World War II was {{followed}} by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing {{the size of the}} various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, but fears existed that the <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> slide back into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should take. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{success with}} Britain was {{undermined}} by {{his attempt to}} annex the Dominican Republic, an independent nation unable to pay its debt. Many Americans believed a Caribbean naval base would establish naval dominance and be useful in protecting shipping from piracy in a potential isthmian canal. Anti-imperialist Republicans had previously rejected a Johnson administration treaty to establish a Samaná Bay naval base. Grant took interest in Dominican annexation and sent his secretary, Orville E. Babcock, there to consult with Buenaventura Báez, the pro-annexation Dominican president. Babcock returned in September 1869 with a draft treaty of annexation, although Fish had not given him any diplomatic authority. Given such authority by Fish, Babcock visited the island nation a second time making a treaty for Dominican annexation and the lease of Samaná Bay. The cabinet discussed the treaties at a meeting on December 21. Fish dismissed annexation, seeing the island as politically unstable. Grant supported it, believing acquisition of the majority-black <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> increase commerce, create a refuge for African Americans, and help to exploit the island's natural resources. He lobbied Sumner in hopes of influencing him to help with passage of the treaties. Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to Grant, but to no avail; Sumner was set against annexation and on June 30, 1870, the Senate rejected the treaties. A congressional investigation headed by Senator Carl Schurz revealed speculators had promoted the treaties' passage. Unwilling to admit defeat, Grant convinced Congress to send a commission to investigate. Although the commission approved Grant's call for annexation in its findings, the Senate remained opposed and Grant was forced to abandon further efforts. Grant retaliated by firing Sumner's friend and Minister to Great Britain, John Lothrop Motley, while he pressured the Senate to depose Sumner of his chairmanship.|$|E

He therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country, such as Liberia or Sierra Leone, though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals.|$|E

25|$|Knygnešiai (Lithuanian book smugglers) smuggled illegal {{books and}} {{periodicals}} across the border. The {{number of such}} publications kept increasing despite strict sanctions and persecution of the activists. The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius has described the ban {{as a test of}} the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote, and the modern <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> never have been created.|$|E
25|$|MAD divided {{potential}} {{nuclear war}} into two stages: first strike and second strike.

It received the greatest opposition from the Chamber of Deputies, which ultimately ratified it 51 to 35. In the end, the Mexican Congress ratified the treaty to ensure that the <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> be free of foreign rule, to prevent further loss of land, and to help the country begin to heal.|$|E
