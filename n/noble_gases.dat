5|$|The <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> {{have full}} valence {{electron}} shells. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer electrons from heavy <b>noble</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. <b>Noble</b> <b>gases</b> are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Noble</b> <b>gases,</b> having {{complete}} electron shells, defied reaction {{with other}} elements until 1962 when Neil Bartlett reported synthesis of xenon hexafluoroplatinate; xenon difluoride, tetrafluoride, hexafluoride, and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then. Among other <b>noble</b> <b>gases,</b> krypton forms a difluoride, and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be radon difluoride. Binary fluorides of lighter <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are exceptionally unstable: argon and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give argon fluorohydride. Helium and neon have no long-lived fluorides, and no neon fluoride {{has ever been}} observed; helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures.|$|E

A satisfactory global fit to this molecular and crystal data is then reproduced by the model to within several percent.

5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} steadily in atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. <b>Noble</b> <b>gases</b> have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier <b>noble</b> <b>gases,</b> however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. <b>Noble</b> <b>gases</b> cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> {{would be}} equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> aided {{in the development of}} a general understanding of atomic structure. In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the <b>noble</b> <b>gases,</b> but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, and that for all <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the octet rule, which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.|$|E

5|$|The <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> (historically {{also the}} inert gases) {{make up a}} group of {{chemical}} elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> that occur naturally are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to relativistic effects; its chemistry {{has not yet been}} investigated.|$|E
5|$|The <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> {{are nearly}} ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} ideal gas law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the <b>noble</b> <b>gases</b> are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} forces between {{atoms and}} molecules {{are important in}} a number of processes of practical importance, including line broadening in radiative processes, gas and crystal properties, adhesion, and thin films. The components of the physical forces between <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> atoms, alkali ions, and halogen ions are analyzed and a data base for the dispersion forces is developed from the literature based on evaluations with the harmonic oscillator dispersion model for higher order coefficients. The Zener model of the repulsive core is used {{in the context of the}} recent asymptotic wave functions of Handler and Smith; and an effective ionization potential within the Handler and Smith wave functions is defined to analyze the two body potential data of Waldman and Gordon, the alkali-halide molecular data, and the <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> crystal and salt crystal data.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid <b>noble</b> <b>gases,</b> though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the <b>noble</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|E

For 20 Ne, 40 Ar, 84 Kr and 132 Xe, some samples show abundances {{higher than}} air, {{while others are}} lower, with a general trend of increasing nuclide concentrations with depth. Gas samples with <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> nuclide abundances higher than air show oxygen concentration in the gas phase lower than the atmosphere, probably due to chemical consumption of oxygen during the drilling process. In turn, <b>gas</b> samples with <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> abundances lower than air contain additional formation gases (methane), which reduces the <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> abundances. However, for all samples, the 20 Ne normalized <b>noble</b> <b>gas</b> nuclide abundance (X/ 20 Ne) are atmospheric for 40 Ar, 84 Kr and 132 Xe.
