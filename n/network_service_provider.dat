25|$|Bill C-60 {{prescribed}} {{that network}} service providers are only required to remove content pursuant {{to a court}} order. However, it required network service providers to operate by a notice-and-notice system: allegations of copyright infringement needed to be forwarded to the subscriber. While failure to forward the notice came with a maximum damage award of $5,000, there was no penalty for filing a wrongful notice. The bill required the <b>network</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> retain subscriber identity records for six months upon receipt of an infringement notice and for one year in the even of legal proceedings. Failure to do so came with statutory damages of up to $10,000 for the <b>network</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b>|$|E

Furthermore, mobile number portability has enhanced mobility of subscribers across networks. Mobile number portability means that subscribers can switch mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> without changing their mobile number despite it being {{issued by the}} network they are leaving. The price war amongst <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> means that all mobile network operators offer mobile voice calls and access to mobile data at comparable rates.
