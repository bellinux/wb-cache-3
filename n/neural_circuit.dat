25|$|The {{neuronal}} circuitry {{affected by}} LTP/LTD and modified by scaling and metaplasticity leads to reverberatory <b>neural</b> <b>circuit</b> development and regulation in a Hebbian manner which is manifested as memory, whereas {{the changes in}} neural circuitry, which begin {{at the level of}} the synapse, are an integral part in the ability of an organism to learn.|$|E
25|$|With {{substantial}} cognitive load, fMRI signals {{indicate a}} common network of frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum. This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses. The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both {{a direct and}} an indirect circuit. The <b>neural</b> <b>circuit</b> responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe. This main circuit originates in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex and then projects through the striatum and thalamus {{to return to the}} prefrontal cortex.|$|E

40|$|<b>Neural</b> <b>circuits</b> are remodeled in {{response}} to developmental and environmental cues. Here we show that glia secrets Myoglianin, a TGF-β ligand, to instruct developmental neural remodeling in Drosophila. Glial Myoglianin up-regulates neuronal expression of an ecdysone nuclear receptor that triggers neurite remodeling following the late-larval ecdysone peak. This observation reveals that glia orchestrate developmental neural remodeling not only via engulfment of unwanted neurites but also through enabling neuron remodeling. Results and Discussions To establish and refine functional <b>neural</b> <b>circuits,</b> neurons alter connections as the organism matures. In Drosophila, larval brain <b>neural</b> <b>circuits</b> are remodeled into adult ones during metamorphosis 1. Neurons forming functional larval <b>neural</b> <b>circuits</b> prune their <b>neural</b> projections by local degeneration in early metamorphosis and re-extend their neurites to form the adult-specific <b>neural</b> <b>circuits</b> 2 - 4. This phenomenon requires activation of the TGF-β signaling in the remodeling neurons. TGF-βsignaling up-regulates expression of the B 1 isoform of the ecdysone receptor (EcR-B 1) at the late larval stage 5. Then, the pruning o...|$|R
2500|$|In 1968 Zellig Harris {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{metalanguage}} {{is in the}} language," [...] suggesting that self-replication is part of language. In 1977 Niklaus Wirth formalized this proposition by publishing a self-replicating deterministic context-free grammar. Adding to it probabilities, Bertrand du Castel published in 2015 a self-replicating stochastic grammar and presented a mapping of that grammar to neural networks, thereby presenting {{a model for a}} self-replicating <b>neural</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The innate immune {{response}} to infectious and sterile injury is modulated by neural circuits that control cytokine production period. The inflammatory reflex is a prototypical <b>neural</b> <b>circuit</b> that controls cytokine {{production in the}} spleen. Action potentials transmitted via the vagus nerve to spleen mediate the release of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that inhibits cytokine release by interacting with alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRNA7) expressed on cytokine-producing cells. [...] The motor arc of the inflammatory reflex is termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of <b>neural</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{a reflex}} arc, which {{begins with a}} sensory input and ends with a motor output, passing through a sequence of neurons connected in series. [...] This can be shown in the [...] "withdrawal reflex" [...] causing a hand to jerk back after a hot stove is touched. [...] The circuit begins with sensory receptors in the skin that are activated by harmful levels of heat: [...] a special type of molecular structure embedded in the membrane causes heat to change the electrical field across the membrane. [...] If the change in electrical potential {{is large enough to}} pass the given threshold, it evokes an action potential, which is transmitted along the axon of the receptor cell, into the spinal cord. [...] There the axon makes excitatory synaptic contacts with other cells, some of which project (send axonal output) to the same region of the spinal cord, others projecting into the brain. [...] One target is a set of spinal interneurons that project to motor neurons controlling the arm muscles. [...] The interneurons excite the motor neurons, and if the excitation is strong enough, some of the motor neurons generate action potentials, which travel down their axons {{to the point where they}} make excitatory synaptic contacts with muscle cells. [...] The excitatory signals induce contraction of the muscle cells, which causes the joint angles in the arm to change, pulling the arm away.|$|E
