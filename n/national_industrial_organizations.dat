40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{factors influencing}} {{the development of}} innovation and creativity in <b>national</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> regarding the positions of organizational behaviour and management psychology. The paper also examines the "consolidation" of innovation in the organization and looks at forming an innovation team. A study on the processes occurring in the teams at various stages of forming, differentiation, integration and maturity has been carried out. The article investigates changes in team relations and potential psychological problems that may appear in a team shifting from one evolution stage to another. Besides, the article provides the analysis of problems arising from {{the composition of the}} team, design of work and the context of the efficiency of the innovation team at various stages of its development. It is posited, that the relationship between team coherence and its productivity lies in the norms functioning within the team. In turn, the functions approximating the interdependence of the psychological climate taking into account the organization factors of the organization have been observed. The analysis of approximating functions reveal that when a team goes through the stages of forming, differentiation, integration and maturity, the factors of organizational behaviour exert an ever increasing influence on the psychological climate of the team. The more the team is focused on a task, the more it becomes intolerant of organizational behaviour stimuli...|$|E

40|$|The hydro {{electrification}} of Costa Rica both has {{a positive}} and negative theme for the province. At one point the use and shift towards hydroelectricity and ‘clean energy’ is seen as beneficial since they are moving away from traditional ‘dirty’ energy. Moreover, the country {{is known for its}} commitment towards renewable energy (United <b>National</b> <b>Industrial</b> Development <b>Organization,</b> 2014, p.). On the other side, hydroelectricity is costly both towards the actual construction of it and the cost it has to the environment and the people living in the proposed areas. We will be exploring the proposal of hydroelectric dams in Costa Rica and their negative effects on the environment and the local community. We will explore the area of the Chirripo Valley. We will be looking at a number of proposed dams in the area and how they could potentially impact the environment, cultural, and the communities. Our goal with this project is to create visual, accessible assessments of hydropower development in Costa Rica that {{can be used as a}} powerful educational medium in order to engage and involve local communities for more active and participatory management.

The development of an instrument that can accurately measure student attitude toward STEM is crucial to STEM-based programs, their intended outcomes, and the companies that aid in their function as well as hope to reap the benefits from their products. The intent {{of this study was to}} develop an instrument to measure the current level of attitude that students ‟ exhibit toward STEM and STEM education. A variation of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model, Taxonomy of Education Objectives – Handbook II, and other pertinent instruments were utilized as sources of inspiration for the development of the instrument. The developed and selected items were submitted to a panel of experts representative of STEM and STEM education. Initial pilot testing refine...|$|R
50|$|Unions began {{forming in}} the American rubber {{industry}} after {{passage of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Industrial</b> Recovery Act in June 1933. Goodyear, B. F.

But workers at U.S. Rubber remained by and large satisfied with working conditions, and unionization made little inroad among company employees. Ching, however, saw unionization coming. Although the United Rubber Workers (URW) had made few inroads among the company's workers, Ching met with URW and Congress of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organizations</b> (CIO) organizers and arranged for card check elections at U.S. Rubber factories. Unionization of the company proceeded without the acrimony observed at other rubber manufacturers, and contracts were quickly signed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBased on {{the theory}} of scale economies, this paper probes the {{mechanism}} and measures of adjusting <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> structure to promote energy saving and emission reduction. The structural factors and efficiency factors influencing energy consumption per unit of GDP interact with each other. Among which, the interaction between economies of scale and <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> structure constitutes the implementation mechanism that <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> structure is adjusted to promote energy saving and emission reduction. The empirical study of energy efficiency of some enterprises in the steel industry in China demonstrates the close relationship between energy efficiency and the scale of enterprises.

40|$|If more {{productive}} firms grow relatively fast, an industry performs better, even when no firm exhibits technical or efficiency change. In other words, the two well-known sources of productivity growth-technology and efficiency-can be augmented {{by a third}} one, namely the <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> effect. In this paper the efficiency of an <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> and its contribution to performance are measured by benchmarking all firms on the industry. More precisely, efficiency {{is measured by the}} proximity between a firm and the best practices. Aggregation of firm efficiencies is imperfect. The bias is used to measure the efficiency of the <b>industrial</b> <b>organization.</b> In benchmarking, change transmitted by a firm represents productivity growth and change transmitted by the best practices represents technical change. Although I use a nonparametric framework, which requires only input and output information, duality analysis reveals the Solow residual. In discrete time Malmquist indices capture the measurement of the <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> effect, efficiency changes, and technical change.

To achieve {{the purpose of the}} study, two null hypotheses were stated, a sectional survey was conducted using data which were from the Nigerian Engineering works, Port Harcourt, with the aid of questionnaire and personal discussions. The response of the questionnaire services serve as the basic element of the study. The instrument for collecting the primary data consisted of 120 copies of questionnaire administered personally to the respondents, which constituted the sample size. The hypotheses were tested with the use of Chi-square (X 2) formula. The findings of the research revealed that change management is a great phenomenon that enhances the performance of the <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> and that if more attentions are given, <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> definitely will have a good standard.

40|$|A firm {{which sells}} its product {{in a free}} {{competition}} market where the exchange price remains stationary, determines the quantity of goods to be produced equaling marginal cost to marginal revenues. In this paper we consider the more general case of markets with price instabilities. To this aim we: i) propose a simple mathematical model for describing the structure of <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations,</b> ii) determine the mathematical concept which expresses the Stiglerian flexibility for an <b>industrial</b> <b>organization.</b> In this way we give a precise meaning to the classical definition of flexible <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> which reads as follow: " a flexible <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> permit to approximate the best technology for any output, {{at the cost of}} not being able to use the best technology for any output " (see [2] on pg. 315). In the framework of the aforementioned model it is possible to introduce the concept of tactics (time dependent production regime) chosen by a firm as a response to price instability and to prove that the presence of exchange price instability enriches the manifold of <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> which are competitive. Indeed we characterize the manifolds of equally competitive <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> as the level curves of the previously introduced profit function. ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{industries}} {{in terms of}} the concepts of chains, clusters and networks is becoming increasingly important in economies around the world. Supply chain management for an individual organization is an emerging field of research in the construction management discipline, but less attention has been devoted to investigating the nature of the construction supply chains and their industrial organizational economic environment. This selected review of construction and mainstream management supply chain literature is organized around four themes; distribution, production, strategic procurement management and <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> economics, and highlights the need to develop an <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> economic supply chain framework for construction. The merging of the supply chain concept with the <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> model as a methodology for understanding firm conduct and industry structure and performance is an important contribution to both construction supply chain and construction economic theory. Much of the <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> supply chain literature has tended to focus upon manufacturing industries, where typically firms are permanent organizations. This raises issues as to the differences between industries founded upon temporary compared with permanent organizations. There is potential for the development of an <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> methodology applicable to the project based industry. Ultimately <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> research seeks to have direct implications for industry performance and government policies. <br /...|$|R
