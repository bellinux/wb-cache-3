Such a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve is consistent with the existence of adverse effects on most components of aggregate expenditure documented in previous empirical studies. The long-term consequences of terrorism are similar to those related to a negative supply shock.

50|$|The core {{demographic}} variables are population size and population growth: {{the more people}} in the economy, the greater the demand for housing. But this is an oversimplification. It is necessary to consider family size, the age composition of the family, the number of first and second children, <b>net</b> migration (<b>immigration</b> minus emigration), non-family household formation, the number of double-family households, death rates, divorce rates, and marriages. In housing economics, the elemental unit of analysis is not the individual, as it is in standard partial equilibrium models. Rather, it is households, which demand housing services: typically one household per house. The size and demographic composition of households is variable and not entirely exogenous. It is endogenous to the housing market in the sense that as the price of housing services increase, household size will tend also to increase.|$|R

However, migration scholars such as Gordon Hanson and Douglas Massey have criticized this view for being oversimplified and not accounting for contradictory evidence, such as the low <b>net</b> illegal <b>immigration</b> from Mexico to the US before the 1980s despite significant economic disparity. Douglas Massey argues that there is bifurcation {{in the labor market}} in developed countries, which creates a structural demand for unskilled immigrant labor to fill undesirable jobs which citizens do not seek, regardless of wages. That means that postindustrial economies have a widening gap between well-paying, white-collar jobs that require ever higher levels of education and human capital, for which citizens and legal immigrants can qualify, and bottom-tier jobs that are stigmatized, require no education and are often filled by undocumented immigrants.Massey argues that this refutes claims that undocumented immigrants are [...] "lowering wages" [...] or stealing jobs from native-born workers, and that it instead shows that undocumented immigrants [...] "take jobs that no one else wants." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Sikhs as a {{political}} entity, distinct from other Indian traditions, {{can be said to}} have begun with the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev Ji in 1606, Sikh distinction was further enhanced by the establishment of the Sikh 'Pure' brotherhood or Khalsa (ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ), by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1699. [...] This gives the Sikhs, as an organized political grouping, a relatively recent history of around 400 years. Migrations of Sikhs during the era of the Gurus were limited to the boundaries of modern-day India and Pakistan, and in particular restricted to the Sikh tribal heartland of the Punjab Region. The development of the Sikh Confederacy and the development of the Sikh Empire (1716-1849), led to Sikhs migrating to conquered parts of their empire such as Ladakh and Peshawar. However these migrations were limited, transitory and unsustained, depending on the Empire's fluctuating boundaries. During the time of the Sikh Empire, there was a <b>net</b> cultural <b>immigration,</b> with Napoleonic and British influences vying for the 'ear' of the then Sikh Maharajah Ranjit Singh. With respect to the Sikh diaspora, the most important political aspect of this period was the historical establishment of a Sikh homeland; the idea of a powerful Sikh state was a reality.|$|R

2500|$|The early Chinese {{migrants}} to Singapore were predominantly males. In 1826, the official census {{figures show that}} {{out of a total}} population of 13,750, there were 5,747 Chinese males but only 341 Chinese females. [...] Most of the Chinese females in this early period of Singapore were nyonyas from Malacca as women from China were discouraged from emigrating. It was noted in 1837 that there were no Chinese women in Singapore who had emigrated directly from China; even as late as 1876, a British official in Singapore wrote {{that he did not know}} of any respectable Chinese woman who had emigrated with her husband. The imbalance of the sexes of the Chinese community continued for a long time with the continual flow into Singapore of male migrant workers who were either single or had left their wives and children behind in China; for example, the 1901 census figures show that there were 130,367 Chinese males compared to 33,674 Chinese females. For a long period, most of the Chinese population in early Singapore were immigrants as many did not intend to settle permanently to raise their family there; even by the late 1890s, only around 10% of the Chinese population in Singapore were born there. [...] The early migrant Chinese workers worked to send money back to their family in China, and many would then return to China after they had earned enough money. However, an increasing number would also choose to settle permanently in Singapore, especially in the 1920s when more chose to remain in Singapore rather than leave. Change in social attitude in the modern era also meant that Chinese women were freer to emigrate from China, and the sex ratio began to normalise in the 20th century. This gradual normalisation of sex ratio led to an increase in the number of native births. [...] Immigration would continue to be the main reason for the Chinese population increase in Singapore until the 19311947 period when the natural increase in population would surpass the <b>net</b> <b>immigration</b> figures.|$|E

The Ts were issues for all respondents except those from community rehabilitation programs (CRP) and disability navigators (DN). There were numerous suggestions for improving DSB services with the primary suggestion being to increase funding (for the 3 Ts). Other suggestions were to reduce administrative barriers (eligibility for services, paper work), better inform target audiences (medical personnel) and improve outreach to minority communities.
