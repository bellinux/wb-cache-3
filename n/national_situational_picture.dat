40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of emergency response largely depends {{on having a}} precise, up-to-date <b>situational</b> <b>picture.</b> With the World Wide Web having evolved from a small read-only text collection to a large-scale collection of socially created data accessible both to machines and humans alike, {{with the advent of}} social media and ubiquitous mobile applications, new sources of information are available. Currently, that potentially valuable information remains mostly unused by the command staff, mainly because the sheer amount of information cannot be handled efficiently. In this paper, we show an approach for turning massive amounts of unstructured citizen-generated content into relevant information supporting the command staff in making better informed decisions. We leverage Linked Open Data and crowdsourcing for processing data from social media, and we show how the combination of human intelligence in the crowd and automatic approaches for enhancing the <b>situational</b> <b>picture</b> with Linked Open Data will lead to a Web 3. 0 approach for more efficient information handling in crisis management...|$|R

40|$|Language {{is used by}} {{many people}} in the world to {{communicate}} with others. Among languages in the world, English is an important language that should be learned. In the 1994 curriculum, English is optionally taught in the elementary school as a local content, beginning from grade 4. In teaching elementary school pupils who can be categorized as beginners, the teacher should give the basic material, vocabulary because vocabulary is central to language mastery which should be given the first priority in the language teaching learning process. Learning English vocabulary brings some problems, like the pupils get bored, they do not have interest in learning English vocabulary given; therefore, the English teachers should provide an interesting way of teaching. To solve the problems, there are many ways that have to be done by the teachers. In this study, the writer suggests a media in teaching English vocabulary to elementary school pupils, that is by using pictures. Pictures as a means of teaching English to beginners have a great number of advantages. Pictures can arouse the pupils' interest and motivate them to learn English (Gunarso 1982 : 14). The visual aids that are used in this study are pictures. There are two kinds of pictures, individual <b>pictures</b> and <b>situational</b> <b>pictures.</b> Individual pictures of person or things, such as a cat, a bus. a farmer, etc are used to introduce vocabulary and <b>situational</b> <b>pictures</b> of person or objects which are in action, such as a man drawing on the blackboard {{can also be used to}} enlarge the pupils' vocabularies. This study is a library study. The writer, therefore, hopes that later somebody could conduct a field research dealing with the topic of this thesis to confirm that the teaching by using pictures can improve the teaching learning of English vocabulary...|$|R

On the other hand, the parking scenario, which generally entails more direct association with other actors over limited resources, would include a greater emphasis on other driver’s intentions. Thus, employing SA properly requires a significant devotion of cognitive (and, more recently, computational) resources as well as recognition of the appropriate level of focus for new input and ongoing analysis. That is, staying in the bounds of a sea channel takes on a lower priority in an emergency collision avoidance maneuver at sea.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Information Fusion {{coordinates}} large-volume {{data processing}} machines to address user needs. Users expect a <b>situational</b> <b>picture</b> {{to extend their}} ability of sensing events, movements, and activities. Typically, data is collected and processed for object location (e. g. target identification) and movement (e. g. tracking); however, high-level reasoning or situational understanding depends on the spatial, cultural, and political effects. In this paper, we explore opportunities where information fusion can aid in the selection and processing of the data for enhanced tacit knowledge understanding by (1) display fusion for data presentation (e. g. cultural segmentation), (2) interactive fusion to allow the user to inject a priori knowledge (e [...] g. cultural values), and (3) associated metrics of predictive capabilities (e. g. cultural networks). In a simple scenario for target identification with deception, cultural information impacts on situational understanding is demonstrated using the Technology-Emotion-Culture-Knowledge (TECK) attributes of the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) model...|$|R
40|$|Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is the {{capability}} of understanding events, circumstances and activities within and impacting the maritime environment. Nowadays, the vessel positioning sensors provide {{a vast amount of}} data that could enhance the maritime knowledge if analysed and modelled. Vessel positioning data is dynamic and continuous on time and space, requiring spatio-temporal data mining techniques to derive knowledge. In this paper, several spatio-temporal data mining techniques are proposed to enhance the MSA, tackling existing challenges such as automatic maritime route extraction and synthetic representation, mapping vessels activities, anomaly detection or position and track prediction. The aim is to provide a more complete and interactive Maritime <b>Situational</b> <b>Picture</b> (MSP) and, hence, to provide more capabilities to operational authorities and policy-makers to support the decision-making process.

Within this framework, di erent types of knowledge (e. g. a priori, contextual) with associated uncertainty can be fused together for situation assessment by expressing unobservable complex events as a logical combination of simpler evidences.

Trial runs were made over several months, collecting reporting data from a number of different sources, over the Gulf of Aden and the Western Indian Ocean. Also satellite radar surveillance was carried out in order to sample the presence of non-reporting ships. The trial showed that satellite AIS is a powerful tool for basin-wide ship traffic monitoring; that multiple AIS satellites are needed for sufficient completeness and update rate; and that coastal AIS and LRIT still provide essential complements to the satellite AIS data. The radar survey showed that about half of the radar-detected ships are not seen in the reporting data.

40|$|Despite {{well over}} two decades of {{academic}} research, situation awareness in complex collaborative environments remains ambiguous. Recent systems-based models of distributed situation awareness have attempted to address this; however, further effort is required in clarifying exactly how situation awareness operates in complex socio-technical systems. One pertinent issue regards what the ‘distributed’ <b>situational</b> <b>picture</b> looks like {{from the perspective of}} each component of the system and how it differs amongst team members. Is the same picture ‘shared’ across team members, or do they have different, but compatible, views on the situation? This article tackles this question by presenting a distributed cognition-inspired systems-based model of situation awareness in collaborative systems, along with an accompanying modelling approach, the propositional network methodology. Following this, the paper focuses explicitly on the model's sub-concept of compatible situation awareness and uses case study evidence to demonstrate how awareness is distributed between, and differs between, team members. This view is then compared to existing team situation awareness views and the implications for collaborative system design are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Situational {{awareness}} plays a {{major role}} in many military and civilian operations. Apart from the identity, type, location and dynamics of targets of interest, the <b>situational</b> <b>picture</b> may also provide other target information, such as weapons state, fuel status and intent. Many legacy systems incorporate an automatic tracking capabil-ity, with identification, situational assessment and decision-making being left to the operators. The automation of many of these functions is the focus of much research and development. A necessary prerequisite for updating the state of a target is the correct association of measurements or other information to the track. The ability of Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model the uncertain rela-tionships between continuous and discrete variables make them excellent candidates for incorporating both kinematic and attribute information in the association process. A BBN model for a single scan data associa-tion problem is presented and used to develop a global nearest neighbours solution using both kinematic and attribute information. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the benefit of using attribute information in the association process. ...|$|R

40|$|Building and {{updating}} a <b>situational</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the scenario}} under consideration {{is the goal}} of the Situation Assessment (SA) Information Fusion (IF) process. The scenario generally involves multiple entities and actors where possibly only a few under direct control of the decision maker. SA aims at explaining the observed events (mainly) by establishing the entities and actors involved, inferring their goals, understanding the relations existing (whether permanently or temporarily) between them, the surrounding environment, and past and present events. It is therefore apparent how the SA process inherently hinges on understanding and reasoning about relations. SA is a necessary preparatory step to the following phase of Impact Assessment (IA) where the decision maker is interested in estimating the evolution of the situation and the possible outcomes, dangers and threats. SA and IA processes are particularly complex and critical for large-scale scenarios with nearly chaotic dynamics such as those affected by natural or man-made disasters. This chapter will discuss recent developments in information fusion methods for representing and reasoning about relational information and knowledge for event detection in the context of crisis management.

40|$|Automatic ship {{reporting}} systems (mainly AIS and LRIT) today provide rather complete coverage {{of all the}} larger (> 300 GT) vessels. Coastal receivers linked in networks (MSSIS, SafeSeaNet, …) {{and a growing number}} of space-based receivers provide a global reach. At JRC (the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre) the so-called “Blue Hub” has been set up to continuously ingest data from such systems (via internet), store them in a database, compile ship tracks, predict ship positions to the current time and display the result – the real-time Maritime <b>Situational</b> <b>Picture</b> (MSP) – on a web browser. Historic data, including the collection of stored MSPs (at 15 min interval), are used to derive statistical distributions of ship density, as a function of ship type or ship behaviour (e. g. fishing). Finally, the continuously available MSP based on the ship reporting data is complemented with incidental samplings of non-cooperative ships using satellite SAR images (Cosmo-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X, Radarsat- 2). This shows that only about 50 % of the ships detected in satellite SAR images are reporting in AIS or LRIT. The system has been used during 6 months periods over ocean-basin wide areas in the Western Indian Ocean (2011 - 2012) and off West Africa including the Gulf of Guinea (2012 - 2013), producing maritime awareness of hitherto unavailable levels.

The {{potential impact of}} these dependencies (for example if the IT systems are lacking appropriate security levels) are remarkable – the malfunction or total loss of public energy grids, the banking system, supply chains or public administration can cause enormous economic damage and massively affect entire nations.

To our knowledge {{this was the first}} time when a joint research effort resulted in methods and technological tools that can be integrated with existing procedures and technologies in order to achieve the most effective and cost-efficient means of mitigating the impact of suicides and trespasses on railway infrastructures. As clearly indicated in the state-of-the-art review, in order to mitigate the consequences of such incidents, system shut down time must be minimised. The project allowed a systematic identification of several important interfaces between IMs, RUs and first responders involved in managing suicide or fatal trespassing incidents [26], and modelled three key-elements with direct impact on the post-incident disruption time. The operational arrangements, represented by the information reference source, support the stakeholders as they assimilate the identified methods, tools, procedures and man agerial models in order to reduce the shut down time associated to suicides and trespassing incidents. The collection of best practice concerning information, situation management and decision support platform [27], as well as the line restoration model (LRM) [28] were meant to improve the <b>situational</b> <b>picture</b> of the incident, the information collection and dissemination tools, the management of the business processes related to the incident response and decision making processes of the involved IM and RU; between them and the first responders, primarily the police; contractors and other RUs. Therefore, the added value of RESTRAIL comprised new products which help improve the full range of operational and technical arrangements between key responders, whilst enabling the responding organisations to meet their legal responsibilities.|$|R
40|$|Background: Aphasia {{has very}} serious {{consequences}} for speech production and, hence, for communication in daily life. Nevertheless, {{in the standard}} diagnostic procedures and in clinical practice, analysis of speech production in daily life is usually ignored or is restricted to the scoring {{of one or more}} variables on rating scales. Many methods for describing and analysing discourse production have been developed during the last few decades, with different aims and focusing on different linguistic levels. Aims: The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a critical review of the various methods that are currently used for the analysis of spontaneous speech ("discourse") of aphasic patients. A distinction is made between semi-spontaneous speech (description of <b>situational</b> <b>pictures</b> or story telling) and "real" spontaneous speech (conversations or interviews based on standardised questions). Both types of connected speech can be analysed with two types of measuring instruments: rating scales and quantified linguistic variables. The advantages and disadvantages of the measuring instruments most frequently used for pragmatic, conversational, and linguistic analyses are discussed. Special attention is paid to the (ecological) validity and reliability of the methods. Main Contribution: The general outcome of the evaluation of procedures for analysing speech production and communicative abilities is that several methods do not fulfil the requirements for reliability and validity. Other methods are extremely time-consuming or give little information on the consequences of the outcomes for clinical practice. Conclusions: None of the discussed procedures is perfect, although some are better than others. Most methods do not give indications for treatment of speech production and communicative disorders in daily life and are not suitable for determining changes in the spontaneous speech of individual patients...|$|R

The results represent state-of-the-art of cooperative long-range capabilities. During 2011 – 2013, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission has carried out two campaigns for counter-piracy surveillance under the name “Piracy, Maritime Awareness and Risks”(PMAR), each for 6 -month; the first focussed on the seas off the Horn of Africa, the second on the Gulf of Guinea. The AIS performance was analysed {{in terms of the}} number of ships seen (up to 2, 850 in the second campaign), the freshness (average maximum time gap between AIS messages over all ships was 4. 4 hours), the fraction of ships that are updated every 3 hours (increased from 21 % in January 2012 to 49 % in March 2013), and other indicators. The marginal value when adding data sources was analysed. E. g., considering the data from the various AIS providers in March 2013, it is found that the average number of ships detected per day increased by 384 when increasing from one to two providers and by another 31 adding the third provider, whereas terrestrial AIS increased the number of ships with another 93. The average maximum time gap was reduced from 10. 9 hours to 4. 4 hours in steps of 1. 9, 2. 7 and 1. 9 hours.

This leads to deficits in the treatment of moderate to severe pain as well as in opioid agonist therapy. Objective: The study objective was to elaborate the reasons for this inadequacy. The work plan of the Access to Opioid Medication in Europe (ATOME) project included two six-country workshops. These workshops comprised a <b>national</b> <b>situational</b> analysis, drafting tailor-made recommendations for improvement and developing action plans for their implementation. Methods: In total, 84 representatives of the national Ministries of Health, national controlled substances authorities, experts representing regulatory and law enforcement authorities, leading health care professionals, and patient representatives from 13 European countries participated in either one of the workshops. The delegates used breakout sessions to identify key common challenges. Content analysis was used for the evaluation of protocols and field notes. Results: A number of challenges to opioid accessibility in the countries was identified in the domains of knowledge and educational, regulatory, legislative, as well as public awareness and training barriers that limit opioid prescription. In addition, short validity of prescriptions and bureaucratic practices resulting in overregulation impeded availablity of some essential medicines. Stigmatization and criminalisation of people who use drugs remained the major impediment to increasing opioid agonist program coverage. Conclusions: The challenges identified during outcomes of the workshops were used as the basis for subsequent dissemination and implementation activities in the ATOME project, and in some countries the workshop proceedings already served as a stepping-stone for the first changes in regulations and legislation...|$|R
40|$|Description Slides of the {{presentation}} of the STORM (Safeguarding Cultural Heritage through Technical and Organisational Resources Management) project at the European Meteorological Society's Annual Meeting, 4 - 8 September 2017, in Dublin, Ireland. The theme of the conference was ‘Serving Society with better Weather and Climate Information’, making it an ideal location to present STORM. The project was presented in the ‘Deriving actionable information from climate prediction on decadal to scenario time scales’ session, which focused on tailoring climate scenarios to facilitate end-user decisions and actions and to support climate change impact assessments. Abstract The protection and conservation of cultural heritage is of utmost importance for our society, not only in order to preserve the cultural identity, but also because cultural heritage is a wealth creator, bringing tourism-related business opportunities on which many communities depend. However, Europe’s heritage assets are extremely exposed to climate change and natural hazards. The goal of the STORM (Safeguarding Cultural Heritage through Technical and Organisational Management) project is to provide critical decision-making tools to multiple sectors and stakeholders engaged in the protection of cultural heritage from climate change and natural hazards on the local, regional and national levels. The concept is tested through pilot site studies at five different heritage locations, all with unique risk profiles: the Diocletian Baths in Rome, Italy; the Mellor Heritage site, Manchester, UK; the Roman Ruins of Tróia, Setúbal, Portugal; the Historical Centre of Rethymno on Crete, Greece and Ephesus, Izmir, Turkey. The evaluation of historical records, real-time on-site monitoring, regional climate projections, and statistically downscaled time series for individual cultural heritage sites at risk supports the risk assessment methods on which these tools are based. In addition, climate indices are evaluated to create a complete <b>situational</b> <b>picture.</b> Here, the STORM project will be presented, focusing on the implementation of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate projections as well as meteorological observations in the risk assessment procedure, hence playing a pivotal role in cultural heritage conservation...|$|R
40|$|The PMAR-MASE project {{aimed to}} provide {{practical}} experience to {{authorities in the}} Eastern-Southern Africa / Indian Ocean region on wide-area maritime awareness. Data from automatic ship reporting systems (AIS and LRIT) have been received during one year over a large Area of Interest (AOI) in the Western Indian Ocean. The data were used to construct the Maritime <b>Situational</b> <b>Picture</b> (MSP) over the AOI, i. e. the map with the current positions of all reporting ships. The MSP has been served continuously in real time to two operational users in the region, between 15 Sep 2014 and 15 Sep 2015. The data have also been used to make monthly ship traffic density maps. Finally, a number of satellite images have been collected to probe {{for the presence of}} ships that are not seen on the reporting systems. This report assesses the quality (completeness and timeliness) of the ship reporting data and the resulting MSP; it presents the derived monthly ship density maps, split between slow moving and fast moving traffic in order to understand ship activity; and it present results on the fraction of non-reporting ships based on the analysis of the satellite images. The ship reporting data that were used are AIS data received by up to 16 satellites of four different operators, AIS data from various coastal networks in the region, and LRIT data from the Flags that use the EU LRIT Data Centre (“EU Flags”). Fusing the data from these systems – that amounts to more than 566, 000 incoming ship position messages per day (figures are given here for the month of June 2015) – it is found that on average, a total of 1, 522 ships are seen in the AOI on a daily basis. Of those, 11 (0. 7 %) are only seen by LRIT, {{in spite of the fact}} that LRIT contributes only a tiny 614 position reports per day (0. 1 %) on average. A sampling of the non-reporting ship traffic by satellite imaging has shown that 34 % of the ships detected in satellite radar images are not seen in AIS or LRIT. However, this fraction varies much from one location to another; among the limited locations sampled, it is highest off the Somali coast. JRC. G. 3 -Maritime affair...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background New and {{explosive}} HIV epidemics {{are being}} witnessed in certain countries of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, {{as well as}} a rapid and dramatic increase in the supply, use, and negative public health consequences of illicit drugs. A majority of registered HIV cases in Ukraine occur among injection drug users (IDUs), large numbers of whom report HIV risk behaviors such as needle sharing. The {{purpose of this study was}} to apply the World Health Organization's Rapid Assessment and Response on Injection Drug Use (IDU-RAR) guide to create a <b>situational</b> <b>picture</b> in the Vinnitsya Oblast, Ukraine, a region with very scarce information about the HIV/AIDS and injection drug use (IDU) epidemics. Methods The IDU-RAR uses a combination of qualitative data collection techniques commonly employed in social science and evaluation research to quickly depict the extent and nature of the given health problem and propose locally relevant recommendations for improvement. The investigators focused their assessment on the contextual factors, drug use, and intervention and policy components of the IDU-RAR. A combination of network and block sampling techniques was used. Data collection methods included direct observation, review of existing data, structured and unstructured interviews, and focus group discussions. Key informants and locations were visited until no new information was being generated. Results The number of registered HIV cases in Vinnitsya has increased from 3 (1987 – 1995) to 860 (1999 – 10 / 2004), 57 of whom have already died. Ten percent of annual admissions to the area's Regional Narcological Dispensary were for opiate disorders, and the number of registered IDUs rose by 20 % from 1999 to 2000. The level of HIV/AIDS awareness is generally poor among the general population but high among high-risk populations. Both HIV/AIDS and injection drug use carry a strong stigma in the community, even among medical professionals. There was very little evidence of primary HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, and IDU prevention efforts focused on promotion of anti-drug messages in the schools. Conclusion Given that Ukraine has sparse resources to be devoted to this problem, action recommendations should be prioritized, realistic, and initially targeted to persons in greatest need. The following action recommendations are prioritized by the following categories: First priority: Voluntary Counseling and Testing; Second Priority: Prevention and Education; and Third Priority: Harm Reduction and Treatment. They are provided in this sequence based on what response can realistically be implemented first with limited additional resources and can make the greatest immediate impact. The persons at greatest risk, HIV positive persons and IDUs, should be attended to first. </p...|$|R
