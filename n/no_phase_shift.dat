In the present study, {{the possibility that the}} differences in the effects of pentobarbital on the circadian rhythm may be due to different contributions of the GABA-ergic system to circadian organization in the two strains was tested by compar-ing the responses of SK mice with those of C 57 BL mice to muscimol (2 mg/kg), a GABA receptor agonist, and triazolam (25 mg/kg), which is thought to act by potentiating the action of GABA. The hypothesis that pentobarbital-induced <b>phase</b> <b>shifts</b> of SK mice are mediated by the GABA receptor system was also tested by observing whether the phase-shifting effects of pentobarbital were blocked by bicuculline (0. 5 mg/kg), a selective antagonist of GABA, in-jected 3 min prior to pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). The results indicated that muscimol induced phase advances at CT 8 and phase delays at CT 0, and triazolam induced phase advances at CT 8 in SK mice. <b>No</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifts</b> were induced by any treatment in C 57 BL mice.

50|$|Voltage {{harmonics}} {{are mostly}} caused by current harmonics. The voltage {{provided by the}} voltage source will be distorted by current harmonics due to source impedance. If the source impedance of the voltage source is small, current harmonics will cause only small voltage harmonics. It is typically the case that voltage harmonics are indeed small compared to current harmonics. For that reason, the voltage waveform can usually be approximated by the fundamental frequency of voltage. If this approximation is used, current harmonics produce {{no effect on the}} real power transferred to the load. An intuitive way to see this comes from sketching the voltage wave at fundamental frequency and overlaying a current harmonic with <b>no</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> (in order to more easily observe the following phenomenon). What can be observed is that for every period of voltage, there is equal area above the horizontal axis and below the current harmonic wave as there is below the axis and above the current harmonic wave. This means that the average real power contributed by current harmonics is equal to zero. However, if higher harmonics of voltage are considered, then current harmonics do make a contribution to the real power transferred to the load.|$|E

However, nonphotic factors, such as behavioral arousal and metabolic cues, can also <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNs) and/or reduce the synchronizing effects of light in nocturnal rodents. In diurnal rodents, the role of arousal or insufficient sleep in these functions is still poorly understood. In the present study, diurnal Sudanian grass rats, Arvicanthis ansorgei, were aroused at night by sleep deprivation (gentle handling) or caffeine treatment that both prevented sleep. <b>Phase</b> <b>shifts</b> of locomotor activity were analyzed in grass rats transferred from a light/dark cycle to constant darkness and aroused in early night or late night.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} whereby brief {{light exposure}} resets the mammalian circadian clock in a phase dependent manner is not known, but {{is thought to}} involve Per gene expression. At the behavioural level, a light pulse produces phase delays in early subjective night, phase advances in late subjective night, and <b>no</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifts</b> in mid-subjective night or subjective day. To {{understand the relationship between}} Per gene activity and behavioural <b>phase</b> <b>shifts,</b> we examined light-induced mPer 1 and mPer 2 expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mouse, in the subjective night, with a view to understanding SCN heterogeneity. In the VIP-containing region of the SCN (termed `core'), light-induced mPer 1 expression occurs at all times of the subjective night, while mPer 2 induction is seen only in early subjective night. In the remaining regions of the SCN (termed `shell'), a phase delaying light pulse produces no mPer 1 but signi®cant mPer 2 expression, while a phase advancing light pulse produces no mPer 2 but substantial mPer 1 induction. Moreover, following a light pulse during mid-subjective night, neither mPer 1 nor mPer 2 are induced in the shell. The results reveal that behavioural <b>phase</b> <b>shifts</b> occur only when light-induced Per gene expression spreads from the core to the shell SCN, with mPer 1 expression in shell corresponding to phase advances, and mPer 2 corresponding to phase delays.

40|$|In Syrian hamsters, {{circadian}} rhythms can be <b>phase</b> <b>shifted</b> {{by light}} {{at night or}} by behavioural arousal during the day (usual sleep period). Previous work in this lab has defined arousal procedures that have differential clock resetting effects; arousal stimulated by running in a novel wheel (WC) or by gentle handling (SD) can induce large <b>phase</b> advance <b>shifts,</b> whereas arousal by physical restraint (SLR), by confinement to a platform over water, or by caffeine administration have <b>no</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> effects. Pharmacological and immunocytochemical experiments were conducted to identify the neural basis for the differential effects of arousal procedures on circadian rhythms. A preliminary experiment evaluated whether modafinil, a pharmaceutical that produces arousal without stimulating activity or anxiety, can induce or modulate <b>phase</b> <b>shifts.</b> This agent, like caffeine, did not induce <b>phase</b> <b>shifts,</b> and thus represents an additional tool to identify neural correlates of clock resetting. Two extensive mapping experiments were then conducted, using c-fos and double-labeling immunocytochemistry for hypocretin or tryptophan hydroxylase. Double-labelling for c-fos and hypocretin revealed that SD and WC, both of which induce shifts, and SLR, which does not, all were associated with significant c-fos expression in hypocretin cells. Thus, activation of the hypocretin system {{is not sufficient to}} induce non-photic shifts. All three procedures also increased c-fos expression in the interge niculate leaflet, revealing no simple relationship between activation of this structure and circadian clock resetting. Examination of the serotonergic raphe nuclei and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) indicated that both WC and SD failed to increase c-fos expression in the serotonergic and non-serotonergic cells in these areas. Stressful restraint, however, significantly elevated the expression of c-fos in rostral DRN serotonin neurons and in the LC. Therefore, it appears that activation of these areas is neither necessary nor sufficient for non-photic shifts. Instead, the current results suggest that the rostral DRN and the LC may be involved in a stress-induced inhibition of <b>phase</b> <b>shifts</b> to arousal. Further behavioural and pharmacological experiments indicated that, if stress blocks <b>phase</b> <b>shifts</b> to arousal, it likely does so at the input stage and via a mechanism separate from glucocorticoid receptor activation...|$|R
