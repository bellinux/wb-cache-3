5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which {{probably}} caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E

On 4 June 1940, his encounter with a Dornier Do 17, which was attacking Allied shipping, involved a <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> while he was firing at the aircraft's rear gunner during a high-speed pass.

500|$|Lucid's stay aboard Mir {{ended with}} the flight of Atlantis on STS-79, which {{launched}} on 16 September. This, the fourth docking, saw John Blaha transferring onto Mir {{to take his place}} as resident US astronaut. His stay on the station improved operations in several areas, including transfer procedures for a docked space shuttle, [...] "hand-over" [...] procedures for long-duration American crew members and [...] "ham" [...] amateur radio communications, and also saw two spacewalks to reconfigure the station's power grid. Blaha spent four months with the EO-22 crew before returning to Earth aboard Atlantis on STS-81 in January 1997, at which point he was replaced by physician Jerry Linenger. During his flight, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian-built Orlan-M spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev, flying EO-23. All three crew members of EO-23 performed a [...] "fly-around" [...] in Soyuz TM-25 spacecraft. Linenger and his Russian crewmates Vasili Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Lazutkin faced several difficulties during the mission, including the most severe fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft (caused by a malfunctioning Vika), failures of various systems, a <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> with Progress M-33 during a long-distance TORU test and a total loss of station electrical power. The power failure also caused a loss of attitude control, which led to an uncontrolled [...] "tumble" [...] through space.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The hash {{function}} Skein is the submission of Ferguson et al. to the NIST Hash Competition, and is arguably a serious candidate for selection as SHA- 3. This paper presents the first third-party analysis of Skein, with an extensive study {{of its main}} component: the block cipher Threefish. We notably investigate <b>near</b> <b>collisions,</b> distinguishers, impossible differentials, key recovery using related-key differential and boomerang attacks. In particular, we present <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> on up to 17 rounds, an impossible differential on 21 rounds, a related-key boomerang distinguisher on 34 rounds, a known-related-key boomerang distinguisher on 35 rounds, and key recovery attacks on up to 32 rounds, out of 72 in total for Threefish- 512. None of our attacks directly extends to the full Skein hash. However, the pseudorandomness of Threefish is required to validate the security proofs on Skein, and our results conclude that at least 36 rounds of Threefish seem required for optimal security guarantees. ...|$|R

Linear Synchronous Motors (LSM) are used for high-acceleration speed during launching.

Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and sold vegetables. He briefly worked as a telegraph operator in 1863 for the Grand Trunk Railway at the railway station in Stratford, Ontario, at age 16. He [...] was held responsible for a <b>near</b> <b>collision.</b> He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.|$|E

2500|$|At {{around this}} time, the flight had a near midair {{collision}} with Delta Air Lines Flight 2315, reportedly missing the plane by only , as {{air traffic controller}} Dave Bottiglia frantically tried to tell the Delta pilot to take evasive action. Bottiglia {{was the first person}} in the control center to realize that Flight 175 was hijacked when he gave directions for a turn. Flight 175 did not respond, instead accelerating and heading toward the Delta plane. The controller commanded the Delta pilot, [...] "Take any evasive action necessary. We have an airplane that we don't know what he's doing. Any action at all." [...] Moments before Flight 175 crashed, it avoided another <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> with Midwest Express Flight 7, which was flying from Milwaukee to New York.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{predicts the}} risk of <b>near</b> midair <b>collisions</b> between {{airborne}} aircraft {{as a function of}} the type of controlled terminal airspace in which they occur, aircraft velocities, the geometries of approach patterns, and the number of flight operations which arise, end in or traverse these areas. Based on an analysis of <b>near</b> midair <b>collision</b> risk, the paper concludes that air carrier operations by themselves are safer than general aviation operations by themselves in radar-controlled environments such as a Terminal Control Area, but that general aviation operations by themselves are safer in less-controlled than in more-controlled airspace. By far the most risky flight appears to be general aviation aircraft interacting with other general aviation aircraft in positively-controlled environments such as a Terminal Control Area. We offer a model which describes the factors that influence <b>near</b> midair <b>collisions</b> and some reasons for a possible explanation of these surprising results. ...|$|R
