40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{measure of}} multiple motives (EMMM) is presented. The EMMM enables researchers to make quick exploratory assessments {{of a relatively}} large number of general motives. It includes 14 single-item self-report measures that assess self-control, self-esteem, sensation-seeking, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> acquisition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> power, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> precision, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> self-consistency, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> structure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> uniqueness, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to belong, {{and the need to}} buffer anxiety about death. Each single-item measure is sourced from previously-established psychometric scales. The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided <b>for</b> <b>the</b> divergent and convergent validity of its items. It is considered to be the Swiss Army knife of motivation measures: A small but versatile tool <b>for</b> understanding <b>the</b> complexity of human attitudes and behaviours...|$|R

On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to be withdrawn from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> assault was on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E

This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000.

Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid in the delivery of building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping quarters and the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may be <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{abdominal}} {{and joint}} pains. It is uncertain {{as to whether}} HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E

5|$|Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit {{served with}} the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy {{entering}} service during the late 1980s. Velebit, then named Soča, was like other Una-class submarines, named after rivers in Yugoslavia. In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata {{until the beginning of}} the war, when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> installation of a single MTU 105kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring {{the integrity of the}} virion particle.|$|E

DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Alfonsín's faction provided the support <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed president by the Congress.

5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and the brass guns <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> English navy were in short supply. Brass {{artillery}} pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber. The number of guns at the castle remained around the same, but the larger, brass culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a minion. In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E
