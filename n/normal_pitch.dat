2500|$|There are {{at least}} two {{possible}} reasons for why Silbermann invented his damper-lifting mechanism. [...] First, as an organ builder, he may have favored the idea of providing the player with a variety of tonal colors.

From this socio-psychological complex there seem to arise a complex of habitual musical practices which we call musical style" ...|$|E

60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, ethical strain is just as bad for us as {{physical}} strain. It is desirable that the <b>normal</b> <b>pitch</b> of conduct at which men are not conscious of being particularly virtuous, although they feel mean when they fall below it, should be raised as high as possible; {{but it is not}} desirable that they should attempt to live above this pitch any more than that they should habitually walk at the rate of five miles an hour or carry a hundredweight continually on their backs. Their normal condition should be in nowise difficult or remarkable; and it is a perfectly sound instinct that leads us to mistrust the good man as much as the bad man, and to object to the clergyman who is pious extra-professionally as much as to the professional pugilist who is quarrelsome and violent in private life. We do not want good men and bad men any more than we want giants and dwarfs. What we do want is a high quality for our normal: that is, people who can be much better than what we now call respectable without self- sacrifice. Conscious goodness, like conscious muscular effort, may be of use in emergencies; but for everyday national use it is negligible; and its effect on the character of the individual may easily be disastrous.|$|E

6000|$|Gradually Arthur Symons came {{to replace}} in my {{intimate}} friendship, Lionel Johnson from whom I was slowly {{separated by a}} scruple of conscience. If {{he came to see}} me he sat tongue-tied unless I gave him the drink that seemed necessary to bring his vitality to but its <b>normal</b> <b>pitch,</b> and if I called upon him he drank so much that I became his confederate. Once, when a friend and I had sat long after our proper bed-time at his constantly repeated and most earnest entreaty, knowing what black melancholy would descend upon him at our departure, and with the unexpressed hope of getting him to his bed, he fixed upon us a laughing and whimsical look, and said:--"I want you two men to understand that you are merely two men that I am drinking with." [...] That was the only time that I was to hear from him an imaginary conversation that had not an air of the most scrupulous accuracy. He gave two accounts of a conversation with Wilde in prison; in one Wilde wore his hair long, and in the other it had been cropped by the prison barber. He was gradually losing, too, the faculty of experience, and in his prose and verse repeated the old ideas and emotions, but faintly, as though with fading interest. I am certain that he prayed much, and on those rare days that I came upon him dressed and active before midday or but little after, I concluded that he had been to morning Mass at Farm Street.|$|E
6000|$|Little {{by little}} indeed, under the {{vividness}} of Kate's behaviour, the probabilities {{fell back into}} their order. Merton Densher was in love, and Kate couldn't help it--could only be sorry and kind: wouldn't that, without wild flurries, cover everything? Milly at all events tried it as a cover, tried it hard, for the time; pulled it over her, in the front, the larger room, drew it up to her chin with energy. If it didn't, so treated, do everything for her, it did {{so much that she}} could herself supply the rest. She made that up by the interest of her great question, the question of whether, seeing him once more, with all that, as she called it to herself, had come and gone, her impression of him would be different from the impression received in New York. That had held her from the moment of their leaving the museum; it kept her company through their drive and during luncheon; and now that she was {{a quarter of an hour}} alone with him it became acute. She was to feel at this crisis that no clear, no common answer, no direct satisfaction on this point, was to reach her; she was to see her question itself simply go to pieces. She couldn't tell if he were different or not, and she didn't know nor care if she were: these things had ceased to matter in the light of the only thing she did know. This was that she liked him, as she put it to herself, as much as ever; and if that were to amount to liking a new person the amusement would be but the greater. She had thought him at first very quiet, in spite of recovery from his original confusion; though even the shade of bewilderment, she yet perceived, had not been due to such vagueness on the subject of her reintensified identity as the probable sight, over there, of many thousands of her kind would sufficiently have justified. No, he was quiet, inevitably, for the first half of the time, because Milly's own lively line--the line of spontaneity--made everything else relative; and because too, so far as Kate was spontaneous, it was ever so finely in the air among them that the <b>normal</b> <b>pitch</b> must be kept. Afterwards, when they had got a little more used, as it were, to each other's separate felicity, he had begun to talk more, clearly bethought himself, at a given moment, of what his natural lively line would be. It would be to take for granted she must wish to hear of the States, and to give her, in its order, everything he had seen and done there. He abounded, of a sudden he almost insisted; he returned, after breaks, to the charge; and the effect was perhaps the more odd as he gave no clue whatever to what he had admired, as he went, or to what he hadn't. He simply drenched her with his sociable story--especially during the time they were away from the others. She had stopped then being American--all to let him be English; a permission of which he took, she could feel, both immense and unconscious advantage. She had really never cared less for the [...] "States" [...] than at this moment; but that had nothing to do with the matter. It would have been the occasion of her life to learn about them, for nothing could put him off, and he ventured on no reference to what had happened for herself. It might have been almost as if he had known that the greatest of all these adventures was her doing just what she did then.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{productivity}} of the beer fermentation process, several strategies can be adopted. One of these promising strategies could be the increase of suspended yeast cells in the reactor. Therefore, the fermentation characteristics of 11 lager yeast strains were studied in <b>normal</b> <b>pitched</b> worts (20 × 106 cells/ mL) (LD) and in worts with a four-fold higher pitching rate (HD). The fermentation rate was 2 - 4 times increased when high initial cell levels were used. The net yeast growth was somewhat similar between the LD and the HD fermentations, although the FAN uptake level was about 35 % higher in the HD fermentations compared with LD. High viabilities were observed throughout the fermentations with high cell loadings. HD fermentations resulted in higher concentrations of all the measured fusel alcohols and higher maxima and residual concentrations of total diacetyl were observed. In contrast, higher levels {{of most of the}} esters were found at the <b>normal</b> <b>pitching</b> rate, although the results of isoamyl acetate were not significant. With the help of “Principal Component Analysis”, {{it became clear that the}} cell density had an important influence on the flavour profile, but that yeast specific preferences could not be overlooked as they determined the sensitivity of the yeast to the application of higher cell densitiesstatus: publishe...|$|R
