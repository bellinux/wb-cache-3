Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal {{on the third}} count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial. The Court rejected this argument. The Court held that the earlier and later counts did <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Global warming {{represents}} a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more unsafe than birds {{because they have}} less ability to move large distances.

5|$|Rigveda, however, does <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> {{yoga and}} there is little {{evidence}} as to what the practices were. Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE).|$|E

5|$|The Aix Basin {{was first}} {{excavated}} for fossils in 1869 by French paleontologist Philippe Matheron. In the 1950s, Raymond Dughi and Francois Sirugue, {{a pair of}} French paleontologists working for the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle Aix-en-Provence, extensively studied the basin's fossil eggshells. They divided the eggs they had found into ten different types, but they did <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> them in detail. In the 1970s and 1980s, further work {{was done by the}} French paleontologist P. Kerourio and the German paleontologist H. K. Erben.|$|E

5|$|The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, and the {{one that}} {{established}} his reputation as a pioneer of British ornithology. He compiled the book at his home Knowle House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was published soon after the first volume of Thomas Bewick's illustrated handbook, A History of British Birds, which appeared in 1797. It does <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> what is now called Montagu's harrier, which he separated from the hen harrier in 1803, after the publication of the book.|$|E

In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who said that his parents were murdered on his bus became the story's base. Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, and listened to the script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour.

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, it does <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> the folding process {{needed to reach}} that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E

5|$|Justus was {{a member}} of the Gregorian mission sent to England by Pope GregoryI. Almost {{everything}} known about Justus and his career is derived from the early 8th-century Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of Bede. As Bede does <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> Justus' origins, nothing is known about him prior to his arrival in England. He probably arrived in England with the second group of missionaries, sent at the request of Augustine of Canterbury in 601. Some modern writers describe Justus as one of the original missionaries who arrived with Augustine in 597, but Bede believed that Justus came in the second group. The second group included Mellitus, who later became Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{state that}} Deusdedit {{died of the}} plague that was {{prevalent}} in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions {{the outbreak of the}} plague, the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably bubonic plague. Although Bede does <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.|$|E

5|$|Remains of Megalomys audreyae {{were found}} by John Walter Gregory among cave breccia on Barbuda around 1900. The exact {{locality}} is unknown. In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae, Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as {{another member of}} the Megalomys group, but he never published a description of the latter. Édouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys (Megalomys) majori to it in his Catalogus Mammalium, but he did <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum. In 1926, Arthur Hopwood finally described it and named it Megalomys audreyae after Gregory's wife Audrey, following Major's intention.|$|E
5|$|Several plays {{have shaped}} Edward's {{contemporary}} image. Christopher Marlowe's play Edward II was first performed around 1592, {{and focuses on}} Edward's relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites. Marlowe presents Edward's death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> the actual nature of Edward's murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a red-hot poker. The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe's contemporaries James VI of Scotland and Henry III of France, may have influenced William Shakespeare's portrayal of Richard II. In the 17th century, the playwright Ben Jonson picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, Mortimer His Fall.|$|E
5|$|Very few {{historical}} sources give detailed {{accounts of}} the battle and they do <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> the exact deployments of the armies. The paucity of such primary sources led early historians to adopt Hall's chronicle as their main resource for the engagement, despite its authorship 70years after the event and questions over the origin of his information. The Burgundian chronicler Jehan de Waurin (13981474) was a more contemporary source, but his chronicle was {{made available to the}} public only from 1891, and several mistakes in it discouraged historians at that time from using it. Later reconstructions of the battle were based on Hall's version, supplemented by minor details from other sources.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to call him a Christian.|$|E
5|$|A children's {{edition of}} the memoir was {{published}} in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of {{children and young people}} and for the right of all children to education. Aged 17 at the time, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.|$|E
5|$|Although legal {{accounts}} do <b>not</b> <b>describe</b> {{the course}} of the combat, contemporary chroniclers have left several records of the day's battle. According to the chronicles, the claimants entered the field last and before all present repeated their accusations against the other and swore oaths guaranteeing their honesty before the King, Parlement and God. Before they remounted, the marshal of the duel performed a brief ceremony in which he knighted Jacques Le Gris. This ceremony was traditional before battle but also performed a part in maintaining the social structure of medieval France. With both men on the same social footing, there would be no defeat of a senior rank by a lesser one. Having been raised to the status of a knight, Sir Jacques regained his horse and the arena was cleared. Both knights were heavily armed and armoured, protected by a hide and wood shield bearing their coat of arms and thick plate armour, riding a heavy warhorse and wielding a lance, longsword, heavy battle axe and long dagger known as a misericordia.|$|E
