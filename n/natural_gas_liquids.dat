25|$|Pioneered in Turner Valley, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> {{extraction}} {{eventually became}} an important Canadian industry in its own right, as the story of its development illustrates.|$|E
25|$|The block {{flow diagram}} also shows how {{processing}} of the raw natural gas yields byproduct sulfur, byproduct ethane, and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> (NGL) propane, butanes and natural gasoline (denoted as pentanes +).|$|E
25|$|The {{enormous}} {{growth in}} Canadian processing {{capacity in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s created large inventories of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids,</b> liquefied petroleum gases and sulfur. Growing supplies sometimes created marketing problems.|$|E
25|$|Keyera - {{midstream}} {{company with}} 18 <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquid</b> processing plants in Alberta.|$|R
50|$|Nexen {{also has}} an Energy Marketing {{division}} that trades and markets proprietary and third-party crude oil, <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> and electrical power.|$|R
50|$|Condensate wells—These wells produce raw <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{along with}} <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquid.</b> Such <b>gas</b> is also called {{associated}} gas and {{often referred to}} as wet gas.|$|R
25|$|Heavier gaseous hydrocarbons: ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), normal butane (n-C4H10), {{isobutane}} (i-C4H10), pentanes {{and even}} higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. When processed and purified into finished by-products, {{all of these}} are collectively referred to as <b>Natural</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Liquids</b> or NGL.|$|E
25|$|As the Turner Valley story illustrates, the {{extraction}} of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> {{goes back to the}} industry's early years. However, the development of partnerships between the large American oil company Amoco and the young, dynamic Dome Petroleum to create sophisticated liquids infrastructure in Western Canada.|$|E
25|$|By 1970, Amoco {{had become}} one of the largest {{integrated}} oil corporations in the world through both acquisitions and internal growth. Besides being a large-scale refiner and distributor of refined products, it was a powerful force in petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration and production, pipelines, and in the marketing of crude oil, natural gas and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> (NGLs).|$|E
50|$|Encana owns an oil and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquid</b> {{processing}} plant {{with a total}} capacity of 115,000 barrels per day, from wells drilled into the Montney Formation.|$|R
50|$|The state's Resources Excise Tax Act of 1978 {{established}} {{taxes on}} in-state production of natural resources, including timber, timber products, and minerals, except for oil, <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> <b>liquid</b> hydrocarbons, helium, carbon dioxide, and other non-hydrocarbon gases.|$|R
50|$|Escravos GTL is a <b>gas</b> to <b>liquids</b> (GTL) project {{based in}} Escravos region, Nigeria. It {{is located in}} the Niger Delta about 100 km {{southeast}} of Lagos. The plant converts <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into <b>liquid</b> petroleum products.|$|R
25|$|The {{next step}} is to recover the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> (NGL) for which most large, modern gas {{processing}} plants use another cryogenic low temperature distillation process involving expansion of the gas through a turbo-expander followed by distillation in a demethanizing fractionating column. Some gas processing plants use lean oil absorption process rather than the cryogenic turbo-expander process.|$|E
25|$|The Dome-operated plant {{quickly became}} a hub of western Canada’s liquids business. The reason is that Amoco and Dome created a {{partnership}} {{to do something that}} had never been tried before, anywhere. Using Fort Saskatchewan as a staging point, they batched <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> through Interprovincial’s oil pipeline to Sarnia. In 1980, the partnership added fractionation facilities at Fort Saskatchewan.|$|E
25|$|New Mexico is {{the fourth}} leading crude oil and eighth leading natural gas {{producer}} (EIA.gov 2015) in the United States. The Permian Basin (part of the Mid-Continent Oil Field) and San Juan Basin lie partly in New Mexico. In 2006 New Mexico accounted for 3.4% of the crude oil, 8.5% of the dry natural gas, and 10.2% of the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> produced in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Production {{methods include}} steam {{reforming}} of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> or <b>liquid</b> hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen, the gasification of coal, biomass, {{and in some}} types of waste-to-energy gasification facilities.|$|R
25|$|The Camisea Project {{encompasses}} three segments—Upstream, Transportation, and Distribution of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{from the}} Camisea field, {{which is located}} in the Ucayali Basin in the Department of Cusco. Under the license contract, the Upstream Consortium holds the rights to produce <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and <b>liquids</b> in block 88 for 40 years. Investments to develop and produce, transport, and distribute <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> from the Camisea field were estimated as follows: the Upstream Project to develop and produce <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> $550 million; the Transportation Project to transport <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and <b>liquids</b> to Lima through pipelines, $820 million; and the Distribution Project for the distribution network in Lima, $170 million.|$|R
50|$|GTUIT {{is a well}} site gas {{processing}} firm. The company's mobile equipment collects gas {{that would otherwise be}} flared and turns it into usable <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquid</b> and conditioned <b>gas.</b> In 2015, the company received an equity investment from Caterpillar Inc.'s Oil and Gas division and signed a marketing deal with the company in 2016. The company is headquartered in Billings, Montana and has a field office in Watford City, North Dakota.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time the team of Dow Chemicals, Nova and Dome put {{together}} the Alberta Ethane Project. This plan was essentially a $1.5 billion blueprint {{for the creation of a}} petrochemicals business in Alberta based on <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids,</b> especially ethane. And the plan took on a political life of its own, since it offered the opportunity for value-added products to be manufactured in Alberta for export. The provincial government stood four-square behind it.|$|E
25|$|Alberta’s liquids {{business}} {{dates to}} the development of the Pembina field, when Dallas-based Goliad Oil and Gas received rights to recover solution gas from the field. Also known as “casing head gas” or “associated gas,” solution gas is dissolved in reservoir oil at underground pressures. Released under the relatively low pressures at Earth’s surface, it usually includes <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids.</b> Often, as at Pembina, these can be profitably extracted. While Goliad received the gas from Pembina, the separated liquids were returned to the producers.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{a series}} on Canada's {{petroleum}} industry, this entry focuses on the second of these two functions of gas processing - removing impurities from the gas stream - rather than recovering <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids,</b> described elsewhere. Of course, most large plants perform both functions, and plants have no other ultimate purpose than to quickly, safely and profitably turn raw gas into products to be safely shipped (mostly by pipeline) to market. The discussion covers gas processing as an engineering feat, critical developments in exploration and development and the fundamentals of the marketplace.|$|E

It {{is the largest}} GTL plant in the world. [...] The first commercial shipment from the Pearl GTL was made on 13 June 2011.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{problems}} with the methanol system earlier in the day, methane clathrate (a flammable ice) had started to accumulate in the gas compression system pipework, causing a blockage. Due to this blockage, condensate (<b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> NGL) Pump B stopped {{and could not be}} restarted. As the entire power supply of the offshore construction work depended on this pump, the manager had only a few minutes to bring the pump back online, otherwise the power supply would fail completely. A search was made through the documents to determine whether Condensate Pump A could be started.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2007, {{the prices}} of {{fertilizers}} of all kinds increased dramatically, peaking around the summer of 2008 (see graphs by the International Fertilizer Industry Association). Prices approximately tripled for ammonia, urea, diammonium phosphate, muriate of potash (KCl), and sulfuric acid (used for making phosphate fertilizer), and then fell just as dramatically {{in the latter part}} of 2008. Some prices doubled within the six months before April 2008. Part of the cause for these price rises was the rise in the price of oil, since the most fertilizers require petroleum or natural gas to manufacture. Although the main fossil fuel input for fertilizer comes from natural gas to generate hydrogen for the Haber–Bosch process (see: Ammonia production), natural gas has its own supply problems similar to those for oil. Because natural gas can substitute for petroleum in some uses (for example, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> and electricity generation), increasing prices for petroleum lead to increasing prices for natural gas, and thus for fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|The new {{operating}} process, {{which was}} the result of the privatization and joint-venture projects, incorporated policies that deal with economic and societal development issues and with environmental protection in a sustainable way. Private local interests owned most of the medium- and small-sized mining operations. More than 250 foreign mining companies have been established in Peru since 1990. Crude oil was transported through 1,754km pipelines, natural gas and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids</b> through 983km dual pipelines, and refined products through 13km pipelines. Important mineral industry ports included Callao, Chimbote, Ilo, Matarani, Paita, Puerto Maldonado, Salaverry, San Martin, San Nicolas, and Talara on the Pacific Ocean and Iquitos Pucallpa and yurimaguas on the Amazon River and its tributaries. Peru had an installed electrical generating capacity of 5,050 megawatts (MW), about 80% of which was accounted for by hydroelectric plants. The Peruvian Government raised about $2 billion from the privatization of its electrical sector and committed to an investment of about $20 million to install an additional 1,006 MW of capacity in the immediate future. The energy mix, by source, was hydro (74.5%), fossil fuel (24.5%), and others (1.0%).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to transporting gas via pipelines {{for use in}} power generation, other end uses for <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> include export as liquefied <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (LNG) or conversion of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into other <b>liquid</b> products via <b>gas</b> to <b>liquids</b> (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into <b>liquids</b> products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including Fischer–Tropsch (F–T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and STG+. F–T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> via a single-loop process. In 2011, Royal Dutch Shell's 140,000 barrel (16 dam³) per day F–T plant went into operation in Qatar.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{gasoline}} is a <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquid</b> with a vapor pressure intermediate between <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> condensate (drip gas) and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} and has a boiling point {{within the range of}} gasoline. The typical gravity of natural {{gasoline is}} around 80 API. This hydrocarbon mixture is liquid at ambient pressure and temperature. It is volatile and unstable but can be blended with other hydrocarbons to produce commercial gasoline. The hydrocarbon mixture of natural gasoline are mostly pentanes and heavier (smaller amounts of C6 and C6+), extracted from <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> that meets vapor pressure, end-point, and other specifications for natural gasoline set by the Gas Processors Association. Includes isopentane which is a saturated branch-chain hydrocarbon, (C5H12), obtained by fractionation of natural gasoline or isomerization of normal pentane.|$|R

25|$|Because <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{is not a}} pure product, as the {{reservoir}} pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing—an effect called retrograde condensation. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method {{to deal with this}} problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate. The resulting <b>liquid</b> is called <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquid</b> (NGL) and has commercial value.|$|R
