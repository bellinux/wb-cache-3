5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the <b>notochord.</b> The <b>notochord</b> releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the <b>notochord</b> and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the <b>notochord</b> becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the <b>notochord</b> into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the genes}} {{responsible}} for the regulation of inner ear formation and its morphogenesis {{are members of the}} homeobox gene family such as Pax, Msx and Otx homeobox genes. The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the <b>notochord.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polycarpa fibrosa is a {{hermaphrodite}} and is viviparous. Sperm is shed {{into the}} sea and sucked in through the buccal siphon of another individual, a batch of eggs is liberated from the oviduct, and fertilisation takes place within the body cavity. The eggs are opaque with pigmented yolks and are about 0.16 mm in diameter. The developing embryos are brooded in the body cavity. Hatching is initiated by the release of enzymes which rupture the egg membranes. The larvae have <b>notochords</b> (stiffening rods) and resemble salamander tadpoles. They have fluid-filled sensory organs known as otocysts. The larvae continue to be brooded at first but are later liberated {{into the sea}}. After a short free-swimming period, they sink to the seabed, their tails are absorbed, they lose their <b>notochords</b> and undergo metamorphosis into the adult form.|$|R
2500|$|Hemichordates ("half (½) chordates") {{have some}} {{features}} {{similar to those}} of chordates: branchial openings that open into the pharynx and look rather like gill slits; stomochords, similar in composition to <b>notochords,</b> but running in a circle round the [...] "collar", which is ahead of the mouth; and a dorsal nerve cord—but also a smaller ventral nerve cord.|$|R
40|$|Dipygus is a {{complete}} caudal duplication deformity in its severest form. The structures derived from the embryonic cloaca and <b>notochords</b> are duplicated to various extent. We report a male baby who presented to us with complete somatic and visceral duplication below the umbilical level associated with gastroschisis and imperforated anus. Staged surgical corrections were suggested and three out of the four stages were performed successfully...|$|R
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in bowfin is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the <b>notochord</b> was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a <b>notochord.</b> The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start {{to develop and}} are used as an {{accessory}} breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, {{but the number of}} rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a <b>notochord,</b> but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.|$|E
25|$|A <b>notochord,</b> {{a fairly}} stiff rod of {{cartilage}} that extends along {{the inside of}} the body. Among the vertebrate sub-group of chordates the <b>notochord</b> develops into the spine, and in wholly aquatic species this helps the animal to swim by flexing its tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed <b>notochords</b> which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|R
5000|$|Haikouichthys [...] is an extinct genus of craniate (animals with <b>notochords</b> and {{distinct}} heads) {{believed to have}} lived 525 million years ago, during the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life. Haikouichthys had a defined skull and other characteristics that have led paleontologists to label it a true craniate, and even to be popularly characterized {{as one of the}} earliest fishes. Cladistic analysis indicates that the animal is probably a basal chordate or a basal craniate; but it does not possess sufficient features to be included uncontroversially even in either stem group.|$|R
40|$|To {{define the}} timing of neural crest formation, we {{challenged}} the fate of presumptive neural crest cells by grafting <b>notochords,</b> Sonic Hedgehog- (Shh) or Noggin-secreting cells {{at different stages of}} neurulation in chick embryos. <b>Notochords</b> or Shh-secreting cells are able to prevent neural crest formation at open neural plate levels, as assayed by DiI-labeling and expression of the transcription factor, Slug, suggesting that neural crest cells are not committed to their fate at this time. In contrast, the BMP signaling antagonist, Noggin, does not repress neural crest formation at the open neural plate stage, but does so if injected into the lumen of the closing neural tube. The period of Noggin sensitivity corresponds to the time when BMPs are expressed in the dorsal neural tube but are down-regulated in the non-neural ectoderm. To confirm {{the timing of}} neural crest formation, Shh or Noggin were added to neural folds at defined times in culture. Shh inhibits neural crest production at early stages (0 - 5 hours in culture), whereas Noggin exerts an effect on neural crest production only later (5 - 10 hours in culture). Our results suggest three phases of neurulation that relate to neural crest formation: (1) an initial BMP-independent phase that can be prevented by Shh-mediated signals from the notochord; (2) an intermediate BMP-dependent phase around the time of neural tube closure, when BMP- 4 is expressed in the dorsal neural tube; and (3) a later pre-migratory phase which is refractory to exogenous Shh and Noggin...|$|R
25|$|The bending of {{the neural}} plate {{involves}} {{the formation of}} hinges, where the neural plate is connected to surrounding tissues. The midline of the neural plate is referred to the median hinge point (MHP). Cells in this area, known as medial hinge point cells because of their involvement with this structure, are stabilized and connected to the <b>notochord.</b> They are derived from {{the area of the}} neural plate anterior to primitive knot. The <b>notochord</b> will begin the shape changes in MHP cells. These cells will decrease in height and become wedge-shaped. Another type of hinge point occurs dorsal-laterally, referred to as dorsal-lateral hinge point (DLHP). These regions furrow and change shape {{in the same way as}} MHP cells do before connecting together to form the neural tube. It was seen in an experiment that without the <b>notochord,</b> the MHP characteristics did not develop correctly, so the neural plate and neural tube formation did not happen properly. The communication between the neural plate and the <b>notochord</b> is important for the future induction and formation of the neural tube.|$|E
25|$|The neural tube {{itself is}} the initial groundwork of the {{vertebrate}} CNS, and the floor plate is a specialized structure and {{is located at the}} ventral midpoint of the neural tube. Evidence supporting the <b>notochord</b> as the signaling center comes from studies in which a second <b>notochord</b> is implanted near a neural tube in vivo, leading to the formation of an ectopic floor plate within the neural tube.|$|E
25|$|A {{chordate}} is {{an animal}} {{belonging to the}} phylum Chordata; they possess a <b>notochord,</b> a hollow dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail, {{for at least some}} period of their life cycle. Chordates are deuterostomes, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth. They are also bilaterally symmetric coelomates. In the case of vertebrate chordates, the <b>notochord</b> is usually replaced by a vertebral column during development, and they may have body plans organized by segmentation.|$|E
40|$|The {{transient}} larval {{structures of}} vertebrae, {{blood vessels and}} the digestive tract were carefully examined during growth. Constrictions appear in the <b>notochords</b> of larvae prior to formation of the vertebral column. Larvae develop the dorso-lateral condyles between the first vertebra and the exoccipitals, differentiated neural and hemal spines, pleural ribs and epipleurals. The digestive organs exhibit sequential development but structures are not lost or degenerated with growth. The ventral vein beneath the cardinal aorta fragments and degenerates during the transition of larvae to juveniles, and is replaced by the dorsal vein. The formation of the dorsal vein completes beneath the cardinal aorta in larvae about 7. 0 mm TL. This apparent shift of the ventral to the dorsal vein in the tail differs from the subsequent shift in the trunk where the ventral vein does not degenerate. The dorsal vein completes from the trunk to the tail until 14 mm TL...|$|R
50|$|A {{tunicate}} is {{a marine}} invertebrate animal, {{a member of}} the subphylum Tunicata, {{which is part of the}} Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and <b>notochords.</b> The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile, and are permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor; others, such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips.|$|R
40|$|Whole-exome and {{targeted}} sequencing of 13 individuals from 10 unrelated families with overlapping clinical manifestations identified loss-of-function and missense variants in KIAA 1109 allowing delineation of an autosomal-recessive multi-system syndrome, which we suggest to name Alkuraya-Kučinskas syndrome (MIM 617822). Shared phenotypic features representing the cardinal characteristics of this syndrome combine brain atrophy with clubfoot and arthrogryposis. Affected individuals present with cerebral parenchymal underdevelopment, ranging from major cerebral parenchymal thinning with lissencephalic aspect to moderate parenchymal rarefaction, severe to mild ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia with brainstem dysgenesis, and cardiac and ophthalmologic anomalies, such as microphthalmia and cataract. Severe loss-of-function cases were incompatible with life, whereas those individuals with milder missense variants presented with severe global developmental delay, syndactyly of 2 nd and 3 rd toes, and severe muscle hypotonia resulting in incapacity to stand without support. Consistent with a causative role for KIAA 1109 loss-of-function/hypomorphic variants in this syndrome, knockdowns of the zebrafish orthologous gene resulted in embryos with hydrocephaly and abnormally curved <b>notochords</b> and overall body shape, whereas published knockouts {{of the fruit}} fly and mouse orthologous genes resulted in lethality or severe neurological defects reminiscent of the probands' features...|$|R
25|$|The prechordal plate, <b>notochord,</b> and non-neural {{ectoderm}} {{are believed}} to be important inducer tissues which release these chemical signals, in order to trigger neural plate folding.|$|E
25|$|The first {{ancestors}} of fish, or animals that were probably {{closely related to}} fish, were Pikaia, Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia. These three genera all appeared around 530 Ma. Pikaia had a primitive <b>notochord,</b> a structure that could have developed into a vertebral column later. Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian, these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan: a <b>notochord,</b> rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail. All of these early vertebrates lacked jaws in the common sense and relied on filter feeding close to the seabed.|$|E
25|$|SHH {{emanates from}} the <b>notochord</b> and ventral floor plate of the {{developing}} neural tube to create a concentration gradient that spans the dorso-ventral axis. Higher concentrations of the SHH ligand {{are found in the}} most ventral aspects of the neural tube and <b>notochord,</b> while lower concentrations are found in the more dorsal regions of the neural tube. The SHH concentration gradient has been visualized in the neural tube of mice engineered to express a SHH::GFP fusion protein to show this graded distribution of SHH during the time of ventral neural tube patterning.|$|E
40|$|Apurinic/apyrimidinic {{endonuclease}} 1, a {{key enzyme}} in repairing abasic sites in DNA, is an embryonic lethal in mice. We are examining {{its role in}} embryogenesis in zebra fish. Zebra fish contain two genomic copies (zfAPEX 1 a and zfAPEX 1 b) with identical coding sequences. zfAPEX 1 b lacks introns. Recombinant protein (ZAP 1) is highly homologous with and has the same enzymatic properties as its human orthologue. ZAP 1 is highly expressed throughout development. Embryos microinjected with morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) targeting the translation start site die at approximately the midblastula transition (MBT) without apoptosis. They are rescued with mRNA for human wild-type APEX 1 but not for APEX 1 encoding endonuclease-defective protein. Rescued embryos develop dysmorphic hearts, pericardial edema, few erythrocytes, small eyes, and abnormal <b>notochords.</b> Although the hearts in rescued embryos form defective loops ranging from no loop to one that is abnormally shaped, cardiac myosin (cmlc 2) is present and contraction occurs. Embryos microinjected with MO targeting zfAPEX 1 a intron-exon junctions also pass the MBT with similar abnormalities. We conclude that AP endonuclease 1 is involved in both repairing DNA and regulating specific early stages of embryonic development...|$|R
50|$|M. citrina is a {{hermaphrodite}} and is viviparous. Sperm is shed {{into the}} water column and enters another individual through its buccal siphon. A batch of eggs is liberated from the oviduct and these are fertilised within the body cavity. The eggs are opaque and have red or yellow yolks. They are about 0.20 mm in diameter. The developing embryos are brooded in the body cavity. Hatching is initiated by the release of enzymes which cause the egg membranes to rupture. The larvae have <b>notochords</b> (stiffening rods) and resemble salamander tadpoles. They have fluid-filled sensory organs known as otocysts. The larvae continue to be brooded for a while but are later liberated into the sea. In European waters about 80% undergo metamorphosis while still in the body cavity but in North America only about 2% are retained internally to metamorphosis. When released, the larvae have a very short free-swimming period, ranging from {{a few minutes to}} an hour or two, before undergoing metamorphosis. The juveniles soon become sticky and attach to any hard surfaces with which they come in contact. This often includes the tunic of the parent individual and this may form a small cluster of individuals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLimitations to the in vivo {{study of}} human nervous system {{development}} make it necessary to design an in vitro model to evaluate the in vivo effects of surrounding tissues on neurogenesis and regional identity of the human neural plate. Rostral neural progenitors (NPs) were initially generated from adherent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in a defined condition and characterized. Then, to find the role of somites (S) and <b>notochords</b> (N) in rostro-caudal (RC) and dorso-ventral (DV) patterning of neuronal cells, NPs were co-cultured with microencapsulated chicken S or N in alginate beads. In this study, N induced more neurogenesis as evaluated by expression of TUJ 1 and MAP 2 -positive cells. Additionally, N induced spinal cord ventral brachiothoracic identity as well as NPs proliferation. We observed a synergic effect on motoneuron induction when S and N were used together. Moreover, S induced hindbrain identity in differentiated neuronal cells from NPs. These results indicate that highly enriched NPs can be generated in an adherent and defined system from hESCs. Moreover, S and N tissues highly influenced neuronal differentiation in point of proliferation, neurogenesis, and RC and DV regional identity. These results indicate a very simple and efficient protocol to mimic in vivo events of human neural development in vitro which {{is important in the}} context of developmental neuroscience and cellular replacement therapies...|$|R
25|$|The sonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) signaling molecule assumes various {{roles in}} patterning {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) during vertebrate development. One of the most characterized functions of SHH is its role in the induction of the floor plate and diverse ventral cell types within the neural tube. The <b>notochord,</b> a structure derived from the axial mesoderm, produces SHH, which travels extracellularly to the ventral region of the neural tube and instructs those cells to form the floor plate. Another view for floor plate induction hypothesizes that some precursor cells located in the <b>notochord</b> are inserted into the neural plate before its formation, later giving rise to the floor plate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>notochord</b> disappears in the sclerotome (vertebral body) segments, but {{persists}} {{in the region}} of the intervertebral discs as the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus and the fibers of the anulus fibrosus make up the intervertebral disc.|$|E
25|$|Bothriolepis had {{a slender}} trunk that was likely covered in soft skin with no scales or markings. The {{orientation}} {{that appears to}} have been most stable for resting was dorsal surface up, evidenced by the flat surface on the ventral side. The trunk’s outline suggests {{that there may have been}} a <b>notochord</b> present surrounded by a membranous sheath, however there is no direct evidence of this since the <b>notochord</b> is made up of soft tissue, which is not typically preserved in the fossil record. Similar to other antiarchs, the thoracic shield of Bothriolepis was attached to its heavily armored head. Its box-like body was enclosed in armor plates, providing protection from predators. Attached to the ventral surface of the trunk is a large, thin, circular plate marked by deep-lying lines and superficial ridges. This plate lies just below the opening to the cloaca.|$|E
40|$|AbstractZebrafish is {{a simple}} {{vertebrate}} that has many attributes that make it ideal {{for the study of}} developmental genetics. One feature that has been lacking in this model system is the ability to disable specifically targeted genes. Recently, double-stranded RNA has been used to silence gene expression in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have found that expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a microinjected plasmid vector can be suppressed in zebrafish embryos by the coinjection of a double-stranded RNA that is specifically targeted to GFP. To determine that double-stranded RNA can attenuate endogenous gene expression, single-cell zebrafish embryos were injected with double-stranded RNA specifically targeted to Zf-T and Pax 6. 1. We found that microinjection of double-stranded Zf-T RNA resulted in a high incidence of a phenotype similar to that of ntl. Furthermore, Zf-T gene expression could not be detected by in situ hybridization and the message was decreased by 75 % by semiquantitative RT-PCR in 12 -h embryos that had been injected with the double-stranded RNA. Expression of the zebrafish genes sonic hedgehog and floating head was altered in the embryos microinjected with the Zf-T double-stranded RNA {{in a manner that is}} remarkably similar to the zebrafish no-tail mutant. Microinjection of double-stranded RNA targeted to Pax 6. 1 was associated with depressed expression of Pax 6. 1 and resulted in absent or greatly reduced eye and forebrain development, similar to the phenotype seen in mouse mutants. Simultaneous injection of Pax 6. 1 and Zf-T resulted in embryos lacking <b>notochords,</b> eyes, and brain structures...|$|R
25|$|In {{cartilaginous}} fish, such as sharks, the vertebrae {{consist of}} two cartilaginous tubes. The upper tube is formed from the vertebral arches, but also includes additional cartilaginous structures {{filling in the}} gaps between the vertebrae, and so enclosing the spinal cord in an essentially continuous sheath. The lower tube surrounds the <b>notochord,</b> and has a complex structure, often including multiple layers of calcification.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebral}} column, {{also known}} as the backbone or spine, is part of the axial skeleton. The vertebral column is the defining characteristic of a vertebrate, in which the <b>notochord</b> (a flexible rod of uniform composition) found in all chordates {{has been replaced by a}} segmented series of bones—vertebrae separated by intervertebral discs. The vertebral column houses the spinal canal, a cavity that encloses and protects the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|There {{is still}} much ongoing {{differential}} (DNA sequence based) comparison research {{that is trying to}} separate out the simplest forms of chordates. As some lineages of the 90% of species that lack a backbone or <b>notochord</b> might have lost these structures over time, this complicates the classification of chordates. Some chordate lineages may only be found by DNA analysis, when there is no physical trace of any chordate-like structures.|$|E
25|$|Alpha motor neurons {{originate}} in the basal plate, the ventral portion of the neural tube in the developing embryo. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is secreted by the nearby <b>notochord</b> and other ventral structures (e.g., the floor plate), establishing a gradient of highly concentrated Shh in the basal plate and less concentrated Shh in the alar plate. Under the influence of Shh and other factors, some neurons of the basal plate differentiate into α-MNs.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of nervous systems {{dates back to}} the first development of nervous systems in animals (or metazoans). Neurons developed as specialized electrical signaling cells in multicellular animals, adapting the mechanism of action potentials present in motile single-celled and colonial eukaryotes. Simple nerve nets seen in animals like cnidaria evolved first, followed by nerve cords in bilateral animals – ventral nerve cords in invertebrates and dorsal nerve cords supported by a <b>notochord</b> in chordates. Bilateralization led to the {{evolution of}} brains, a process called cephalization.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} lampreys, {{such as their}} cartilaginous skeleton, suggest they are the sister taxon (see cladistics) of all living jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), and are usually considered the most basal group of the Vertebrata. Instead of true vertebrae, they {{have a series of}} cartilaginous structures called arcualia arranged above the <b>notochord.</b> Hagfish, which resemble lampreys, have traditionally been considered the sister taxon of the true vertebrates (lampreys and gnathostomes) but DNA evidence suggests that they are in fact the sister taxon of lampreys.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebrae}} of lobe-finned fishes {{consist of}} three discrete bony elements. The vertebral arch surrounds the spinal cord, and is of broadly similar form to {{that found in}} most other vertebrates. Just beneath the arch lies a small plate-like pleurocentrum, which protects the upper surface of the <b>notochord,</b> and below that, a larger arch-shaped intercentrum to protect the lower border. Both of these structures are embedded within a single cylindrical mass of cartilage. A similar arrangement {{was found in the}} primitive Labyrinthodonts, but in the evolutionary line that led to reptiles (and hence, also to mammals and birds), the intercentrum became partially or wholly replaced by an enlarged pleurocentrum, which in turn became the bony vertebral body.|$|E
25|$|The general {{structure}} of human vertebrae is fairly typical of {{that found in}} mammals, reptiles, and birds. The shape of the vertebral body does, however, vary somewhat between different groups. In mammals, such as humans, it typically has flat upper and lower surfaces, while in reptiles the anterior surface commonly has a concave socket into which the expanded convex face of the next vertebral body fits. Even these patterns are only generalisations, however, {{and there may be}} variation in form of the vertebrae {{along the length of the}} spine even within a single species. Some unusual variations include the saddle-shaped sockets between the cervical vertebrae of birds and the presence of a narrow hollow canal running down the centre of the vertebral bodies of geckos and tuataras, containing a remnant of the <b>notochord.</b>|$|E
