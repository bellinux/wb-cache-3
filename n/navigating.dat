5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by <b>navigating</b> toward the brighter horizon created by {{the reflection of the}} moon and starlight off the water's surface.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for <b>navigating</b> obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of <b>navigating</b> the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades.

40|$|<b>Navigated</b> total knee {{arthroplasty}} {{has been}} shown to increase accuracy in post operative implant alignment. By contrast <b>navigated</b> total knee arthroplasty has not shown significant functional improvements to date, when compared with conventional surgery using subjective clinical questionnaire scores. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the knee joint kinematics measured during functional activities using electrogoniometry 12 months after total knee arthroplasty in randomised <b>navigated</b> and conventional total knee arthroplasty groups. The study design was a double blinded, randomised, prospective, controlled trial. The patients were randomised into 2 surgical groups (n= 102 <b>navigated</b> group, n= 98 conventional group; mean age navigated= 67, conventional= 67). Flexible electrogoniometry was used to measure patient's knee kinematics with respect to time during 12 functional activities. No significant difference was found in terms of the maximum, minimum and excursion knee joint angle during any of the functional activities. However there was a statistically significant improvement in the level and slope gait cycle at the pre swing phase in the <b>navigated</b> group. There were minimal functional improvements in the <b>navigated</b> total knee arthroplasty group 12 months after surgery. However, these are unlikely to have a significant effect on daily activity for the <b>navigated</b> group...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: The {{postoperative}} mechanical axis in 36 {{cases of}} total knee arthroplasty using <b>navigated</b> and mechanical alignment systems was evaluated and compared. All the operations were performed {{over the same}} period by the same surgeon and team, who were beginners in the <b>navigated</b> technique and experienced in the mechanical technique. Methods: Between 2008 and 2010, 36 total knee prostheses were performed and compared: 25 <b>navigated</b> and 11 mechanical procedures. Any deviation from the axis measured on the panoramic postoperative X-ray was considered positive. Results: The <b>navigated</b> prostheses produced a mean axis deviation of 1. 32 degrees and standard deviation of 1. 57 degrees and the mechanical, respectively 3. 18 and 2. 99 degrees. There was better alignment with a tendency towards a statistical difference favoring the <b>navigated</b> technique. Conclusion: There were significantly more cases with axis deviation greater than three degrees using the mechanical technique. The <b>navigated</b> technique was incorporated by this team without additional complications and, even without experience of <b>navigated</b> surgery, the initial cases achieved better alignment than with the mechanical technique, and a significantly smaller number of outliers from the three-degree safety zone...|$|R

50|$|The {{steering}} law in {{human-computer interaction}} and ergonomics is a predictive model of human movement {{that describes the}} time required to <b>navigate,</b> or steer, through a 2-dimensional tunnel. The tunnel {{can be thought of as}} a path or trajectory on a plane that has an associated thickness or width, where the width can vary along the tunnel. The goal of a steering task is to <b>navigate</b> from one end of the tunnel to the other as quickly as possible, without touching the boundaries of the tunnel. A real-world example that approximates this task is driving a car down a road that may have twists and turns, where the car must <b>navigate</b> the road as quickly as possible without touching the sides of the road. The steering law predicts both the instantaneous speed at which we may <b>navigate</b> the tunnel, and the total time required to <b>navigate</b> the entire tunnel.|$|R

5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in <b>navigating</b> to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
