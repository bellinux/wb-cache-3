40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} donor site morbidity following sural nerve harvesting, {{with special}} attention to the recovery of sensory loss. Methods: We prospectively followed 38 subjects who underwent sural nerve harvest, including two with bilateral <b>nerve</b> <b>excision.</b> Symptoms related to sural <b>nerve</b> <b>excision</b> were evaluated and demarcation of the area with reduced touch sensation was quantified. Assessments were performed periodically up to 1 year after surgery and the results of different sensory evaluations were compared. Results: A significant reduction of sensory deficit was identified between consecutive evaluations (p < 0. 05). Decreases of 26. 85 %, 20. 69 % and 24. 29 % were observed 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, respectively. Shock-like pain (7. 5 %), stabbing pain (7. 5 %), and numbness (5 %) were the most frequently reported symptoms. All symptoms were brief and resolved spontaneously 3 - 6 months after surgery. Conclusion: Sural nerve harvest can be performed with acceptable morbidity. When present, symptoms resolve between the third and sixth month after surgery and a significant reduction of sensory loss in the area innervated by the sural nerve was observed {{during the first year of}} follow-up.

40|$|Introduction: Distal median nerve masses may be {{developed}} post-traumatic or non-traumatic. In this paper, {{we aim to}} present a 52 year old female case with a postraumatic neuroma of the median nerve in the left wrist. Case Report: A 52 -year-old female patient had accidental incised wound over her left wrist which was primarily sutured. She presented 6 months later with unrelieved pain and growing swelling at the wrist. USG showed solid mass of size 2 × 3 cms. Intraoperatively the mass was seen to arise from medial <b>nerve</b> and careful <b>excision</b> was done protecting the nerve. At one year follow up the patient is relived of her symptoms with no sensorimotor deficit. Conclusion: Post traumatic neuroma present as unrelieved pain and progressive swelling.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: we {{investigated}} whether carotid sinus nerve infiltration with lignocaine reduced blood pressure lability {{during the first}} 24 h following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Design: prospective randomised double-blind controlled trial. Materials: eighty patients undergoing CEA for significant symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Methods: after initial dissection, 5 ml of 1 % lignocaine or normal saline placebo according to randomisation was infiltrated around the carotid sinus nerve. Blood pressure was measured by intra-arterial cannula during surgery and for four hours afterwards every 15 min, then manually, hourly for 18 h. Results: patients having excision of the carotid sinus nerve were grouped separately for analysis: 29 patients had lignocaine, 33 placebo and 17 excision (one early death with incomplete data was excluded). Mean systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures {{did not differ significantly}} between the three groups before carotid sinus nerve infiltration. After infiltration, those patients who had carotid sinus <b>nerve</b> <b>excision,</b> had significantly higher systolic [mean (SD) = 155 (16) mmHg] and diastolic [75 (9) mmHg] pressures than those receiving LA [systolic = 136 (15) mmHg, diastolic = 65 (10) mmHg] or placebo [systolic = 136 (19) mmHg, diastolic = 65 (9) mmHg], (p < 0. 005 ANOVA). <b>Nerve</b> <b>excision</b> also resulted in wider variability of blood pressure as defined by the mean of individual standard deviations (systolic = 25 mmHg, diastolic = 13 mmHg) compared to LA (systolic = 19 mmHg, diastolic = 12 mmHg) or placebo (systolic = 18 mmHg, diastolic = 10 mmHg) (p < 0. 05 ANOVA). Normotensive patients had significantly lower mean diastolic pressures (p < 0. 001 ANOVA) and variability (p < 0. 05) if they received lignocaine although this did not influence pulse pressure. Conclusions: lignocaine injection of the carotid sinus nerve has no benefit in those patients with existing treated hypertension and only marginal effects in normotensives. It is more important to preserve the carotid sinus nerve if possible...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Autologous nerve {{grafting}} {{remains the}} gold standard for repair of peripheral nerve injuries. Its use, however, is limited by donor nerve availability and donor site morbidity. This is especially problematic after failure of an initial autograft that requires a repeat nerve graft, resulting in a second surgical site with associated morbidity. Based on the molecular differences in nerve degeneration in the proximal and distal segments after transection, we hypothesized that a chronically-denervated proximal stump may be viable for autologous nerve repair. Methods: 20 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent right sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>excision</b> and sural nerve transection. After 8 weeks, nerve repair was performed by harvesting the proximal segment of the sural nerve (n= 10) or a fresh sural nerve (n= 10) from the contralateral hind limb. Electrophysiological changes were analyzed to compare the fresh and denervated grafts. Results: Electrophysiological testing demonstrated higher compound motor action potential in the denervated group compared to the fresh autograft group, however this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0. 117). Conclusion: The proximal segment of a chronically-denervated sural nerve can be as effective as a fresh sural nerve for autologous repair of peripheral nerve injuries in a rodent model.

40|$|Schwannoma, {{also known}} as neurilemoma, {{is the most common}} tumour of {{peripheral}} nerves.

40|$|Introduction: Intraneural {{ganglion}} cysts are benign, mucinous, non-neoplastic lesions of {{the peripheral}} nerves. While {{the most common}} location of intraneural ganglion cysts is the ulnar nerve and its branches, intraneural ganglion cyst involving the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve {{has not yet been}} reported. Presentation of case: A- 25 -year-old woman presented with pain and a palpable mass in the hypothenar region of the volar side of her right hand. Her neuromuscular examination was normal. The pain was unresponsive to nonsurgical treatments. After confirming with imaging modalities, the initial diagnosis was considered as an intraneural ganglion cyst arising from superficial ulnar <b>nerve.</b> <b>Excision</b> of the ganglion and exploration of the articular branch (if seen in operation) decision was undertaken by the senior author. Whether MRI or intraoperative exploration, not identified an articular branch. Discussion: Intraneural ganglion cysts of peripheral nerves may be seen in miscellaneous locations in the body. However, to our knowledge, an intraneural ganglion cyst involving the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve is unique. While a variety of theories have been proposed to enlighten the etiopathogenesis of intraneural ganglia, the latest and most affirmed is the unifying articular (synovial) theory. Conclusion: Intraneural ganglion cysts may be seen on the hypothenar side of the palm. The etiology and treatment of choice are closely associated with each other in this rare disorder. It is important to realize a related articular branch, otherwise the origin of cyst formation remains, and this may cause other para-articular cysts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic groin pain is a {{major cause}} of {{post-operative}} morbidity in open inguinal mesh hernia repair. Neu- rectomy is a well-established treatment modality. This study was performed to evaluate the neurosensory outcomes of prophylactic neurectomy in open mesh hernia repair. Aim: To assess the incidence of inguinodynia in patients undergoing open mesh hernia repair And to study, the neurosen- sory outcomes of sacrificing the ilioinguinal nerve in comparison to the group in which a nerve is identified and preserved. Materials and methods: A prospective double-blinded study was performed at Kasturba Medical College, Manipal from September 2008 to December 2009. The ilioinguinal nerve was either preserved or sacrificed according to the surgeon's choosing. Pain and hyposthesia were studied at defined timed intervals by a single observer. Results: 105 inguinal hernia mesh repairs were enrolled into the study. <b>Nerve</b> <b>excision</b> was done in 44 patients and pre- served in 61 patients. Ninety patients were followed till six months. At post-operative day 1, all patients in both the groups had pain and 15. 2 % had numbness. Chronic post surgical inguinodynia was seen in 16. 7 % of the population in the study group and numbness in 5. 6 % of the study population at six months. Conclusion: The severity of pain in the neurectomy group was less than the control group. There were no significant dif- ferences in the neurosensory outcomes of prophylactic ilioinguinal neurectomies in open mesh hernia repair compared to nerve preservation and hence prophylactic neurectomy is presently the choice of most surgeons.

40|$|Chronic Groin Pain (Inguinodynia) {{following}} {{inguinal hernia}} repair is a significant, though under-reported problem. Mild pain lasting {{for a few}} days is common following mesh inguinal hernia repair. However, moderate to severe pain persisting more than 3 mo after inguinal herniorrhaphy should be considered as pathological. The major reasons for chronic groin pain have been identified as neuropathic cause due to inguinal nerve(s) damage or non-neuropathic cause due to mesh or other related factors. The symptom complex of chronic groin pain varies from a dull ache to sharp shooting pain along the distribution of inguinal nerves. Thorough history and meticulous clinical examination should be performed to identify the exact cause of chronic groin pain, as there is no single test to confirm the aetiology behind the pain or to point out the exact nerve involved. Various studies have been performed to look at the difference in chronic groin pain rates with the use of mesh vs non-mesh repair, use of heavyweight vs lightweight mesh and mesh fixation with sutures vs glue. Though there is no convincing evidence favouring one over the other, lightweight meshes are generally preferred because of their lesser foreign body reaction and better tolerance by the patients. Identification of all three nerves {{has been shown to be}} an important factor in reducing chronic groin pain, though there are no well conducted randomised studies to recommend the benefits of <b>nerve</b> <b>excision</b> vs preservation. Both non-surgical and surgical options have been tried for chronic groin pain, with their consequent risks of analgesic side-effects, recurrent pain, recurrent hernia and significant sensory loss.

Zymosan intra-articularly injected at the dose of 0. 5 mg did not affect the body core temperature (Tc) compared with saline (control), whereas at doses of 1 and 2 mg, zymosan promoted a flattened increase in Tc and declined thereafter. The dose of 4 mg of zymosan was selected for further experiments because it elicited a marked and long-lasting Tc elevation starting at 3 1 / 2 h, peaking at 5 1 / 2 h, and remaining until 10 h. This temperature increase was preceded by a decrease in the tail skin temperature, as well as hyperalgesia and edema in the knee joint. No febrile response was observed in the following days. In addition, zymosan-induced fever was not modified by the sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>excision.</b> Zymosan increased PGE 2 concentration in the CSF but not in the plasma. Oral pretreatment with ibuprofen (5 - 20 mg/kg), celecoxib (1 - 10 mg/kg), dipyrone (60 - 240 mg/kg), and paracetamol (100 - 200 mg/kg) or subcutaneous injection of dexamethasone (0. 25 - 1. 0 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced or prevented the fever during the zymosan-induced arthritis. Celecoxib (5 mg/kg), paracetamol (150 mg/kg), and dipyrone (120 mg/kg) decreased CSF PGE 2 concentration and fever during zymosan-induced arthritis, suggesting the involvement of PGE 2 in this response.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the quantity of fibrillation potentials (FP) decreases with drop in the intramuscular temperature. However, the quantitative measurement of the FP with intramuscular temperature changes has not been reported.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{effects of}} {{locomotor}} training (LT) on skeletal muscle after {{peripheral nerve injury}} and acetylcholinesterase deficiency are not well documented. METHODS: We determined the effects of LT on mouse soleus muscle performance after sciatic <b>nerve</b> transection with <b>excision</b> (full and permanent denervation), nerve transection (partial functional reinnervation), nerve crush (full denervation with full functional reinnervation), and acetylcholinesterase deficiency (alteration in neuromuscular junction functioning). RESULTS: We found no significant effect of LT on the recovery of soleus muscle weight, maximal force in response to muscle stimulation, and fatigue resistance after nerve transection with or without excision. However, LT significantly increased soleus muscle fatigue resistance after nerve crush and acetylcholinesterase deficiency. Moreover, hindlimb immobilization significantly aggravated the deficit in soleus muscle maximal force production and atrophy after nerve crush. Conclusions: LT is beneficial, and reduced muscle use is detrimental for intrinsic muscle performance {{in the context of}} disturbed nervemuscle communication...|$|R
40|$|Background: Athetosis {{has been}} {{controversial}} {{since it was}} first described by William Hammond in 1871; many aspects of Hammond’s career were equally controversial. Methods: Primary sources {{have been used to}} review treatment controversies in the 50 -year period following the initial description of athetosis. Results: The treatments used most commonly employed available pharmaceutical agents and modalities (e. g., galvanism). Initial anecdotal reports of success were seldom confirmed with subsequent experience. Several novel invasive therapies were also developed and promoted, all of which damaged or destroyed either upper or lower motor neuron pathways, and were also often associated with high mortality rates. In general, these therapies substituted paresis for abnormal spontaneous movements. These included peripheral <b>nerve</b> stretching, <b>excision</b> of a portion of the precentral gyrus, rhizotomy, nerve "transplantation" (i. e., neurotomy and nerve-to-nerve anastomoses), and "muscle group isolation" (i. e., alcohol neurolysis). There was no agreement on the appropriateness of such high-risk procedures, particularly given the intentional generation of further neurological morbidity. Discussion: Pharmaceutical agents and modalities initially employed for athetosis had little a priori evidence-based justification and no biologically plausible theoretical framework to guide empiric treatment selection. Subsequently, all the invasive procedures employed were directed at lessening or removing the manifestations, rather than the underlying cause, of the abnormal central nervous system "irritation," usually by imposing paresis or paralysis. Factors contributing to the disparity in outcomes between favorable initial reports and the often-disappointing results of later studies included reliance on anecdotal reports or small uncontrolled case series, placebo effects, biased observation, misdiagnosis, and biased reporting...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAxon {{fasciculation}} {{is one of}} {{the processes}} controlling topographic innervation during embryonic development. While axon guidance steers extending axons in the accurate direction, axon fasciculation allows sets of co-extending axons to grow in tight bundles. The Eph:ephrin family has been involved both in axon guidance and fasciculation, yet it remains unclear how these two distinct types of responses are elicited. Herein we have characterized the role of ephrin-B 1, a member of the ephrinB family in sensory and motor innervation of the limb. We show that ephrin-B 1 is expressed in sensory axons and in the limb bud mesenchyme while EphB 2 is expressed in motor and sensory axons. Loss of ephrin-B 1 had no impact on the accurate dorso-ventral innervation of the limb by motor axons, yet EfnB 1 mutants exhibited decreased fasciculation of peripheral motor and sensory <b>nerves.</b> Using tissue-specific <b>excision</b> of EfnB 1 and in vitro experiments, we demonstrate that ephrin-B 1 controls fasciculation of axons via a surround repulsion mechanism involving growth cone collapse of EphB 2 -expressing axons. Altogether, our results highlight the complex role of Eph:ephrin signaling {{in the development of the}} sensory-motor circuit innervating the limb...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{described in}} this paper was suggested by the recent case of a twenty-five-year-old woman who developed temporary paralysis of the right posterior interosseous <b>nerve</b> after <b>excision</b> of a fractured head of radius. Although it is widely accepted that the posterior interosseous nerve is at risk during resection of the radial head, {{a search of the}} literature failed to reveal any described method of safeguarding the nerve. The present investigation concerns the relationship of the posterior interosseous nerve to the radius in different positions of the elbow. It was postulated that the canal in the supinator muscle through which the posterior interosseous nerve runs has a fixed relationship to the radial neck. A particular object {{of the study was to}} test the assumption that pronation of the forearm would pull the nerve medially, away from the operation site. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten elbow-joint preparations from five cadavers were used. As it was not possible to demonstrate the course ofthe posterior interosseous nerve by simple dissection ofa preparation without disturbing the normal anatomical relationships, a radiographic technique was devised requiring direct injection of a contrast medium into the nerve. In each specimen, the radial nerve was first exposed anteriorly by developing the plane of cleavage between the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles by blunt dissection. The radial nerve was followed as far as the VULNERABILITY OF THE POSTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS NERVE DURING RADIAL HEAD RESECTION 321 cubital fossa where it divides into the superficial radial nerve and the posterior interosseous nerve, which immediately enters the supinator muscle.

Schwannomas originating from small nerve branches were removedwithout identification of the site of origin. After their resection, definitive healing was achieved. Conclusions. (1) Schwannomas located in extremities arise predominantly from major peripheral nerves, most commonly the ulnar andmedian nerves. (2) Gradual tumour growth causes exacerbation of compression neuropathy, creating an indication for surgery. (3) In most cases, improvement in peripheral <b>nerve</b> function after <b>excision</b> of schwannoma is achieved. (4) The risk of new permanent postoperative neurological deficits is low. 1...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The paper aims {{to define}} the {{parameters}} available before surgery which could predict immediate facial <b>nerve</b> function after <b>excision</b> of a vestibular schwannoma (VS). METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with VS operated consecutively by a single surgeon using an identical surgical technique have been evaluated retrospectively. Data were collected regarding patients' sex, age at onset of symptoms and at surgery, initial symptoms, neurological status at presentation, early post-operative neurological status and complications. The main radiological parameters {{included in the study}} were tumour extension pattern, diameters, shape, and volume, as well as extent of bony changes of the internal auditory canal. RESULTS: As the tumour stage and volume increase, facial nerve function is worse after surgery (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 05, respectively). Concomitantly, larger extra-meatal tumour diameters in three dimensions (sagittal, coronal and axial) led to worse function (p < 0. 01). Anterior and/or caudal tumour extension (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 004, respectively) had more significant correlation than posterior and/or cranial extension (p = 0. 022 and p = 0. 353, respectively). Polycyclic VS had the worst prognosis, followed by the tumours with oval shape. The extent of intra-meatal tumour growth does not correlate with immediate facial nerve outcome. The different angles, lengths and diameters of the internal auditory channel showed no significant correlation with facial nerve outcome. Patients with headache as an initial symptom and those with gait instability and/or pre-operative poor facial nerve function had significantly worse immediate facial nerve outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that the analysis of the radiological and neurological patient data prior to surgery could give reliable clues regarding the immediate post-operative facial nerve function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Radial nerve {{compression}} by a ganglion in the radial tunnel is not common. Compressive neuropathies of the radial nerve in the radial tunnel can occur anywhere along {{the course of}} the nerve and may lead to various clinical manifestations, depending on which branch is involved. We present two unusual cases of ganglions located in the radial tunnel and requiring surgical excision. Case presentation A 31 -year-old woman complained of difficulty in fully extending her fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joint for 2 weeks. Before her first visit, she had noticed a swelling and pain in her right elbow over the anterolateral forearm. The extension muscle power of the metacarpophalangeal joints at the fingers and the interphalangeal joint at the thumb had decreased. Sonography and magnetic resonance imaging of the elbow revealed a cystic lesion located at the area of the arcade of Frohse. A thin-walled ovoid cyst was found against the posterior interosseous <b>nerve</b> during surgical <b>excision.</b> Pathological examination was compatible with a ganglion cyst. The second case involved a 36 -year-old woman complaining of numbness over the radial aspect of her hand and wrist, but without swelling or tumor in this area. The patient had slightly decreased sensitivity in the distribution of the sensory branch of the radial nerve. There was no muscle weakness on extension of the fingers and wrist. Surgical exposure defined a ganglion cyst in the shoulder of the division of the radial nerve into its superficial sensory and posterior interosseous components. There has been no disease recurrence after following both patients for 2 years. Conclusion Compression of nerves by extraneural soft tissue tumors of the extremities should be considered when a patient presents with progressive weakness or sensory changes in an extremity. Surgical excision should be promptly performed to ensure optimal recovery from the nerve palsy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tumors and tumor-like lesions in {{or around}} the median nerve are {{uncommon}} causes of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The {{purpose of the present}} study is to highlight the diagnostic approach and point out the profile of patients with CTS and potential underlying pathology. Twenty-eight patients with 32 affected hands had CTS correlated to a mass in {{or around the}} nerve. In 20 hands a palpable mass was present. Diagnostic workup included nerve conduction studies, ultrasound and/or MRI. Pre- and postoperative examination included two-point discrimination (2 PD), grip strength, visual analogue scale (for pain) (VAS) and disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) scores. Twelve of 28 patients were young (range 9 - 38 years) and 10 were male. Nerve compression was due to 27 extraneural lesions (8 abnormal muscles, 5 lipomas, 7 tenosynovitis, 4 vascular tumors, 2 ganglia, 1 Dupuytren's fibromatosis) and five intraneural tumors (three schwannomas, one neurofibroma, one sarcoma). <b>Nerve</b> decompression and <b>excision</b> of extraneural lesions were performed in all cases whereas in intraneural tumors, decompression was followed by excision in most cases and nerve grafting in one. Mean follow-up was 22 months (12 - 105 months). Extraneural masses were associated with a better outcome than nerve tumors. The mean postoperative VAS/DASH scores were 0. 3 / 16. 2 in extraneural lesions and 2. 5 / 22 in intraneural lesions. The 2 PD improved gradually in all patients (mean pre- and postoperative 12 and 5 mm). The mean grip strength increased from 28 to 31. 3 kg postoperatively. Although rare, the surgeon should include in the differential diagnosis of CTS the unusual cause of tumors and tumor-like lesions, especially when the patients' profile is not typical (young, male, no repetitive stress or manual labor). In addition, the presence of a palpable mass at the distal forearm or palm dictates the need for imaging studies. The extent, location and aggressiveness of the mass will determine the approach and type of procedure...|$|R
