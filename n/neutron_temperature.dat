Masud Ahmad, along with Riazuddin, temporarily working at the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Italy, return to Pakistan to begin theoretical work on a fission explosive device. The scientists were posted at Quaid-e-Azam University and the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) respectively. In the absence of the availability of computers, they use the mainframe computers at Quaid-e-Azam University for work related to the theoretical physics of a nuclear explosive device. He, along with Raziuddin Siddiqui and Riazuddin formed the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) in PAEC, which was mandated to develop the theoretical designs of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. By the 1973, the theoretical physicists from academic universities of Pakistan joined the Theoretical Physics Group, and initiated to work on developing the designs of the weapon. The Theoretical Physics Group directly reported to Abdus Salam who coordinated the research on metallurgy, weapon chemical lenses, enrichment, separation and reprocessing of the fuel. In 1974, the TPG scientists engaged in the calculations for the implosion mechanism and completed the work on Fast neutron calculations. The work was submitted to the Office of Science and Technology (now known as Ministry of Science and Technology), and Abdus Salam review the work done by the TPG. Later, Abdus Salam led the work on simultaneity where the TPG finished the calculations on how weapon would be detonated from several points at same time. In 1977, the TPG scientists completed the theoretical work on the design of an atomic bomb. In 1978, the TPG took calculations on Neutron emission - a type of radioactive decay.

40|$|Abstract The <b>neutron</b> <b>temperature</b> is a {{characteristic}} parameter in irradiation channels of reactor. For nuclides which have resonances in the thermal neutron energy range, their Westcott g-factors {{are different from}} unity. The values of g-factors and cross-sections of (n, c) reaction of these nuclides are temperature dependence. The standard energy for tabulation of thermal neutron cross-section (r 0) is that of room temperature (293. 59 K or 20. 43 C), cor-responding to a neutron energy 0. 0253 eV or to a neutron velocity of 2200 m/s. However, in the irradiation channels of reactor, the temperature is not exact at 20. 43 C. Thus, the temperature at the irradiation position must be known to convert r 0 to r(T).

40|$|The {{brightest}} {{class of}} low mass X-ray binary source: the Z-track sources are reviewed specifically {{with regard to}} the nature of the three distinct states of the sources. A physical model is presented for the Cygnus X- 2 sub-group in which increasing mass accretion rate takes place on the Normal Branch resulting in high <b>neutron</b> star <b>temperature</b> and radiation pressure responsible for inner disk disruption and launching of jets. The Flaring Branch consists of unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star. It is shown that the Sco X- 1 like sub-group is dominated by almost non-stop flaring consisting of both unstable burning and increase of Mdot, causing higher <b>neutron</b> star <b>temperatures.</b> Finally, results of Atoll source surveys are presented and a model for the nature of the Banana and Island states in these sources is proposed. Motion along the Banana state is caused by variation of Mdot. Measurements of the high energy cut-off of the Comptonized emission E_CO provide the electron temperature T_e of the Comptonizing ADC; above a luminosity of 2 x 10 ^ 37 erg/s E_CO is a few keV and T_e equals the <b>neutron</b> star <b>temperature.</b> At lower luminosities, the cut-off energy rises towards 100 keV showing heating of the corona by an unknown process.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for cooling neutrons by inelastic magnetic scattering in weakly absorbing, cold paramagnetic systems. Kinetic neutron energy is removed in constant decrements {{determined by the}} Zeeman energy of paramagnetic atoms or ions in an external magnetic field, or by zero-field level splittings in magnetic molecules. Analytical solutions of the stationary neutron transport equation are given using inelastic neutron scattering cross sections derived in an appendix. They neglect any inelastic process except the paramagnetic scattering and hence still underestimate very-cold neutron densities. Molecular oxygen with its triplet ground state appears particularly promising, notably as a host in fully deuterated oxygen-clathrate hydrate, or more exotically, in dry oxygen-He 4 van der Waals clusters. At a <b>neutron</b> <b>temperature</b> about 6 K, for which neutron conversion to ultra-cold neutrons by single-phonon emission in pure superfluid He 4 works best, conversion rates due to paramagnetic scattering in the clathrate {{are found to be}} a factor 9 larger. While in conversion the neutron imparts only a single energy quantum to the medium, the multi-step paramagnetic cooling cascade leads to further strong enhancements of very-cold neutron densities, e. g., by a factor 14 (57) for an initial <b>neutron</b> <b>temperature</b> of 30 K (100 K), for the moderator held at about 1. 3 K. Due to a favorable Bragg cutoff of the oxygen-clathrate the cascade-cooling can take effect in a moderator with linear extensions smaller than a meter.

[Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65 (3) : 400 (2002) ]; they were motivated by the experimental observation of small changes in energy of UCN upon their collisions with surface. The first hypothesis explaines {{the nature of the}} observed phenomenon by inelastic coherent scattering of UCN on nanoparticles weakly attached at surface, in a state of permanent thermal motion. It got experimental confirmed in ref. [Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65 (11) : 1996 (2002) ]. The second hypothesis inverts the problem of neutron interaction with nanoparticles in the following sence. In all experiments with UCN, the trap-wall temperature was much higher than a temperature of about 1 mK, which corresponds to the UCN energy. Therefore, UCN preferentially increased their energy. The surface density of weakly attached nanoparticles was low. If, however, the nanoparticles temperature is lower than the <b>neutron</b> <b>temperature</b> and if the nanoparticles density is high, the problem of interaction of neutrons with nanoparticles is inverted. In this case, the neutrons can cool down, under certain conditions, owing tot heir scattering on ultracold-heavy-water, deuterium, and oxigen nanoparticles to their temperature of about 1 mK, with result that the UCN density increases by many orders of magnitude.
