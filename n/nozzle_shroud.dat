40|$|Results of in-stream {{combustion}} measurements {{taken during}} Mach 5 to 7 true simulation {{testing of the}} Hypersonic Research Engine/Aerothermodynamic Integration Model (HRE/AIM) are presented. These results, the instrumentation techniques, and configuration changes to the engine installation that were required to test this model are described. In test runs at facility Mach numbers of 5 to 7, an exhaust instrumentation ring which formed {{an extension of the}} engine exhaust <b>nozzle</b> <b>shroud</b> provided diagnostic measurements at 10 circumferential locations in the HRE combustor exit plane. The measurements included static and pitot pressures using conventional conical probes, combustion gas temperatures from cooled-gas pyrometer probes, and species concentration from analysis of combustion gas samples. Results showed considerable circumferential variation, indicating that efficiency losses were due to nonuniform fuel distribution or incomplete mixing. Results using the Mach 7 facility nozzle but with Mach 6 temperature simulation, 1590 to 1670 K, showed indications of incomplete combustion. Nitric oxide measurements at the combustor exit peaked at 2000 ppmv for stoichiometric combustion at Mach 6...|$|E

The afterbody drag was derived from balance measurements of thrust-minus-drag and wind-off calibrations of thrust, and interpreted {{with the help of}} pressure plotting data. Two single-nozzle afterbodies were tested for comparison. Parameters investigated in the programme include jet size, base area with the changes obtained by infilling the valley between the nozzles and by extending as a fairing, afterbody boattail angle, <b>nozzle</b> <b>shroud</b> area ratio coupled with changes in shroud length, and shroud angle. At subsonic speeds and likely operational jet pressure ratios, the afterbody drag coefficients based on fuselage cross-sectional area lie in the range 0. 03 - 0. 06 of which typically, 0. 026 can be ascribed to skin friction. Under these conditions, much of the variation between configurations can be expressed as a linear increase in afterbody drag with effective base are...|$|E
40|$|An {{anisokinetic}} <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{system was}} designed for sampling particles at a constant low flow rate from a ventilation duct to an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS). <b>Shrouded</b> anisokinetic <b>nozzles</b> are a means for sampling from a moving airstream with higher particle transmission than with unshrouded isokinetic <b>nozzles.</b> This <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> sampling system was evaluated in an experimental ventilation duct system. Aspiration and transport efficiency measurements were made for five particle sizes in the range 1 - 13 μm at each of three duct air speeds in the range 2. 2 - 8. 8 m/s. Under these conditions, the <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> system showed improved performance compared to buttonhook isokinetic nozzles, especially for larger particles and higher air speeds. Measured transmission efficiencies through the <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> sampling system were generally higher and more reliably predictable than those through buttonhook isokinetic nozzles. Model predictions of transport and aspiration efficiencies of the <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> system showed good agreement with measurements over {{the entire range of}} experimental conditions.

40|$|The {{detrimental}} {{impact on}} the environment over the utilization of the conventional energy based fossil fuel is obvious. Thus, the effort on the reduction on the dependency on this unclean fuel is salient. The application of the clean renewable wind power {{can be one of the}} appropriate measures in supporting the effort in reducing the dependency on the unclean fuel. Performance is one of the essential aspects in determining the economic attractiveness on the technology application. One of the factors responsible to the performance of the power technology is the wind velocity acting on the rotor blade. The addition of a shroud element is believed to have a great promise to increase the velocity at rotor, thus possibly improving the performance of the wind turbine. This study presents an experiment on horizontal and vertical wind turbines incorporated with rounded shroud devices. The experiment is conducted in a vehicle to simulate the effect of the flow of wind. The results on this experiment indicate that the addition of the shroud device with geometry of diffuser improves the performance of the horizontal axis wind turbine. For the <b>nozzle</b> <b>shroud</b> geometry, it seems to less significantly improve the performance of the horizontal axis wind turbine. For the vertical turbine, the incorporation of the shroud devices, both nozzle and diffuser, has almost no effect to increase the performance. This study also presents the discussion for the reasons behind the experimental results by relating to the condition of the turbine rotation and the wind velocity inside the shroud devices...|$|E
40|$|Prior and {{on-going}} machine {{evaluations of}} TBC coatings for power generation applications are summarized. Rainbow testing of various TBC's on turbine <b>nozzles,</b> <b>shrouds</b> and buckets are described {{along with one}} test on combustor liners. GEPG has conducted over 15 machine tests with TBC coated turbine nozzles of various coatings. Rainbow test times generally range between 10, 000 to 24, 000 hours. TBC performance has been quite good and additional testing, including TBC's on shrouds and buckets is continuing. The results show that TBC's have the capability of surviving in power generation machines for the times required. The earlier rainbow tests which evaluated various top coat compositions resulted in confirmation of the superiority of YSZ and especially the 6 - 8 YSZ composition. On-going tests are more focused on TBC process and property variations. The prevalent failure modes seen thus far in the various rainbow tests are erosion, foreign object damage and buildup of deposits. Additional post test analysis is required to investigate bond coat oxidation and other time/temperature dependent changes to the system...|$|R

Several ratios of the spacing between the <b>nozzle</b> and <b>shroud</b> exit to the nozzle exit diameter were investigated for several <b>shroud</b> to <b>nozzle</b> exit diameter ratios. Maximum gross thrust loss occurred under conditions of zero cooling-air flow and was as much as 35 percent below nozzle jet thrust.

It was developed by Luigi Stipa (1931) and Ludwig Kort (1934). The Kort <b>nozzle</b> is a <b>shrouded</b> propeller assembly for marine propulsion.

40|$|The test {{seeks to}} find the {{effectiveness}} of thrust augmentation due to air entrainment at the rocket <b>nozzle</b> exit. <b>Shrouds</b> {{are attached to the}} primary nozzle to entrain the ambient air for further expansion. Compressed air is used to simulate a propellant in the primary flow; therefore, combustion and afterburning are excluded. Perfect expansion is used in the primary (unshrouded) nozzle to further rule out the suspicion that the shrouds simply act as a nozzle extension in the event that thrust augmentation is observed. The goal is {{to find the}} effectiveness of thrust augmentation as the result of air entrainment alone. Thrust and flow data are recorded for different shrouds at over, fully, and under-expanded conditions. Recorded mass flow rate data will be used to calculate the entrainment rate. Results of this experiment will be verified with a computer code...|$|R

40|$|Hot flow aero-acoustic {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with Pratt & Whitney's High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) Mixer-Ejector Exhaust Nozzles by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) in the GEAE Anechoic Freejet Noise Facility (Cell 41) located in Evendale, Ohio. The tests evaluated the impact of various geometric and design parameters on the noise generated by a two-dimensional (2 -D) shrouded, 8 -lobed, mixer-ejector exhaust <b>nozzle.</b> The <b>shrouded</b> mixer-ejector provides noise suppression by mixing relatively low energy ambient air with the hot, high-speed primary exhaust jet. Additional attenuation was obtained by lining the shroud internal walls with acoustic panels, which absorb acoustic energy generated during the mixing process. Two mixer designs were investigated, the high mixing "vortical" and aligned flow "axial", along with variations in the shroud internal mixing area ratios and shroud length. The shrouds were tested as hardwall or lined with acoustic panels packed with a bulk absorber. A total of 21 model configurations at 1 : 11. 47 scale were tested. The models were tested over a range of primary nozzle pressure ratios and primary exhaust temperatures representative of typical HSCT aero thermodynamic cycles. Static as well as flight simulated data were acquired during testing. A round convergent unshrouded nozzle was tested to provide an acoustic baseline for comparison to the test configurations. Comparisons were made to previous test results obtained with this hardware at NASA Glenn's 9 - by 15 -foot low-speed wind tunnel (LSWT). Laser velocimetry was used to investigate external as well as ejector internal velocity profiles for comparison to computational predictions. Ejector interior wall static pressure data were also obtained. A significant reduction in exhaust system noise was demonstrated with the 2 -D <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs...|$|R

The test parameters involved particle sizes from 1 to 15 {mu}m, air velocities from 3 to 15 m/s. The results of the tests show that shrouded probes can deliver samples with significantly less particle-size bias then the isokinetic nozzle probes tested. Tests were also conducted on two sample flow splitters to determine particle loss as a function of aerodynamic particle size. The particle size range covered in these tests was 5 to 15 {mu}m.

A favorable installation effect occurred from Mach 0. 82 to 0. 96 with a nominal 4 -percent corrected secondary weight-flow ratio. This favorable effect resulted from changes in pressure forces on the nozzle surfaces.

40|$|The hot {{and cold}} {{cracking}} tendencies of some early iron aluminide alloy compositions limited their use to applications where good weldability was not required. Considerable {{progress has been made}} toward improving this situation. Using hot crack testing techniques developed at ORNL and a systematic study of alloy compositional effects, we have established a range of compositions within which hot cracking resistance is very good, essentially equivalent to stainless steel. Cold cracking, however, remains an issue, and extensive efforts are continuing to optimize composition and welding parameters, especially preheat and postweld heat treatment, to minimize its occurrence. In terms of filler metal and process development, we have progressed from sheared strip through aspiration cast rod and shielded metal arc electrodes {{to the point where we}} can now produce composite wire with a steel sheath and aluminum core in coil form, which permits the use of both the gas tungsten arc and gas metal arc processes. This is a significant advancement in that the gas metal arc process lends itself well to automated welding, and is the process of choice for commercial weld overlay applications. Using the newly developed filler metals, we have prepared clad specimens for testing in a variety of environments both in-house and outside ORNL, including laboratory and commercial organizations. As a means of assessing the field performance of this new type of material, we have modified several non-pressure boundary boiler components, including fuel <b>nozzles</b> and port <b>shrouds,</b> by introducing areas of weld overlay in strategic locations, and have placed these components in service in operating boilers for a side-by-side comparison with conventional corrosion-resistant materials...|$|R
