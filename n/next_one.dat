5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of the <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral {{can be seen as}} a special case of self-similarity.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} proceeds in {{a series}} of steps such that the output of each step is used as an input for the <b>next</b> <b>one.</b> Let k be an integer that counts the steps of the algorithm, starting with zero. Thus, the initial step corresponds to k=0, the next step corresponds to k=1, and so on.|$|E

5|$|The game's puzzles {{are divided}} into groups set on {{different}} planets. Players generally must complete each puzzle in order to progress to the <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> but the game includes optional harder puzzles. Final boss levels, called out as defense levels, complete each planet; here, the player must efficiently create chemicals and deliver them in a timely manner, once the reactor systems have been started, to trigger defense systems to ward off attacking enemies before they destroy a control structure.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{computer}} software {{has been written}} for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a central processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the <b>next</b> <b>one</b> is executed.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe's home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.|$|E

5|$|In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn {{installed}} the Pong prototype {{at a local}} bar, Andy Capp's Tavern. They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar's manager, Bill Gaddis; Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype {{on one of the}} tables near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, pinball machines, and Computer Space. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the <b>next</b> <b>one</b> and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.|$|E
5|$|In late March, Davis began {{suffering}} {{a series of}} injuries. On March 28, Davis injured his left ankle, after four minutes of play against the Jazz. He missed {{the rest of the}} game and the <b>next</b> <b>one.</b> Davis returned to the lineup on March 31 against Sacramento. However, on April 2, Davis endured back spasms that caused him to miss the second half against the Nuggets. Davis saw limited minutes on April 4 and missed a game on April 9 due to his back. On April 10, the team announced that Davis would miss the remaining four games. Davis finished the season as the NBA leader in blocked shots per game (2.82). Because of his improved performance this season against his rookie season, Davis finished third in the NBA Most Improved Player Award voting behind Lance Stephenson and Goran Dragić.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton deceived Bradman with a googly. Bradman {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in, but it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg-glanced the <b>next</b> <b>one</b> for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed to hold on. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both players had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled {{by many of the}} deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness is an {{isometric}} platform game {{in which}} the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a trackball, though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim {{of the game is}} for the player to complete six maze-like, isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock {{at the end of a}} race is carried over to the <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil: Revelations is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. In the game's single-player campaign, the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes. Most of the scenarios involve the player controlling Jill Valentine aboard a ghost ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but some require the player to play as other characters in different settings. To finish a scenario and proceed to the <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> the player must complete certain objectives such as solving puzzles, defeating a boss, collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game, among others.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel was the <b>next</b> <b>one</b> of {{the front}} runners to pit, coming in on lap 13, while {{teammate}} Kimi Räikkönen followed a lap later. Rosberg made a pit stop on lap 15 and emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him two laps later. Meanwhile, Hamilton went into the pit lane for a tyre change on lap 16. By lap 18, Hamilton was leading Vettel by 8.1 seconds, with Rosberg a further 3.8 seconds behind. Max Verstappen entered the point scoring ranks with a pass on Fernando Alonso into turn one on lap 26. Two laps later, his Toro Rosso teammate Sainz damaged his front wing when hitting a bollard on {{his way into the}} pit lane, leading to a front wing change.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating {{him through a}} maze of consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the <b>next</b> <b>one</b> in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E
50|$|We {{have learned}} a lot from {{experience}} about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It's a little bit off because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting to {{look at the history of}} measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than Millikan's, and the <b>next</b> <b>one's</b> a little bit bigger than that, and the <b>next</b> <b>one's</b> a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.|$|R
