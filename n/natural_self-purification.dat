40|$|Lake Miedwie is a {{eutrophic}} reservoir {{characterized by}} strong oxygen {{deficiencies in the}} hypolimnion, as well as high concentrations of nutrients (particularly phosphorus) and a significant recent increase in algae biomass. The water quality in the lake depends on pollutant inflow from the watershed, rate of biological activities, and accumulations of pollutants in bottom sediments. The lake has very good natural conditions, described by class I of vulnerability for degradation. Decreasing the level of anthropogenic stress should allow the <b>natural</b> <b>self-purification</b> of lake water.

40|$|International audienceStepped cascades are {{recognized}} as high potential air water gas exchangers. In natural rivers, these structures enhance oxygen transfer to water by creating turbulence at interface with increasing air entrainment in water and air water surface exchange. Stepped cascades could be really useful to improve the <b>natural</b> <b>self-purification</b> process by providing oxygen to aerobic micro-organisms. The aeration performance of these structures depends on several operating and geometrical parameters. In the literature, several empirical correlations for aeration efficiency prediction on stepped cascades exist. Most of these correlations are only applicable for operating and geometrical parameters {{in the range of}} which they have been developed. In this paper, 398 experimental sets of data (from our experiments and collected from literature) were used to develop a correlation for aeration prediction over stepped cascades derived from dimensional analysis and parameterized for each individual flow regime in order to consider change in flow regime effect on oxygen transfer. This new correlation allowed calculating the whole set of data obtained for cascades with steps heights between 0. 05 m and 0. 254 m, cascade total height between 0. 25 m and 2. 5 m, for discharges per unit of width ranging from 0. 28 10 (- 3) m(2) /s to 600 10 (- 3) m(2) /s and for cascade steps number between 3 and 25. In these ranges of parameters, standard deviation for aeration efficiency estimation was found to be less than 17 %. Finally, advices were proposed to help and improve the structure design in order to improve aeration...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{has good}} quality {{drinking}} water derived {{from thousands of}} streams, rivers, lakes and aquifers fed by regular rainfalls ranging from 400 to 11 000 mm year- 1. These waters are treated variously to provide over 80 % of 3. 6 million inhabitants with satisfactory drinking water. By international standards, New Zealand nevertheless has high incidence rates of potentially waterborne diseases such as campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, and giardiasis. Traditional public health interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of these diseases generally focus on water treatment and personal and food hygiene. However, continuing epidemics of most enteric diseases in New Zealand indicate that this approach is often less than effective. A broader approach might lie {{in the study of}} whole ecosystems to understand the interactions between climate, vegetation, geology, pathogens, animals and humans. For example, pastoral farming removes deep-rooted vegetation from hill sides and river banks, increasing the volume and speed of runoff during heavy rains, and thereby reducing <b>natural</b> <b>self-purification</b> of water contaminated by stock excrement. Stock or humans drinking water down-stream may now arguably be exposed to pathogens more frequently than they would have been with a single contamination event following an exceptional flood. Ecological analysis of this kind can result in novel recommendations for the type, time and place of public health interventions, with a consequent reduction in the frequency with which pathogens contaminate water. A direct source of both human and stock infection is thereby removed, as are various sources of secondary human infection (meat from infected stock and faecal contamination from infected stock and humans, for example) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} sewage {{effluent}} and <b>natural</b> <b>self-purification</b> {{in the upper}} Chinyika River was investigated during the period October 2004 to February 2005. The physico-chemical and river flow variables, and water samples, were colleted on monthly basis. The samples were analysed for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand and total dissolved solids using the appropriate methods. Sediment samples were also collected once during the dry months and also once during the wet months and were analysed for total nitrogen, total phosphorus and heavy metals. The nutrient concentrations {{in the water column}} and loading levels in the sediments were high just below sewage outflow in to the river, generally decreasing with increasing distance from the point of sewage outflow because of self-purification. The nutrient concentration was high during the dry months with the highest mean values (N = 6. 35; P = 4. 01 mg l- 1) being recorded in November and was low during the wet months with the lowest values (N = 1. 33; P = 0. 57 mg l- 1) being recorded in January and December respectively, suggesting dilution effect. The nutrient load, on the other hand, was high during the wet months with the highest mean values (N = 8704. 80; P = 2434. 00 kg month- 1) being recoded in January suggesting that organic matter was washed away from the catchment (diffuse inputs) in to the river channel resulting in high nutrient loading levels. The nutrient level in the sediments was high during the dry months (mean N = 1. 01; mean P = 0. 39 mg g- 1 dry sediment) and low during the wet months (mean N = 0. 37; mean P = 0. 06 mg g- 1 dry sediment) probably due to sediment re-suspension and the subsequent transportation because of storm action. There were no detectable temporal and spatial trends observed in heavy metal levels in the sediments. The other physico-chemical variables showed a general tendency of deteriorating just below sewage outflow and then improving with increasing distance downstream because of self-purification, except conductivity. High self-purification capacity was observed in the upper Chinyika River during the dry and wet months though it was generally lower in the latter coinciding with the observed riparian vegetation senescence, thus, emphasizing the importance of riparian vegetation in water quality monitoring in river channels. Conservation of riparian wetlands is, thus, central to sound watershed management. The capacity of rivers to purify themselves should be managed so that they can absorb pollution before discharging into lakes and reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Capacity of {{self-purification}} {{processes of}} urban river areas near Basel (CH). Improvement of rehabilitated and natural-like wetlands {{in the ancient}} river basins of the river Wiese, Birs and Rhine. Introduction and objectives: Urban areas are characterized by an enormous human use density. Passing rivers and their landscapes were subjected and adapted to the human activities. Straightened and obstructed running waters have today become self-evident nationwide. Since {{the end of the}} 20 th century an increased number of projects have been trying to convert these into natural forms with permitted controlled dynamics (e. g. the rehabilitation of the river Wiese or BirsVital in the area of Basel). Following a new social consent, priority is given to recreation use and sustainability. Such rehabilitation projects in urban areas often encounter different conflicting aims, e. g. between nature conservation and recreation use, or between striving after improved horizontal and vertical permeability (connectivity) and the requirements of groundwater protection. The precepts of a sustainable use advise using the <b>natural</b> <b>self-purification</b> potential within a modern river landscape management by preferring free running waters. In many cases, this wonâ€™t be possible in urban areas due to the requirement of space as well as the doubts raised by ground-water protection or involved groups of users. Unfortunately there exist too few studies on rehabilitations in urban areas aiming at a chemical-physical and social optimization. The two MGU projects F 2. 00 and F 1. 03 in the period 2000 - 2002 in the Langen Erlen and 2003 - 2005 in the Brueglinger Ebene and the Petite Camargue Alsacienne try to remedy these deficiencies by examining under which premises and boundary conditions a revival of the natural wetlands and river landscapes would be possible and how the various requirements for use could be considered. This work focused on the purification potential of flooded, natural wetlands and shallow lakes and shows the efficiency of such systems. The results are discussed {{against the backdrop of the}} adoption of such landscape features for the improvement of rehabilitated river landscapes. Methods: Different measuring techniques (according to standardized methods) in different temporal resolutions are used to quantify the purification performance along the running distance of natural horizontal filters and for the characterisation of the water quality in the investigated wetlands. Therefore, in the areas of investigation, monthly samples were generally taken. The determination of the water quality took place on the one hand directly in the field (oxygen saturation, oxygen contents, water temperature, pH value, specific electrical conductivity and turbidity) and on the other hand dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV-Absorption at 254 nm (UVA 254) as well as cations (K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) and anions (NH 4 +, NO 3 -, PO 4 3 -, SO 4 2 -, Cl-) were measured in the water laboratory of the Geographical Institute. The colony-forming units of E. coli and total coliform germs were determined by means of diaphragm filtration. In the "Hintere Stellimatten" the sampling turned out somewhat different but always with the intention to document the changes within the running water. To investigate the change of the water quality with increasing soil depth in the groundwater recharge area "Hintere Stellimatten", water samples were taken by means of suction candles out of different soil depths. Later â€“ in the constructed wetland of the Brueglinger Ebene â€“ six laterally slit tubing probes divided into three levels were inserted into the substrate down to the tarred bedrock. They served to collect water samples to capture the current chemical-physical conditions and the vertical exchange and conversion processes along the main running distance. The same analytics (with exception of the microbiology and DOC-analysis) as described above are taken with these samples. In order to identify the influence of the surface water on the groundwater quality, water samples were taken (and analyzed in the water laboratory of the Industrial Works of Basel, IWB) monthly or fortnightly in the groundwater well # 8 (distance 400 m) and # 9 (distance 100 m) near the recharge area "Hintere Stellimatten". Almost the same parameters as above were chosen. Results: During the project F 2. 00 in the "Hintere Stellimatten" in the Langen Erlen area, a procedure to charge the natural-like ground water recharge and protection area (belonging to the IWB) with water from the river Wiese (without using energy) was tested. The purification performance concerning nitrate and ammonium along the running distance of the natural horizontal filter is being proofed. The reduction rates underlie fluctuations and for ortho-phosphates it is even more difficult to see clear tendencies. The number of aerobe mesophilic germs augmented in the recharge area, and E. coli germs consequently decreased by 25 - 30...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{of life on}} Earth in {{the future}} will largely depend on the amount of safe water. As the most {{fundamental}} source of life, water is relentlessly consumed and polluted. To halt this trend, many countries are taking extensive measures and investing substantial resources in order to stop the contamination of water and return at least tolerably good water quality to nature. The goal of water purification is to obtain clean water with the sewage sludge as a by-product. Clean water is returned to nature, and further treatment of sludge may be subject to other procedures. The conclusion of this paper is simple. The procedure with purified water is easily achievable, purified water is discharged into rivers, lakes and seas, but the problem of further treatment of sludge remains. This paper presents the basic methods of wastewater treatment and procedures for processing the products from contaminated water. The paper can serve as a basis for further elaboration. Water Pollution In order to ensure normal life of living creatures, the water in which they live or the water they use must have a natural chemical composition and natural features. When, as a result of human activities, the chemical composition of water and the ratio of its chemical elements significantly change, we say that water is polluted. When the pollutants come from industrial plants, we are talking about industrial wastewater, and when they come from households and urban areas, we are talking about municipal wastewater. Both contain a huge amount of pollutants that eventually end up in rivers. Then, thousands of defenseless birds, fish and other animals suffer, and environmental consequences become immeasurable. In addition, the waste fed to the water often ends up in the bodies of marine animals, so they can return to us as food. Thermal water pollution also has multiple effects on the changes in the wildlife composition of aquatic ecosystems. Polluted water can be purified by mechanical, chemical and biological agents. Mechanical methods are based on the effect of physical forces. Chemical agents are based on chemical processes. Biological measures are based on natural laws and activities of living beings. Water saving and its rational use {{are some of the most}} effective ways of saving water from pollution. Water treatment Water treatment is done in two ways: by sedimentation and filtration. Dirt falling on the bottom is called deposition. The passage of clean water through the material is called filtering. Water containing dissolved substances is purified by distillation. To improve the taste of distilled water, aeration should be performed. The sunâ€™s ultraviolet rays destroy biological pollutants. Mechanical, biological and chemical methods are used for water purification. Mechanical methods Mechanical methods are based on the removal of physical impurities from water and the action of natural forces. For this purpose we use: grids and sieves, sedimentation, flotation, filtration, centrifugation, sand sedimentation tanks, grease traps, primary sedimentation tanks and flow equalization tanks. Wastewater aeration equipment is also used within these facilities. Grids and Sieves Larger, insoluble and floating substances in wastewater are removed with grids and sieves. Sedimentation The application of grids and sieves as well as sand sedimentation tanks and grease traps can be viewed as a process of deposition using certain infrastructure facilities intended for this type of separation of impurities. Infrastructure facilities are sedimentation tanks. There are vertical, horizontal and radial flow sedimentation tanks. Flotation Particle resurfacing with bubbles of air is called flotation. The best effect is achieved by aeration of bubbles of smaller diameters in a larger area. Filtration Filtration is a process used in water conditioning to remove insoluble substances. During filtration, water passes through a layer of granular material placed on a perforated surface. Some other processes can also take place during filtration. Centrifugation Centrifugation is a method of separating particles from a suspension due to the effect of the centrifugal force that is many times greater than the force of gravity. For larger water quantities, it is not realistic to apply centrifugation as a water purification technique. Sand sedimentation tanks Substances with specific gravity higher than water, such as sand, gravel, stone, earth, slag, mineral particles, etc., accumulate in the plants called sand traps. Grease traps Substances lighter than water: oil, grease, soap flakes, bits of wood, cork, etc., are removed by means of grease traps. Flow equalization tanks They provide conditions for the slow and steady movement of water and retain wastewater long enough to provide gravity sedimentation of suspended particles. Chemical methods Chemical purification methods are the processes in which the treatment is carried out by means of certain chemical reactions, or certain physical and chemical phenomena. Basic operations of the chemical wastewater treatment are the removal of suspended and colloidal substances: by coagulation and flocculation, and the removal of some dissolved substances: by chemical deposition, ion exchange, oxidation,Â Â  gas blowing and adsorption. Chemical deposition The process of chemical deposition is based on the conversion of dissolved substances in wastewater to insoluble compounds, using suitable reagents. Ion exchange Ion exchange is much more widely used as a water preparation process to remove water hardness than as a wastewater purification process. Oxidation Oxidation can convert some organic and inorganic substances in industrial wastewater into compounds that are far less polluting. The most often used oxidant is chlorine. Gas blowing Some dissolved substances can be removed from the wastewater by means of blowing gas, ordinary air or steam. Adsorption Adsorption is a process of accumulating fluid substances on the surface of the solid phase. A substance being adsorbed isÂ  adsorbate, and the phase upon which the adsorption is carried out is called the adsorbent. Biological methods Biological purification processes are based on the activities of a complex microflora, which is in the course of their life cycle adopted by organic and parts of inorganic materials causing wastewater pollution, using them to maintain life activities and to create new cells. During a biological treatment, stabilized sludge is precipitated,and removed from the water in secondary sedimentation tanks. Biological purification processes can be aerobic and anaerobic, with the help of aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms. Aerobic processes with suspended microflora are divided into: the processes with activated sludge in bioaeration tanks, processes in aerated lagoons (biological lagoons) and processes in aerobic (shallow) lakes (biological artificial lakes). Activated sludge process This is an aerobic process of a biological wastewater treatment, as it occurs due to aerobic microbial population. Microorganisms are found in aeration basins, where, with the help of oxygen in the metabolic process, substrate degradation is provided. Microorganisms oxidize the dissolved substrate into carbon dioxide and water. A part of the organic material is synthesized into new cells or used for the growth of existing ones and the rest consists of waste and excess sludge. A part of sludge is returned into the process (activated sludge) where it has a role of an activator of the biological process. The rest of sludge is discharged into the sludge treatment device or disposed of in a proper way. Clear purified water (effluent) is discharged into the recipient, or, if necessary, taken to additional processing. Process in aerobic lagoons Lagoons and shallow basins, as an aerobic biological wastewater treatment method, provide a sufficient amount of oxygen through photosynthesis. Process in shallow lakes Aerobic lakes are large and shallow earthen basins in which wastewater treatment takes place with minimum regulation, practically as <b>natural</b> <b>self-purification.</b> Anaerobic processes The anaerobic treatment process is based on the methane fermentation of organic wastewater pollution, where organic material is converted into a mixture of gases. The use of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen is called anaerobic digestion. Processing products from the wastewater treatment process Waste materials from the wastewater treatment process should have a high proportion of isolated components and a small proportion of the remaining moisture. Sludge treatment methods may include: thickening, stabilization, conditioning, dewatering, drying or oxidation and disposal. In accordance with the applied technology, sludge treatment processes may be biological, technical and mechanical ones. Biological sludge treatment processes are performed for compost production, to improve sludge residue for disposal, for biological stabilization of sludge residue. Composting is the simplest way of processing biodegradable sludge (humus). Compost can be used in agriculture, to revitalize the soil laid bare by fire and to improve the quality of land next to roads. Mechanical-biological treatment of sludge is based on a process of mechanical treatment of sludge, where valuable components are separated from sludge. These components are metal, paper, plastic, nonmetal or harmful substances that cannot be disposed of in landfills. The thermal treatment of sludge is carried out using the following methods: combustion, pyrolysis and gasification. </p...|$|E
