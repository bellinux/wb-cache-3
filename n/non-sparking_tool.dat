Spills: Clean up spills {{in a manner that}} does not disperse dust into the air. Use <b>non-sparking</b> <b>tools</b> and equipment. Reduce airborne dust and prevent scattering by moistening with water. Pick up spill for recovery or disposal and place in a closed container.|$|R
50|$|EGA Master is a {{manufacturer}} of tools for professional/industrial use founded by Iñaki Garmendia Ajuria in 1990 and based in Vitoria-Gasteiz (Spain). Originally specialized in pipe tools it later diversified into a wider product range, including mechanical <b>tools,</b> <b>non-sparking</b> <b>tools,</b> titanium non-magnetic tools, insulated tools and explosion-proof intrinsically safe instruments. It patented the Basque Wrench, among other worldwide patents. The company has customers in over 150 countries, and was selected in 2011 {{as one of the}} top 100 Spanish brands.|$|R
50|$|Beryllium copper is {{non-sparking}} but physically {{tough and}} nonmagnetic, fulfilling {{the requirements of}} ATEX directive for Zones 0, 1, and 2. Beryllium copper screwdrivers, pliers, wrenches, cold chisels, knives, and hammers are available for environments with explosive hazards, such as oil rigs, coal mines, and grain elevators. An alternative metal sometimes used for <b>non-sparking</b> <b>tools</b> is aluminium bronze. Compared to steel tools, beryllium copper tools are more expensive, not as strong, and less durable, but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages.|$|R
5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include <b>non-sparking</b> <b>tools</b> that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|R

The Switzerland based {{company is a}} manufacturer of engineered alloys of different compositions and properties, intended for specific uses in the aerospace, automotive, energy-conservation, manufacturing and other industries. It also produces <b>non-sparking</b> safety <b>tools</b> for the oil industry, {{as well as the}} firefighting and fire prevention sectors. Additionally, AMPCO METAL provides engineering, machining and welding advice to the industry, in matters involving its speciality copper, aluminium-bronze and other alloys. AMPCO METAL currently employs approximately 250 people worldwide, and operates a number of divisions and sales offices on three continents.|$|R

50|$|Berylliosis is an {{occupational}} disease. Relevant occupations are those where beryllium is mined, processed or converted into metal alloys, or where machining of metals containing beryllium and recycling of scrap alloys occurs. It {{is associated with}} aerospace manufacturing, microwave semiconductor electronics, beryllium mining or manufacturing of fluorescent light bulbs (which once contained beryllium compounds in their internal phosphor coating). Beryllia was used in lamp manufacture because of ceramic's obvious virtues for insulation and heat resistance, and also because beryllia could be made transparent. Certain welding anodes along with other electrical contacts and even <b>non-sparking</b> <b>tools</b> are made of beryllium copper alloy and the subsequent machining of such materials would cause the disease as well.|$|R
40|$|BERYLLIUM {{poisoning}} is {{an industrial}} hazard which {{has appeared in}} the United States during the past 10 years. Beryllium compounds are commonly found in fluorescent lamps, radio, electronic and x-ray tubes, alloys and <b>non-spark</b> <b>tools.</b> 1 The metal is lighter (specific gravity, 1. 85) than aluminum (specific gravity, 2. 70). 4 Soluble dusts and fumes produce acute pneumonia and dermatitis. In-soluble dust in the lungs causes a slow development of granulomatosis. 2 The fibrosis of the lungs may develop over a period of years. 5 Particles embedded in the tissue require surgical excision for cure. 3 No suitable treatment was found before cortisone or ACTH. It is too early to evaluate the curative value of corti-sone, but it has seemed life saving on two occasions in this case...|$|R
50|$|The {{wire brush}} is {{primarily}} an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It {{is also used}} to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle wire brush, as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or in potentially flammable environments where <b>non-sparking</b> <b>tools</b> are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.|$|R
50|$|The impact between steel hammer {{heads and}} the objects being hit can create sparks, which may ignite {{flammable}} or explosive gases. These are a hazard in some {{industries such as}} underground coal mining (due {{to the presence of}} methane gas), or in other hazardous environments such as petroleum refineries and chemical plants. In these environments, a variety of <b>non-sparking</b> metal <b>tools</b> are used, primarily made of aluminium or beryllium copper. In recent years, the handles have been made of durable plastic or rubber, though wood is still widely used because of its shock-absorbing qualities and repairability.|$|R
5000|$|The American Metal Products Company {{was founded}} on June 6, 1914, in Milwaukee, WI by {{inventor}} August Littman, {{with a small group}} of other entrepreneurs. The company's first product was a specially-formulated bronze alloy hard enough to cut steel, aptly named Bronze — a name derived from the new company's own identity.An early version of the company's present diamond-shaped logo saw the day. It has remained in use in substantially the same recognizable format ever since. The American Metal Products Company slowly expanded its activities into the production of aluminium bronze alloys as sand castings, forgings and centrifugal castings.The company was renamed [...] "AMPCO METAL" [...] in 1930, by which time it had built itself a reputation as a reliable producer of high quality alloys.The Second World War strongly increased the demand for copper-based alloys and industrial bronzes, especially in the field of aeronautics. By 1944, manufacturing operations had grown from 100 to 2,500 employees, and every American airplane carried AMPCO METAL parts somewhere in its structure—in its engines, landing gear, propellers or airframe.In the marine environment, AMPCO METAL propellers were manufactured for landing barges and ships, and generally, AMPCO METAL alloys could be found in most sectors of military operations.Innovation was an important part of company philosophy from the outset. From 1922 onward into the 1970s, intensive research was done on the development of special <b>non-sparking,</b> non-magnetic hand <b>tools</b> for highly specialised fields such as the petroleum and natural gas industries, fire fighting and prevention, and the non-ferrous-metal welding sector. Centrifugally-cast bronzes, special hard bronzes for tooling and die applications, nickel-aluminium bronzes, high-strength aeronautical alloys as well as high-conductivity welding electrodes were all flagship products in these diverse industries.From the late 1950s, AMPCO METAL developed an extensive sales and distribution network in different countries, primarily across Europe, in order to increase contact with its various markets.In the 1970s, AMPCO METAL became the first alloy producer certified by the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) and in the 1980s, the first company to use EPC (Evaporative Pattern Casting) manufacturing processes in copper-based alloy production.In 2003, AMPCO METAL launched a sales and marketing department in Tian-Jin, China.AMPCO METAL is now active on three continents and in twelve countries.|$|R
