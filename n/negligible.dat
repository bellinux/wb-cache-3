5|$|In {{contrast}} to the three species of Collybia, D.racemosa shows <b>negligible</b> reactivity to common chemical tests used in mushroom identification, including aniline, alpha-napthol, guaiacol, sulfoformol, phenol, and phenol-aniline.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, 237Np, is <b>negligible</b> {{compared to}} the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in <b>negligible</b> amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes. Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on 239Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium, 244Pu, is 3%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most plutonium is produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|A {{constant}} stress layer {{exists in the}} near wall region. Due to the damping of the vertical velocity fluctuations near the wall, the Reynolds stress term will become <b>negligible</b> and we find that a linear velocity profile exists. This is only true for the very near wall region.|$|E
5|$|Although {{probably}} {{outnumbered by}} a substantial margin, Julian's army won a complete victory after a hard-fought struggle. With <b>negligible</b> casualties of their own, the Romans drove the Alamanni beyond the river Rhine, inflicting heavy losses. Julian's force, the imperial escort army of Gaul, was small but of high quality. The battle was {{won by the}} skill of the Roman infantry, with the cavalry initially performing poorly.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth. This {{magnetic field}} is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides <b>negligible</b> protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Most onion cultivars {{are about}} 89% water, 9% {{carbohydrates}} (including 4% sugar and 2% dietary fibre), 1% protein, and <b>negligible</b> fat (table). Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients {{and have an}} energy value of 166 kJ (40 Calories) in a 100g (3.5oz) amount. Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content.|$|E
5|$|Per 100 g serving {{providing}} 63 calories, the raw fruit {{has high}} vitamin C content (218% of the Daily Value, DV) and moderate levels {{of iron and}} manganese (12% DV each). Other nutrients are present in <b>negligible</b> amounts (less than 10% DV, table).|$|E
5|$|Plutonium 239, with a 24,000 year half life, {{will persist}} in the {{environment}} {{hundreds of thousands of}} years. The DOE's assessment of the Central Operating Unit indicates that the long-term risk to citizens living outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats is <b>negligible,</b> but citizen organizations state that the remediation of the site was inadequate.|$|E
5|$|R. leucophrys leucophrys, the {{nominate}} subspecies, is {{the most}} widely distributed form found in Australia. The description below refers to it. There is <b>negligible</b> variation within this form, and little between the three; all have very similar plumage.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that Jesus {{was a political}} national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is <b>negligible.</b> Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E
5|$|The 1959 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season had a then record-tying number of tropical cyclones – five – develop before August1. The season was officially to begin on June15, 1959 and last until November15, 1959, {{the period of}} each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin, however in actuality the season began early when Tropical Storm Arlene formed on May28. Tropical Storm Arlene struck Louisiana and brought minor flooding to the Gulf Coast of the United States. The next storm, Beulah, formed in the western Gulf of Mexico and brought <b>negligible</b> impact to Mexico and Texas. Later in June, an unnamed hurricane, nicknamed the Escuminac disaster, caused minor damage in Florida and devastated coastal Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, after becoming extratropical. Hurricane Cindy brought minor impact to The Carolinas. In late July, Hurricane Debra produced flooding {{in the state of}} Texas. Tropical Storm Edith in August and Hurricane Flora in September caused <b>negligible</b> impact on land.|$|E
5|$|The {{direction}} {{and intensity of}} the dipole change over time. Over {{the last two centuries}} the dipole strength has been decreasing {{at a rate of about}} 6.3% per century. At this rate of decrease, the field would be <b>negligible</b> in about 1600 years. However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of the storm also brought unseasonable rainfall, although <b>negligible,</b> to parts of southern and central California on July11. The moisture reached the region after being pulled northward by an upper-level low {{off the coast of}} Oregon. While over open waters, the storm produced usually heavy rainfall, exceeding 2in/h (50mm/h) at times.|$|E
5|$|The {{sulfuric acid}} {{droplets}} {{can be highly}} electrically charged, and so they offer the potential for lightning. Venus' small induced magnetosphere provides <b>negligible</b> protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation may result in cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges.|$|E
5|$|This kind {{of combat}} was {{consistent}} with the aim of minimising casualties and its efficacy is illustrated by the Battle of Strasbourg. The battle was primarily a struggle of attrition where steady pressure on the barbarians resulted in their eventual rout. Despite a long and hard-fought struggle, Roman casualties were <b>negligible</b> in comparison to the losses sustained by the defeated army.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes {{with food and}} water, but because of its low solubility, this exposure is <b>negligible.</b>|$|E
5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the <b>negligible</b> power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as <b>negligible,</b> due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, <b>negligible</b> charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
5|$|As {{an example}} of Curcubita, raw summer squash is 94% water, 3% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with <b>negligible</b> fat content (table). In 100 grams, raw squash {{supplies}} 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different Curcubita species may vary somewhat.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a <b>negligible</b> amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E
5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At {{the same time}} work {{continued}} on the castle. Spending on construction was <b>negligible</b> from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had been spent {{on the construction of}} Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town walls. As the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon, the plan was to build the castle's northern facade last.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a crystal {{structure}} analogous {{to that of}} diamond. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate {{between the two is}} <b>negligible</b> at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, {{the same as that of}} diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.|$|E
5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the Water Authority Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with <b>negligible</b> phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, {{the salt}} {{extraction}} activities gradually went into decline as the locally produced salt was uncompetitive with cheap salt {{produced in the}} Kama River regions. Extensive poaching also led to the significantly reduced outputs from pearl hunting. However, commercial deer herding became more popular, although its share in the economy remained <b>negligible</b> until the 19th century. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, the practice of seasonal fishing and hunting settlements in the north of the peninsula became very common.|$|E
5|$|Family Trade {{started off}} with decent ratings by GSN's standards, {{averaging}} 403,000 viewers for the two episodes shown {{on the night of}} the show's premiere, slightly above the network's primetime viewership average. However, the show quickly fell in the ratings, with all new episodes airing in March (including the premiere night's episodes) averaging 296,000 viewers, and only 40,000 viewers (with a 0.0 rating) among adults 18–49. In April, the series dropped even lower in terms of total viewers, with an average of 274,000, and only improved by a <b>negligible</b> amount among adults 18–49, with 46,000 viewers (again with a 0.0 rating).|$|E
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is <b>negligible</b> (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a <b>negligible</b> income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and {{increasingly}} as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E
5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were <b>negligible.</b> Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, believing the arriving force would threaten his lines of communication, ordered those elements of the division that had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had inadvertently stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{reinforced}} the CAP with launches of 3 more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused <b>negligible</b> damage, {{they kept the}} Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E
5|$|In a few {{northern}} areas, {{fish are}} also eaten. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a <b>negligible</b> or extremely minor {{part of the}} sea otter's diet. Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is <b>negligible.</b> Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is <b>negligible,</b> as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but <b>negligible</b> electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' occult and libertarian polemical {{writings}} {{were published}} posthumously, with Western esoteric and countercultural circles citing {{him as one}} of the most significant figures in propagating Thelema across North America. Although academic interest in his scientific career was originally <b>negligible,</b> in subsequent decades historians came to recognize Parsons' contributions to rocket engineering. For these innovations, his advocacy of space exploration and human spaceflight, and his role in the founding of JPL and Aerojet, Parsons is regarded as among the most important figures in the history of the U.S. space program. He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals.|$|E
5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} {{the revival of the}} Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to <b>negligible</b> influence within the state.|$|E
