50|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>rail</b> (Gallirallus lafresnayanus) is a {{large and}} drab flightless rail that is found {{on the island of}} New Caledonia in the Pacific. It is a dull brown above, with grey underparts, and has a yellowish, downward-curving bill. No one knows what it sounds like and it is not known whether it is nocturnal or crepuscular.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Gallirallus species are (with the {{exception}} of the weka) notoriously retiring and shy birds with often drab coloration. Given that the Okinawa rail and the Calayan rail have only been discovered in the late 20th century and as late as 2004, respectively, it cannot be ruled out that the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> and Sharpe's <b>rail</b> may still exist.|$|R

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows (Corvus moneduloides) are {{prolific}} tool {{users in}} captivity {{and in the}} wild, and have an inherited predisposition to express tool-oriented behaviours. To further understand the evolution and development of tool use, we compared the development of object manipulation in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows and common ravens (Corvus corax), which do not routinely use tools. We found striking qualitative similarities in the ontogeny of tool-oriented behaviour in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows and food-caching behaviour in ravens. Given that the common ancestor of <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows and ravens was almost certainly a caching species, we therefore propose that the basic action patterns for tool use in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows may have their evolutionary origins in caching behaviour. Noncombinatorial object manipulations had similar frequencies in the two species. However, frequencies of object combinations that are precursors to functional behaviour increased in <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows and decreased in ravens throughout the study period, ending 6 weeks post-fledging. These quantitative observations {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> crows develop tool-oriented behaviour because of an increased motivation to perform object combinations that facilitate the necessary learning. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R
50|$|Despite these threats, no {{species are}} known to have become extinct since 1500. Two species, the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>rail</b> and the New Caledonian lorikeet have not been seen for over a hundred years and are {{considered}} to be critically endangered if not actually extinct. A similar fate was thought to have befallen the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar, but a recent survey found them in remote areas. The New Caledonian crested gecko was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994. Native grasses are being outcompeted by robust, introduced competitors, such as Melinis minutiflora.|$|E
50|$|One species, the Guam rail, is {{extinct in}} the wild; {{there exists a}} semi-wild {{population}} in preparation for reintroduction to its original habitat. Three more species have gone extinct in historic times, while the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>rail</b> probably is extinct. The Sharpe's rail, only known from the type specimen of unclear origin, may also be extinct, although recent evidence {{suggests that it is}} invalid, and instead should be regarded as a morph of the buff-banded rail. Two further species are assumed from circumstantial evidence to have survived into the Modern era but are not known from recent specimens.|$|E
50|$|New Caledonia {{has one of}} {{the most}} enigmatic birds of the world, the {{endangered}} kagu. It is related to the cranes and it lives very hidden. It is also the heraldic bird of the island. Another endemic bird is the <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> <b>rail.</b> This critically endangered bird could be extinct but many believe that it still persists. Both the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar and the New Caledonian lorikeet are believed to persist under similar circumstances. There are also another twenty or so endemic birds on the island, including the tool-using New Caledonian crow. See Endemic birds of New Caledonia for more details. The seashells from New Caledonia are in great demand by collectors.|$|E

A majority voters - 80% - voted for <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> residents {{to determine whether or}} not to institute self-determination.

40|$|Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a {{recognised}} key threat for {{the conservation}} of parrots globally, causing morbidity and mortality of individuals in susceptible species. We present findings from a survey in 2012 to investigate the presence of BFDV in wild <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> parrots, including the endangered Ouvea Parakeet (Eunymphicus uvaeensis). Blood and feather samples from seven Ouvea Parakeets and 13 <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus deplanchii), and feathers from 15 <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Rainbow Lorikeets, five Horned Parakeets (Eunymphicus cornutus) and six <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Parakeets (Cyanoramphus saisseti) obtained from passive sampling, were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BFDV. We identified a BFDV prevalence of 25 % (95 % CI 11 - 45 %) in wild <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Rainbow Lorikeets, suggesting this species may act as a reservoir for persistence of BFDV in the wild, placing other parrots in New Caledonia at risk. All other parrot species tested negative for BFDV. <b>New</b> <b>Caledonian</b> Rainbow Lorikeets were introduced to Ouvéa Island in the 1970 s, potentially bringing BFDV with them. As Ouvea Parakeets are restricted to this small island, we strongly recommend surveillance screening for BFDV in this species to guide future biosecurity and conservation efforts, and further understand the risk posed by BFDV to threatened parrots...|$|R
