2500|$|His {{skills were}} noted by several collegiate and NBA players across the country. Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder posted on his Twitter account that [...] "Jimmer Fredette {{is the best}} scorer in the world!", while Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns tweeted [...] "Jimmer Fredette? That name's {{straight}} out of Hoosiers. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> never misses." [...] Jared Sullinger, a forward at Ohio State University, said [...] "Jimmer is going off right now. Pure scorer." ...|$|E
60|$|Tommy {{maintained}} a masterly silence. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> was a power with women.|$|E
60|$|She stared. Peter {{was not in}} {{the habit}} of making her {{presents}} of flowers. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> had looked strange.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, that's he! The {{man that}} lies drunk in the passage. He's been pouring it down like water {{ever since he}} drove in at six o'clock, so it's <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he's</b> like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Young Si's place," [...] said Agnes. [...] "He {{lives there}} night and day. Wouldn't it make anyone melancholy? <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he's</b> mysterious. I'm {{going to get}} his spyglass. He told me I might always use it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea," [...] said Babbalanja, [...] "a very round sun was Ludwig the Fat. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he's</b> {{down in the}} chronicles; several ells {{about the}} waist, and King of cups and Tokay. Truly, a famous king: three hundred-weight of lard, with a diadem on top: lean brains and a fat doublet--a {{demijohn}} of a demi-god!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Gerald {{went through}} a great deal yesterday, and is quite knocked up, so <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> needs some {{strengthening}} medicine." ...|$|E
60|$|Fillmore {{retired and}} Sally {{settled down to}} wait for Gerald, no longer hurt by his manner over the telephone. Poor Gerald! <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> had seemed upset.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's how you {{encourage}} him," [...] {{said her}} daughter; [...] "no wonder he doesn't behave. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> acts {{as if the}} whole place belongs to him." ...|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{criticism}} {{comes from}} neighbours of the Cronins during John's childhood, {{in that one}} neighbour reported that [...] "for {{the first few years}} of his life, his mum dressed him up as a girl. She wanted a girl so she dressed John in bows and frilly blouses. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>heâ€™s</b> such a mess now", a condition that persisted until the Cronins had a daughter in 1978.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{a strange}} man, that captain," [...] said Mr. Greene. [...] "And it is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> lost his ship and {{his life in the}} frozen north." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the looks}} of the beatings <b>he's</b> got <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he's</b> been singing. That's the trouble with these animal people. They don't {{know how to take}} care of their property. They hammer its head off and get grouched because it ain't an angel of obedience.--Put him away, Johnny. Wash him clean, and put on the regular {{dressing}} wherever the skin's broken. I give him up myself, but I'll find some place for him in the next bunch of dogs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hal {{has only}} put in fivepence-halfpenny," [...] said David, [...] "so <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> is ashamed. Such a big boy, with sixpence a week! But if he won't {{let us have}} his sixpence now--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon I'm {{seeing things}} too," [...] agreed Pan in {{suppressed}} excitement. [...] "I said once before it's {{too good to}} be true. Dad wasn't loco. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> raved.... Blink, is there any mistake?" ...|$|E
60|$|Yet the letter, {{with the}} {{personal}} grievance, {{the concern for}} June, the 'rap over the knuckles,' was all so natural. No wonder his father {{wanted to know what}} Bosinney meant, <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> was angry.|$|E
50|$|Ridho's musical {{style has}} given a big {{contribution}} to Slank's style, rock and blues. Since his idols are Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles, <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> has such of blues influences.|$|R
40|$|MISOGYNY, {{no matter}} how it's defined, has become a {{political}} football. Fifteen minutes into {{the first quarter of}} David Williamson's Managing Carmen and Brent Lyall, a star AFL footballer, has already taken a high tackle from his hottie girlfriend, had a clanger with his manager and been caught wearing women's clothes by his acting coach. Not a good look for Brent's sponsors. By full time, Williamson's witty banter and colourful characters have hit their mark. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he's</b> already working on the screenplay...|$|R
60|$|Whether it {{was upon}} this {{occasion}} {{of taking the}} box, that Mr. Harry threw the fifteen mains mentioned {{in one of those}} other letters of Mr. Walpole's, which have not come into his present learned editor's hands, I know not; but certain it is, that on his first appearance at White's, Harry had five or six evenings of prodigious good luck, and seemed more than ever the Fortunate Youth. The five hundred pounds withdrawn from his patrimonial inheritance had multiplied into thousands. He bought fine clothes, purchased fine horses, gave grand entertainments, made handsome presents, lived {{as if he had been}} as rich as Sir James Lowther, or his Grace of Bedford, and yet the five thousand pounds never seemed to diminish. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> gave where giving was so easy; <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> was generous with Fortunatus's purse in his pocket. I say <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> gave, for such was his nature. Other Fortunati tie up the endless purse, drink small beer, and go to bed with a tallow candle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose {{this was}} inevitable, Jeeves. I wouldn't {{have thought that}} this Fink-Nottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p, but, if he has, <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> finds the going sticky." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> {{had become}} {{in the eyes}} of the Edmonstones almost a part of their family. Mrs. Edmonstone had assumed a motherly control over him, to which he {{submitted}} with a sort of affectionate gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Professor Pumphrey, [...] "you hurt Clarence's feelings, George. He's {{been out}} there all morning getting hot and dusty, and <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> wants to beat the tar out of those sons of guns!" ...|$|E
60|$|All {{these things}} {{occupied}} Harry's mind, {{and it is}} <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> hardly looked up when Selim stopped. The horse had been walking so slowly that stopping {{did not seem to}} make much difference.|$|R
60|$|Next {{he spoke}} to his {{daughter}} as though assenting to something, for I saw her sigh in relief. <b>No</b> <b>wonder,</b> for <b>he</b> was conveying his decision to spare our lives and admit us to their fellowship.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were the}} best ten years of his life," [...] Aynesworth answered. [...] "Think of how and in what {{surroundings}} he has been compelled to live. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> has had the humanity hammered out of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jove!" [...] Mulhall muttered {{under his}} breath. [...] "A long-legged Napoleon the Third, but burnt out, baked, and fire-crackled. And mangy! <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> crooks {{his head to}} one side. He's got to keep the balance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which," [...] Powell again commented to me earnestly, [...] "was a lie... <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> sweated." [...] You {{see from}} this {{the value of}} Powell's comments. Mrs Anthony then said: [...] "Why are you sending me away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worst in the county," [...] was the disconcerting reply. [...] "Half rocks an' half trees. Ol' Cap'n Wegg wasn't no farmer. He were a sea-cap'n; so it's <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> got took in when {{he bought}} the place." ...|$|E
60|$|I made <b>no</b> answer, <b>wondering</b> what <b>he</b> meant exactly and {{thinking}} it wisest to be silent.|$|R
60|$|Need we {{say that}} Harold leaped joyfully at the proposal? And now, here he was, called on to abandon the `Aurora' to her fate, as we have said, {{near the end of}} a prosperous voyage. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>he</b> was perplexed.|$|R
6000|$|Lord my God to thee I flie [...] Save me {{and secure}} me under [...] Thy {{protection}} while I crie [...] Least as a Lion (and <b>no</b> <b>wonder)</b> [...] <b>He</b> hast to tear my Soul asunder [...] Tearing and no rescue nigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{the trap}} he was laying for you. It has just dawned on me. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> didn't object to your {{opening the door}} and {{chipping}} the ball out. By doing so you would forfeit the match." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{did this}} man, through very goodness, conquer {{the hearts of}} all; and it is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> was ever merry and gay, for there was no home in the wide world where he was not welcomed more royally than any king.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Makely said, smiling: [...] "No, I don't {{think that}} was the {{brightest}} outlook in the world. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he</b> has brought back such gloomy impressions. I am sure that if he could have seen life under brighter auspices he would not have the ideas he has." ...|$|E
60|$|And Tom {{heard him}} keckling to himself up the garden walk to his house; {{went off to}} see that Elsley was safe; and then home, and slept like a top; <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> for <b>he</b> would have done so the night before his execution.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He is {{very fond}} of Alice. She has done more with him than I ever thought possible. Kept him respectable this whole year, and really it grows on him. He makes ever so much more of her now than when he first brought her home--and <b>no</b> <b>wonder.</b> <b>No,</b> no; <b>he</b> won't fall foul of her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My!" [...] said Miss Judson, that evening, {{at dinner}} with a certain young interne of St. Joseph's Hospital. [...] "That Doctor Emory is a wizard. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>he's</b> successful. Think of it! Two filthy lepers in our office to- day! One was a coon. And {{he knew what was}} the matter the moment he laid eyes on them. He's a caution. When I tell you what he did to them with his cigar! And he was cute about it! He gave me the wink first. And they never dreamed what he was doing. He took his cigar and [...] " ...|$|R
