40|$|Marine organisms {{have evolved}} defence {{mechanisms}} to prevent epibiosis. This {{study investigated the}} anti-settlement properties of natural periostracal microtopographies of two mytilid species, Mytilus edulis (from <b>North,</b> <b>Baltic</b> and White Seas) and Perna perna (from the SW Atlantic). Resin replicas of shells were exposed to cyprids of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. Replicas with intact isotropic microtopographies and smooth controls were much less fouled than roughened anisotropic surfaces. This indicates that in both M. edulis and P. perna the periostracum possesses a generic anti-settlement property, at least against S. balanoides cyprids, which is not regionally adapted. Such a potential globally effective anti-settlement mechanism possibly contributes to the invasive success of Mytilidae...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{research}} and industry partners {{in collaboration with}} the EU have created the FP 7 NORSEWInD project with the main objective of delivering to the <b>North,</b> <b>Baltic</b> and Irish Sea areas high quality wind atlases for offshore wind resource assessment. The state-of-the-art atmospheric mesoscale model WRF is used to map the wind resource at 90 m a. g. l. for the North Sea area. A model domain with a spatial resolution of 20 x 20 km is used to simulate a winter and a summer month (November 2008 and July 2009). It is coupled with a Newtonian relaxation assimilation technique to ingest surface wind data provided from QuikSCAT (QS) satellite and sea surface temperature (SST) data from GHRSST Level 4 analysis. Wind results from the model are validated against observational data from the anemometric mast FINO 1 and the spatial improvement of the average wind field at 90 m a. g. l is calculated. Improvements of more than 5 % were obtained from using data assimilation on the overall domain. Each source has shown a distinct impact on the analyzed periods. The QS assimilation had higher impact during the summer period whereas SST assimilation was significant during the winter period. At FINO 1 location, improvements on the vertical wind profile were obtained from the SST assimilation. The MAE and RMSE statistical parameters were slightly improved...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the presence of}} tattoo lesions in 613 small cetaceans belonging to nine species and originating from the Southeast Pacific Ocean, the Southwest and Northeast Atlantic Ocean {{as well as from}} the <b>North,</b> <b>Baltic</b> and Mediterranean Seas. Most of the specimens had been caught in nets or were found stranded in the period 1988 - 2002. Thirty-five bottlenose dolphins from the Sado estuary, Portugal were photographed alive in 1994 - 1997. Tattoo lesions were detected in 68 of 196 Lagenorhynchus obscurus, 33 of 54 Delphinus capensis, five of 12 Tursiops truncatus, 57 of 95 Phocoena spinipinnis from Peru as well as in 17 of 35 T. truncatus from the Sado estuary, in two of 10 Stenella coeruleoalba and one of four T. truncatus from the Mediterranean Sea. Prevalence of the disease varied significantly between species in mature specimens but not among immatures. It also varied very significantly between inshore (P. spinipinnis and Sado T. truncatus) and offshore or offshore-neritic (S. coeruleoalba, L. obscurus, D. capensis and Peruvian T. truncatus) odontocetes, being higher in adult specimens of inshore (53. 5 %) than of offshore (29. 7 %) taxa. This variation may be caused by immunotoxic environmental pollutants of continental origin like organochlorines. The coastal waters of Peru and the Sado estuary suffer from eutrophication and pollution from various origins. Direct correlation with pollutant loads needs to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Offshore wind is {{the major}} growth area in the wind {{industry}} sector today. However, there remains a key, fundamental missing element - {{a thorough understanding of}} the offshore wind climatology and likely wind resource. In 2008 the EU FP 7 funded project NORSEWInD was created with a remit to deliver offshore wind speed data at a nominal project hub height acquired in offshore locations in the <b>North,</b> <b>Baltic</b> and Irish seas. Part of the overall NORSEWInD project was the use of LiDAR remote sensing (RS) systems mounted on offshore platforms to measure wind velocity profiles at a number of locations offshore. The data acquired from the offshore RS measurements was fed into a large and novel wind speed dataset suitable for use by the wind industry. The data was also fed into key areas such as forecasting and MESOSCALE modelling improvements. One significant problem identified was the effect of platform interference effects on the RS data. Therefore, part of the fundamental research incorporated into the NORSEWInD project was an investigation into the possible extent and effect of the interference on the measured data from the various mounting platforms. This paper reports on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of the wind flows over the platforms and the verification of the CFD models by the use of sub scale wind tunnel models employing three dimensional Constant Temperature Anemometers (CTAs) to measure local velocity vector data...|$|E
