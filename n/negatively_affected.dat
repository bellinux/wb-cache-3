Manipulative behavior done by manager emerged from interest conflict {{and it can be}} minimized through a monitoring mechanism which aims to align considerable interests. Monitoring mechanism can be in form of independent commissioner boards proportion, commissioner boards size, audit committee, concentrated ownership and culture. The research aims to test effect of independent commissioner board proportion, size of commissioner board, audit committee, concentrated ownership and culture toward the earnings management. Result show that independent commissioner boards proportion does not <b>negatively</b> <b>affect</b> earnings management, commissioner boards size does not <b>negatively</b> <b>affect</b> earnings management, audit committee does <b>negatively</b> <b>affect</b> earnings management, concentrated ownership does <b>negatively</b> <b>affect</b> earnings management and culture does affect earnings management. ...|$|R

5|$|Redfish and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living in the lake, until the {{construction}} of an embankment reduced their populations. A large quantity of silt is now deposited in the lake from the Guadalupe River, after the dredging of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E
5|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} has little economic value, though its attractive skin is occasionally used for leather. In Australian waters, {{it is not}} fished and faces minimal threats. However, elsewhere in its range it may be <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> by extensive fishery activity and habitat degradation from pollution, blast fishing, and coral removal. Because of these concerns, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Pelé {{publicly}} {{accused the}} Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira of corruption after Pelé's television company was rejected {{in a contest}} for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup. Pelé accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair. As {{a consequence of the}} affair, the President of FIFA, João Havelange banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban were perceived to have <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> Havelange's chances of re-election as FIFA's president in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} competitor <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E
5|$|Taraki's Government {{initiated}} a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted {{to limit the}} amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while weakening the power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> by the land reform.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the cloudy {{catshark}} {{consists of}} molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs {{two at a}} time in nursery areas. The claspers of the male bear numerous hooks that likely serve to facilitate copulation. This harmless shark can be readily maintained in captivity and is used as a model organism for biological research. It is caught incidentally, and generally discarded, by commercial fisheries. These activities do not appear to have <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The four windows {{from the}} Tiffany studios include those {{donated by the}} college's Class of 1899 and Class of 1900. A window {{depicting}} Joan of Arc was donated in memory of Rutgers College sophomore Henry Janeway Weston (1877–1898) who committed suicide in 1898. According to Rutgers, this window was a gift of the Tiffany studios. Weston, the grandson of Henry Latimer Janeway (1824–1909)a wealthy wallpaper manufacturer, Rutgers alumnus (A.B. 1844, A.M. 1847) and long-serving trustee (1862–1909)killed himself after his family became aware of a romantic relationship with a woman that would have <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> his reputation.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement {{came up with}} {{a constructive}} reform program during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were termination of the kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness to move toward the implementation of the reformers' goals <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether a sentiment effect arising from poor air quality <b>negatively</b> <b>affects</b> stock prices. We find little {{evidence suggesting that}} local air quality directly affects stock prices. However, we show that the local air quality index (which is increasing in air pollution) relative to that of Beijing <b>negatively</b> <b>affects</b> stock prices. We apply a discontinuity design that focuses on observations with the relative air quality index falling in the narrow band around zero and find a consistent result. Additional analysis unveils a subsequent reversal in stock prices {{in response to the}} relative air quality. Further, the relative air quality index also <b>negatively</b> <b>affects</b> trading volume. Finally, we show that the negative association between stock prices and the relative air quality index is not influenced by economic fundamentals or investor sophistication. In sum, our findings suggest that poor air quality <b>negatively</b> <b>affects</b> stock prices and investor trading activities...|$|R

5|$|The shock {{produced}} by the onefin electric ray can be painful, but is not substantially dangerous to humans. Though not utilized economically, this ray is frequently caught as bycatch in bottom trawls in South African waters. Because of its inshore habits, {{it may also be}} <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> by water pollution from coastal development. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient due to lack of specific data, while noting that its vulnerability to fishing and habitat degradation may merit concern.|$|E
5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 ariary for foreigners and 400 ariary for locals), which is largely {{used to pay}} for the preservation of the site. The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> at the site {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E
5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E

Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic.

Other towns were <b>negatively</b> <b>affected</b> by Danzig's near-monopoly in foreign trade, but profitably participated in transit and export activities. The largest of those were Kraków (Cracow), Poznań, Lwów (Lviv), and Warszawa (Warsaw), and outside of the Crown, Breslau (Wrocław).

These improvements included refurbishing the production line equipment, including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international HACCP certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages.
