Sometimes the land was assigned or occupied informally occupied by pioneers without a <b>notarial</b> <b>contract,</b> a situation that was normalized a few years later with an official contract. Several concessions were awarded to ex-soldiers who were exempt from the usual obligations owed to Jesuit lords.|$|E
50|$|The grape is {{believed}} to have originated in Greece and made its way to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia by way of Slovenia. The first written documentation of the grape was in a 1289 <b>notarial</b> <b>contract</b> on vineyard land in the Friuli region. During the 14th century, the Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio listed indulgence of Ribolla wines as one of the sins of gluttony in his diatribe on the subject. When the Duke of Austria, Leopold III, established reign over Trieste one of his stipulations was that the city supply him each year with 100 urns of the region's best Ribolla wine. By 1402, the reputation of the wine made from the grape was high enough for the city of Udine to feel compelled to enact a law which prohibited the adulteration of any wine made from Ribolla. In the 18th century, the Italian writer Antonio Musnig rated Ribolla wine as the finest white wine in the Friuli. The phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century took a hard toll on Ribolla plantings with many Friuli vineyards owners choosing to replant their land with imported French wine grapes like Merlot and Sauvignon blanc rather than the local grape varieties. By the 1990s less than 1% of all white Friuli wines created under a Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation contained Ribolla. By the turn of the 21st century, international interest in the wines of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia had led to an increase in plantings of the grape. Today it has a more prominent roles in the white DOC wines of Colli Orientali del Friuli and Collio Goriziano.|$|E

An {{analysis}} of French legal sources from the Middle Ages and the early modern period clearly points to {{the tension between the}} conceptual and the practical sides of drama. Three main issues will be addressed: codification by the Church, what <b>notarial</b> <b>contracts</b> can and cannot tell us about the 'rise of professional drama', and how imperial and municipal authorities tried to control theatre practice during the Reformation period in the French-speaking Low Countries. The intersection of the legal and the theatrical reveals 'a history' of drama untold in 'the history' of drama...|$|R

The church is reported in <b>notarial</b> <b>contracts</b> in 1271 {{as well as in}} a document dating to 1394. In 1583, it is reported to have numbered 125 residents. In the Ottoman inventory 1671 it is recorded as having fifteen families, while in the Egyptian inventory of 1834 it has 10 Christian and 3 Muslim ("Cretan Turks") families. On the contrary, in the inventory of 1881 only 2 Christians and 225 Muslims were reported. By 1900, it numbered only 10 residents, and none in 1920. By 1928 it had been repopulated, with 258 people living there.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} the role of foreign merchants, {{operating}} from Portugal, in the Portuguese overseas trade, during the first ten years of Iberian Union. The focus is not in products or routes, but in the mechanisms of association of such merchants. Iberian Union created a legal framework which prohibited the interference and trade of Portuguese agents in the Spanish Empire and vice-versa. Due to the imperialist wars of the Habsburgs, the Portuguese Empire also suffered from Dutch and English rivalry both in the Indic and in the Atlantic and also from the embargos of Dutch and English products and ships in Iberian ports. In such conjuncture, how did merchants related with each other? What was {{the impact of the}} political union of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns in trading associations? The used data sources are the <b>notarial</b> <b>contracts</b> of Lisbon for the same period. The paper highlights the role of Castilian merchants in the Portuguese trade, but it also stresses that Iberian partnerships have prevailed before 1580. The role of other merchants, such as Flemish/Dutch, Germans, Italians and French, is also considered. The paper discusses how and why did these merchants join in trans-national partnerships and what was their role in the Portuguese trade network at the time...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} Dante’s so-called “debts”, {{the most}} sizeable {{of which were}} guaranteed by his relatives and friends. Out of these loans, those contracted for the highest amounts remained unsettled even decades after the agreed repayment date. The salient features of the Florentine <b>notarial</b> <b>contracts</b> stipulated ex causa mutui during the age of Dante will be discussed. Particular attention {{will be given to}} the difference between the sum of money which was actually given in loan and the sum declared in the document, the duration of the contract, the personal guarantees requested and the relationship between notarial records and private account books. The different uses of the notarial instrumentum mutui will be illustrated, from its implementation on the debtor’s estate to the transfer of the negotiable instrument to third parties. In certain instances, fictive debts (ad defensionem) were contracted with the aid of trusted friends and other individuals who acted as figureheads (in order to defend the assets of the bankrupt, thus damaging the mass of creditors, for example) or else constructed {{in such a way as}} to define a priority of mortgages on the assets of the debtors. Even in this latter case, possible or feared actions undertaken by third parties, which could compromise the debtor’s assets, were immediately deflected in order to avoid repercussions...|$|R
40|$|The {{commerce}} of Alicante in {{the reign}} of Philip II, studied {{from the perspective of}} its social group, has been analysed from fiscal sources of Alicante, (the book of the 'sisa',- a type of tax- of merchandise of 1565), judicial documents of Valencia (the proceedings of the Royal Audience, and the orders and embargoes of civil justice in Valencia), and <b>notarial</b> <b>contracts</b> of Castille (protocols of Cartagena and Yecla), which complicated the activity of the Alicante merchants, {{and at the same time}} reveals their secrets to us. This business had a large Italian component, from Genova, Milan and Florence, and a lesser imput from France and Valencia, but within a framework of cooperation, of family relations and enoblement. So, although the commentator Viciana stated that Alicante attracted merchants from Cartagena and also Italy, it has been shown that this was not so, except for a few who did so in 1570, as Cartagena also received Italian emigrants, whose merchants had good relations with those of Alicante, as it was demonstrated in times of epidemics that they were able to halt maritime traffic. Alicante obtained a privileged fiscal position in its access to the southern Castillian plateau (the southern Customs houses), and this greatly favoured its commerce, on top of being occupied with the provision of Valencia and other centres, such as the interior of Valencia...|$|R
40|$|After 268 {{years under}} the Order of St. John, in June 1798 Malta {{was taken by}} Napoleon’s Republican {{soldiers}} {{in less than a}} week and General Bonaparte clearly showed his genius, reorganizing the administration of the country. These events have inevitably attracted the attention of several scholars, who have studied the entire Maltese administrative apparatus during the brief French rule on the island, without however going into financial details. As a matter of fact, two years (the length of the ‘French period’ in Malta) are not enough to properly assess the economic balance of a state. A few historians have tried to analyse the Maltese economy both under the Knights and under the British government, but no one has consulted notaries’ documents as a key primary source for reconstructing the economic and social history of Malta during the French regime. In actual fact, <b>notarial</b> <b>contracts</b> allow researchers easy access to large amounts of relevant data, which provide historical evidence of economic and social life. I have already adopted this research methodology to create an outline of the financial market of Udine (a city in the north-east of Italy) during the first Austrian rule (1798 - 1805); my findings have been revealing, since they anticipated the “land revolution”, so called by Carlo Zaghi, who was the first to use this definition and after him many other historians, by stating that the massive transfer of the nobility’s estates to the emerging middle class was determined by the radical changes introduced by Napoleon. In my study I demonstrated that, although undoubtedly promoted by the French, it was actually the result of a long process of transformation, which started before the Napoleonic rule. As will be shown in this paper the Maltese vicissitudes fit in perfectly with this historical picture. peer-reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|Real estate {{appraisal}} in Germany {{is partly}} codified by law. The federal Baugesetzbuch (abbr. BauGB, [...] "German statutory code on building and construction'") contains guidelines on governing authorities, defines the term market value and refers to continuative rules (chapter 3, articles 192 ff.). Each municipality (city or administrative district) must form a Gutachterausschuss (appraisal committee), {{consisting of a}} chairman and honorary members. The committee gathers information on all real estate deals (it is mandatory to send a copy of each <b>notarial</b> purchase <b>contract</b> to the Gutachterausschuss) and includes it in the Kaufpreissammlung (purchase price database). Most committees publish an official real estate market report every two years, in which besides other information on comparables the land value is determined. The committees also perform appraisals on behalf of public authorities.|$|R
40|$|Set {{within the}} {{contexts}} of legal {{culture and the}} growth of the absolutist state, this study of early modern Burgundy reveals a more complex picture of family authority than has previously been acknowledged by historians. Implicitly, family disorder threatened the basis of political authority in early modern France. While the father was idealized, families and government officials wrestled with instances where that order was explicitly threatened. Authority was reinforced not so much by an increased reliance upon fathers, but by a complex interweaving of civil law, royal legislation, and legal practice that made children more dependant on their family {{for a longer period of}} time. In the sixteenth century, jurists increasingly applied Roman law to their own customary law, gradually tightening inheritance practices and excluding women from prominent positions they historically held in communal property management. These changes were reinforced by the monarchy 2 ̆ 7 s new restrictions over children 2 ̆ 7 s choice of marriage partners. By the late seventeenth century, a small group of Burgundian jurists questioned the Romanist interpretive assumptions that had held sway for over a century and argued that Burgundian children could act independently of their parents after they reached an age of majority. These opinions were delegitimized in an early eighteenth-century pamphlet war and in a classic Old Regime corporate conflict between the Estates and the Parlement of Burgundy. The second part of the study examines guardianship cases and <b>notarial</b> <b>contracts</b> from 1580 to 1780. These sources reveal that legal thought on the extended dependance of children slowly reverberated among the general population through heightened interference in the child 2 ̆ 7 s life choices and a rise in the popular conception of an age of majority. Despite the predominant eighteenth-century philosophical currents, the average French male or female youth had less room to maneuver in the eighteenth century than in the early sixteenth century. This would begin to change only with the advent of industrialization. ...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the task}} of {{providing}} stable supply of investment resources the current situation with the flow of investments into enterprises is considered in the paper, the main problems faced by investors are determined and summarized. Strategic opportunities and ways to facilitate investment activities of enterprises in the light of such basic factors as the use of leasing, size and availability of tax credits are identified. Particularly the procedure of tax arrest and sale of tax property is suggested to be canceled, companies are encouraged to increase the declared income and number of employees in order to use company rules of the Tax Code and apply the 0 % rate for income tax. Realizing the shortage of funds in businesses the authors suggest to change the amount of fees for <b>notarial</b> registration of <b>contracts</b> and state dues of 5 % of a contract value to a constant amount. The authors consider it inappropriate and suggest to review the bank demands for companies that receive foreign currency loans, are engaged in export activities, provide information about the environmental and social standards compliance. The circumstances under which businesses can credit each other and the amount of loan can rise unilaterally are singled out. A number of recommendations to be used in leasing contracts are made. Since these steps should have a comprehensive approach to the regulation of company conditions the authors offer to show them as the basic policy and target blocks and the overall system activities to promote the investments...|$|R

S temi zgodovinskimi viri si lahko pomagamo pri raziskovanju predmodernih selitev, ko ni še na voljo ustreznejše prebivalstvene in migracijske statistike. V prispevku so predstavljene značilnosti vira, možnosti in metodološki vidiki njegove uporabe kot tudi meje povednosti podatkov in vprašanja njihove interpretacije. Podrobneje so ti problemi izpostavljeni na primeru Trsta v 18. stoletju, ko je mesto doživelo hiter demografski vzpon in globoke družbene spremembe zaradi množičnega doseljevanja iz etnično in kulturno raznolikega zalednega prostora. The {{article focuses}} on the influx of {{population}} in cities {{on the basis of}} ecclesiastical marriage registry books. This historical source can be of help when researching pre-modern migrations, where appropriate population and marriage statistics is missing. It has proven useful especially for the 18 th century, sometimes in combination with other sources concerning marriage, such as celibacy statements of the newly wed or the <b>notarial</b> marriage <b>contracts,</b> as well as death registry books. Marriage registry books contain data on the regional provenance of the newly wed, as well as a series of social-demographic, professional, and other data that can serve as a basis to distinguish between the newcomers and the native population, as well as to assess the dynamics, consistency, structural features, and certain other cultural and behavioural patterns of the foreign population in a long-term perspective. Marriage data cannot be used in order to calculate accurately the range of migration or to draw detailed conclusions on all its characteristics. However, in absence of other documentation, it is a type of source that can be used, despite its insufficiencies, to extract a series of useful indications for evaluating the importance of migrations, their geographic and structural constants, and their change over time. The article presents the characteristic of the source, the possibilities and methodological aspects of its use, as well as the limits of data reliability and questions related to their interpretation. These issues have been shown in detail on the example of Trieste in the 18 th century, when the city went trough a period of fast demographic growth and profound social change owing to a massive influx of population from its ethnically and culturally different hinterland. In this case, the source has proven useful, especially when presenting the centuries-long dynamics of immigration, the geographic origin, and the gender structure of the newcomers, as well as the formation of urban social reality, including the mixing of various foreign components and the local population, evident from an analysis of endogamy and exogamy...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the price of transport we heavily relied on one kind of source which is found in massive numbers in the Amsterdam <b>notarial</b> archives: chartering <b>contracts.</b> A chartering contract is an agreement between a shipping company and one or more freighters or charterers who charter the ship for a particular voyage or, less often, for a specified period like a month. The freighter chartered the whole {{or part of the}} ship to carry a cargo from port A to port B at a certain price. The contracts conta{{in the name of the}} shipmaster who was acting in the name of the shipping company, his residence, the name of the charterer (s), the name of the ship, the freight charge and often but not always the tonnage of the ship and the kind of cargo and its quantity or weight. The chartering contracts are also called charter-parties or freight contracts. In Amsterdam lots of chartering contracts were notarized, which means that a signed copy was entered in notarial registers. An unknown number of them were not (Van Tielhof 2002 : 199; Knoppers 1976 : 17 - 18; Van Royen 1996 : 108). It is important to stress that these prices were the prices actually agreed upon for a specified transport service. The market for freights in Amsterdam must have expanded considerably in the course of the 16 th century, along with the expansion of overseas trade and shipping. In the 15 th century chartering contracts were probably still concluded on the first of the two big fairs, where foreign merchants appeared to look for possibilities to ship their goods (Posthumus 1953 : 130). At the end of the 16 th century chartering contracts were signed all year round. Jan Franssen Bruyningh started to work as a notary public in Amsterdam in October 1593, and had a large clientele of merchants and ship-owners from the start. Every year, about hundred freight contracts referring to voyages to the Baltic are documented in his protocols. Bruyningh also witnessed huge numbers of charter parties referring to other trade routes, such as Spain and Portugal for which about 50 contracts remain in his protocols each year. 1 It is highly probable that Bruyningh did not build his practice up from nothing but that he continued the flourishing practice of a predecessor. This can very well have bee...|$|R
40|$|U radu se objavljuju regesta pergamena iz obiteljskog arhiva trogirskog ogranka patricijske obitelji Fanfogna Garagnin, koja se čuvaju u Muzeju grada Trogira. Pergamene su nastajale u razdoblju od XIII. do XVIII. stoljeća, a u ovom dijelu donose se regesta pergamena iz srednjovjekovnog razdoblja. In {{this article}} there are {{published}} the regesta of the parchments {{from the family}} archive of the Fanfogna Garagnin family, which are now kept in the City Museum of Trogir. This collection and consequently the division of material in this article are, for greater ease of survey, made in three groups. The first and the greatest group consists of parchments dating from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, which are than divided into subgroups according to the respective century and ordered chronologically. Most of these documents were written in the notarial chanceries of Zadar, {{but many of them}} came from the chanceries of Venice (ducali), Ancona, Split, Šibenik, Trogir, Hvar, Nin, Skradin and Pag, with a few documents from Rome or Padua. The oldest and most numerous are the documents which contain typical <b>notarial</b> documents containing <b>contracts</b> on selling and buying landed property, judicial suits, auctions, last wills, grants, procurations, receipts, contracts on dowries, appointing of executors of wills, contracts on selling salt-pans and so on. All these notarial deeds give a wide spectrum of data regarding everyday life, trade, judicial practice, microtoponymy and social relations, and in them the main actors are usually ordinary people, with only a few famous personalities. However, in a lot of these deeds the main actors were ecclesiastical persons, members of both of the regular and the secular clergy, including members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy (bishops and archbishops). The second group consists of only five documents. Three of them, written on paper, are of a completely private character and relate to Anthony Fanfogna and the Garagnin brothers. One document is written in a Cyrillic script of the so-called western type (bosančica) and speaks of the sale of some land in the village of Zastina in Poljica, while the last document is written in German. The third and last group mostly consists of papal bulls issued by different popes from Pope Paul V to Pope Pius VI. These are mostly documents regarding the ecclesiastical career of Archbishop John Lucas Garagnin of Split. They are written in a peculiar type of chancery script, the so-called bollatica, {{and this is one of}} the greatest collections of charters written in that script extant in Croatian archives. In this volume of Zbornik there is published the first part of this article, containing the regesta of the parchments dating to the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, while the regesta of the rest of the parchments and of the two remaining groups of documents will be published in the following issue...|$|R
