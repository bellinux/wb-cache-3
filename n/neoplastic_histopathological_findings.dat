A total of 36 tissue samples from patients previously diagnosed with HL based solely on morphological aspects were used in this study. Our purpose was to confirm the presence of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in these tissue samples by in situ hybridization (ISH), and to compare the detection of EBV with specific <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> observed in each case. Among the 36 specimens, 80. 55 % were EBV positive, confirming the previous clinical and histhophatological diagnosis. None of the <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> analyzed correlated with {{the presence or absence}} of EBV. This shows that a definitive diagnosis of HL cannot be established based on <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> alone. Because there are many important implications on the establishment of definitive diagnosis of HL, the detection of EBV by ISH is obligatory...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Tobacco use is an {{important}} risk factor for advanced <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on edentulous alveolar ridge mucosa. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effects of smoking on <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on edentulous alveolar ridge mucosa. Material and methods The experimental group consisted of 48 patients (29 smokers and 19 nonsmokers). The mean age of smokers was 42. 6 and of nonsmokers 48. 7 years. The anamnesis included the following data: age, sex, diseases and toxic habits-cigarette smoking. Biopsy samples were taken from the edentulous alveolar ridge mucosa without gross signs of symptoms. Results The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was 11. 5 ± 7. The results of χ² test proved that there were no statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) in <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on the alveolar ridge mucosa. The mean duration of smoking was 12. 7 ± 5 years. Hyperkeratosis was established in 76. 92 % of smokers who smoked longer than 15 years. The mean-age at which smokers began smoking was 27. 3 ± 8 years and there were no statistically significant differences in <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on the alveolar ridge mucosa correlated with the beginning of smoking. Conclusion On the basis of our research we conclude that smokers who have been smoking for 15 years are at risk for developing histopathological changes of the alveolar ridge mucosa, but there were no statistically significant differences in <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on the alveolar ridge mucosa correlated with the number of cigarettes per day and the beginning of smoking. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} value of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in differentiation of benign and malignant omental lesions. Patients and methods: MDCT scan was performed for 37 patients with omental lesions after administration of oral and intravenous contrast. The CT diagnosis was {{compared with the}} final <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings.</b> Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of MDCT were calculated using surgical and <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> as the gold standard. Results: MDCT findings of all cases with omental torsion, cystic lymphangioma, and loculated fluid in the greater omentum correlated with the surgical and <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> with 100 % diagnostic accuracy. However, the diagnosis was missed in two patients from seven (2 / 7) with tuberculous peritonitis and in two patients from 21 (2 / 21) with peritoneal carcinomatosis with sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 73 %, 92 %, 85 % and 90 %, 95 %, 93 %, respectively. Conclusion: MDCT is an excellent diagnostic tool for evaluating omental lesions, especially those present with nonspecific clinical manifestations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim {{of present}} study was to {{identify}} the clinical signs, gross and <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> in turkeys experimentally infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/duck/Vietnam/ 12 / 2005 (H 5 N 1). Specific pathogens free of white turkeys having 6 weeks old were inoculated with 0. 1 mL of the virus with 10 EID. Death was event at 3 DPI. Gross lesions observed after necropsy were splenomegaly, 5 50 pulmonary edema, severe congestion in lungs, hyperemia in brain as well as cecal-tonsil and congestion in skeletal muscle. <b>Histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> were multi organ necrosis and/or inflammation. The most consistent and severely affected organs were spleen, lungs, brain, pancreas and cecal-tonsil. It would be worth to mention that the lungs and spleen were most affected organs, among the others grossly and histopathologically, However to our knowledge, this is the first description of <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Duck/Vietnam/ 12 / 2005 (H 5 N 1) in turkey...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the histopathological features of corneal graft failures over time. Methods: A single-center retrospective {{analysis was performed}} on corneal specimens diagnosed as corneal graft failure retrieved from the Henry C. Witelson Ophthalmic Pathology Laboratory and Registry (Montreal, Canada) over a 9 -year period. the corneal buttons were divided into 3 different groups according to the time between the diagnosis of corneal graft failure and regraft. Corneal specimens obtained during keratoplasty were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff. Five different <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> were evaluated in each specimen. Results: Overall, the most common <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> was endothelial decompensation (97. 2 %). Subepithelial pannus (38. 9 %), vessels in the corneal stroma (11. 1 %), and anterior synechiae (2. 8 %) were the other present findings. the inflammatory reaction was considered discrete in 83. 3 % of the cases. the only significant <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> correlated with time was the presence of vessels in the corneal stroma (P = 0. 0092). Conclusions: Corneal neovascularization, represented {{by the presence of}} vessels in the corneal stroma, was the only <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> correlated with time. Because it is a known factor of poor prognosis, our findings strongly support that early regraft has higher chances of success.

40|$|The {{recurrent}} goiter is the regrowth of thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy. An inadequate surgical {{removal of}} the thyroid gland, lack of substitution therapy and pathological stimulation of the thyroid growth can all promote the recurrence. The {{aim of this study}} was to find the connection between the <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> during the first and second operation and the recurrence of goiter. The study group consisted of 29 women and 1 man. The mean time to recurrence was 15 years. The most frequent <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> during the first and second operation was struma nodosa. According to our observations different <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> were found in 63. 4 % cases after primary and secondary thyroidectomy. Some genetic investigations showed that nodules in recurrent goiters did not derive from nodules left during the first operation but from a group of cells which had high growth potential. Thus, not only the operation technique and substitution after operation are key factors of successful therapy of goiter, but also other factors which stimulate the re-growth of thyroid tissue...|$|R

The immunosuppressive drug most frequently associated with diarrhea in transplant recipients is mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).
