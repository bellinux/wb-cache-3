As he rides past Cuțitul de Argint Church, he notices that he is being pursued by armed guards, sent by the Bucharest Aga to lock him into a debtors' prison.

The latter, who presents himself as Negoiță, reluctantly accepts to do so when Ianulea assures him that his pursuers are not boyars. In exchange for his help, Ianulea lets him on his secret identity, and promises to reward him.

[...] "It is <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> that <b>the</b> <b>place</b> is joyless for him; that he is weary of the old wooden houses, the mud and the dust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the chill east wind, and the chilliest of social atmospheres;--all these and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to the purpose. The spell survives, and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise." [...] There is a very American quality in this perpetual consciousness of a spell on Hawthorne's part; it is only in a country where newness and change and brevity of tenure are the common substance of life, that the fact of one's ancestors having lived for a hundred and seventy years in a single spot would become an element of one's morality. It is only an imaginative American that would feel urged to keep reverting to this circumstance, to keep analysing and cunningly considering it.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT With the {{objective}} to evaluate, in field, the behaviuor face to Early blight and the agronomics and morphologic characteristics of two somaclones, the IBP- 27, obtained by mutagenesis in vitro, and the IBP- 10 by somaclonal variation it {{was carried out}} the present work. The experiments conducted in the Empresa Cultivos Varios “La Cuba” in the Ciego de Avila Province and in the Experimental Unit from Remedios in Villa Clara Province. The height of the plants, number of stems, number and weight of the tubers by plant (kg), the general aspect of the tubers, the superficiality of the eyes, colour of the skin and forms of the tubers were evaluated. The affectations presented by somaclones for the common scab and Early blight were also evaluated. The evaluated somaclonespresented inferior levels of affectation to Erly blight than Desiree variety, in both places. Somaclone IBP- 27 stood out because it presented {{a greater number of}} stems <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of plantation. The characters number and weight of the tubers by plant Remedios presented variations between somaclones and the Desiree control, nevertheless this behaviour was not observed in Ciego de Avila. Somaclones also presented changes in the colour of the tubers and the form when they were compared with the original variety in both atmospheres.

40|$|Nigeria is {{a patriarchal}} society, which puts women in {{subordinate}} positions that may prompt gender-based discrimination. While {{evidence of this}} phenomenon has been investigated in Nigeria and other African countries, no such investigation has been conducted with immigrant and first-generation Nigerian women in the United States. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the role of a Nigerian woman 2 ̆ 7 s perceived empowerment and status on her willingness to access reproductive health services. The research questions examined views of Nigerian traditional beliefs 2 ̆ 7 influence on status and how attitudes around traditional beliefs relate to access to reproductive health services and/or knowledge. Data were gathered through semi structured interviews with 9 Nigerian women in the Washington DC-Maryland-Virginia area. The women were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using the ecological systems theory as a framework, which theorizes that a woman 2 ̆ 7 s status is related to her ability to access services or information; empowerment increases that access of services/information, and that traditional Nigerian beliefs have mostly positive effects on their status. However, the findings revealed that, among these 9 women, traditional beliefs did not have an overwhelming direct effect to access to services or information. Empowering women is vital for social growth, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> what <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of origin. This study contributes to positive social change by providing a resource that demonstrates the importance of these women 2 ̆ 7 s contributions to society, thus helping to move society forward...|$|R
6000|$|... "The queerest {{thing that}} ever {{happened}} to me was about a shark. We was off the Banks, and the time of year was July, and the ice was coming down, and we got in among a lot of it. Not far away, off our weather bow, there was a little iceberg which had such a queerness about it that the captain and three men went in a boat to look at it. The ice was mighty clear ice, and you could see almost through it, and right inside of it, not more than three feet above the waterline, and about two feet, or maybe twenty inches, inside the ice, was a whopping big shark, about fourteen feet long,--a regular man-eater,--frozen in there hard and fast. `Bless my soul,' said the captain, `this is a wonderful curiosity, and I'm going to git him out.' Just then one of the men said he saw that shark wink, but the captain wouldn't believe him, for he said that shark was frozen stiff and hard and couldn't wink. You see, the captain had his own idees about things, and he knew that whales was warm-blooded and would freeze if they was shut up in ice, but he forgot that sharks was not whales and that they're cold-blooded just like toads. And there is toads that has been shut up in rocks for thousands of years, and they stayed alive, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how cold <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was, because they was cold-blooded, and when the rocks was split, out hopped the frog. But, as I said before, the captain forgot sharks was cold-blooded, and he determined to git that one out.|$|R
60|$|I now can but {{share with}} a friend my {{thoughts}} and my emotions, {{and there is a}} continual discovery of difference, but in those days, before I had found myself, we could share adventures. When friends plan and do together, their minds become one mind and the last secret disappears. I was useless at games. I cannot remember that I ever kicked a goal or made a run, but I was a mine of knowledge when I and the athlete and those two notoriously gentlemanly boys--theirs was the name that I remember without a face--set out for Richmond Park, for Coomb Wood or Twyford Abbey to look for butterflies and moths and beetles. Sometimes to-day I meet people at lunch or dinner whose address will sound familiar and I remember of a sudden how a game-keeper chased me from the plantation behind their house, and how I have turned over the cow-dung in their paddock in the search for some rare beetle believed to haunt the spot. The athlete was our watchman and our safety. He would suggest, should we meet a carriage on the drive, that we take off our hats and walk on as though about to pay a call. And once when we were sighted by a game-keeper at Coomb Wood, he persuaded the eldest of the brothers to pretend to be a school-master taking his boys for a walk, and the keeper, instead of swearing and threatening the law, was sad and argumentative. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> how charming <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> (and there is a little stream in a hollow where Wimbledon Common flows into Coomb Wood that is pleasant in the memory,) I knew that those other boys saw something I did not see. I was a stranger there. There was something in their way of saying <b>the</b> names of <b>places</b> that made me feel this.|$|R
60|$|Planted deep, in the town's {{earliest}} infancy and childhood, {{by these}} two earnest and energetic men, the race has ever since subsisted here; always, too, in respectability; never, so far as I have known, disgraced by a single unworthy member; but seldom or never, on the other hand, after the first two generations, performing any memorable deed, or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice. Gradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; as old houses, here and there about the streets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil. From father to son, for above a hundred years, they followed the sea; a grey-headed shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took <b>the</b> hereditary <b>place</b> before <b>the</b> mast, confronting the salt spray and the gale which had blustered against his sire and grandsire. The boy, also in due time, passed from the forecastle to the cabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his world-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the natal earth. This long connexion of a family with one spot, as its place of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being and the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him. It is not love but instinct. The new inhabitant--who came himself from a foreign land, or whose father or grandfather came--has little claim {{to be called a}} Salemite; he has no conception of the oyster-like tenacity with which an old settler, over whom his third century is creeping, clings to the spot where his successive generations have been embedded. It is <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> that <b>the</b> <b>place</b> is joyless for him; that he is weary of the old wooden houses, the mud and dust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the chill east wind, and the chillest of social atmospheres;--all these, and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to the purpose. The spell survives, and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise. So has it been in my case. I felt it almost as a destiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar here--ever, as one representative of the race lay down in the grave, another assuming, as it were, his sentry-march along the main street--might still in my little day be seen and recognised in the old town. Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence that the connexion, which has become an unhealthy one, should at last be severed. Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and re-planted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My children have had other birth-places, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.|$|R
