5|$|Nowadays, using {{oscilloscopes}} {{with time}} resolutions {{of less than}} one <b>nanosecond,</b> {{the speed of light}} can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach <b>nanosecond</b> to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, a British {{mission was}} sent to the United States to assist the American Manhattan Project in {{developing}} atomic bombs. First to arrive at the Los Alamos Laboratory were Frisch and Titterton, on 13 December 1943. The two shared an office at first, but were soon working on different projects. Titterton worked in collaboration with the American physicist Boyce McDaniel in Robert R. Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group. Together, they searched for delays between nuclear fission and the emission of prompt neutrons. A sizeable delay could make a nuclear chain reaction impractical. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond; subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a <b>nanosecond</b> too.|$|E

5|$|No formula {{could be}} more {{accurate}} than the values put into it; the values for the cross sections were dubious, and {{had not yet been}} determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would be a priority, but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of uranium-235, and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (Electrostatic Generator) Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of uranium-235. This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of plutonium-239 was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as uranium-235. Titterton and Boyce McDaniel of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it took for prompt neutrons to be emitted from a uranium-235 nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 <b>nanosecond.</b> Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a <b>nanosecond</b> too. Confirmation of the theorists' contention that the number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both fast and slow neutrons took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.|$|E
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the <b>nanosecond</b> range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E

50|$|The November main analysis, {{which showed}} an early arrival time of 57.8 <b>nanoseconds,</b> was {{conducted}} blind to avoid observer bias, whereby those running the analysis might inadvertently fine-tune the result toward expected values. To this end, old and incomplete values for distances and delays {{from the year}} 2006 were initially adopted. With the final correction needed not yet known, the intermediate expected result was also an unknown. Analysis of the measurement data under those 'blind' conditions gave an early neutrino arrival of 1043.4 <b>nanoseconds.</b> Afterward, the data were analyzed again taking into consideration the complete and actual sources of errors. If neutrino and light speed were the same, a subtraction value of 1043.4 <b>nanoseconds</b> should have been obtained for the correction. However, the actual subtraction value amounted to only 985.6 <b>nanoseconds,</b> corresponding to an arrival time 57.8 <b>nanoseconds</b> earlier than expected.|$|R
30|$|The {{fluorescence}} lifetime of typical organic fluorescent dyes {{is only a}} few <b>nanoseconds</b> (ns), which is similar to the decay time of autofluorescence of biological samples. While the {{fluorescence lifetime}} of QDs can sustain tens of <b>nanoseconds</b> (20 to 50  ns), which makes the fluorescence of QDs still persist and obtain fluorescence signals without background interference when the majority of the auto-fluorescence background has been attenuated after a few <b>nanoseconds</b> of light excitation [39, 40].|$|R

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{experimental}} results {{were published in}} the 1990 s, it has been believed that the sonoluminescence flash always occurs {{no more than a few}} <b>nanoseconds</b> before the minimum radius of a collapsing bubble. A concurrent belief has been that the period between sonoluminescence flashes is steady on the order of a few <b>nanoseconds,</b> and that sonoluminescence flashes occur with a "clock-like" regularity. To the contrary, data presented here show that the sonoluminescence flash can occur hundreds of <b>nanoseconds</b> before the minimum radius and that the sonoluminescence flash-to-flash period can vary on the order of hundreds of <b>nanoseconds.</b> These new findings may require a reexamination of the physics of sonoluminescence.

25|$|Laser peening {{typically}} uses {{high energy}} (10 to 40 Joule), 10 to 30 <b>nanosecond</b> pulse, flashed laser systems to generate gigawatts of {{power on the}} surface of a part by focusing the laser beam down to a few millimeters in diameter. Laser peening is unlike the other manufacturing processes in that it neither heats or adds material; it is a mechanical process of cold working the metallic component to impart compressive residual stresses.

Though SI prefixes may {{also be used to}} form multiples of the second such as kilosecond (one thousand seconds), such units are rarely used in practice. The more common larger non-SI units of time are not formed by powers of ten; instead, the second is multiplied by 60 to form a minute, which is multiplied by 60 to form an hour, which is multiplied by 24 to form a day.|$|E

5000|$|This {{interaction}} of the very rapidly moving negatively charged electrons with the magnetic field radiates a pulse of electromagnetic energy. The pulse typically rises to its peak value in some 5 <b>nanoseconds.</b> Its magnitude typically decays to half of its peak value within 200 <b>nanoseconds.</b> (By the IEC definition, this E1 pulse ends 1000 <b>nanoseconds</b> after it begins.) This process occurs simultaneously on about 1025 electrons. [...] The simultaneous action of the {{very large number of}} electrons causes the resulting electromagnetic pulses from each electron to radiate coherently, thus adding to produce a single very large amplitude, but very narrow, radiated electromagnetic pulse.|$|R
25|$|Laser vitreolysis is a {{possible}} treatment option {{for the removal of}} vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). In this procedure an ophthalmic laser (usually a yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser) applies a series of <b>nanosecond</b> pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. During this process, the laser energy evaporates the collagen and hyaluronin molecules to form a gas. (It {{is important to note that}} the laser energy applied during vitreolysis treatment does not simply break the floater into smaller pieces. Instead, the laser energy converts the floater material to a gas, which is then absorbed into the eye.) The end result is that the floater is removed and/or reduced to a size that no longer impedes vision.|$|E
25|$|Two {{facets of}} the result came under {{particular}} scrutiny within the neutrino community: the GPS synchronization system, and {{the profile of the}} proton beam spill that generated neutrinos. The second concern was addressed in the November rerun: for this analysis, OPERA scientists repeated the measurement over the same baseline using a new CERN proton beam which circumvented the need to make any assumptions about the details of neutrino production during the beam activation, such as energy distribution or production rate. This beam provided proton pulses of 3nanoseconds each with up to 524 <b>nanosecond</b> gaps. This meant a detected neutrino could be tracked uniquely to its generating 3 nanoseconds pulse, and hence its start and end travel times could be directly noted. Thus, the neutrino's speed could now be calculated without having to resort to statistical inference.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} frequency {{range of a}} RO depends on the input and output characteristics. The highest frequency of the input (controlling) signal {{is limited by the}} response of the RO light source to the change in the controlling current and by the response of the photoresistor to light; its typical value ranges between 1 and 250Hz. The response time of a photoresistor to switching off of the light typically varies between 2.5 and 1000 ms, whereas the response to switching the illumination on is about 10 times faster. As to the light source, its reaction time to a current pulse is in the <b>nanosecond</b> range for an LED, and is therefore neglected. However, for an incandescent lamp it is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which limits the frequency range of the respective ROs to a few Hz.|$|E

25|$|Resistive plate {{chambers}} (RPC) {{are fast}} gaseous detectors {{that provide a}} muon trigger system parallel {{with those of the}} DTs and CSCs. RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity plastic material and separated by a gas volume. When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing an avalanche of electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one <b>nanosecond</b> (one billionth of a second).|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Lundgren {{appeared}} in Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic, co-starring Keanu Reeves. The film portrays screenwriter William Gibson's dystopian cyberpunk {{view of the}} future with the world dominated by megacorporations and with strong East Asian influences. Reeves plays the title character, {{a man with a}} cybernetic brain implant designed to store information. Lundgren plays Karl Honig, a Jesus-obsessed hit man and street preacher who wears a robe and carries a shepherd's staff. The film was shot on location in Toronto and Montreal in 12 weeks, filling in for the film's Newark, New Jersey and Beijing settings. The film was premiered in Japan first on 15 April 1995 and features a previously composed score by Michael Danna, different editing, and more scenes with Lundgren and Japanese star Takeshi Kitano. Critical response was negative overall; Roger Ebert said, [...] "Johnny Mnemonic {{is one of the great}} goofy gestures of recent cinema, a movie which doesn't deserve one <b>nanosecond</b> of serious analysis." [...] The film was a financial disappointment, grossing $19,075,720 in the domestic American market against its $26m budget. The cloak worn by Lundgren in the film is now located in the lobby of the Famous Players Coliseum in Mississauga, Ontario, it was his last theatrical release film until 2010.
