2500|$|Stop sign {{placement}} {{can pose}} an additional challenge to users. There is a trade-off between the salient visual cues provided by increased limit line set-back, and the crucial {{time that is}} lost in approaching the intersection from behind that line; being closer can provide a few additional seconds requisite for safe transit. However, common creeping into the intersection past the limit line causes drivers to lose the invaluable perspective of the visual acuity of lateral motion, crippling them to the more dangerous SAVT. This makes {{it very difficult to}} estimate the movement of oncoming traffic. As intersections are not engineered to be used this way, the traffic flow ideals have broken down when drivers consistently choose this method as the safer alternative. Stop signs are accompanied with a limit line, which has a mandatory set-back distance which is often not less than 15 feet. While it may be <b>negligence</b> <b>per</b> <b>se</b> to prematurely pass the stop limit line, drivers may be unfairly denied sufficient time gap or opportunity to enter otherwise because of the through-traffic flow and speed; the inherent problem with this traffic control device. While stop signs are a relatively inexpensive method of traffic management, they can be expensive from perspective of the damage they cause users. Pricey but safer traffic signals, roundabouts, and traffic circles are alternatively used where traffic flow dictates it is inappropriate to use a stop sign. It is just as crucial for law enforcement to regulate traffic through-speed that is above the [...] assured clear distance ahead ahead as it is to cite stop sign runners for this device to be a viable option.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court has {{employed}} the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> standard for illegality of tying arrangements under antitrust laws for some sixty years. The tying arrangement, once reviled by the House of Representatives as 2 ̆ 2 {{one of the}} greatest agencies and instrumentalities of monopoly ever devised by man, 2 ̆ 2 is now understood by many to have potentially redeeming, as well as condemning, qualities. As a result, scholars and judges alike have decried the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> standard as ineffective and called for its abandonment. However, the Supreme Court continues to endorse the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> standard when assessing tying arrangements. The Seventh Circuit, like other circuits, has struggled in applying the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s <b>per</b> <b>se</b> tying analysis; this is evident in its recent decision, Reifert v. South Central MLS Corp. While all three judges hearing the case agreed on the outcome, Judge Wood contended that the majority misstated the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s <b>per</b> <b>se</b> analysis by adding a factor (the economic interest requirement) never recognized by the Court as a requisite for <b>per</b> <b>se</b> illegality of tying arrangements.

40|$|Preemption {{has emerged}} as the leading {{contender}} for conceptual grounding of the patentable subject matter doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s exclusion of abstract ideas and natural phenomena from patentability. Despite the Supreme Courts frequent use of preemption rhetoric, however, the concept cannot provide a satisfactory explanation of the Courts patentable subject matter jurisprudence or a sound theoretical basis for the doctrine. Patentable subject matter jurisprudence has two distinct threads, one concerned with overly broad impact on downstream innovation and the other based on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion of abstract ideas and natural phenomena from patentability. Most of the Courts patentable subject matter decisions apply a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis. While preemption is conceptually related to the downstream impact thread, the term is misleading even in that context. When preemption rhetoric is employed in the majority of cases, which are based on <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion, it leads to confusion and incoherence. This Article disentangles the preemption rhetoric from the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis in the Supreme Courts cases. <b>Per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion analysis necessarily involves two steps: identifying the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements in a claim and applying some rule to determine whether additional claim limitations render the claim patentable. The Article identifies these two steps within the Supreme Courts cases and seeks to prepare the ground for coherent theoretical analysis. Preemption rhetoric is a distraction from important questions that must be answered to give patentable subject matter doctrine a firm theoretical grounding. First, what are the normative bases of the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusions? As the discussion of the cases shows, failing to answer this question leads to seemingly arbitrary (or result-driven) identification of the <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements in a claim. Second, what rules should be used to determine whether a particular claim incorporating <b>per</b> <b>se</b> excluded elements along with other limitations is patentable subject matter? The current muddle in patentable subject matter analysis is due largely to failure to moor these second-step rules to the normative basis for <b>per</b> <b>se</b> exclusion...|$|R

5000|$|Violations [...] "per se": {{these are}} {{violations}} {{that meet the}} strict characterization of Section 1 ("agreements, conspiracies or trusts in restraint of trade"). A <b>per</b> <b>se</b> violation requires no further inquiry into the practice's actual effect on the market or the intentions of those individuals who engaged in the practice. Conduct characterized as <b>per</b> <b>se</b> unlawful is that which {{has been found to}} have a [...] "'pernicious effect on competition' or 'lacks [...] [...] [...] any redeeming virtue'" [...] Such conduct [...] "would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output." [...] When a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> rule is applied, a civil violation of the antitrust laws is found merely by proving that the conduct occurred and that it fell within a <b>per</b> <b>se</b> category.

Conduct considered <b>per</b> <b>se</b> unlawful includes horizontal price-fixing, horizontal market division, and concerted refusals to deal.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there are}} five valid excuses that are {{available}} for a defendant to defeat a standard of <b>negligence</b> <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> (Restatement (Second) of Torts section 288.1(2).) First, the defendant may not know of the breach due to incompetence. Secondly, he might either lack knowledge or reason to know of the breach or duty. Furthermore, for some explainable reason, he {{may be unable to}} comply, despite diligence. The breach may be due to a sudden emergency not of one’s own making. And lastly, in special situations it may be safer to not comply than to comply. In cases where these defenses are applied, <b>negligence</b> <b>per</b> <b>se</b> doctrine creates no more than a rebuttable presumption of negligence that shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.|$|E

50|$|This {{is part of}} the {{violation}} of statute argument used under <b>negligence</b> <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> However, violation of statute will not be <b>negligence</b> <b>per</b> <b>se</b> if there is an excuse for that violation; such as the one given in this case. So the statute will create a general duty of care but that does not alleviate the common law duties of care nor the duty to act as a reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances. One such excuse for deviation is a greater and unreasonable danger being faced while adhering to the statute. We agree with the court that only a fool would walk on the side where the traffic is extremely heavy as opposed to walking on the side where the traffic is light. So part of the prima facie case related to statutes must include a determination whether {{the violation}} of the statute was excused.|$|E

50|$|Most {{nuisance}} claims allege {{a nuisance}} in fact, {{for the simple}} reason that not many actions or structures have been deemed to be nuisances <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> In general, if an act, or use of property, is lawful, or authorized by competent authority, it cannot be a nuisance <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> Rather, the act in question must either be declared by public statute, or by case law, to be a nuisance <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> There are few state or federal statutes or case law declaring actions or structures to be a nuisance in and of themselves. Few activities or structures, in and of themselves and under any and all circumstances, are a nuisance; which is how courts determine whether or not an action or structure is a nuisance <b>per</b> <b>se.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By contrast, a {{nuisance}} <b>per</b> <b>se</b> is [...] "an activity, or an act, structure, instrument, or occupation which is {{a nuisance}} at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings." [...] Liability for a nuisance <b>per</b> <b>se</b> is absolute, and injury to the public is presumed; if its existence is alleged and established by proof, it is also established {{as a matter of}} law.

The data suggests that on the average overdominance was not important for yield in BSSS. Correlations of inbred line traits with the same traits of the hybrids were larger than correlations of inbred line traits with hybrid yield. The correlations of inbred traits with hybrid yield were too small to be of predictive value.

50|$|This is {{also known}} as <b>negligence</b> <b>per</b> <b>se.</b> Breach can be shown in most jurisdictions if a {{defendant}} violates a statute that pertains to safety and the purpose of which is to prevent the result of the case. Note that this is an alternative way to show breach. A violation of statute will not have occurred in every case. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown does not mean that there has been no breach. Even if it is attempted to be shown but fails, there may be other bases of breach.|$|E
50|$|Because a {{reasonable}} person is objectively presumed {{to know the}} law, noncompliance with a local safety statute may also constitute negligence. The related doctrine of <b>negligence</b> <b>per</b> <b>se</b> addresses {{the circumstances under which}} the law of negligence can become an implied cause of action for breaching a statutory standard of care. Conversely, minimal compliance with a safety statute does not always absolve a defendant if the trier of fact determines that the reasonable person should have taken actions beyond and in excess of what the statute required. However, if the trier of fact finds the statute's standard itself is reasonable and the defendant acted in accordance with what the statute contemplated, the duty of care can be deemed met.|$|E
