5|$|Those {{cells that}} {{recognize}} coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, {{as the name}} suggests, interact with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, mast cells and neutrophils will degranulate, <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) – this process may explain the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used in biological therapies against cancer. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.|$|E

The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells.</b> These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak {{in order}} to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E

In patients who had become seroreactive in the lipoidal tests it was depressed in those with secondary and latent syphilis.

Our results suggest that while the combined treatment does not substantially modify the depressed <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> response, thymosin alpha 1 pre-treatment significantly restores the boosting capacity of the two cytokines, IL- 2 and IFN. Since thymosin alpha 1 proved capable of accelerating <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity recovery in animals irradiated and reconstituted with symgenic marrow cells, we hypothesize that the synergistic effect between thymosin alpha 1 and IFN could result from the differentiation of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> lines by thymosin alpha 1 which can then become sensitive to IFN. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a good correlation between restoration of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity and regulation of tumor growth. Thus, these results may have important implications in tumor immunotherapy and patients with infectious diseases such as AIDS which is associated with low <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity...|$|R

Whereas the <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity measured {{immediately after the}} treatment with medullasin remained almost {{on the same level}} as the control, an incubation at 37 degrees C for several hours increased markedly the <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity of the lymphocytes treated with medullasin. Enhancement of the natural cytotoxicity was caused by the treatment with physiologic concentrations of the protease (5 - 20 micrograms/ml). Inhibitors of medullasin such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and elastatinal prevented the activation of natural cytotoxicity. Depletion of lymphocytes bearing Fc receptors for IgG abolished the enhancement of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity by medullasin. Interferon activity was not detected in the supernatant of lymphocyte cultures stimulated with medullasin. The medullasin enhanced further the <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity of lymphocytes stimulated with interferon. Medullasin activity was detected neither in unstimulated nor stimulated (by concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin) human lymphocytes. The protease was released easily from human mature granulocytes into culture medium.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity and the possible role of beta- endorphin in a natural model of autoimmune orchitis, the dark mink. An assay was developed to study <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity in the mink and base-line levels of activity in this specie were determined. <b>Natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity was assessed in fertile mutation mink, primary infertile dark mink and secondary infertile Utah dark mink with autoimmune orchitis. The study included three sampling times: November, March and April. <b>Natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity was significantly lower in mink studied in April than it was in. mink studied in March or November, and there was a significant correlation of activity to fertility. The addition of beta-endorphin to <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> cultures had no effect on activity. A preliminary study was done to determine concentration levels of beta-endorphin in mink plasma, pituitary, hypothalamus and testes. Measurable amounts were found in all tissue types studied. Although the number of samples was too limited to draw significant conclusions, there appears to be a trend toward lower beta-endorphin concentration, in pituitary tissue and plasma samples, of mink with autoimmune orchitis. Beta-endorphin levels did not appear to correlate with <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity in the mink. Two assays, the <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> assay and the blasto-genesis assay, were used to insure that the beta-endorphin preparation used in this study were active. <b>Natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity had been reported to be enhanced by the addition of beta-endorphin. In the present study <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was enhanced in the presence of betaendorphin, suggesting that the peptide was active.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that a}} single systemic injection of a high dose of morphine (greater {{than or equal to}} 20 mg/kg) transiently suppresses splenic <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> cytotoxicity in rats.

This effect was blocked by an opiate antagonist, naltrexone. <b>Natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity was unaffected by systemic administration of N-methyl morphine, a morphine analogue that does not cross the blood-brain barrier.

40|$|Decreased cell {{mediated}} cytotoxicity occurs frequently in inflammatory bowel disease, particularly {{in patients with}} active disease. It is not clear, however, whether this decrease {{is caused by the}} disease or is a consequence of the medical treatment. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with 5 -aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on the in vitro <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity in five patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission and in four healthy control subjects in a double blind randomised crossover trial preceded and separated by four weeks of treatment with placebo. The <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity was significantly impaired in 67 % (six of nine subjects) after four weeks' sulphasalazine treatment and tended to be related to subjects with a slow acetylator phenotype. In contrast, 5 -aminosalicylic acid treatment caused only a marginal reaction in the <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity in 22 % (two of nine subjects). The inhibitory effects were found to be reversible since the decreased <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity was completely restored after placebo treatment in all subjects. In conclusion, in vivo treatment with sulphasalazine inhibits the in vitro <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity and this seems to be mediated by the sulphapyridine moiety.
