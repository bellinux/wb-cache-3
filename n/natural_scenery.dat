25|$|Alwar is {{the first}} major city when {{travelling}} from Delhi en route to Rajasthan. Its heritage is a major draw for tourists. The fort of Alwar, known as Bala fort, is about 595 meters high. It was constructed in the tenth century, making it the oldest building in the city. Despite {{being one of the}} princely states of Rajputana, the rulers here had left no stone unturned in building many forts. Seeing the fort of Baala, there is an impression that sometimes {{it would have been a}} very inaccessible fort, where there would have been many turrets, a large gate, a temple and a residential area. There is a state museum in the City Palace, where there is a rare collection of miniature paintings. Near the corner are Mousi's umbrella, Vinay Palace, Vijay Mandir Palace and Moti Dungri. In other tourist spots, the lake is situated in Silasedh Lake and Jaisamand Lake. Sariska, which is at a distance of 36 kilometers, after rain, for its green trees and greenery of bushes, is seen differently. In its beautiful valley, visions are visible with blue cow, chital, wild pig, other animals. Sariska is counted in old Tiger-projects. Due to poaching sighting tigers has unfortunately become rare. Do not be discouraged but go Sariska, which is still full of beautiful <b>natural</b> <b>scenery</b> and colorful birds. Historical significance of the nearby Biratnagar or Barrath, is due to the stupa and established inscription made by Emperor Ashoka the Great. According to legendary belief, Pandavas spent some time in their ignorance here. There is a large number of religious devotees on the Pandupole-Bhardhari Loktirtha. You can also experience unlimited peace by traveling here. Alwar is also famous for its famous sweet kalakand (Mauva of Alwar), this milk made from milk is not only nearby but also famous.

500|$|The nuanced view {{of flight}} {{is part of}} Miyazaki's broader {{critique}} of modern society and technology. Margaret Talbot writes that in person, Miyazaki exhibits [...] "a profound dissatisfaction with modern life," [...] particularly {{with the effects of}} technology and a disconnection from nature. Many of his films depict technological hubris as among the roots of evil. The battleships which are seen moving over the landscape are depicted as [...] "gleaming with modernity and parading righteousness," [...] but are then shown to be highly destructive. In contrast, the semi-organic castle demonstrates [...] "Miyazaki’s Taoist presentation of industrialism needing to be aligned with nature" [...] according to Carl and Garrath Wilson. Antonio Lioi writes that Miyazaki often depicts beautiful scenes in contrast to those containing symbols of modernity, such as the scene where Sophie's reverie is interrupted by a war machine. This contrast is part of an ecological criticism of modernity, but Miyazaki also offers an alternative, in the form of beautiful <b>natural</b> <b>scenery.</b>|$|E

John Charles Olmsted, the stepson of Frederick Law Olmsted, spent May 1903 in Portland. , received in December, emphasized creation of a system of parks and linking parkways that would take advantage of <b>natural</b> <b>scenery.</b> It proposed a formal square for Union Station, squares along the downtown waterfront, and parks in places later known as Forest Park, Sellwood Park, Mount Tabor Park, Rocky Butte, and Ross Island, as well as Terwilliger Parkway, the 40 Mile Loop, and other connecting parkways. Proposed parks for Swan Island, in the Willamette River, and other places in Portland did not develop. Others like Forest Park came into being only many years later.|$|E
