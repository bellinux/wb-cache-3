500|$|Hischak {{described}} the original cast album as [...] "surprisingly lively and mostly enjoyable for a musical {{that was considered}} so dull on stage." [...] He pointed to [...] "Intermission Talk" [...] as a number which probably works better in a recording than on stage and states that [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> hypnotic power of 'No Other Love'". The original cast recording was released on compact disc in 1993.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, M. Suganth of The Times of India {{rated the}} film 4.5 out of 5. Naman Ramachandran {{considered}} Rajinikanth's Kali an effective {{portrayal of a}} challenging, complex character. He praised Balu Mahendra's cinematography, especially his use of natural light. In December 2014, Gautaman Bhaskaran of the Hindustan Times wrote: [...] "On watching [...] recently, there was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> brilliance of [...] acting ability. In both, he essays shades of deep grey, and yet there was something captivating about Rajinikanth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Solomon {{charged that}} the [...] "so-called 'left'" [...] was [...] "making its {{position}} clear" [...] with the Declaration of Principles. [...] "There was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> flag it had unfurled," [...] he declared, [...] "It was the banner of thinly veiled communism." [...] While he declared that [...] "the Declaration of Principles must be decisively rejected in the referendum," [...] he nevertheless strongly hinted that a factional split was in the offing. Merely defeating the proposed Declaration of Principles was [...] "not enough," [...] he concluded, [...] "The Socialist Party must be made safe for Socialism, for social democracy." ...|$|E

5000|$|As of 2015, {{there were}} diverse claims {{regarding}} the fastest typing in smartphones. The typical yardstick is writing, with <b>no</b> <b>mistakes,</b> <b>the</b> 160-character text: ...|$|R

2500|$|The album {{received}} polarizing reviews. Rock Sound {{gave the}} album an 8/10 rating, remarking that [...] "It {{may not be}} perfect, but Korn have thrown caution to the wind and set out an impressive template for a future sound, for a band doing that nearly 20 years into their career, they deserve your respect". They do note however that the album sounds [...] "a little formulaic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] at times. Spin gave the album a 7/10, saying [...] "Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon". Henry Northmore from The List gave the album a rating of 4/5 saying that [...] "the purists (both metal and dubstep) will probably hate it, {{but if you are}} willing to have your brain assaulted from every direction by a new Frankensteinian metal/beats hybrid, you’ll find an album packed with pure adrenaline". Allmusic gave the album 4/5 saying that [...] "despite all the electronics, there’s <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>The</b> Path of Totality as a Korn album...and one of their better ones to boot".|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{said the}} closure allowed Francis {{to settle a}} {{confrontation}} started by his predecessor that [...] "created an uproar among American Catholics," [...] who energetically defended the nuns {{in the face of}} Vatican interference, signing petitions and sending letters to the Vatican. Father James Martin, who wrote frequently about the conflict as an editor of the Jesuit magazine America, said: [...] "What you see with the sisters is true courage, which is being faithful to the church authority and also to who they are." [...] On April 17, 2015, the editorial board of The New York Times editorialized that, [...] "The Vatican's misguided investigation of American Catholic nuns seemed thoroughly steeped in chauvinism from its inception three years ago by the church's male-dominated bureaucracy. Rome's move against widely respected churchwomen was puzzling and provocative in an era of scandal by male priests committing child rape and being repeatedly shielded by their male superiors....There was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> message that the reforming spirit of Francis's fresh broom had poked sharply into another corner of the Vatican. The extraordinary effort to have the Vatican take control of the sisters' main communal voice – the Leadership Conference of Women Religious – ended with none of the aggressive bombast of Rome's initial announcement of the inquiry under Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{could be}} <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> <b>The</b> live eye {{that had been}} {{watching}} him {{through a hole in}} the tapestry was gone. The firelight no longer shone on a reflecting surface.|$|R
60|$|There {{could be}} <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> <b>The</b> bright {{glittering}} eyes, the black beard and moustache, the prominent nose, the kindly smile, the broad chest and shoulders, revealed unquestionably {{the captain of}} the Rajah's gun-boat.|$|R

6000|$|... “What are {{you going}} to do with her?” he panted. There was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> grim trend of {{mischief}} in those flushed by sternly composed young faces.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's folks {{coming at}} last!" [...] the porter exclaimed, turning around excitedly. [...] "They've {{been a time}} and <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> <b>The</b> village isn't {{a quarter of a}} mile away. Did you find a flask, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Battle rapped on his log. [...] "Excellentissimo!" [...] he said. [...] "He's a scholard born. Now, monkeys like you," [...] he went on, {{looking into}} Nod's face, [...] "if I make <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>the</b> blackamoors calls 'Pongoes.'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I tell you," [...] the {{smuggler}} said, [...] "it's {{going to be}} a storm, and <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> <b>The</b> Lucy is a tight craft, and has weathered gales when many a bigger ship has gone down. Still, I don't like running out into it without necessity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I {{knew his}} wife too. The bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, {{she had the}} {{foot and mouth disease}} and <b>no</b> <b>mistake!</b> <b>The</b> night she threw the soup in the waiter's face in the Star and Garter. Oho! ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped short. There was a low, {{grinding}} sound, {{accompanied by}} a strange tremor in the planks on which they stood, as if the house were gradually coming alive!

60|$|There was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> sound, the deep, low {{throbbing}} of {{a powerful}} engine as yet some distance away. I was conscious of a curious sense of uneasiness.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bow-wow!" [...] he said, and Betsy knew at {{once that}} meant yes, as well as Dorothy and Ozma knew it, for there was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> tone of Toto's voice.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, well! {{it was a}} queer wedding, and <b>no</b> <b>mistake!</b> <b>The</b> queerest {{that had}} ever been in Marosfalva within memory of man. A bride more prone to tears than to laughter!

6000|$|... "He is no fool," [...] one of {{the others}} said. [...] "He gave it those black fellows hot, and <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> <b>The</b> sooner he's put out of the way, the better.

60|$|Mildred pushed again, {{straining}} every muscle. Then {{she bent}} {{and examined the}} wall. It was easy to see, from this side, where the series of three blocks were firmly joined together.

60|$|Hardly {{a minute}} passed before I heard a woman's {{voice in the}} room. There was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> charm of those tones. It {{was the voice of}} Mrs. Van Brandt.|$|E
6000|$|Helen's eyes fell {{beneath his}} gaze. She discerned {{what he was}} thinking, and, though the words [...] "heart's desire" [...] were accidental, there was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> <b>the</b> suggestion. She said slowly: ...|$|E
