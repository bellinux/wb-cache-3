5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> He {{was admitted to the}} <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, the New England states {{adopted a}} region-wide system for route numbering. New England Route 14 was {{initially}} {{designated as a}} northsouth route beginning at White River Junction, through Montpelier, {{to the city of}} Burlington. The route used modern VT 14 to Barre, then US 302 to Montpelier, and US 2 to Burlington. By 1925, an extension into <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> had been designated continuing across the Connecticut River to Lebanon, <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> and heading southeast to Franklin, along modern US 4 to Andover and <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> Route 11 to Franklin.|$|E
5|$|In March 1779 the {{regiment}} was reassigned to the Northern Department, and marched to Springfield, Massachusetts.

5|$|The Abbey Shield was {{designed}} by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard University. It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal {{of the state of}} <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> In 1927, by a monastic vote, the shield design was incorporated as the official shield of Saint Anselm Abbey and the college. The drops in each quadrant represent the three drops of blood on Anselm's coat of arms, and the sheaf of five arrows is taken from the first shield of the State of <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> representing the five original counties of the state. Hence, the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm of <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1824, <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill {{laying the groundwork for}} a party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National Republicans), who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams. The work of the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office, but Franklin Pierce won his first election: Hillsborough town moderator, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.|$|E
