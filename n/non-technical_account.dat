5000|$|Whiteside was an {{authority}} {{on the work of}} Isaac Newton and editor of the eight volumes of the mathematical papers of Isaac Newton. From 1987 to his retirement in 1999, he was the Professor of History of Mathematics and Exact Sciences at Cambridge University. Whiteside wrote a 19-page <b>non-technical</b> <b>account,</b> Newton the Mathematician. [...] In this essay he describes Newton's mathematical development starting in secondary school. Whiteside says that the most important influence on Newton's mathematical development was Book II of René Descartes's La Géométrie. [...] Book II is devoted to a problem that had been considered and partly solved by Pappus of Alexandria and Apollonius of Perga. Descartes completely solved the problem, inventing new mathematics as needed. The problem is this: Given n lines L, with points P(L) on them, find the locus of points Q, such that the lengths of the line segments QP(C) satisfy certain conditions. For example, if n = 4, given lines a, b, c, and d and a point A on a, B on b, and so on, find the locus of points Q such that the product QA*QB equals the product QC*QD. When the lines are not all parallel, Pappus had shown that the locus of points Q was a conic section. Descartes considered larger n, allowing some lines to be parallel, and he obtained cubic and higher degree curves. He was able to do this by producing the equation that the points of Q satisfy, using the Cartesian coordinate system. The rest of Descartes' Book II is occupied with showing that the cubic curves arise naturally in the study of optics from the Snell-Descartes Law. Newton developed an interest in optics. Newton was inspired to undertake the classification of cubic curves, and he identified 72 of the 78 different species.|$|E

40|$|T {{his paper}} aims to enhance {{understanding}} of accounting concepts and practices inthe industrial relations community by contrasting the alleged technical and <b>non-technical</b> roles of <b>accounting.</b> By <b>non-technical</b> roles, we mean the ideological, social and perception-fashioning roles of accounting procedures and processes. Our principal con-tention {{is that the}} industrial relations community would benefit from improved aware-ness of the non-technical character of accounting—especially through alertness to the rhetorical features and social construction of <b>accounting.</b> Four often-unapparent <b>non-technical</b> roles of <b>accounting</b> in industrial relations are discussed and their significance is highlighted. This paper is based uponour separate experiences of teaching accounting to indus-trial relations students and practitioners over the past 25 years. It is stimulated by the conviction that accounting deserves to be acknowledged in industrial relations as an equivocal and rhetorical social practice that is a socially-constructed means of financial expression and rhetoric.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{discovery of}} quasicrystals by D Shechtman, D Gratias, I Blech, and J W Cahn in 1984 provided the paradigm {{for a new}} type of long-range order of solid matter in nature. This discovery stimulated an explosion of new experimental and theoretical research. In years prior to the discovery, there was a very active development of various gateways to quasicrystals in theoretical and mathematical physics. Without this conceptual basis, it would have been impossible to grasp and explore efficiently the structure and physical properties of quasicrystrals.

Brief consideration is given to the relation of this project to the broader social and economic program of a wise development of natural resources. Prior to this study, no systematic description and interpretation of the Loup Project has been attempted so far as the writer has been able to discover. Aside from the preliminary engineering survey report and <b>non-technical</b> newepaper <b>accounts,</b> little mention of the project has been made in print.

40|$|This {{research}} examined what accounting {{employers are}} seeking in their ‘ideal’ accounting graduate {{and sought to}} provide clarification on the ‘expectation gap’ between what accounting employers require in their graduates, and the skills these graduates are exhibiting. Adopting a qualitative research method, this research paper draws on semi-structured interviews conducted face-to-face with participants from key accounting employers. This research found that, in terms of technical skills, employers require at least a sound understanding of the fundamental technical accounting skills. However, beyond this, little more is expected technically of graduates as the requisite technical skills are learned ‘on the job’. Findings also suggest that the touted ‘expectation gap’ is not as pervasive as prior literature has suggested. Over half of employers also believed universities are preparing students adequately for the workplace, although this seemed to be moderated by an opinion among employers that this is “as well as an academic institution can do. ” Based on the findings, some key recommendations were made. These include a greater inclusion of <b>non-technical</b> skills in <b>accounting</b> education through the incorporation of practical case study problems into accounting curricula, involving group discussion {{and the production of}} written reports and business presentations for their ‘client’ as well as the continued encouragement of internship opportunities within university degrees...|$|R

40|$|Universities have {{traditionally}} been criticised for not producing ‘work ready’ accountants and the role and responsibilities of universities in educating professional accountants continues to be debated. This paper reviews the literature in accounting and other professions regarding the respective roles of universities and employers {{in the development of}} both technical and <b>non-technical</b> skills of <b>accounting</b> practitioners. The literature review suggests that critics of university based education fail to recognise (a) the changes that have occurred in the roles and responsibilities of accounting practitioners and (b) the opportunity costs necessarily associated with providing generalist accounting degrees. The literature also suggests that universities and employers have comparative advantages for the development of different types of professional skills and knowledge. The paper reports the insights provided from a series of interviews with accounting practitioners and students about their perceptions of the respective responsibilities and roles of universities and employers. In general, although some interviewees recognised that universities cannot be ‘all things to all people’, there was a tendency to expect universities to have the major responsibility for the development in accounting graduates of both technical and non-technical knowledge and skills. Such perceptions tended to understate the responsibilities and comparative advantage of employers and result in unrealistic expectations about the outcomes of a university education. Employers need to be made more aware of the resource and other limitations associated with university programs and more attention should be provided to developing meaningful opportunities for learning and reflection within work place contexts...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{interference}} lies at {{the heart}} of several surprising equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena in many-body Physics. Here we discuss two recently explored non-equilibrium scenarios where external periodic drive applied to closed (i. e., not attached to any external bath) quantum many-body systems have apparently opposite effects in respective cases. In one case it freezes/localizes a disorder free system dynamically, while in the other it delocalizes a disordered many-body localized system, and quantum interference is responsible for both the effects. We review these in the perspective of more general questions of ergodicity, energy absorption, asymptotic behavior, and finally the essential role of quantum mechanics in understanding these issues in periodically driven closed many-body systems.

The first sections of the paper give a <b>non-technical</b> <b>account</b> of how generalized networks are used to model a diversity of significant practical problems. To begin, we discuss the model structure of a generalized network (GN) and provide a brief survey of applications which have been modeled as GN problems. Next we explain a somewhat newer modeling technique in which generalized networks form a major, but not the only, component of the model. The later sections give a technical exposition of the design and analysis of computer solution techniques for large-scale GN problems. They contain a study of GN solution strategies within the framework of specializations of the primal simplex method. We identify an efficient solution procedure derived from an integrated system of start, pivot, and degeneracy rules. The resulting computer code is shown, on large problems, to be at least 50 times more efficient than the LP system, APEX III...|$|E
