5000|$|The airline has {{converted}} {{an order}} for A380F into the passenger version which are due for delivery in 2009. In its place the airline has ordered ten Boeing 747-8 freighters for its SkyCargo subsidiary. Emirates has chosen the Boeing 747-8 [...] "derivative" [...] freighter over the all-new Airbus A380F for its <b>nose-loading</b> capability, something the rival Airbus freighter is lacking.|$|E
5000|$|His second airline venture began flying {{cars and}} their owners across the English Channel in 1954, {{initially}} using {{a fleet of}} Bristol Freighter twin-engined, piston-powered planes. These were later supplemented and eventually superseded by the larger-capacity, four-engined Carvairs. The Carvair design {{was based on the}} Douglas DC-4 piston-engined airliner. It involved raising the aircraft's cockpit [...] "above" [...] the fuselage in a 747-style bulge so as to create more space for vehicles and/or passengers on the main deck. It also involved replacing the DC-4's original tail fin with a newly designed, larger DC-7-style fin as well as equipping the aircraft with a Bristol Freighter-type <b>nose-loading</b> cargo door, more powerful brakes and a stronger undercarriage.|$|E
40|$|With {{polypropylene}} as {{a prototype}} viscoelastic material at room temperature, {{it was found}} that a "nose" may appear in the unloading segment of the load-displacement curve during nanoindentation when the holding time at peak load is short and/or the unloading rate is small, and when the peak load is high enough. The load at which the nose appears was also found to decrease linearly with decreasing unloading rate. A linear viscoelasticity analysis was performed to interpret this effect. The analysis predicts a linear variation between the nose load and the unloading rate, and the slope of such a linear variation is also shown to be proportional to the viscosity parameter of the material. Thus, by measuring the slope of the <b>nose-load</b> versus unloading rate plot at a given temperature, the viscosity parameter of the specimen can be found. This is a new way of measuring the viscosity parameter of a material in addition to the existing method of force modulation and noting the frequency response of the displacement. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
