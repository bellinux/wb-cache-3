5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E

The challenge to policymakers is to find that wage level that is considered fair given workers' <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country's global competitiveness.|$|E

25|$|The {{power station}} was {{constructed}} near Cape Town {{to be the}} sole provider {{of power in the}} Western Cape after fossil-fuel power stations were deemed too small and too expensive to be viable. Nuclear power was considered because it was more economical than transporting coal to the existing fossil-fuel power stations, and construction of new fossil-fuel power-stations, which would have required 300m tall chimneys to comply with clean-air legislation. Athlone Power Station in the city was too small to provide Cape Town's <b>needs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Paarden Island power station (itself too small) has been demolished.|$|E
