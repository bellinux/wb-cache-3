5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E
5|$|The {{crews of}} the American {{merchant}} vessels possessed only small arms, but their escort, Experiment, {{was a much}} more powerful vessel. Commanded by William Maley, the 135-ton Experiment was armed with 12 six-pounder guns and had a complement of 70 men. In comparison, Rigaud's initial attack force consisted of eleven barges crewed by 40 to 50 men each in the smaller ones, and 60 or 70 in the larger vessels. These barges were primarily propelled by oars, with 26 per vessel. The Haitian craft were each equipped {{with a mix of}} swivel guns and four-pounder cannon, with most vessels armed with two or three guns as well as small arms. In addition to the vessels that set out to attack the convoy, there were more barges and men nearby that the Haitians could call upon if reinforcements were needed. In total some 37 barges and 1500 men were at Rigaud's immediate disposal, though the Americans did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> during the attack. Individually the Haitian barges presented only a small threat to the convoy, but when attacking en masse they could easily overwhelm and capture the American ships if they managed to board them.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the cave}} network {{she finds a}} dying Cameo, who tells her the Beforetime weapons Alexi and Vega are searching for caused the Great White, but they do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this.</b> She also reveals it is Elspeth’s destiny, as the Seeker, to destroy them. After {{mourning}} her death, Elspeth overhears that Rushton, imprisoned in the next cavern, is the true heir of Obernewtyn. Suddenly, she is captured by Ariel, who ties her to a {{table next to the}} Zebkrahn machine. Elspeth is forced to hold the diaries of Marisa Seraphim, the wife of the founder of Obernewtyn and Alexi's stepmother, and use her abilities to discover what Marisa was thinking when she wrote them to determine the weapons’ location. Still withstanding the torture, Elspeth mentally enters Rushton’s mind and recognises the voice of her earlier rescuer from the Zebkrahn. Rushton gives his mental strength to her to endure the pain inflicted on her by the machine. In her despair at their threats to kill him, her resistance breaks and Marissa’s thoughts reveal the map to be carved into the front doors of Obernewtyn. At this point, the Zebkrahn overheats and bursts into flames. Something in Elspeth’s mind cracks and she uses this new power to kill Vega, who she saw standing over Rushton with a knife. She falls unconscious as Domick and Rushton’s other friends rush in. Alexi is killed, but Ariel flees into the night and is believed to have died in the blizzard. Now known to be the legal master of Obernewtyn, Rushton plans to build it into a secret refuge for Misfits.|$|E

25|$|Patrick and {{his wife}} Diane, a lawyer specializing in labor and {{employment}} law, married in 1984. They have lived in Milton, Massachusetts since 1989 and have two daughters, Sarah and Katherine. In July 2008, Katherine publicly announced {{that she is a}} lesbian, and mentioned that her father did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> while he was fighting against a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have banned same-sex marriage. In a joint interview Patrick expressed support for his daughter and said he was proud of her. In September 2011, his daughter Sarah married Marco Morgese, a former Italian soldier. On May 20, 2013, Patrick became a grandfather when Sarah gave birth to a son, Gianluca Noah Patrick Morgese.|$|E
25|$|The return {{fire from}} Fort Clark was ineffectual, either falling short or passing overhead, and no hits {{were made on}} the bombarding ships. Shortly after noon, the {{defenders}} ran low on ammunition, and about 12:25p.m. they ran out completely. At this point, they abandoned the fort, some fleeing to Fort Hatteras, while others took to boats. Col. Max Weber, commanding the Federal troops already on shore, noted this and put some men in to take possession, but the fleet did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> and continued firing for another five minutes. It was during this interval of confusion that the landing force suffered its only casualty, {{one of the soldiers}} being seriously wounded in the hand by a shell fragment. Fortunately, some of the troops were able {{to get the attention of}} the gunners on the ships by waving a large American flag, and the bombardment stopped with no further harm done. Stringham and his captains then turned their attention to Fort Hatteras.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} story, Gray's caveat {{was taken to the}} US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and {{remained}} {{near the bottom of the}} in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.|$|E

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Ron's {{character}} {{are based on}} those of Nick Offerman in real life, such as his woodworking abilities; Offerman runs an independent carpentry business called Offerman Woodshop. Offerman also plays saxophone in real life, just as Ron does, although the Parks and Recreation writers did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> when they wrote this element of his character. Offerman's real-life training in stage combat and Kabuki dance were the partial inspiration for self-defense classes Ron offered his parks department colleagues in [...] "Park Safety." [...] Ron's second ex-wife Tammy, who {{first appeared in the}} episode [...] "Ron and Tammy," [...] was played by comedian and actress Megan Mullally, Offerman's real-life wife. The idea of Ron hating his ex-wife Tammy was established early {{in the creation of the}} character, and it was Schur who conceived the idea of casting Mullally, an idea to which Offerman was extremely responsive.|$|E
500|$|With Toland dead, the severely–wounded Powell was {{in command}} of the brigade—but Powell was thought to be dying, and could not be moved. This left the infantry's Lieutenant Colonel Franklin in command, {{although}} he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> until the fighting was mostly over. [...] The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry did not reform and act as a regiment. It had only four companies in the town, and one was serving as the rear guard. Instead, individual companies were led by their captains (or lieutenants), and some of these leaders performed well. Captain Gilmore led the portion of cavalry that was still mounted, including what was left of his two-company detachment from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. Gilmore's detachment, which [...] "suffered most severely", was complemented in the after action report made by Lieutenant Colonel Franklin. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, led by Franklin and Major John W. Shaw, also performed well.|$|E

They are both {{surprised}} by Roy's beautiful home and the elegant wedding details, and Roy tells them he runs a very successful gravel company. During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does <b>not</b> <b>know.</b> <b>This</b> is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E

500|$|Despite Weed's efforts, Taylor was {{nominated}} {{on the fourth}} ballot, to the anger of Clay's supporters and of [...] Conscience Whigs from the Northeast. When order was restored, John A. Collier, a New Yorker and a Weed opponent, addressed the convention. Delegates hung on his every word as he {{described himself as a}} Clay partisan; he had voted for Clay on each ballot. He eloquently described the grief of the Clay supporters, frustrated again in their battle to make Clay president. [...] Collier warned of a fatal breach in the party, and stated that only one thing could prevent it: the nomination of Fillmore for vice president, whom he incorrectly depicted as a strong Clay supporter. Fillmore in fact agreed with many of Clay's positions, but did not back him for president and was not in Philadelphia. Delegates did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> was false, or at least greatly exaggerated, and there was a large reaction in Fillmore's favor. At the time, the presidential candidate did not automatically pick his running mate, and despite the efforts of Taylor's managers to get the nomination for their choice, Abbott Lawrence of Massachusetts, Fillmore became the Whig nominee for vice president on the second ballot.|$|E
500|$|In {{his study}} of the {{cultural}} and literary legacy of Brussels, André De Vries remarked that Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was [...] "crude by Hergé's later standards, {{in every sense of the}} word". Simon Kuper of the Financial Times criticised both Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo as the [...] "worst" [...] of the Adventures, being [...] "poorly drawn" [...] and [...] "largely plot-free". Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Hergé had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, Hergé cast the Bolsheviks as [...] "absolute evil" [...] but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> either, thereby observing the Soviet [...] "world of misery" [...] and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as [...] "fairly straightforward" [...] and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as [...] "pantomime cut-outs".|$|E

2500|$|An {{incubation}} {{effect can}} be observed in TOT states, where the passage of time alone can influence the resolution of the state and result in successful recall. Also, the presence of a TOT state is a good predictor that the problem can be resolved correctly, although this has been shown to occur more frequently with older-young-adults than young-adults or seniors. This is evidence for both the metacognitive perspective as well as the psycholinguistic perspective. [...] It demonstrates the devotion of resources to searching memory, a source of cumulative information, for the desired correct information, and it also shows that we are aware of what information we know or do <b>not</b> <b>know.</b> <b>This</b> is why the current debate between the psycholinguistic view of TOTs as retrieval failure and the metacognitive view of TOTs as a tool for learning continues.|$|E
