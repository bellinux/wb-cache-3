2500|$|According to the {{philosophy}} of the NA program, most addicts did not realize they had a problem with drugs until they had none left. Even if other people pointed out they may have a drug problem they were convinced otherwise. But once an addict on his or her own tries to stop and realizes they cannot, they finally see that drugs have been controlling them. Addicts lived to use and used to live. <b>NA</b> <b>helps</b> show them a different way of life and helps them fight their disease. NA describes [...] as a progressive disease with no known cure, which affects every area of an addict's life: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. NA suggests that the disease of addiction can be arrested, and recovery is possible through the NA twelve-step program. The steps never mention drugs or drug use, rather they refer only to addiction, to indicate that addicts have a disease of which drug use is one symptom. Other symptoms include obsession, compulsion, denial, and self-centeredness.|$|R

40|$|A novel avian origin {{influenza}} H 7 N 9 virus {{emerged in}} March 2013 in China and caused severe disease in humans. The high human death rate has caused public health concern and attracted global attention. The influenza viruses have two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neura-minidase (NA), with HA facilitating viral entry into a host cell and <b>NA</b> <b>helping</b> new viral particles leave a host cell to infect more host cells. In {{a previous study}} published in May 2003, we applied computational analysis to the HA sequences of this new virus. Our findings suggested that the HA of this virus had avian type receptors as its primary binding and human types as secondary bind-ing, which was verified by several subsequent wet lab experiments in later months of 2013. We also showed that the human H 7 N 9 and avian H 7 N 9 in China in 2013 shared the same HA receptor binding patterns. The NA protein of this new virus has a stalk deletion {{that is associated with}} virulence and host adaptation. In the present study, we wanted to understand the biological ef-fects of this NA deletion on the HA receptor binding preference of this virus. However, the NA pro-teins of human H 7 N 9 in China in 2013 all carry a stalk deletion so we lack the NA proteins with no stalk deletion as a control.

Unexpected findings were the following: (a) in approximately half of the myocytes, there is a transient outward current composed of two components, one blocked by 4 -aminopyridine and the other by Mn or caffeine; (b) there is clearly a time-dependent outward current (delayed rectifier current) that contributes to repolarization; and (c) the relationship of maximum upstroke velocity of phase 0 to membrane potential is more positive and steeper than that observed in cardiac tissues from Purkinje fibers...|$|R

The building was then coming under sustained shell and machine-gun fire, and heavy casualties were anticipated. The following day the leaders at the GPO decided to negotiate surrender. Pearse asked Cumann na mBan member Elizabeth O'Farrell (a mid-wife at the National Maternity Hospital) to act as a go-between. Under British military supervision she brought Pearse's surrender order to the rebel units still fighting in Dublin.

40|$|Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX; [URL] is {{an ongoing}} {{two-phase}} integrated atmospheric field experiment being performed over North America (NA). Its first phase (INTEX-A) was performed {{in the summer of}} 2004 and the second phase (INTEX-B) is planned for the early spring of 2006. The main goal is to characterize the sources and distribution of gases and aerosols over NA and to understand their transport and transformation on transcontinental/intercontinental scales in order to assess their impact on air quality and climate. Central to achieving this goal is the need to relate space-based observations with those from airborne and surface platforms. During JNTEX-A, NASA s DC- 8 was joined by some dozen other aircraft from a large number of European (U. K., France, and Germany) and North American partners to explore the composition of the troposphere over NA and the Atlantic in a coordinated manner. Global and regional models along with satellite observations were extensively used to plan, coordinate, and implement this field mission. Aircraft were instrumented to measure a comprehensive suite of gases and aerosols utilizing in-situ and remote sensors. The NASA DC- 8 alone was equipped with some 20 instruments capable of measuring species at concentrations as low as 10 (exp - 15) v/v. Measurements included major atmospheric gaseous constituents (O 3, NO(x), HNO 3, HNO 4, PANS, SO 2, VOC/OVOC, CO, and CO 2), free radicals and precursors (OH, HO 2, H 2 O 2, HCHO), aerosols and radiation (microphysics, composition, optical depth, radiative flux), as well as multiple tracers of pollution. Validation of instruments aboard Terra, Aqua, and Envisat satellites was given high priority. Some of the highest pollution levels were present in the upper troposphere due to widespread deep convection. Although unexpected, frequent instances of Asian pollution over NA were encountered during these summer months. The soil uptake of CO 2 over NA was characterized over large regions of <b>NA</b> <b>helping</b> to understand the continents CO 2 -sink potential. DC- 8 sampling of smoke from Alaskan fires and formaldehyde over forested regions, and simultaneous satellite observations of these provided excellent opportunities for the interplay of these platforms. Outflow of pollution from NA was sampled again over the Atlantic after several days to assess its evolution during transport. Models of chemistry and radiation are presently being employed to help in the interpretation of JNTEX-A data. The planning for INTEX-B (spring 2006) is currently underway. First results from INTEX-A and plans for INTEX-B will be discusse...|$|R

The Lan Na troops took positions opposite of an Ayutthayan encampment and sent out three soldiers to infiltrate the invaders {{under the cover of}} darkness. The soldiers untied the Ayutthaya war elephants and cut their tails, sending them into a frenzy; chaos ensued. The Ayutthayans were unable to offer organised resistance to a Lan Na assault on the camp and were forced to retreat. Tilokaraj captured the cities of Phrae and Muong Nan, after successfully employing artillery. Borommarachathirat II failed to capture Chiang Mai in 1442 and was repulsed a second time in 1448. In the latter year Borommatrailokkanat became king of Ayutthaya. He soon created the most advanced military administration in Southeast Asia. In 1451, Sawankhalok broke away from Ayutthaya and joined Lan Na, the conflict between the two kingdoms thus broke out anew. Lan Na forces under Muen Harn Nakorn besieged Chaliang, but a late night counterattack by the defenders repelled the invaders. Ayutthaya captured Chiang Mai in 1452 but was compelled to withdraw after Lan <b>Na</b> received <b>help</b> from the Lao Kingdom of Lan Xang.
