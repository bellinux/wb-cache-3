5000|$|The {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} powdery mildew of hops was once {{considered to be}} Sphaerotheca macularis, which is capable of infecting many plants; however, in recent years, the pathogen that causes powdery mildew of hops has been taxonomically classified as Podosphaera macularis. This ascomycete is only pathogenic on hopplants, including both ornamental and wild hops. The host range of many Podosphaera macularis strains is restricted by the existence of resistant hop varieties, such as the “Nugget” variety of Washington state and Oregon, although in recent years, resistancewithin this hop variety has been overcome in the laboratory. When disease does occur, early symptoms include chlorotic spots on the leaves of hop plants. Spots may fade to gray or white as the season progresses. Signs include white clusters of hyphae, which are often present on the leaves, {{and in some cases}} can infect the cone itself. If this infection occurs, a brown, <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion</b> may develop. Occasionally, chleistothecia are visible as small, black dots on the undersides of leaves.|$|E

We asked whether the prognosis {{was related to the}} extent and location of necrotic lesions on MRI. We investigated 46 radiographically noncollapsed humeral heads in 27 patients, 24 steroid-related and three alcohol-related, using MRI and serial radiographs. The minimum followup was 24  months (mean, 84. 9  months; range, 24 – 166  months). The <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion</b> was typically located at the medial and superior aspect of the humeral head. The necrotic angle, which expressed the extent of the <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion,</b> was measured on midoblique-coronal plane (range; 0 °– 134. 7 °) and on midoblique-sagittal plane (range; 0 °– 150. 6 °).

40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of hepatospecific contrast-enhanced MRI versus triple-phase CT scan after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Methods. Thirty-four consecutive HCC patients (42 hepatic nodules) {{were treated with}} percutaneous RFA and underwent MR and CT scans. All patients were enrolled in a research protocol that included CT with iodized contrast medium injection and MR with hepatospecific contrast medium injection. All patients were restaged within four weeks and at 3 months from ablation. The images were reviewed by four different radiologists to evaluate tumor necrosis, residual or recurrence disease, and evidence of new foci. Results. Thirty-two nodules were necrotic after treatment; 10 showed residual disease. Six new HCCs were identified. At first month followup CT has identified 34 <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions</b> and 8 residual diseases; no new foci were recognized. At MRI instead, 32 complete <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions</b> were identified, 10 lesions showed residual disease, and 2 new HCCs were found. At three months, CT demonstrated 33 completely <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions,</b> 9 residual diseases, and 2 new HCCs. MR showed 31 complete <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions,</b> 11 cases of residual disease, and 6 new HCCs. Conclusions.

40|$|In tobacco cultivars {{resistant}} to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), infection {{results in the}} death of the infected cells accompanying the formation of <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions.</b> To identify the genes involved in this hypersensitive reaction, we isolated the cDNA of tobacco DS 9, the transcript of which decreases before the appearance of <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions.</b> The DS 9 gene encodes a chloroplastic homolog of bacterial FtsH protein, which serves to maintain quality control of some cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. A large quantity of DS 9 protein was found in healthy leaves, whereas the quantity of DS 9 protein in infected leaves decreased before the lesions appeared. In transgenic tobacco plants containing less and more DS 9 protein than wild-type plants, the <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions</b> induced by TMV were smaller and larger, respectively, than those on wild-type plants. These results suggest that a decrease in the level of DS 9 protein in TMV-infected cells, resulting in a subsequent loss of function of the chloroplasts, accelerates the hypersensitive reaction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of {{atypical}} acute retinal necrosis (ARN) observed using ultra-wide-field imaging. Case summary: A 50 -year-old male with recurrent oral ulcer presented with visual loss in his right eye. On the initial visit, slit-lamp examination showed inflammatory cells (3 +) in the anterior chamber and vitreous of the right eye. Funduscopic exami-nation and ultra-wide-field fundus images showed severe occlusive vasculitis with perivascular hemorrhage. No <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion</b> was observed at the peripheral retina in the left eye. Under the impression of Behçet's uveitis, immunosuppressive therapies in-cluding oral steroid, intravenous cyclophosphamide, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha agent and intravitreal triamcinolone were administered, but without improvement. Subsequently, a <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion</b> appeared at the far peripheral retina in the right eye and varicella-zoster virus was identified using the polymerase chain reaction test. After the patient was diagnosed with atyp-ical ARN, intravenous acyclovir was administered, resulting in eventual suppression of the <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion</b> progression. Due to retinal detachment, pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil infusion was performed in the right eye. At that time, a whitish lesion at the far peripheral retina in the ultra-wide-field photography of the fellow eye was found and 3 intravitreal ganciclovir injections were administered. Finally, the whitish lesion regressed after 1 month. Conclusions: Ultra-wide-field imaging might be useful for diagnosis and follow-up of atypical ARN patients...|$|E
40|$|Because {{there is}} no {{consensus}} regarding the factors predicting femoral head collapse in asymptomatic osteonecrosis of the hip, we studied the risk factors for collapse. Between 1990 and 2000, we used MRI to confirm asymptomatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head in 81 patients (81 hips) whose other hip had nontraumatic symptomatic osteonecrosis and we monitored them prospectively. The minimum followup was 5  years (mean, 8. 3  years; range, 5 – 16  years). At the latest followup, 31 hips (38 %) were symptomatic and 26 hips (32 %) had collapsed.

30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} a role of vesicular trafficking in plant cell death. For example, rice spotted leaf 28 (SPL 28) encoding a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit μ 1 (AP 1 M 1), which {{is involved in the}} post-Golgi trafficking pathway (Qiao et al. 2010). The spl 28 mutants displayed a <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion</b> phenotype spontaneously in the absence of pathogen attack. Another example is the discovery of the μ subunit of Arabidopsis adaptor protein- 2 (AP 2 M), mediating clathrin-coated vesicle formation, is also involved in the <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesion</b> formation. An ap 2 m mutant displayed reduced amount of cell death after Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 (Hatsugai et al. 2016). A third example is Arabidopsis enhanced disease resistance 4 (EDR 4) negatively regulating resistance to powdery mildew. The EDR 4 interacts with clathrin heavy chain 2 (CHC 2) (Wu et al. 2015). The edr 4 mutants displayed cell death and reduced endocytosis rates, indicating that clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking is involved in cell deaths. The molecular mechanisms of how these proteins regulate cell death have not yet been elucidated.|$|E

These lesions {{are reminiscent of}} the HR lesions (a type of programmed cell death) that are induced by plant-pathogen interactions and other abiotic stress factors. This type of <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions</b> was also observed when Arabidopsis was treated with other mycotoxins such as Fumonisin B 1 (Stone et al. [2000]) and AAL-toxin (Gechev et al. [2004]). After infiltration of tomato leaves with FA, symptoms of cell death were observed by Evans blue staining (Figure 1) and also by measuring amount of enhanced ROS levels (Figure 4 A, B) {{as well as by}} DNA degradation (Figure 8). We estimated the cell death that occurred 24 h after treatment with 250 μg/ml FA as appearance of <b>necrotic</b> <b>lesions</b> on tomato leaves. At 72 h after the incubation period, more number of leaf cells were strongly and positively stained by Evans blue (Figure 1 F, G). The dead cells were mostly found in the interior of the lesions.|$|R
