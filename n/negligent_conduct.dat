2500|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} {{a pamphlet}} appeared, entitled An Enquiry into the Conduct of Captain Mostyn. It was anonymous, though {{the author was}} probably Admiral Vernon. The author criticised {{the findings of the}} court, accusing them of having been led and coached by Mostyn's powerful cousin the Earl of Winchilsea, and of whitewashing Mostyn's <b>negligent</b> <b>conduct</b> during the chase. Mostyn's supporters quickly published a response, A Vindication of the Conduct of Captain M-N, attributing blame solely to Hampton Courts tendency to roll in heavy swell. Despite this response, public opinion remained against Mostyn and nearly a year after the verdict he was jeered out of Portsmouth Dockyard by workmen and sailors calling out ‘All's well! there's no Frenchman in the way!’ ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} the gradual change that typifies {{evolution}} of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule {{through most of the}} 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in privity of contract. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, Winterbottom v. Wright, the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be [...] "absurd and outrageous consequences" [...] if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the <b>negligent</b> <b>conduct</b> and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classic example}} {{is that of}} a father who gives his child a loaded gun, which she {{carelessly}} drops upon the plaintiff’s foot, causing injury. The plaintiff argues that it is negligent to give a child a loaded gun and that such negligence caused the injury, but this argument fails, for the injury did not result from the risk that made the <b>conduct</b> <b>negligent.</b> The risk that made the <b>conduct</b> <b>negligent</b> was the risk of the child accidentally firing the gun; the harm suffered {{could just as easily have}} resulted from handing the child an unloaded gun.|$|R

However, it was later revealed that the water pressure of the hose used in the experiment was more than ten times that of what had been used {{at the time of the}} incident, and, hence, the DPJ was later forced to apologize.|$|R

The court determined that the auditors owed investors of the company a duty of care, and that the auditors had been <b>negligent</b> in <b>conducting</b> their audit.

40|$|This Note {{asserts that}} courts should {{continue}} to apply the traditional maritime rescue doctrine along with its “wanton or reckless” standard when assessing whether a rescuer injured during a maritime rescue attempt stemming from a <b>negligent</b> tortfeasor’s <b>conduct</b> may recover {{for his or her}} injuries. Part I will analyze the arc of rescue doctrine–related case law surrounding the aforementioned circuit split, scrutinizing how the rescue doctrine has been impacted by the larger-scale paradigm shift in apportioning liability from contributory negligence to comparative negligence. Part II will discuss the circuit split directly and argue that in light of admiralty law’s historical and statutory commitment to encouraging nearby seafarers to aid those in peril despite no broad, universal tort law duty to rescue, it is consistent and appropriate to preserve the traditional maritime rescue doctrine. Finally, Part III will discuss important policy considerations favoring a “wanton or reckless” standard of care in the maritime rescue context, including both incentivizing life-saving rescue attempts and properly allocating costs under principles of law and economics...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board, Mr. Hill was charged with ten counts of robbery, however, he was soon acquitted of all charges. After the charges were dropped, he then sued Hamilton's police service {{as well as some}} of the {{officers}} who were involved in his arrest. Hill argued that the police were <b>negligent</b> in <b>conducting</b> a thorough investigation because the police officers did not properly interview the witnesses, which ultimately led to his arrest. Hill's lawsuit was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada because there was not enough evidence to support Hill's findings that the police were negligent in their duty or standard of care. What is important to note about this particular trial is that three out of the nine Supreme Court Judges did not view the negligent tort claim as being lawful or practical because a strict duty of care towards suspects would therefore interfere with how the police operate in terms of apprehending offenders and investigating crimes.|$|R
50|$|In R v Victor, the {{appellant}} {{knew that}} he was prone to epileptic fits—he had been since the age of fourteen or fifteen—but nevertheless drove a motor car, against medical advice. One day, he suffered a fit while driving and collided with a pedestrian and another car. Someone was badly hurt. He was charged with and convicted of reckless or negligent driving—not because he was epileptic, but because he had chosen to drive when a reasonable person would have foreseen the likelihood of a fit and its consequences. He should not in the circumstances have driven at all. Even though his conduct was involuntary {{at the time of the}} accident, he could not use his disability to escape liability. He was convicted on the basis of his <b>negligent</b> prior voluntary <b>conduct.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fire {{will not}} be denied its {{opportunity}} to burn through Florida’s forests. The citizens of Florida, however, can accept the responsibility of deciding how the forest will burn. Fire can be purposefully ignited under exact weather conditions, acting as a controlled but dangerous servant with a slim chance of escape or harm. Or, if Floridians refuse to accept any responsibility in proactively managing forest fire, nature will determine when the forest will burn. The fire will be a fearful master, raging through the forest {{with the potential to}} cause great harm to people, property, and the environment. In recognition of the important role that the intentional use of fire has in reducing wildfire hazard, not to mention its important ecological and economic functions, the Florida legislature enacted laws protecting fire practitioners from liability. These laws protect practitioners from liability {{as long as they are}} not grossly <b>negligent</b> in <b>conducting</b> the fire and meet certain requirements. Although this law is extremely important to fire practitioners, it can be interpreted as providing no protection if a legally set fire unexpectedly escapes and causes harm. This has the effect of discouraging landowners from conducting fire operations. This Note argues that, in order to encourage the men and women who are willing to accept the challenge of using intentional fire to reduce wildfire risk, the prescribed fire statute should be amended...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{traditional}} view that parties involved in commercial negotiations are entitled to keep their cards close to their chest. Such a view holds that, {{in the absence of}} any fiduciary relationship or obligations of utmost good faith, parties are entitled to operate on the basis of advancing their own interests. They are free to conduct investigations to determine and verify legal, accounting and general business information. Any other matters are generally seen to be at the risk of the parties. But while this view is often expressed by the courts, negotiating parties and their lawyers need to be aware of the extent to which it is under challenge from developments in the law relating to matters such as misleading and deceptive <b>conduct,</b> <b>negligent</b> misstatement, equitable estoppel, unconscionable conduct, and even the rules on professional ethics. The paper will review recent case law in each of these areas to determine the extent to which parties may be liable for non-disclosure of information during commercial negotiations.

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his {{activities}} from then until early 545, by which time he was the garrison commander of Rome. Along with the general Conon {{he was responsible for}} the city's defence during the siege by Totila in 546. During the siege he restricted himself to passive defence, refusing to sally forth from the walls even when Belisarius, who had returned from the east and landed with reinforcements at the nearby Portus Romanus, ordered him to do so. As a result, Belisarius' attempts to succour the beleaguered city failed. Procopius heavily criticizes Bessas for his conduct during the siege. He neglected of the civilian population of the city and enriched himself by selling the starving populace the grain he had hoarded at exorbitant prices. The civilians were so exhausted by famine that when he finally allowed those who wanted to leave the city to do so, many simply died on the wayside, while others were killed by the Goths. Finally, he proved <b>negligent</b> in the <b>conduct</b> of the defence, and allowed security measures to grow lax: guards slept at their posts, and patrols were discontinued. This allowed four Isaurian soldiers to contact Totila, and on 17 December 546, the city was betrayed to the Goths. Bessas managed to escape with the greater part of the garrison, but the treasure that he had amassed was left behind for the Goths to enjoy. Following his dismal performance in Italy, Bessas was apparently recalled to Constantinople.|$|R

40|$|The {{world is}} seeing more {{maritime}} disasters every year, {{in a variety}} of jurisdictions around the world. Many of these disasters cause a large number of deaths. As a result of those deaths, there is often pressure on the relevant authorities to prosecute the parties responsible. The master of the vessel may be the most obvious party to charge, but there may have been other parties responsible for the operation and management of the vessel whose <b>negligent</b> or reckless <b>conduct</b> contributed to the vessel’s demise. Despite the contributions of other parties, the master of a vessel may become a scapegoat, and, as a result, bear the brunt of any prosecution. There are several reasons why the master may receive the most blame in these situations. One of those may be that the law in force within the relevant jurisdiction does not provide particular criminal charges that apply to parties other than the master. This paper asks whether Australian law encourages prosecuting bodies to scapegoat the master of a vessel and whether this is demonstrative of the wider problem of seafarer criminalisation worldwide. Criminal law will be fit for its intended purpose if it provides prosecuting authorities with the means to prosecute those truly responsible for damage caused, and to prosecute those parties in an appropriate manner. In 2012, the Australian government spearheaded sweeping changes to domestic maritime law. Those changes brought several new criminal charges relevant to maritime disasters causing death, and amended previous charges. This paper looks to the law in Australia applicable to maritime disasters causing death and asks whether the laws are fit for their intended purpose. The research conducted is doctrinal, focussing particularly on the Navigation Act 2012 (Cth), the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 (Cth), and the Crimes at Sea Act 2000 (Cth) ...|$|R
