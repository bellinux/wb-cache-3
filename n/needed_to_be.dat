The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the gutters) <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced; and the stained glass windows <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.|$|E

Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cut down to protect roads and buildings.
