5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming <b>not</b> <b>down</b> the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|Following WrestleMania XX, Sable {{quickly turned}} heel again {{and engaged in}} another short feud with Torrie Wilson. The feud culminated at The Great American Bash, where Sable {{defeated}} Wilson despite the referee not noticing that one of Wilson's shoulders were <b>not</b> <b>down.</b> On the edition of July 1 of SmackDown, Sable was defeated by Wilson in a rematch. Sable's final appearance in WWE was on SmackDown! when she, Dawn Marie, and Wilson accompanied Eddie Guerrero to the ring in his lowrider. On August 10, 2004, WWE's official website announced that Sable and WWE had parted ways, this time on good terms. Lesnar claimed that she left the company {{to spend more time}} with her family.|$|E

However, the rider should not shift weight so much that he or she becomes unbalanced or has the heels come up.|$|E
25|$|Friedrich Röth served {{originally}} in {{an artillery}} regiment. He was seriously wounded {{early in the}} war. Once he was again fit for duty, he was commissioned, in May 1915. He transferred to the aerial service, only to be severely injured in a crash. Because of his extended recuperation, he did not win his wings until early 1917. His initial assignment was to a Bavarian artillery spotting unit, FA(A) 296. At some point, he served in Jagdstaffel 34, but did <b>not</b> <b>down</b> any enemies until {{he was assigned to}} Jagdstaffel 23.|$|E

25|$|Then the swimmer shrugs their {{shoulders}} and throws their arms and shoulders forward, lunging cat-like {{back into the water}} (though the emphasis is to go forward, <b>not</b> <b>down).</b> As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kicks. Timing is very important in order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the gluteus maximus to prevent the legs and feet from rising out of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.|$|E
25|$|After the game, the Atlantic Coast Conference {{announced}} that the officials had erred and that the final touchdown should not have counted. According to the ACC, the officiating crew had committed three crucial mistakes: 1) they had incorrectly ruled that Walton was <b>not</b> <b>down</b> on the fourth lateral (though it's unclear whether any video footage that clearly showed Walton's knee hitting the turf was available to the replay official), 2) they reversed the flag they had thrown based on their review of the video footage, which cannot be used to overturn penalties, and 3) they missed a couple of crucial penalties against the Hurricanes involving an illegal block on the back deep in their own territory and illegal participation against one of their bench players without a helmet for entering the playing field before Elder crossed the end zone. Although {{the outcome of the}} game could not be changed, the ACC suspended the entire officiating crew for two games.|$|E
25|$|As the runner-up of {{previous}} World T20 competition, Sri Lanka went Bangladesh under the captaincy of Dinesh Chandimal to 2014 ICC World Twenty20. In the group stage at Super 10 stage, they played with South Africa, New Zealand, England, and Netherlands. In the first match, Sri Lanka played with South Africa. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first. They {{had a good}} understanding about Bangladeshi pitches, due to Bangladesh bilateral tournament and 2014 Asia Cup, which was held prior to the World T20 at the same site. Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera reminded all sorts of aggressive shots by legendary Sanath Jayasuriya. Kusal's master stroke was a photocopy of Jayasuriya and he devastated Dale Steyn, Morné Morkel, and Lonwabo Tsotsobe. He scored 61 runs off 40 balls giving Sri Lanka a total of 165/7. South Africans was <b>not</b> <b>down</b> as yet, where they progressively built the innings. With the wickets in crucial intervals, they {{ended up in the}} losing side with 5 runs short. Kusal was the Man-of-the-Match.|$|E

25|$|After he left school, {{he passed}} the {{entrance}} exam to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and, in 1909, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. He was a tall, fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up <b>not</b> <b>down,</b> and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look out for me. We got on together very well; he danced splendidly and I danced again several more times with him. I enjoyed the evening thoroughly.|$|E
25|$|After a while, {{however, the}} nWo began to fight within its ranks, with Hogan and Nash battling for control. The {{situation}} {{came to a}} head on April 20, 1998, during a match between Hogan and recent nWo inductee (and rival) Randy Savage for Savage's recently won WCW World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Nash interfered on Savage's behalf and jackknifed Hogan to the mat, signaling the breakup of the nWo into two separate factions (Nash's interference was not enough to prevent Hogan from regaining his championship, thanks to Bret Hart's interference shortly thereafter). Nash became the leader of nWo Wolfpac, alongside Savage, Curt Hennig, and Konnan. Hennig, however, shortly thereafter defected over to Hogan's nWo Hollywood faction. Then, during a match between Hall, Nash, Sting and The Giant (who had recently rejoined the nWo after being kicked out two years prior), Hall turned on Nash by hitting him with his tag team title belt and leaving the ring. The Wolfpac, however, was <b>not</b> <b>down</b> for long as Lex Luger joined Nash's team. Sting would eventually become a member as well, after being recruited heavily by both sides towards the middle of 1998. After Sting won Giant's half of the tag team title at the Great American Bash that June, Nash became Sting's partner. They defended the championship until July 20, when they were defeated by Hall and The Giant. Nash then set his sights on his former partner, and the rivalry {{came to a head}} at Halloween Havoc on October 25. During the course of the match, Nash jackknifed Hall twice but, instead of pinning him, left the ring and lost via countout. Shortly after the match, Nash became WCW's new booker.|$|E

500|$|Delorentos' {{third album}} was {{released}} on 27 January 2012. It had been recorded over the summer of 2011 with producer Rob Kirwan in Grouse Lodge studios, Westmeath and Exchequer Studios Dublin. The album was different as Kirwan insisted on two weeks' Pre-production beforehand, something the band had <b>not</b> <b>down</b> before. The record was recorded over three months with engineer Colin Murphy, and Cenzo Townsend additionally mixing a number of tracks. The first single from the record, [...] "Did we ever really Try" [...] was released in October 2011 with an accompanying EP Magazine - written by the band with contributions from other artists and musicians. It reached number 10 on the charts, despite not being available in record stores, only the band's own [...] "pop-up stores".|$|E

Farther to the east, I-70 departs the US6 corridor, which {{continues}} to follow Clear Creek through a narrow, curving gorge. The interstate, however, follows the corridor of US40 out of the canyon. The highway crests a small mountain near Genesee Park to descend into Mount Vernon Canyon to exit the Rocky Mountains. This portion features grade-warning signs with unusual messages, such as [...] "Trucks: Don't be fooled," [...] "Truckers, you are <b>not</b> <b>down</b> yet," [...] and [...] "Are your brakes adjusted and cool?"

[...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's <b>not</b> <b>down</b> to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani, Joe Levy of Billboard, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone each {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars. Cinquemani {{wrote that the}} album was [...] "all over the map", yet felt it was [...] "a {{surprisingly}} coherent one". Levy wrote that the album was [...] "subtle" [...] compared to [...] "current standards", adding that: [...] "These songs unfold slowly, building through foreplay-like intros before hooks are displayed over a shifting series of textures". Ganz felt that Rebel Heart [...] "is at its strongest when Madonna shoves everyone {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight", and added: [...] "Deep down, Madonna does have a rebel heart– and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Jamieson Cox of Time commended the album for its consistent production and sound, and for Madonna's vocals and songwriting. Giving it a rating of [...] "B", Kyle Anderson and Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly called the album [...] "Madonna's best outing since 2000's Music". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian and Time Out writer Nick Levine gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. Petridis felt that the two contrasting sides of the album did not [...] "quite gel", reasoning that: [...] "the former might represent the music Madonna wants to make, while the latter is the music she feels obliged to make". Levine wrote: [...] "'Rebel Heart' may lack cohesion, but she's definitely <b>not</b> <b>down</b> for the count: this contains some of the best music Madonna's made in a decade".|$|E
500|$|Richard Fogle {{responded to}} the {{critical}} attack on Keats's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod, Gerard, and others in 1953. His argument was similar to Brooks: that the poem was thematically coherent {{and that there is}} a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem. As such, Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination. Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis: [...] "I find Mr. Leavis too austere, but he points out a quality which Keats plainly sought for. His profusion and prodigality is, however, modified by a principle of sobriety." [...] It is possible that Fogle's statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability. Wasserman, following in 1953, claimed that [...] "Of all Keats' poems, it is probably the 'Ode to a Nightingale' that has most tormented the critic [...] in any reading of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' the turmoil will <b>not</b> <b>down.</b> Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in 'a wild Abyss'". He then explained, [...] "It is this turbulence, I suspect, that has led Allen Tate to believe the ode 'at least tries to say everything that poetry can say.' But I propose it is the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' that succeeds in saying what poetry can say, and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet can." ...|$|E
