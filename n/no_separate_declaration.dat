500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. <b>No</b> <b>separate</b> <b>declaration</b> of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
