25|$|The rebels {{realized}} {{that the people in}} Mecca supported the defense offered by Uthman and were <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> to listen to them. That was a great psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.|$|E
25|$|The {{concert was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears–San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith Palmer, {{attributed}} {{her love of}} the episode to Craig Robinson, because the two shared an enjoyment of singing together ever since the first season episode [...] "Basketball". She explained, [...] "We sing on the set and in the hair and makeup trailer. We sound good together, but sometimes people are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> to hear our amazing duets, mostly from the '80s." [...] Flannery believed that Robinson's performance in the episode was [...] "very funny," [...] as his character served as a [...] "great foil for Michael Scott." [...] "The Negotiation" [...] featured the return of character Andy Bernard, who had last {{been seen in the}} episode [...] "The Return", as he was attending anger management classes. At the time [...] "The Return" [...] aired, no one was certain Helms would be returning, but in early February, NBC confirmed Helms had been hired on as a series regular {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode 7.7 out of 10, praising the plot and the {{introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticizing the amount of humor and MCU references. David Sims of The A.V. Club scored the episode a 'B', calling it [...] "the first episode to show some potential for originality around the corner". He praised the character development, specifically for Coulson and Skye, {{and the introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticized Quinn as [...] "barely a step above a generic Miami Vice villain and whose motives would be totally uninteresting if they were ever made clear to us". He also found Dalton to be [...] "the latest in a line of dull Whedon hunks with just a glimmer of personality." [...] The Guardians Graeme Virtue felt that [...] "If Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been levitating your boat so far, this breezy episode probably didn't do that much to change your mind. If you're <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood,</b> the endless quipping can seem exhausting, but at least there was some incremental character development." [...] He had especial praise for the introduction of Hall/Graviton, and felt that Hart's performance as the character topped Samuel L. Jackson's cameo from the previous episode.|$|E
500|$|But {{there is}} some {{opposition}} {{to the idea of}} an empowered global parliament. A 2007 BBC poll of approximately 12,000 respondents asked, [...] "How likely would you be to support a Global Parliament, where votes are based on country population sizes, and the global parliament is able to make binding policies?" [...] Of those polled, 19.1% responded [...] "Very unlikely–it is a bad idea"; 14.9% responded [...] "Quite unlikely–but it might work"; 23.1% said [...] "Quite likely–but with reservations"; and 14.4% said [...] "Very likely–it is a good idea". The poll was broken out by country, and the U.S. and Australia showed the strongest opposition. Potential challenge to the UNPA are political organizations such as the U.S. Constitution Party, and politicians such as 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul, which favor withdrawal from the United Nations and other multilateral organizations altogether due to sovereignty concerns. Canadian Action Party leader Connie Fogal also opposes the UNPA, saying, [...] "It is very revealing to see the NDP and the Greens as part of and promoting this...Further, the European assembly {{has proven to be a}} rubber stamping mechanism of bureaucratic decisions. This is not democracy." [...] In addition, a Civicus article warns, [...] "With an unexpected backlash against civil society in the offing (despite the good efforts of the UN General Assembly President, Jan Eliasson, to reverse the trend), citizen participation at the UN is diminishing quickly. It would be safe to assume that Member States as a whole are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> to consider a Parliamentary Assembly at this time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lucius sent Fronto few {{messages}} at {{the beginning}} of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: [...] "not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy". Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night. One reason for Lucius' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius' presentation of terms was seen as cowardice. The Parthians were <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> for peace.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the reasons for missing classes as well as the relationship between students’ personality traits and tendency to miss classes for different reasons. The first part of the study describes the development of a self-report measure of reasons for missing classes in college. Reasons included <b>not</b> being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood,</b> personal issues, health issues, lecture issues and no negative consequences. Results showed that personality traits, especially conscientiousness, play significant role in students’ tendency to skip classes. Since previous research have shown positive relationship between class attendance and college grades, policies aimed at increasing attendance might be worth considering...|$|R
50|$|Even {{when there}} is no {{immediate}} error, a higher-level stance can simply fail to be useful. If we were to try to understand the thermostat {{at the level of the}} intentional stance, ascribing to it beliefs about how hot it is and a desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no traction over the problem as compared to staying at the design stance, but we would generate theoretical commitments that expose us to absurdities, such as the possibility of <b>the</b> thermostat <b>not</b> being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> to work today because the weather is so nice. Whether to take a particular stance, then, is determined by how successful that stance is when applied.|$|R
