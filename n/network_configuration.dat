25|$|DHCP is used {{to provide}} the {{appropriate}} client network parameters and specifically the location (IP address) of the TFTP server hosting, ready for download, the initial bootstrap program (NBP) and complementary files. To initiate a PXE bootstrap session the DHCP component of the client's PXE firmware broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet containing PXE-specific options to port 67/UDP (DHCP server port); it asks for the required <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> and network booting parameters. The PXE-specific options identify the initiated DHCP transaction as a PXE transaction. Standard DHCP servers (non PXE enabled) {{will be able to}} answer with a regular DHCPOFFER carrying networking information (i.e. IP address) but not the PXE specific parameters. A PXE client {{will not be able to}} boot if it only receives an answer from a non PXE enabled DHCP server.|$|E
500|$|The first Argentine railway, a ten-kilometre road, {{had been}} built in 1854. By 1885, a total of [...] of {{railways}} were open for traffic. The new railways brought livestock to Buenos Aires from the vast pampas, for slaughter and processing in the (mainly English) meat-packing plants, and then for shipment around the world. Some contemporary analysts lamented the export bias of the <b>network</b> <b>configuration,</b> while opposing the [...] "monopoly" [...] of private British companies on nationalist grounds.

Bidders {{can neither}} propose different <b>network</b> <b>configurations</b> nor can they submit bids {{on a group}} of network links. We believe the market itself can be designed better. We present a lot structure and an auction design where bidders might propose and build different <b>network</b> <b>configurations</b> and where bidding for packages is a possibility. We demonstrate why the auction design in this paper should be considered for future network procurement exercises through an example, inspired by UK offshore electricity transmission assets, to illustrate our idea...|$|R

[...] It helps to identify if there are too many routers between two CobraNet devices, if a certain latency is possible given the <b>network</b> <b>configuration,</b> and other tasks. [...] However, Cirrus Logic does not provide software to manipulate their hardware. [...] In fact, in the simplest of cases, no software is required by the end user. [...] For instance, a simple breakout box which converts a CobraNet signal to eight analog audio signals would require little or no configuration by the end user apart from possibly selecting the bundle number. [...] If configuration is required (for example, in a DSP box with integrated CobraNet I/O), then the manufacturer of the device typically supplies proprietary software for that purpose.|$|E

40|$|As {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{have been}} applied across a spectrum of application domains, the problem of source location privacy (SLP) {{has emerged as a}} significant issue, particularly in safety-critical situations. In seminal work on SLP, phantom routing was proposed as an approach to addressing the issue. However, results presented in support of phantom routing have not included considerations for practical <b>network</b> <b>configurations,</b> omitting simulations and analyses with larger network sizes. This paper addresses this shortcoming by conducting an in-depth investigation of phantom routing under various <b>network</b> <b>configurations.</b> The results presented demonstrate that previous work in phantom routing does not generalise well to different <b>network</b> <b>configurations.</b> Specifically, under certain configurations, it is shown that the afforded SLP is reduced by a factor of up to 75. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{scholars}} are advocating {{a better understanding of}} how value is created in business networks, rather than merely in business relationships or at the level of single actors. Among such networks, innovation networks, i. e. the configurations of strategic entrepreneurial nets aimed at improving the effectiveness of innovation performance, have come under scrutiny in the business marketing literature. However, research that explicitly connects value considerations with innovation <b>network</b> <b>configurations</b> is still in its infancy, with empirical evidence being notably scarce. This study is aimed at identifying if and how <b>network</b> <b>configurations</b> affect value constellation aspects in business networks, in terms of value recipients and value outcomes. We interviewed key informants representing 46 high-technology entrepreneurial firms co-located in an innovation network (Daresbury Science and Technology Park - UK). Our study identifies that different <b>network</b> <b>configurations</b> can co-exist in the same overall network; these, nevertheless, are not alternative independent structures, but rather they interact with each other through actors spanning their boundaries. Our study thus provides an understanding of <b>network</b> <b>configurations</b> relating to specific value consequences, but also provides evidence relating to the interactions between different configurations. By doing this, we establish a bridge between a business marketing and a strategy perspective on value in networks. Important managerial implications and implications for policy makers also emerge from our study...|$|R
