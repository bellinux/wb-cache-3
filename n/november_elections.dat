5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful. The {{election}} {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters that April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the <b>November</b> <b>elections,</b> Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E

25|$|President Zelaya was {{promoting}} a controversial nonbinding poll {{on whether to}} include a fourth ballot box in the <b>November</b> <b>elections</b> on convening a constitutional convention to rewrite the constitution.

25|$|In 2004, 15 lawmakers, all Republican, spoke.

Toomey of Pennsylvania. Tiahrt, who also spoke at the 30th annual march, urged marchers to “help pro-lifers in your state”; Toomey supported these remarks, saying to vote for pro-life candidates in order to reclaim the Senate and, in turn, the courts.|$|E

25|$|Joseph R. Hawley of New Haven {{commanded}} a {{division in the}} Army of the Potomac during the Siege of Petersburg and was promoted in September 1864 to brigadier general.

Other Union generals with Connecticut roots included Henry W. Benham of Meriden, Luther P. Bradley of New Haven, William T. Clark of Norwich, Orris S. Ferry of Bethel, and Alpheus S.

25|$|Following {{his victory}} in the Northern Virginia Campaign, Lee moved north with 55,000 men through the Shenandoah Valley {{starting}} on September 4, 1862. His objective was to resupply his army outside of the war-torn Virginia theater and to damage Northern morale {{in anticipation of the}} <b>November</b> <b>elections.</b> He undertook the risky maneuver of splitting his army so that he could continue north into Maryland while simultaneously capturing the Federal garrison and arsenal at Harpers Ferry. McClellan accidentally found a copy of Lee's orders to his subordinate commanders and planned to isolate and defeat the separated portions of Lee's army.|$|E
25|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations with}} the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the compromise bill passed both Houses of Congress on Friday, September 29, 2006, just before the 109th Congress adjourned for the <b>November</b> <b>elections.</b> Hutchison led the effort to pass the bill in the Senate while Rep. Kay Granger led a bipartisan Texas House coalition to see the bill through to a successful conclusion in the House. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on October 13, 2006, including the 20-gate cap. Southwest and American airlines then required approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to begin one-stop flights from Love Field to destinations outside the Wright limits.|$|E

25|$|Carter {{nominated}} Truesdale {{for a full}} {{five-year term}} on the Board on August 5, 1980. But Senate Republicans, convinced Truesdale was excessively pro-labor, sought to delay his confirmation until after the <b>November</b> <b>elections</b> (which Republican Ronald Reagan was expected to win). The Republicans announced in mid-August that they would filibuster Truesdale's appointment. By mid-September, Senate Republicans had adopted a much-enlarged strategy to bottle up large numbers of Carter appointees who {{would be able to}} serve past the end of the presidential term. On October 23, 1980, President Carter used his recess appointment powers to appoint Truesdale to the NLRB once again. Truesdale's recess appointment was effective only until Congress came back into session.|$|E
25|$|The CRNC {{is one of}} {{the leading}} 527 groups in the United States, and {{provides}} field support for Republican and conservative causes nationwide. During Howell's tenure, the CRNC coordinated a large deployment of student volunteers to Virginia, for the 2009 gubernatorial election in support of Bob McDonnell (as well as his running mates Bill Bolling and Ken Cuccinelli). The field program also assisted with the other major general-election effort that year, for New Jersey gubernatorial nominee Chris Christie. After Republican victories in both of those bellwether races, Howell's administration targeted the Fall 2010 CRNC field program towards specific states, which they believed contained the greatest potential for state-level and congressional gains, in the <b>November</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2006, the LA Times {{reported}} that {{a federal grand jury}} had subpoenaed Weldon's congressional records prior to the <b>November</b> <b>elections.</b> Because a member must notify House leadership promptly if they receive subpoenas while the House is in session to be entered into the Congressional Record, Weldon may have violated House rules depending on when he received the subpoenas. On July 17, 2007, The Washington Post {{reported that}}, as of Spring 2007, federal investigators were continuing to examine Weldon's official actions taken on behalf of his daughter's lobbying clients. The same article noted that Weldon had spent at least $30,000 in legal fees and related investigatory expenses {{as a result of the}} probe.|$|E

In June 2009, Stand for Marriage Maine, the coalition group leading the veto effort, announced it had hired Schubert Flint Public Affairs, which had worked on the Proposition 8 effort in California, to handle public relations for the veto effort. In July 2009, No on 1/Protect Maine Equality was formed to oppose the veto. On September 2, 2009, the Secretary of State of Maine verified that the opponents had submitted a sufficient number of valid signatures and certified the ballot question for November.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2004, Bush {{announced}} a Vision for Space Exploration, {{calling for the}} completion of the International Space Station by 2010 and the retirement of the space shuttle while developing a new spacecraft called the Crew Exploration Vehicle under the title Project Constellation. The CEV would be used to return American astronauts to the Moon by 2018, with the objective of establishing a permanent lunar base, and eventually sending future manned missions to Mars. To this end, the plan proposes that NASA's budget increase by five percent every year until it is capped at US$18 billion in 2008, with only inflationary increases thereafter. The planned retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2010 after the ISS is completed is also expected to free up US$5 billion to US$6 billion a year. The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign. Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the <b>November</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|E
25|$|King Alexander died {{of blood}} {{poisoning}} {{caused by a}} monkey bite, {{two months after the}} signing of the treaty, on 25 October 1920. His death revived the constitutional question of whether Greece should be a monarchy or a republic and transformed the <b>November</b> <b>elections</b> into a contest between Venizelos and the return of the exiled king Constantine, Alexander's father. In the elections anti-Venizelists, most of them supporters of Constantine, secured 246 out of 370 seats. The defeat came as a surprise to most people and Venizelos failed even to get elected as an MP. Venizelos himself attributed this to the war-weariness of the Greek people that had been under arms with almost no intermission since 1912. Venizelists believed that the promise of demobilization and withdrawal from Asia Minor was the most potent weapon of opposition. Abuse of power by Venizelists in the period of 1917–1920 and prosecution of their adversaries were also a further cause for people to vote in favor of the opposition. Thus, on 6 December 1920, King Constantine was recalled by a plebiscite. This caused great dissatisfaction not only to the newly liberated populations in Asia Minor but also to the Great Powers who opposed the return of Constantine. As a result of his defeat Venizelos left for Paris and withdrew from politics.|$|E
