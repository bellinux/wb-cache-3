40|$|Abstract. Moving vehicle {{will produce}} dynamic {{excitation}} {{and can be}} categorized {{in the study of}} noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). Studies of NVH can resolve issues {{associated with the use of}} a vehicle comfort. Exposure to some level of noise and vibration can be classified as a danger to vehicle passengers if they are exposed in a standard eight-hour time period. Therefore NVH aspect is the most important aspect in selecting a military vehicle other than the factor of safety, reliability, fuel consumption and maintenance costs. This study was carried out on Malaysian Army (MA) 3 -tonne truck drivers who are exposed to noise and vibration produced by the truck. Vibration exposure at seat, steering wheel and body floor was measured using tri-axial and single axis accelerometers which were connected to a Brüel & Kjær Type 3649 vibration analyser, while noise exposure was measured at the driver’s ear position using a DuO smart <b>noise</b> <b>monitor.</b> From the results obtained, both vibration and noise pressure levels increased proportionally with the increasing speed of the truck.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the effect of an {{electronic}} noise-monitoring device (NoiseSign) at reducing noise levels in quiet study areas in an academic library. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys and decibel-level measurements were used to measure the perceived and objective noise levels, respectively, in both an intervention and a control area of two major branch libraries. Patrons’ perception of noise was measured with a passive paper and online survey, which asked patrons to rate the current noise level and their desired noise level. The actual noise measurements were collected twice a day with a hand-held decibel reader for 60 seconds and then corroborated after the intervention with automatically logged decibel readings from the <b>noise</b> <b>monitor</b> device in the two intervention areas. The authors conducted one-way ANOVA’s to determine if the results were significant. Findings: The NoiseSign had no statistically significant effect on either actual noise levels or user perceptions of noise in the library. The surveys comments and anecdotal observation of the spaces while doing measurements did reveal that noise in the quiet study areas was not the primary source of complaints. Originality/value: In spite of many proposed solutions to reducing noise in libraries, there has been very little research in this area.

40|$|As {{part of the}} 200 -PO- 1 Phase I {{geophysical}} surveys, Fugro Airborne Surveys was {{contracted to}} collect airborne electromagnetic (EM) and magnetic surveys of the Hanford Site 600 Area. Two helicopter survey systems were used with the HeliGEOTEM{reg_sign} time domain portion flown between June 19 th and June 20 th, 2008, and the RESOLVE{reg_sign} frequency domain portion was flown from June 29 th to July 1 st, 2008. Magnetic data were acquired contemporaneously with the electromagnetic surveys using a total-field cesium vapor magnetometer. Approximately 925 line kilometers (km) were flown using the HeliGEOTEM{reg_sign} II system and 412 line kilometers were flown using the RESOLVE{reg_sign} system. The HeliGEOTEM system has an effective penetration of roughly 250 meters {{into the ground and}} the RESOLVE system has an effective penetration of roughly 60 meters. Acquisition parameters and preliminary results are provided in SGW- 39674, Airborne Electromagnetic Survey Report, 200 -PO- 1 Groundwater Operable Unit, 600 Area, Hanford Site. Airborne data are interpreted in this report in an attempt to identify areas of likely preferential groundwater flow within the aquifer system based on the presence of paleochannels or fault zones. The premise for the interpretation is that coarser-grained intervals have filled in scour channels created by episodic catastrophic flood events during the late Pleistocene. The interpretation strategy used the magnetic field anomaly data and existing bedrock maps to identify likely fault or lineament zones. Combined analysis of the magnetic, 60 -Hz <b>noise</b> <b>monitor,</b> and flight-altitude (radar) data were used to identify zones where EM response is more likely due to cultural interference and or bedrock structures. Cross-sectional and map view presentations of the EM data were used to identify more electrically resistive zones that likely correlate with coarser-grained intervals. The resulting interpretation identifies one major northwest-southeast trending preferential flowpath with several minor units running along a similar trend. This presumed path of preferential flow is compared with the tritium concentration levels observed for the 600 Area. Analysis of the magnetic field data shows the location of potential bedrock faults and lineaments which may influence the horizontal and vertical flow of water. Faults lying within, or in the vicinity of preferential groundwater flow paths may allow flow into or out of the otherwise confined basalt layers...|$|E

Clinically, air conduction thresholds inside and outside the sound booth, corresponded within 5 dB or less > 90 % of instances (mean absolute difference 3. 3 ± 3. 2 SD).

40|$|INTRODUCTION Actual <b>noise</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{systems have}} the {{shortcoming}} {{that although the}} intensity, duration, and time of occurrence of noises can be recorded, their source often cannot be identified.

DESIGN : The investigation comprised three studies. Study 1 evaluated calibration accuracy across four Samsung S 5301 smartphones (Android v 4. 0. 4) using commercial Sennheiser HD 202 headphones. Study 2 involved referencing smartphone microphone sensitivity to narrowband noise intensity as measured in octave bands by a sound-level meter between 30 and 75 dB SPL (5 dB increments). Study 3 compared screening outcomes of smartphone based and conventional hearing screening. STUDY SAMPLE : Study 2 : 15 normal-hearing subjects (age range, 18 – 22 years; all female). Study 3 : 162 children (324 ears) aged 5 to 7 years. RESULTS : Smartphone calibration at 20, 30, and 40 dB was within 1 dB of recommended reference equivalent thresholds levels.
