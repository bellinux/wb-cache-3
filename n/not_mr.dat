500|$|From his {{relationship}} with Connie, Sam moved on to a love triangle storyline with Ward Sisters Faye Morton and Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is <b>not</b> <b>Mr</b> Right, simply Mr Right Now. [...] But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Once his deception was uncovered, Sam attempted to salvage his romantic relationship with Chrissie, but was unsuccessful. For some weeks thereafter, Sam engaged in casual sexual relationships with Senior house officer Maddy Young and Staff Nurse Zoe Foxe. These were, however, stymied by the discovery he had cancer.|$|E
500|$|On September 17, 2003 Judge George Greer {{denied the}} petition, and wrote that [...] "the Petition {{is an attempt}} by Mr. and Mrs. Schindler to re-litigate the entire case. It {{is not even a}} veiled or {{disguised}} attempt. The exhibits relied upon by them clearly demonstrate this to be true." [...] Regarding (Nurse) Iyer's statements, Greer wrote that they were [...] "incredible to say the least" [...] and that [...] "Ms. Iyer details what amounts to a 15-month cover-up April 1995 through July 1996 which include the staff of Palm Garden of Largo Convalescent Center, the Guardian of the Person, the guardian ad litem, the medical professionals, the police and, believe it or <b>not,</b> <b>Mr.</b> and Mrs. Schindler... It is impossible to believe that Mr. and Mrs. Schindler would not have subpoenaed Ms. Iyer for the January 2000 evidentiary hearing had Iyer contacted them in 1996 as her affidavit alleges".|$|E

500|$|In the {{flashback}} episode [...] "What Lies Beneath", exploring Faye's {{decision to}} move to Holby, she is seen to fight with her husband James, then later step over his dead body on the stairs. Kensit explained: [...] "there's a scuffle and he pins her {{against the wall and}} practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It's the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves. It turns out similar things have happened before." [...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is <b>not</b> <b>Mr</b> Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of Bram Stoker's Dracula, after a news story about several vampire attacks, Lisa begins to suspect that Mr. Burns is a vampire, {{but the rest of}} the family dismisses her concerns. The family is invited to Mr. Burns' castle in Pennsylvania, where Bart and Lisa {{discover}} a secret staircase descending to an eerie basement filled with coffins. As they investigate, vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them. Lisa escapes, but Bart activates the [...] "Super Fun Happy Slide", causing him to be captured and get bitten by Mr. Burns. Bart returns to the table with Mr. Burns, who tells him to take a seat. Bart is very pale and is behaving oddly, but these factors get little attention by the family. Later that night, Lisa is awakened by a now undead Bart and his vampire friends. When Bart is about to bite Lisa, Homer and Marge interrupt and discover that Bart is a vampire. Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns' heart. Unfortunately, despite Mr. Burns' death, Bart still remains a vampire. To make things worse, Lisa discovers that everyone in the Simpson family except for herself is a vampire, and that the true head vampire is inexplicably Marge, <b>not</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns. With this revelation, the whole entire family swoops in on Lisa, only to stop and wish everyone a happy Halloween. Then, they all harmonize [...] "Hark the Herald Angels Sing", parodying A Charlie Brown Christmas.|$|E

Clough reminds them that he is <b>not</b> <b>Mr</b> Revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager's name or methods again.|$|E

In the letter, Fitzgerald writes: [...] "A formal assessment has not been done of {{the damage caused by}} the disclosure of Valerie Wilson's status as a CIA employee, and thus we possess no such document." [...] He continues: [...] "In any event, we would not view an assessment of the damage caused by the disclosure as relevant to the issue of whether or <b>not</b> <b>Mr.</b> Libby intentionally lied when he made the statements and gave the grand jury testimony which the grand jury alleged was false." ...|$|E

Frankie realises that the cook and gardener did not see Mr Savage before the signing, while the parlourmaid did and would have realised that it was Roger in the [...] "deathbed" [...] who wrote the will and <b>not</b> <b>Mr</b> Savage.

2500|$|The defense criticized lawyer Gloria Allred, who {{represents}} several of Cosby's accusers, stating that Allred's [...] "campaign against Mr. Cosby builds on racial bias and prejudice that can pollute {{the court of}} public opinion."

She said that Cosby [...] "complains about racial bias but what about the African American women whom I represent who accuse him of sexual assault or rape and who refuse to remain silent about what they say they have suffered?" [...] and [...] "This is not an issue of racial bias. Instead, it is an issue of whether or <b>not</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cosby has committed acts of gender sexual violence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but <b>not</b> <b>Mr</b> Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In Commission v Germany the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E
2500|$|Since its founding, the EU has {{operated}} among an increasing plurality {{of national and}} globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, {{and in any case}} under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, <b>not</b> <b>Mr</b> Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states [...] "have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves" [...] on the [...] "basis of reciprocity". EU law would not [...] "be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question". This meant any [...] "subsequent unilateral act" [...] of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In [...] "accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law", said the Court of Justice, the [...] "directly applicable measures of the institutions" [...] (such as the Regulations in the case) [...] "render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law". This was necessary to prevent a [...] "corresponding denial" [...] of Treaty [...] "obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states", that could [...] "imperil the very foundations of the" [...] EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.|$|E
