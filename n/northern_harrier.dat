5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the <b>northern</b> <b>harrier</b> breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime migratory path {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The golden eagle, bald eagle, osprey, and <b>northern</b> <b>harrier</b> pass through the area during their annual {{migration}} periods. It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do nest in the forests of the IBA include the northern goshawk, red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee {{many years to come}} to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britainâ€”examples include <b>northern</b> <b>harrier</b> (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|E
50|$|Key Cave NWR also manages several {{bird species}} {{including}} grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), dickcissels (Spiza americana), <b>northern</b> <b>harriers</b> (Circus cyaneus), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus).|$|R
50|$|Upland {{habitats}} {{are used}} extensively by ground nesting birds such <b>northern</b> <b>harriers,</b> western meadowlarks, mallards and ring-necked pheasant. Vegetation is typically dominated by annual rye grass, curly dock and wild sunflower. Rodent populations {{in these areas}} provide prey for large numbers of wintering birds of prey.|$|R
50|$|Raptors are {{a common}} sight on Delta NWR. The most {{commonly}} observed species include American kestrels, <b>northern</b> <b>harriers,</b> red-tailed hawks and turkey vultures. Black vultures, Cooper's hawks, merlins, red-shouldered hawks and sharp-shinned hawks have also been seen on the refuge. Ospreys are common winter visitors to the refuge.|$|R
25|$|Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, {{watching}} for prey activity from a perch {{such as a}} tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, hummock or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a <b>northern</b> <b>harrier</b> (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|E
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park {{provides}} a breeding habitat for four species of flycatchers and {{two species of}} waterthrushes. American bittern nest near the park. Bald eagle are frequent visitors to the park, and some ornithologists believe they may be nesting there since adult pairs have been observed with their young. The park is a nesting location for three [...] "rare" [...] birds, including two birds of prey (the northern goshawk and <b>northern</b> <b>harrier),</b> and Swainson's thrush, {{as well as one}} [...] "at risk" [...] duck, the green-winged teal.|$|E
500|$|Bird watchers have {{observed}} over 200 {{species of birds}} in the park, including the great blue heron, <b>northern</b> <b>harrier,</b> white-throated sparrow and highly sensitive species which are rare as breeding birds in Pennsylvania such as northern goshawk and yellow-bellied flycatcher.

50|$|Cape May Peninsula {{is renowned}} for its {{spectacular}} raptor migrations each fall. During this period great numbers of 17 raptor species are commonly seen including peregrine falcons, ospreys, <b>northern</b> <b>harriers,</b> American kestrels, Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks. Because many raptors do not choose to cross such large bodies of water as the Delaware Bay, many use the bayshore upland forest edge as a migration corridor.|$|R

50|$|Grasslands are {{periodically}} hayed, mowed or {{burned to}} keep open field from changing back to forest. Many wildlife species benefit from these open field habitats. Waterfowl, bobolinks, {{and many other}} songbirds and small mammals use open fields to nest and rear young. Birds of prey such as American kestrel, <b>northern</b> <b>harriers</b> and rough-legged hawks glide over these same grasslands in search of prey such as mice, voles and other small mammals.|$|R

The land hosts several regionally-threatened species, including <b>northern</b> <b>harriers,</b> spotted turtles and Cooper's hawks, and is additionally utilized by shorebirds and migratory bird species following the Atlantic Flyway. A number of amphibians, including the protected blue-spotted salamander, have been observed at Amsterdam Beach.|$|R
50|$|The {{cycle of}} meadow vole {{abundance}} {{is an important}} proximate factor affecting the life histories of its major predators. Meadow voles are usually the most abundant small mammals in northern prairie wetlands, often exceeding 40% of all individual small mammals present. Numbers of short-eared owls, <b>northern</b> <b>harriers,</b> rough-legged hawks (Buteo lagopus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and red foxes were related to large numbers of meadow voles in a field in Wisconsin. Predator numbers are positively associated with meadow vole abundance.|$|R

5000|$|Some Native American tribes {{believe that}} seeing a hawk on your wedding {{day is a}} sign of a long, happy marriage. Unlike many raptors, hen or <b>northern</b> <b>harriers</b> have {{historically}} been favorably regarded by farmers because they eat predators of quail eggs and mice that damage crops. Harriers are sometimes called [...] "good hawks" [...] because they pose no threat to poultry as some hawks do. Heavy pesticide use in the 1970s and 1980s caused a decline in harrier populations.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with other}} flock-living passerines, the golden-crowned sparrow {{is prone to}} {{elevated}} levels of feather mites. It serves as a host for chiggers, chewing lice, including Machaerilaemus maestum, and hippoboscid flies, including Ornithoica vicina. Diseases which are known to affect it include canarypox. A number of predators prey on the golden-crowned sparrow {{at some point in}} its life cycle. [...] These include northern and loggerhead shrikes, sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks, <b>northern</b> <b>harriers,</b> merlins, mountain pygmy owls, western screech owls, barn owls, feral cats, and Columbian ground squirrels.|$|R
