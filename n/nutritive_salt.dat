40|$|During spring, a {{hydrological}} profile {{was carried}} out in the river and bay of Morlaix (Finistere, France), in particularly favourable climatic conditions. Low salinity gradients were obtained. The distribution of <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts</b> clearly showed 2 different zones. The 1 st, estuarine, was characterized by an important production and a great consumption of the dissolved silica. The other, the Bay, open to the sea, showed a distribution of <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts</b> which indicated that the benthic macroscopic algae accounted for {approx} 80 % of the total consumption. The rates of consumption observed suggest that the water must remain at least 2 days in the estuarine zone and 3 days in the Baie de Morlaix...|$|R

Located just south of the residential area Kvarntorp, and north of the densely populated central Haninge, the wetland lake receives considerable amount of <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{nutrient}} {{release from}} bottom sediment {{in a lake}} occurs under anoxic condition in the hypolimnion, and influences the water quality in the whole lake. The {{purpose of this study}} is to make the influence of bottom sediment on water quality clear. Annual change of water quality in Kawahara Lake was investigated, and laboratory tests and field tests to clear the consumption of dissolved oxygen and nutrient release were carried out. From the test data, the oxygen transfer coefficient and the nutrient release rate were discussed. By comparison the test results between the change of water quality in Kawahara Lake, the efficiency of the tests was confirmed. Further, the comings and outgoings of <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts</b> in the Lake became clear, and the function of drain system of bottom water was examined on discharging the <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The floristic {{composition}} of the Saho river in Nara City was studied in order to evaluate the water quality. The floristic composition and the chemical water quality were investigated at seven sites of the river. These sites are numberd (1 to 7) from the upper stream. The floristic composition changed along the river; species and individuals of plants gradually increased in number from the site 1 to 6, while they decreased in the site 7. The water quality also changed; the concentration of <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts</b> and the electric conductivity gradually increased from the site 1 to 6 and steeply increased at the site 7. This fact proves a close relationship between the floristic composition and the water quality. Thus, it is concluded that the water quality can be evaluated by the florictic composition in the Saho river...|$|R
5000|$|Fruit wine can be {{made from}} {{virtually}} any plant matter that can be fermented. [...] Most fruits and berries have the potential to produce wine. There are a number of methods of extracting flavour and juice from the fruits or plants being used, pressing the juice, stewing and fermenting the pulp of the fruits are common. Few foods other than grapes have the balanced quantities of sugar, acid, tannin, <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts</b> for yeast feeding and water to naturally produce a stable, drinkable wine, so most country wines are adjusted in one or more respects at fermentation. However, some of these products do require the addition of sugar or honey to make them palatable and to increase the alcoholic content (sugar is converted to alcohol in the fermentation). Two commonly produced varieties are elderberry wine and dandelion wine. Tainted elderberry wine is the beverage used to commit murders in Joseph Kesselring's play and Frank Capra's film adaptation Arsenic and Old Lace. A wine made from elderberry flowers is called elder blow wine.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} years, the {{increasing}} number of aromatic hydrocarbons-contaminated sites has increased the need to develop and improve technologies allowing hazardous pollutants to be removed and therefore contaminated soils to be detoxified. Among the different available technologies, the most promising ones seem to be the bioremediation techniques, that convert the contaminants into simpler and generally less toxic compounds by means of microbial activity. For remedial actions to be successfully applied, conditions suitable for microbial growth must be provided: aeration, moisture content, pH, temperature, and nutrients. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the influence of nutrients on phenol and p-nitrophenol biodegradation using a slurry-phase process. The influence of nutrients on biodegradation of phenol- and p-nitrophenol-contaminated soils in a slurry phase process was studied. <b>Nutritive</b> <b>salts</b> were added at several concentrations to achieve optimal and moderate nutrient levels. A check on salt desorption from uncontaminated soil indicated that sorption processes can be neglected, with all disappearance of phenols being due to biodegradation. Addition of nutrients shortens the disappearance time of phenolic compounds, with the disappearance time at the optimal salinity level being nearly two times faster than that observed at moderate nutrient levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} {{behaviors of}} small rivers that pass through suburban areas {{are difficult to}} understand because of the multi-origin inputs that can modify their behavior. In this context, a monitoring strategy has been designed for the Marque River, located in Lille Metropolitan area of northern France, that includes both low-frequency monitoring over a one-year period (monthly sampling) and high frequency monitoring (measurements every 10 minutes) in spring and summer. Several environmental and chemical parameters are evaluated including rainfall events, river flow, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, <b>nutritive</b> <b>salts</b> and dissolved organic matter. Our results from the Marque River show that (i) it is impacted by both urban and agricultural inputs, and as a consequence, the concentrations of phosphate and inorganic nitrogen have degraded the water quality; (ii) the classic photosynthesis/respiration processes are disrupted by the inputs of organic matter and nutritive salts; (iii) during dry periods, the urban sewage inputs (treated or not) are more important during the day, as indicated by higher river flows and maximal concentrations of ammonium; (iv) phosphate concentrations depend on oxygen contents in the river; (v) high nutrient concentrations result in eutrophication of the Marque River with lower pH and oxygen concentrations in summer. During rainfalls, additional inputs of ammonium, biodegradable organic matter as well as sediment resuspension result in anoxic events; and finally (vi) concentrations of nitrate are approximately constant over the year, except in winter when higher inputs can be recorded. Having better identified the processes responsible for the observed water quality, a more informed remediation effort can be put forward to move this suburban river to a good status of water quality...|$|R
40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.), {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in the world, is deficient in lysine and tryptophan. Environmental conditions greatly impact plant growth, development and productivity. In this study, we used particle bombardment mediated co-transformation to obtain marker-free transgenic maize inbred X 178 lines harboring a lysine-rich protein gene SBgLR from potato and an ethylene responsive factor (ERF) transcription factor gene, TSRF 1, from tomato. Both of the target genes were successfully expressed and showed various expression levels in different transgenic lines. Analysis showed that the protein and lysine content in T 1 transgenic maize seeds increased significantly. Compared to non-transformed maize, the protein and lysine content increased by 7. 7 % to 24. 38 % and 8. 70 % to 30. 43 %, respectively. Moreover, transgenic maize exhibited more tolerance to salt stress. When treated with 200 mM NaCl for 48 h, both non-transformed and transgenic plant leaves displayed wilting and losing green symptoms and dramatic increase of the free proline contents. However, the degree of control seedlings was much more serious than that of transgenic lines and much more increases of the free proline contents in the transgenic lines than that in the control seedlings were observed. Meanwhile, lower extent decreases of the chlorophyll contents were detected in the transgenic seedlings. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to analyze the expression of ten stress-related genes, including stress responsive transcription factor genes, ZmMYB 59 and ZmMYC 1, proline synthesis related genes, ZmP 5 CS 1 and ZmP 5 CS 2, photosynthesis-related genes, ZmELIP, ZmPSI-N, ZmOEE, Zmrbcs and ZmPLAS, and one ABA biosynthesis related gene, ZmSDR. The results showed that with the exception of ZmP 5 CS 1 and ZmP 5 CS 2 in line 9 – 10 and 19 – 11, ZmMYC 1 in line 19 – 11 and ZmSDR in line 19 – 11, the expression of other stress-related genes were inhibited in transgenic lines under normal conditions. After salt treatment, the expressions of the ten stress-related genes were significantly induced in both wild-type (WT) and transgenic lines. However, compared to WT, the increases of ZmP 5 CS 1 in all these three transgenic lines and ZmP 5 CS 2 in line 9 – 10 were less than WT plants. This study provides an effective approach of maize genetic engineering for improved <b>nutritive</b> quality and <b>salt</b> tolerance...|$|R
