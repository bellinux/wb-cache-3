However, the mechanisms that generate neocortical oscillations in physiological frequency bands remain unknown.

We simulated networks from sensory neocortex using nine columns of event-driven rule-based <b>neurons</b> <b>wired</b> according to anatomical data and driven with random white-noise synaptic inputs. We tuned the network to achieve realistic cell firing rates {{and to avoid}} population spikes. A physiological frequency spectrum appeared as an emergent property, displaying dominant frequencies that were not present in the inputs or in the intrinsic or activated frequencies {{of any of the}} cell groups. We monitored spectral changes while using minimal dynamical perturbation as a methodology through gradual introduction of hubs into individual layers. We found that hubs in layer 2 / 3 excitatory cells had the greatest influence on overall network activity, suggesting that this subpopulation was a primary generator of theta/beta strength in the network. Similarly, layer 2 / 3 interneurons appeared largely responsible for gamma activation through preferential attenuation {{of the rest of the}} spectrum. The network showed evidence of frequency homeostasis: increased activation of supragranular layers increased firing rates in the network without altering the spectral profile, and alteration in synaptic delays did not significantly shift spectral peaks.

The neocortical columnar architecture has been hypothesized to be a module for shaping dynamics to perform information processing.

Using NEURON[1], we simulated a set of 11 horizontally connected layered neocortical columns which consisted of event-driven rule-based <b>neurons</b> <b>wired</b> according to known anatomical data and driven with random white-noise synaptic inputs [2]. We simulated afferent sensory inputs via the thalamus by strong stimulation of layer 4 pyramidal neuron AMPA/NMDA synapses in selected columns.

During baseline, a physiological frequency spectrum appeared as an emergent property, displaying dominant frequencies that were not present in either the inputs, or in the intrinsic or activated frequencies of any of the cell groups. Thalamic stimuli evoked a brief population spike within layer 4. This population spike recruited recurrent activation within the column, evoking a set of 4 - 8 population spike discharges lasting from 500 - 1000 ms.

For an accurate {{processing of}} time intervals by the brain, representation of the physical time within neuronal circuits is necessary. I propose that time-dimension of the physical surrounding is represented in the brain by different types of neuronal oscillators, generating spikes or spike bursts at regular intervals. The proposed oscillators include the pacemaker neurons, tonic inputs and synchronized excitation and inhibition of inter-connected neurons. Oscillators, which are built inside various circuits of brain, help to form modular clocks, processing time intervals or other temporal characteristics specific to functions of a circuit.

40|$|Single page posterThere are an {{estimated}} 100 billion neurons in the human brain, equal {{to the number of}} stars in our galaxy. These neurons are connected at specialized junctions called synapses, one type of which is electrical. Gap junction channels connect neurons at electrical synapses, allowing small molecules to pass between cells. Initial synapse formation is determined by the genetic code, which instructs where, when, and how <b>neurons</b> <b>wire</b> together to create circuits. Genetic defects believed to alter normal circuit wiring have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, but the exact circuits and molecular mechanisms affected remain unclear. Critical to normal circuit wiring is the formation of the first synapses between neurons, as these lay the foundation upon which mature circuits are built; research has shown that these first synapses are electrical but it is unknown which genes are responsible and drive the continued development of the networks. This project aims to identify the genes required for the first synapses and investigate their roles from a genetic, neural circuit, and behavioral standpoint. We examined the first spinal cord circuits that wire together in zebrafish. These neural networks provide advantages to studying synapse formation because they wire together within 24 hours post fertilization via electrical synapses, are visualizable at the levels of neurons, circuit function, and behavior, and are genetically accessible. With this approach, we can identify the genes responsible for the first synapses formed in the brain and examine how these synapses impact early circuit wiring.

To investigate {{the basic structure of}} cortical microcircuits, we use a two-photon photostimulation technique that enables the systematic mapping of synaptic connections with single-cell resolution. We map the inhibitory connectivity between upper layers somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells in mouse frontal cortex. Most, and sometimes all, inhibitory neurons are locally connected to every sampled pyramidal cell. This dense inhibitory connectivity is found at both young and mature developmental ages. Inhibitory innervation of neighboring pyramidal cells is similar, regardless of whether they are connected among themselves or not. We conclude that local inhibitory connectivity is promiscuous, does not form subnetworks, and can approach the theoretical limit of a completely connected synaptic matrix...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{of the brain and}} its underlying circuitry is dependent on the formation of trillions of chemical synapses, which are highly specialized contacts that regulate the flow of information from one neuron to the next. It is through these synaptic connections that <b>neurons</b> <b>wire</b> together into networks capable of performing specific tasks, and activity-dependent changes in their structural and physiological state is one way that the brain is thought to adapt and store information. At the ultrastructural level, developmental and activity-dependent changes in {{the size and shape of}} dendritic spines have been well documented, and it is widely believed that structural changes in spines are a hallmark sign of synapse maturation and alteration of synaptic physiology. While changes in spine structure have been studied extensively, changes in one of its most prominent components, the postsynaptic density (PSD), have largely evaded observation. The PSD is a protein-rich organelle on the cytoplasmic side of the postsynaptic membrane, where it sits in direct opposition to the presynaptic terminal. The PSD functions both to cluster neurotransmitter receptors at the cell surface as well as organize the intracellular signaling molecules responsible for transducing extracellular signals to the postsynaptic cell. Much is known about the chemical composition of the PSD, but the structural arrangement of its molecular components is not well documented. Adding to the difficulty of understanding such a complex mass of protein machinery is the fact that its protein composition is known to change in response to synaptic activity, meaning that its structure is plastic and no two PSDs are identical. Here, immuno-gold labeling and electron tomography of PSDs isolated throughout development was used to track changes in both the structure and molecular composition of the PSD. State-of-the-art cryo-electron tomography was used to study the fine structure of the PSD during development, and provides an unprecedented glimpse into its molecular architecture in an un-fixed, unstained and hydrated state. Through this analysis, large structural and compositional changes are apparent and suggest a model by which the PSD is first assembled as a mesh-like lattice of proteins that function as support for the later recruitment of various PSD components.

Avoidance of cells that receive common input may be a fundamental principle of information processing within a cortical column. Our findings challenge the prevailing hypothesis that shared developmental lineage is always associated with an increase in connectivity, and suggest that both attraction and repulsion play an important role in shaping cortical circuits...|$|R

A silicon photodiode array for subretinal stimulation has been fabricated by a silicon-integrated-circuit/MEMS process. Each pixel in the two-dimensional array contains three series-connected photodiodes, which photovoltaically convert pulsed near-infrared light into bi-phasic current to stimulate nearby retinal <b>neurons</b> without <b>wired</b> power connections. The device thickness is chosen to be 30 µm to absorb {{a significant portion of}} light while still being thin enough for subretinal implantation. Active and return electrodes confine current near each pixel and are sputter coated with iridium oxide to enhance charge injection levels and provide a stable neural interface. Pixels are separated by 5 µm wide trenches to electrically isolate them and to allow nutrient diffusion through the device. Three sizes of pixels (280, 140 and 70 µm) with active electrodes of 80, 40 and 20 µm diameter were fabricated. The turn-on voltages of the one-diode, two-series-connected diode and three-series-connected diode structures are approximately 0. 6, 1. 2 and 1. 8 V, respectively. The measured photo-responsivity per diode at 880 nm wavelength is ~ 0. 36 A W− 1, at zero voltage bias and scales with the exposed silicon area. For all three pixel sizes, the reverse-bias dark current is sufficiently low (< 100 pA) for our application. Pixels of all three sizes reliably elicit retinal responses at safe near-infrared light irradiances, with good acceptance of the photodiode array in the subretinal space.

40|$|The {{formation}} of cortical columns is often conceptualized {{as a local}} process in which synaptic microcircuits confined to {{the volume of the}} emerging column are established and selectively refined. Many <b>neurons,</b> however, while <b>wiring</b> up locally are simultaneously building macroscopic circuits spanning widely distributed brain regions, such as different cortical areas or the two brain hemispheres. Thus, it is conceivable that interareal interactions shape the local column layout.

This is revealed by comparing the layouts of orientation columns (i) in left/right pairs of brain hemispheres and (ii) in areas V 1 and V 2 of individual brain hemispheres. Whereas the size of columns varied strongly within all areas considered, columns in different areas were typically closely matched in size if they were mutually connected.

This sophisticated retinal network allows extraction and encoding of more than 20 representations of the visual scene in its output neurons, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Within the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of retina, glycine receptors (GlyRs) are expressed on different cell classes and modulate RGC visual activity to light onset (ON RGCs) and to light offset (OFF RGCs), for example, their temporal precision and gain control. There are four GlyR alpha subunits (GlyRα 1 - 4) with differential expression patterns in IPL. Each mediates spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) with different decay kinetics. Moreover, GlyR alpha subunit-specific expression was discovered across different RGC types. This evidence suggests subunit-specific roles for glycinergic inhibitory circuits to modulate the RGC visual outputs. However, the details remain largely unknown. To investigate glycinergic subunit-specific modulation, I used GlyRα subunit knockout (KO) mouse lines, which lack GlyRα 2 (Glra 2 -/-), GlyRα 3 (Glra 3 -/-) or both (Glra 2 / 3 -/-). I found that GlyRα 2 and GlyRα 3 enhance ON RGCs visual responses whereas only GlyRα 2 enhances OFF RGCs visual responses. Second, I used viral tools to manipulate {{the expression of the}} GlyRα 1 subunit on RGCs to examine its role in visual processing. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were injected into dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and transported retrogradely to infect RGCs and generate shRNA to selectively knockdown GlyRα 1 expression. In OFFαTransient RGCs, which predominantly express GlyRα 1, shRNA almost completely eliminated all glycinergic input and I showed that this input increases signal to noise ratio of OFFαTransient RGC visual responses. I expanded our understanding of subunit-specificity by surveying subunit specific expression and currents across eight identified RGCs in the PVcre mouse. By comparing co-localization of GlyR α subunit puncta on identified RGC dendrites with the decay kinetics of their sIPSCs, I showed that there is subunit-specific expression of GlyRs.

The proposed fabrication technique enables the electrodes {{on the surface of}} MEAs to make a tight connection to the <b>neurons,</b> because the <b>wire</b> of the MEA is fabricated to be plateau-shaped, as the Young’s modulus of PDMS is similar to soft tissues and PDMS follows the curvature of the neural tissue due to its high conformability compared to the other polymers. Injury caused by the movement of the MEAs can therefore be minimized. Each electrode has a diameter of 130 μm and the 8 -channel array has a center-to-center electrode spacing of 300 μm. The signal-to-noise ratio of the plateau-shaped electrodes was larger than that of recessed electrodes because there was no space between the electrode and neural cell. Reliable neural recordings were possible by adjusting the position of the electrode during the experiment without trapping air under the electrodes. Simultaneous multi-channel neural recordings were successfully achieved from the spinal cord of rodents. We describe the fabrication technique, electrode 3 D profile, electrode impedance, and MEA performance in in vivo experiments in rodents...|$|R
40|$|During development, {{coordinate}} {{regulation of}} cell cycle exit and differentiation of neuronal precursors {{is essential for}} generation of appropriate number of <b>neurons</b> and proper <b>wiring</b> of neuronal circuits. BM 88 is a neuronal protein associated in vivo with terminal neuron-generating divisions, marking the exit of proliferative cells from the cell cycle. Here, we provide functional evidence that BM 88 is sufficient to initiate the differentiation of spinal cord neural precursors toward acquisition of generic neuronal and subtype-specific traits. Gain-of-function approaches show that BM 88 negatively regulates proliferation of neuronal precursors, driving them to prematurely exit the cell cycle, down-regulate Notch 1, and commit to a neuronal differentiation pathway. The combined effect on proliferation and differentiation results in precocious induction of neurogenesis and generation of postmitotic neurons within the ventricular zone. The dual action of BM 88 is not recapitulated by the cell cycle inhibitor p 27 Kip 1, suggesting that cell cycle exit does not induce differentiation by default. Mechanistically, induction of endogenous BM 88 by forced expression of the proneural gene Mash 1 indicates that BM 88 {{is part of the}} differentiation program activated by proneural genes. Furthermore, BM 88 gene silencing conferred by small interfering RNA in spinal cord neural progenitor cells enhances cell cycle progression and impairs neuronal differentiation. Our results implicate BM 88 in the synchronization of cell cycle exit and differentiation of neuronal precursors in the developing nervous system...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{contributes to the}} control of movement, coordination, and certain cognitive functions. The cerebellar network is composed of five different types of <b>neurons</b> that are <b>wired</b> together in a repetitive module. Given that four of these five neurons synthesize and release GABA, this inhibitory neurotransmitter plays {{a central role in}} regulation of the excitability and correct functioning of the {{cerebellar cortex}}. We have now used isoniazid, an inhibitor of glutamic acid decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of GABA, to evaluate the contribution of GABAergic transmission in different types of cerebellar cortical neurons to the functioning of the cerebellar circuit. Parasagittal cerebellar slices were prepared from 28 - to 40 -day-old male rats and were subjected to patch-clamp recording in the voltage- or current-clamp mode. Exposure of the tissue slices to isoniazid (10 mM) resulted in a decrease in the level of GABAergic transmission in Purkinje cells and a consequent increase in the firing rate of spontaneous action potentials that was apparent after 40 min. In granule neurons, isoniazid reduced both tonic and phasic GABAergic currents and thereby altered the flow of information across the cerebellar cortex. Our data support the notion that the amount of GABA at the synaptic level is a major determinant of the excitability of the cerebellar cortex, and they suggest that isoniazid may be a useful tool with which to study the function of the cerebellar network.

40|$|In {{the human}} brain there are about 100 billion {{excitatory}} glutamatergic neurons and 10 billion inhibitory GABAergic neurons. During development, these <b>neurons</b> are synaptically <b>wired</b> together into neural networks, functionally prepared to perform the full register of brain functions, and to learn from experiences. Much {{research has focused on}} the understanding of synapses onto excitatory neurons. Considerably less, however, is known about the properties of synapses onto the inhibitory neurons, information necessary to achieve a more complete picture of network function. The aim of this thesis was {{to examine the effects of}} glutamate on inhibitory interneurons by comparing them to those on excitatory pyramidal cells in the same region of the hippocampus. Electrophysiological methods were used in the acute rat hippocampal slice preparation. This thesis shows that glutamate synapses formed onto interneurons, in contrast to those formed onto pyramidal cells maintain a developmental phenotype into adulthood. First, interneurons in adult rats have AMPA silent synapses, which are created by activity dependent AMPA silencing. Second, the average number of synapses connecting a presynaptic excitatory cell and an interneuron remains only one in the adult rat. Furthermore, inhibitory interneurons rely more on tonically active extrasynaptic NMDA receptors for their excitability than do excitatory pyramidal cells. The findings presented in this thesis suggest that some fundamental aspects of glutamate transmission onto interneurons do not change during development, as they do in synapses onto pyramidal cells. This differential development results in different phenotypes of glutamatergic transmission onto these two major groups of neurons. This difference is likely critical for the optimized functioning of the adult neural network...|$|R
40|$|The {{direction}} of visual motion is encoded {{in a population}} of direction selective retinal ganglion cells (DSRGCs) that provide inputs to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In this work, a novel method of in vivo two-photon calcium imaging is developed and used to determine how direction selective information is organized in the superficial LGN. Neurons preferring a single {{direction of}} motion within the superficial LGN predominantly represent the horizontal directions of motion, and a population of cells exists which responds to both opposing directions along the horizontal axis. A simple statistical model of retina-LGN connections demonstrates that random wiring within the superficial layer is sufficient to produce the observed fractions of direction and axis of motion preferring LGN <b>neurons.</b> The random <b>wiring</b> model {{is consistent with previous}} experimental results on the fraction of LGN neurons receiving a single driving input, and makes quantitative predictions about retina-LGN connectivity. The efficient coding hypothesis suggests that sensory neurons should be adapted to carry as much information as possible about the statistics of the environment. In a theoretical study, we reconcile this hypothesis with the organization and function of the retinogeniculate motion selective circuit. Under this theory, the symmetries of the distribution of optic flows in natural scenes constrain optimal direction selective neurons to prefer only the cardinal directions of motion. The directional tuning curves of On-Off DSRGCs in mice are compared with the optimal tuning curves for jointly encoding orthogonal directions of motion, and are found to correspond closely. The optimal encoding scheme for two opposing direction selective neurons, as observed in our study of the superficial LGN, requires sharpening of tuning relative the retinal representation. The theory's predicted sharpening corresponds to our own data on direction selective responses in LGN, and predicts that tuning curves that in a vertical motion layer in the LGN should be more broadly tuned than those in a horizontal motion laye...|$|R
