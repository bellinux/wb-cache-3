5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that {{the main source of}} the mercury is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the mercury comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a <b>non-toxic,</b> inorganic form. The <b>non-toxic</b> mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth, as a dense {{element of}} high atomic weight, {{is used in}} bismuth-impregnated latex shields to shield from X-ray in medical examinations, such as CTs, mostly as it is {{considered}} <b>non-toxic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diving gases, {{including}} compressed air, oxygen, nitrox, heliox, trimix, helium and argon, are <b>non-toxic,</b> non flammable, {{and may be}} oxidizer or asphyxiant, and {{are rated}} in Transport category 3.|$|E
5|$|Neutral helium at {{standard}} conditions is <b>non-toxic,</b> plays no biological role and {{is found in}} trace amounts in human blood.|$|E
5|$|Biodiesel (in its pure form) is a <b>non-toxic,</b> {{biodegradable}} form {{of diesel}} fuel made from vegetable oil, usually soybean oil or recycled restaurant grease. Biodiesel promises {{a reduction in}} some exhaust emissions, as well as reduced dependence on foreign petroleum supplies.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{vanadate}} is an opaque yellow pigment in artists' oil and acrylic paint. This compound is a <b>non-toxic</b> lightfast {{substitute for}} lemon yellow pigments {{such as the}} cadmium sulfides and the lead/strontium/barium chromates. Unlike lead chromate+lead sulfate lemon, bismuth vanadate does not readily blacken with UV exposure.|$|E
5|$|Gallium has {{no known}} natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves {{in a similar}} manner to ferric salts in {{biological}} systems, and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals. Gallium is used in thermometers as a <b>non-toxic</b> and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury.|$|E
5|$|Helium (He) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, <b>non-toxic,</b> inert {{monatomic}} {{chemical element}} that heads the noble gas {{series in the}} periodic table and whose atomic number is 2. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.|$|E
5|$|Helium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, <b>non-toxic,</b> inert, monatomic gas, {{the first in}} the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a <b>non-toxic</b> species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the <b>non-toxic</b> juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{dysprosium}} salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are mildly toxic when ingested. Based on {{the toxicity}} of dysprosium chloride to mice, {{it is estimated}} that the ingestion of 500grams or more could be fatal to a human. The insoluble salts, however, are <b>non-toxic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although argon is <b>non-toxic,</b> it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is <b>non-toxic,</b> when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (<b>non-toxic</b> and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are <b>non-toxic</b> and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{scandium}} {{is considered}} <b>non-toxic,</b> though extensive animal testing of scandium compounds {{has not been}} done. The median lethal dose (LD50) levels for scandium(III) chloride for rats have been determined as 4mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 755mg/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results, compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and <b>non-toxic</b> chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|Some {{ytterbium}} halides {{are used}} as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid {{and can be used}} as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF3) is used as an inert and <b>non-toxic</b> tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which are good for dental health, and is also a good X-ray contrast agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{producers of}} iodine today are Chile and Japan. Iodine {{and its compounds}} are primarily used in nutrition. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a <b>non-toxic</b> radiocontrast material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine {{can also be used}} to treat thyroid cancer. Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Kushana {{leaves for}} the Tolmekian capital with Nausicaä and five hostages from the Valley, but an agile Pejite {{interceptor}} shoots down Tolmekian airships carrying them. Nausicaä, Kushana and other hostages crash-lands in the jungle, disturbing several Ohm, which Nausicaä soothes. She leaves {{to rescue the}} Pejite pilot Asbel, brother of Princess Lastelle, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a <b>non-toxic</b> area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausicaä realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is <b>non-toxic</b> even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. Zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes {{requires}} medical attention. OSHA recommendations for zirconium are 5mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10mg/m3 short-term exposure limit. Only limited data exists on the toxicology of hafnium.|$|E
5|$|Water-soluble {{compounds}} of yttrium {{are considered}} mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are <b>non-toxic.</b> In experiments on animals, yttrium {{and its compounds}} caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.|$|E
5|$|Xenon gas can {{be safely}} kept in normal sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is <b>non-toxic,</b> although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to {{a select group of}} substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are <b>non-toxic</b> and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as <b>non-toxic</b> but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered <b>non-toxic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Europium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and {{is named after}} the continent of Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively <b>non-toxic</b> compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium {{is one of the}} least abundant elements in the universe; only about % of all matter in the universe is europium.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be <b>non-toxic,</b> and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe cookei, {{commonly}} known as the straw fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. It was first described in 1892 by Giacomo Bresadola, and is named in honour of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species can be found in Europe, Asia and North America. It produces small mushrooms of an ochre colour, with a prominent umbo, fibres on the cap and a distinctive bulb {{at the base of the}} stem. It grows from soil in mixed woodland, and is encountered in summer and autumn, though is not common. Ecologically, it feeds through use of ectomycorrhiza. Inocybe cookei has been described as both toxic and <b>non-toxic,</b> but either way, is not advised for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Nausicaä liberates {{the baby}} Ohm and gains its trust. She and the Ohm {{stand before the}} raging herd and are run over. The Ohm calm down and use their golden tentacles to {{resuscitate}} her. Nausicaä, her dress drenched blue with Ohm blood, walks atop hundreds of golden Ohm tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the saviour's prophecy. The Ohm and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them to rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a <b>non-toxic</b> tree sprouts next to Nausicaä's lost aviation goggles.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts <b>non-toxic</b> mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Samarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it {{is unclear}} whether this is the effect of {{samarium}} or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50µg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8µg/L being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are <b>non-toxic</b> and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is <b>non-toxic</b> even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An {{estimated}} quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. <b>Non-toxic</b> boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E
5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} atomic hydrogen first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, <b>non-toxic,</b> nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
