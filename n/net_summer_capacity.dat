50|$|The {{megawatt}} (MW) {{is equal}} to one million (106) watts. Many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale, including large electric motors; large warships such as aircraft carriers, cruisers, and submarines; large server farms or data centers; and some scientific research equipment, such as supercolliders, and the output pulses of very large lasers. A large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat.On railways, modern high-powered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6 MW, although some produce much more. The Eurostar, for example, uses more than 12 MW, while heavy diesel-electric locomotives typically produce/use 3 to 5 MW. U.S. nuclear power plants have <b>net</b> <b>summer</b> <b>capacities</b> between about 500 and 1300 MW.|$|R

40|$|We present ice {{velocities}} {{observed with}} global positioning systems and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-Xin a land-terminating {{region of the}} southwest Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) during the melt year 2012 – 2013, toexamine the spatial pattern of seasonal and annual ice motion. We ﬁnd that while spatial variability in theconﬁguration of the subglacial drainage system controls ice motion at short timescales, this conﬁgurationhas negligible impact on the spatial pattern of the proportion of annual motion which occurs duringsummer. While absolute annual velocities vary substantially, the proportional contribution of summermotion to annual motion does not. These observations suggest that in land-terminating margins of the GrIS,subglacial hydrology does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence spatial variations in <b>net</b> <b>summer</b> speedup. Furthermore, our ﬁndings imply that not every feature of the subglacial drainage system needs to beresolved in ice sheet models...|$|R

The modelling uses clean energy options that not only replace the amount of electricity that Hazelwood produces {{over the course of a}} year but also replace Hazelwood’s peak summer generation.

40|$|The few prethaw {{observations}} of tundra carbon fluxes {{suggest that there}} may be large spring releases, but {{little is known about the}} scale and underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. To address these questions, we combined ecosystem eddy flux measurements from two towers near Barrow, Alaska, with mechanistic soil-core thawing experiment. During a 2 week period prior to snowmelt in 2014, large fluxes were measured, reducing <b>net</b> <b>summer</b> uptake of CO 2 by 46 % and adding 6 % to cumulative CH 4 emissions. Emission pulses were linked to unique rain-on-snow events enhancing soil cracking. Controlled laboratory experiment revealed that as surface ice thaws, an immediate, large pulse of trapped gases is emitted. These results suggest that the Arctic CO 2 and CH 4 spring pulse is a delayed release of biogenic gas production from the previous fall and that the pulse can be large enough to offset a significant fraction of the moderate Arctic tundra carbon sink...|$|R

40|$|The {{daily and}} {{seasonal}} evolution of O 2 and CO 2 saturation, water-atmosphere fluxes and budgets were measured in two fluvial {{reaches of the}} Mincio River (Italy). The northern reach is free flowing and is dominated by macrophytes while the southern reach is dammed, hypertrophic and phytoplankton dominated. We hypothesized short term regulation of gas saturation and fluxes by primary producers and the reversal of CO 2 off-gassing in the southern reach. Results indicated that both reaches were always CO 2 supersaturated. Higher CO 2 evasion rates in the northern compared to the southern reach depended on reaeration coefficient, in turn depending on water velocity. In the northern reach dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was one order of magnitude higher than oxygen consumption, likely due {{to a combination of}} anoxic heterotrophic activity in the hyporheic zone and carbonate dissolution. The activity of macrophytes influenced CO 2 saturation on short time scales. A <b>net</b> <b>summer</b> abatement of DIC occurred in the southern reach, probably due to fixation by phytoplankton, which attenuated supersaturation but not reversed CO 2 efflux. This study demonstrates how in small rivers CO 2 evasion can undergo rapid and significant changes due to eutrophication, altered hydrology and shift in primary producer communities. </p...|$|R
