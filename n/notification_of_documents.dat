50|$|One {{major benefit}} of turning all {{incoming}} paper mail into images {{as soon as}} it is received, {{is the extent to which}} it shortens the decision cycle. Although it might be difficult to quantify exactly what the cost savings are, it seems an obvious advantage. Digital mailrooms allow users to receive immediate <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> a <b>document's</b> arrival at the company. Employees can access images in record time, regardless <b>of</b> where the <b>documents</b> were physically acquired. Files can then be processed very rapidly according to their level of urgency. Just as digital mailrooms facilitate the exchange of company information, they also facilitate the coordination of several people around the same document. The decision-making process becomes quicker and more accurate.|$|R

40|$|A third dynamic {{behind the}} {{increased}} concern about systemic {{risk in the}} payments system is the globalization of financial markets, which is tying economies and markets together in ways that introduce additional issues about the mechanisms by which traditional clearing (the <b>notification</b> and transfer <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and orders to purchase and sell assets) and settlement (the transfer of final payment) take place. Finally, the fears about the supposed potential for systemic risk associated with clearing and settlement loss have been given greater credence {{by the lack of}} internal controls within major institutions, which have been exposed by the actions of rogue traders in Kidder, Bankers Trust, and Barings (see Edwards 1996). As the problems in these institutions have been unwound, greater appreciation has emerged o...|$|R
40|$|In a publish-subscribe {{system based}} on {{filtering}} <b>of</b> XML <b>documents</b> subscribers specify their interests with profiles expressed in the XPath language. The system processes a stream <b>of</b> XML <b>documents</b> and delivers to subscribers a <b>notification</b> or content <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> that match the profiles. We present a new XML-document-filtering algorithm {{that is based on}} the classic Aho–Corasick pattern-matching automaton. The automaton has a size linear in the sum of the sizes of the filters. We assume that the XML documents all conform to a given DTD; our algorithm utilizes the DTD in the preprocessing phase of the automaton to prune out descendant axes (//) and wildcards (∗) from the XPath filters. The XPath subset currently supported consists of linear XPath expressions without predicates. In the case of a 683 MB protein-sequence database, we obtained a throughput of 18. 8 MB/sec for 50 000 filters and 17. 0 MB/sec for 500 000 filters, using a SAX parser with a throughput of 27 MB/sec...|$|R

The initial implementation of the system, providing the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the unit staff about new orders, indicates that the model is viable both in terms of functionality and ability to scale up...|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} that co-authors {{partition}} a document into sections, expecting to optimise the collaborative process. Doing {{so they can}} concentrate their attention on certain sections, {{such as those in}} which they have more expertise. This strategy could lead to other problems, however. For example, co-authors' activities could be isolated from the teamwork and they could perceive the writing task in different ways. Col. laboraci is a Web-based system that supports collaborative writing activities. The system provides co-authors with different mechanisms (email <b>notification,</b> modularity <b>of</b> a <b>document,</b> rapid access to a document's sections) that enable them to have different views of the writing task. Nevertheless, Col. laboraci does not detach the co-authors from the teamwork, avoiding to isolate his/her activities from the team, but supports a global perspective of the task. The system has been used in ten different writing tasks. Evidence that co-authors might need different views of the writing task was found. How these mechanisms were used and evaluated by the users is also reported...|$|R

The {{goal is to}} create web application that would be efficient to follow up changes on websites and to inform a user about changes in user friendly way. The analysis of similar existing applications was made to specify requirements of new application. Following the analysis, design of application was made by using different design techniques such as determining use cases of aplication, modelling of data or design of user interface using wireframe. Application was successfully implemented with PHP framework Nette. In conclusion, application was tested and its functionality was demonstrated on the set <b>of</b> input <b>documents</b> and for different combination <b>of</b> <b>document</b> analysis and <b>notifications.</b> The main benefit of the application is the practical usability and wide range of set up <b>of</b> <b>document</b> analysis and ways <b>of</b> <b>notification...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
