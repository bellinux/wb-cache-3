All strains showed significant NADPH-dependent nitrite release at pH 7. 6 and pH 8. 8. Statistical differences in nitrite-releasing activity between strains were found between BALB and PL/J and ATH strains at pH 7. 6. At pH 8. 8, BI 0. M differed from CD-l and BALB. These results are in contrast to a report of little or no denitrification activity in uninduced rats and suggest hat the 2 NP microsomal metabolism may be of greater importance than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|This Letter {{describes}} a fabrication of a microsensor incorporating a novel customised nitro-sensitive polymer {{derived from the}} propylenedioxythiophene family. Electrochemical polymerisation was used to selectively grow different types of localised polymer films on interdigitated electrode arrays, thereby fabricating miniature sensors that exhibited a highly selective and reversible response to chemical vapours containing 'nitro' (NO 2) groups. Such nitro-bearing vapours are also present in trace quantities in {{the atmosphere in the}} presence of explosives. Vapours of <b>nitropropane</b> and nitrobenzene, serving as model analytes for explosives, were used for sensor testing. The sensors were demonstrated to have up to three orders of magnitude higher signal response to vapours from nitro compounds compared to other vapours commonly found in the atmosphere. The authors believe this is the highest selectivity to nitro compounds reported from a polymer-based chemicapacitor sensor...|$|E

40|$|A {{panel of}} bacteria, each genetically {{engineered}} to respond by increased luminescence {{to a different}} type of environmental stress, is presented. Members of the panel were shown to be sensitive to several groups of chemicals including phenols, halomethanes and several oxidants. The increase in light emission depended upon toxicant concentration and could, thus, be used to calculate a characteristic value, EC₂₀₀, designating the sample concentration causing a two-fold luminescence induction. In almost all cases, EC₂₀₀ values were lower than the corresponding Microtox™ EC₅₀ values, indicating a generally higher sensitivity. One of the panel members, DPD 2794, a designated DNA-damage sensor, responded within 2 h to the presence of genotoxicants, including metabolically activated <b>nitropropane.</b> It is suggested that these or similarly constructed strains can be used for the rapid and sensitive detection of potentially toxic and genotoxic pollutants and that the concept of genetically engineering a panel of microbial toxicity sensors can readily be implemented for environmental monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms that biosynthesize broad-specificity oxygenases to {{initiate}} metabolism of linear and branched-chain alkanes, nitroalkanes, cyclic ketones, alkenoic acids, and chromenes were surveyed for {{the ability to}} biodegrade trichloroethylene (TCE). The results indicated that TCE oxidation is not a common property of broad-specificity microbial oxygenases. Bacteria that contained <b>nitropropane</b> dioxygenase, cyclohexanone monooxygenase, cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenases, 4 -methoxybenzoate monooxygenase, and hexane monooxygenase did not degrade TCE. However, one new unique class of microorganisms removed TCE from incubation mixtures. Five Mycobacterium strains that were grown on propane as the sole source of carbon and energy degraded TCE.

40|$|ZEOLITES AND RELATED MICROPOROUS MATERIALS: STATE OF THE ART 1994 The {{effect of}} solvent {{polarity}} on reaction rate and selectivity in the cyclohexylation of phenol over an ultrastable Y zeolite is analyzed {{in terms of}} its effect on the adsorption of reagents and products {{on the one hand and}} on the surface reaction on the other hand. It is shown that in absence of diffusional limitations, variations of activity and selectivity with solvent polarity are determined by the equilibrium distribution of reagents and products between the bulk solution and the cavities of the zeolites, the latter acting as micro-reactors. Polar solvents, as nitrobenzene and <b>nitropropane</b> strongly adsorb on the catalyst and suppress catalytic activity. Due to the high polarity of the solvent, the primary products are expelled from the catalyst, suppressing consecutive reactions. In apolar solvents, the concentration of phenol on the catalyst increases at the expense of cyclohexene, the latter becoming more stabilized in the bulk solution. This also results in decreased rates of primary and secondary reactions. At intermediate solvent polarity both reagents adsorb on the catalyst, resulting in the highest reaction rate. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of aqueous {{solutions}} of 2 -nitropropane in air {{causes a}} slow oxidation reaction that generates H 2 O 2. Purified horseradish peroxidase catalyses the oxidation of such preincubated 2 -nitropropane solutions {{according to the}} equation: [Formula: see text] The pH optimum is 4. 5 and Km for 2 -nitropropane is 16 mm. Other nitroalkanes or nitro-aromatics tested are not oxidized at significant rates by peroxidase. H 2 O 2 or 2, 4 -dichlorophenol increases the rate of 2 -nitropropane oxidation by peroxidase. Catalase inhibits the reaction completely. Superoxide dismutase or mannitol, a scavenger of the hydroxyl radical, OH., each inhibits partially. Aniline and guaiacol are also powerful inhibitors of 2 -nitropropane oxidation. It is suggested that peroxidase uses the traces of H 2 O 2 generated during preincubation of 2 -nitropropane to catalyse oxidation of this substrate into a radical species that can reduce O 2 to the superoxide ion, O 2 − [...] O 2 −., or OH. derived from it, then appears to react with more <b>nitropropane,</b> generating further radicals and H 2 O 2 to continue the oxidation.

40|$|Abstract The {{properties}} of starch nanoparticles (SNPs) labeled with the fluorescent dye pyrene (Py-SNPs) were probed by using fluorescence quenching, pyrene excimer formation, and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). Pyrene labeling of the SNPs was achieved by reacting 1 -pyrenebutyric acid with the hydroxyl groups of the SNPs under basic conditions and {{in the presence of}} diisopropylcarbodiimide. This procedure did not degrade the SNPs as confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and afforded a means to generate a pyrene labeling level ranging from 0. 5 to 5. 0 mol% of the glucose units making up the SNPs. A polymeric quencher was also synthesized to probe the accessibility of the interior of the Py-SNPs by using fluorescence quenching measurements. The polymeric quencher was a 2 K poly(ethylene glycol) terminated at one end with a methyl group and a <b>nitropropane</b> group at the other. Unfortunately these quenching experiments were abandoned when {{it was found that the}} polymeric quencher synthesized for these experiments absorbed too strongly where pyrene absorbs. Intramolecular pyrene excimer formation in the Py-SNPs was investigated by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence. These experiments demonstrated that the Py-SNPs contract but do not overlap like linear polymers do in the semi-dilute regime. They also showed that despite the inherent rigidity of starch, the Py-SNPs deformed in water to allow their hydrophobic pyrene labels to cluster toward the center of the SNPs to minimize pyrene-solvent contacts. This segregation of the hydrophobic pyrene labels led to a distinct core-shell structure for the Py-SNPs which was illustrated in TEM images acquired on films prepared with the Py-SNPs. In summary, this thesis has uncovered some unexpected {{properties of}} the SNPs. Their branched structure makes their interpenetration difficult in the semi-dilute regime which forces them to contract. SNPs are thus deformable and their deformation can be probed quantitatively by using fluorescence and TEM. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research on}} the electronic properties of nitroalkane anions, CH 3 (CH 2) nNO 2 (where n= 0, 1, 2, and 3), using a newly built velocity-map imaging photoelectron spectrometer. The nitroalkanes are an intriguing class of molecules that possess many similarities owing to the dominating presence of the nitro group. They all possess relatively low adiabatic electron affinities, large dipole moments, and undergo similar distortions (largely localized within the nitro group) upon electron attachment. The focus of the studies presented in this thesis is quantitatively characterizing the anion and neutral states, determining fundamental molecular properties (i. e., adiabatic electron affinities, bond dissociation energies, vertical detachment energies, etc.), and highlighting some of the interesting dynamics that the nitroalkane anions can exhibit using photoelectron spectroscopy. The first two studies present the photoelectron spectra of nitromethane and nitroethane anions. As these molecules are small enough to be tractable by a more involved theoretical analysis, ab initio theory and Franck-Condon simulations were utilized to simulate and interpret the photoelectron spectra. In order for the simulations to achieve good agreement with the experimental spectra, additional efforts were directed at characterizing the torsional potentials of the methyl and ethyl groups and predicting the contribution of torsional motion to the photoelectron spectra. These investigations led to new assignments for the adiabatic electron affinities, the first observation of their dipole-bound states in photoelectron spectra, and determinations of the C-NO 2 bond dissociation energies for the nitromethane and nitroethane anion. The third study presents the photoelectron spectra of <b>nitropropane</b> and nitrobutane anions. Each of these molecules possesses a number of stable anion and neutral conformers. Ab initio theory and Franck-Condon simulations were employed to identify possible conformations responsible for the dominant features in the photoelectron spectra. Finally, an anomalous feature belonging to a separate photoelectron emission pathway was identified in the photoelectron spectrum using spectra obtained at different photon energies and through {{an analysis of the}} angular distributions. The nitroalkane anions possess adiabatic electron affinities that are smaller than the transition energies of their fundamental CH stretching modes. As a consequence, excitation of one of these modes will lead to vibrational autodetachment that is facilitated by intramolecular vibrational excitation. The last study presents vibrational autodetachment photoelectron spectra of the nitromethane anion. The spectra were analyzed using several simple models to extract some of the important underlying information regarding the intramolecular vibrational relaxation occurring prior to vibrational autodetachment...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the growing}} {{interests}} in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis {{is due to the}} fact that an increasing number of both synthetic and natural antibacterial compounds specifically target fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes. However, the investigations this approach has engendered have uncovered diversity in this relatively conserved pathway. The enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase catalyses the last step in the elongation cycle of fatty acids. It is not only a key enzyme in the pathway, but also the most diverse enzyme across bacterial species and the target of many antimicrobial agents. Despite this diversity, advanced bioinformatics tools failed to detect any of the known enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR) isoforms in Vibrio cholerae. This dissertation describes the discovery of two novel ENR isozymes by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli fabI(Ts) mutant strain with a V. cholerae genomic library. We first uncovered and named FabV, a new class of triclosan-resistant enoyl-ACP reductases. In vivo and in vitro analysis of the purified protein showed that FabV is an NADH-dependent ENR, and belongs to the same superfamily as FabI and FabL, two of the three previously characterized ENRs. Unlike the Escherichia coli ENR (FabI), FabV is intrinsically resistant to triclosan, the common household antibacterial agent and expression of FabV renders its host resistant to triclosan. Interestingly, we found that FabV is present in a number of important Gram-negative pathogens. Building on our work, the FabV ENR activity was subsequently confirmed by other groups in two important pathogens: Burkholderia mallei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Lu and Tonge 2010; Zhu, Lin et al. 2010). However, fabV was not the only ENR expressed in Vibrio cholerae. Screening of another cosmid library with higher genome coverage identified yet another gene able to restore de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in the ENR mutant strain. The product of this gene called FabS is a novel NADPH-dependent triclosan-sensitive ENR. Unlike FabV, FabS does not belong to any of the known superfamilies of proteins associated with known ENRs (short chain dehydrogenase reductase, SDR or <b>nitropropane</b> dioxygenase, NPD). Interestingly, the analysis of the conserved domains present in the FabS protein sequence links FabS to NADH-quinone reductases. Comparing the presence of conserved domains present in all known ENRs (Marchler-Bauer, Lu et al. 2011) suggests that the ENR activity may result from convergent evolution involving protein domain shuffling. We conclude with preliminary data suggesting the existence of other active ENRs in Vibrio cholerae, uncovering an even greater diversity. The potential physiological relevance of such diversity in this essential enzyme is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from April 7, 2014 - April 7, 2016 This thesis describes {{the development of a}} new enantioselective synthetic method employing chiral cis- 2, 5 -diaminobicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane-based organometallic catalysts. The significance of this new method to organic synthesis is illustrated with preparation of enantioenriched products that are transformed to important pharmaceutical agents. Chapter 1 provides a brief historical overview of asymmetric catalysis, especially the development of salen-ligands and salen-metal complexes. Focus is placed on salen frameworks derived from chiral 1, 2 -diamines and their application in asymmetric synthesis. Chapter 2 introduces the concept of increasing nitrogen-nitrogen separation in a salen framework and the associated enlargement of chiral space. This leads to our proposition that the 1, 4 -diamine motif present in a cis- 2, 5 -diaminobicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane scaffold would provide a superior chiral framework for the salen ligand in asymmetric induction via a metal-salen catalyst. This chapter describes the synthesis and characterization of the new salen ligand and its complexes with various transition and pblock metals. Chapter 3 describes the enantioselective hetero-Diels-Alder (HDA) reaction of Danishefsky diene with a large number of aldehydes catalyzed by our new chromium(III) -salen complex. The reaction provides 5, 6 -dihydro- 4 -pyranones in high yield and with enantiomeric excess up to 96 %. These results compare favorably with those obtained with other chiral catalyst systems. The HDA adducts are rich in functionality and stand ready for conversion into useful chiral building blocks. Chapter 4 further illustrates an application of our chromium(III) -salen complex in catalysis of the enantioselective Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi (NHK) reaction of allyl halides with aromatic aldehydes. The reaction affords homoallylic alcohols in high yield and enantiomeric excess. Extension of this reaction to vinylic halides using the same catalyst is probed but further studies are needed to find optimal conditions for the synthesis of enantioenriched allylic alcohols by this method. In chaper 5, a tetrahydrosalen derivative generated by reduction of our salen ligand in combination with copper(I) triflate was found to be an efficient catalyst for the enantioselective Henry reaction of aldehydes with nitromethane, affording β-nitro alcohols in high enantiomeric excess. The enantioenriched Henry adducts were transformed to important organic materials including beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. The catalyst system when used with <b>nitropropane</b> was shown to give a syn-nitro alcohol in high diastereomeric and enantiomeric excess. Chapter 6 describes an iron(III) complex derived from our salen ligand and shows that it is an efficient catalyst for enantioselective sulfa-Michael addition (SMA) of thiols to acyclic α,β-unsaturated ketones. β-Thiaketones are produced by this method in high enantiomeric excess. This protocol was used to synthesize (R) -Montelukast, an anti asthma agent, from commercially available starting materials in four steps. With asubstituted acyclic enones as SMA substrates, the method was shown to give syn product in high diastereomeric and enantiomeric excess. Chapter 7 shows that a novel iron(III) -salen catalyst bearing our bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane scaffold leads to enantioselective intramolecular Conia-ene cyclization of a β-keto ester bearing an unactivated terminal alkyne. The product, a chiral polyfunctionalized cyclopentane derivative, constitutes a useful platform for further structural elaboration. In chapter 8, it was demonstrated that a cobalt(II) -salen catalyst induces a high degree of diastereo- and enantioselectivity in the cyclopropanation of a 1, 1 '-disubstituted alkene with ethyl diazoacetate as co-reactant. A formal synthesis of the dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Synosutine was accomplished using this protocol...|$|E
