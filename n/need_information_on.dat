[...] "Gmail does set out in their process {{in terms of their}} legal disclosure guidelines that it can be done by a search warrant ... but there are exceptions that can apply {{in different parts of the}} world and different service providers. For example, Facebook generally provides an exception for emergency life threatening situations that are signed off by law enforcement."Another computer forensic expert at iT4ensics, which works for large corporations dealing with matters like internal fraud, Scott Lasak, said that police [...] "would just contact Google" [...] and [...] "being of a police or FBI background Google would assist them"."Whether or not they need to go through warrants or that sort of thing I'm not sure. But even for just an IP address they might not even need a warrant for something like that being of a police background....NSW Police would not comment on whether it had received help from Google. The search giant also declined to comment, instead offering a standard statement on how it cooperated with law enforcement.A spokesman for the online users' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia, Stephen Collins, said Google was likely to have handed over the <b>need</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the basis of [...] "probable cause or a warrant", which he said was [...] "perfectly legitimate".

50|$|Santos and Domenico {{successfully}} {{reach the}} white city of clay - Canudos, {{and both are}} eventually accepted. Other notable events happen, like Manuelo Costa getting married to one of Joao Abado's daughters, much to Joao's dismay. Some minor assaults are also attempted on Canudos, but all are successfully thwarted. During one of them, however, Don Diego deserts the group, greatly angering his comrade, Prudencio. However, all of the Canudosians know that the final battle is approaching, and preparations are underway. Canudosians decide to use the 1000 drahcans Domenico provided them with {{to get as much}} ammunition and supplies as they can out of the Camoorian market. They send Ze Moreira and Manuelo Costa out to the market to buy everything they need, and even though they successfully accomplish the mission and deliver the goods, both are eventually captured by Camoorians. The Grand Marshall along with Federico Cezar realize that they still <b>need</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> how to get past the Caatinga, and try to scare it out of the peasants by having a Camoorian merchant they were dealing with tortured to death in front of them. Seemingly shocked, Manuelo asks for a one-on-one time with the Marshalls. Ze assumes that Manuelo has betrayed them and is shocked and angry. Manuelo tells the Marshalls that there is a secret hole in the ground that would lead them past the Caatinga and that if they release Ze with a message to his wife, he would lead them through it personally. After some pondering, the Grand Marshall complies and Ze is released with a message, but still treats Manuelo coldly. After Ze is safely out of the city, Manuelo refuses to say anything else, and even though the Grand Marshall tries to win him over and even bribe him, nothing works. Grand Marshall Edmondo Betancur then gives the order to torture Manuelo in the worst way possible. Manuelo, however, holds through the torture and dies heroically, having preserved his secret, thus becoming the first of the Five Great Canudosians.|$|E

40|$|Riparian microhabitats in {{coniferous}} {{forests in}} northeastern Oregon {{are sensitive to}} alteration. They have been used disproportionately by people, livestock, and wildlife.
