The initial abstraction and the total volume of rainfall provided by the SCS-CN method are used to identify the ponding time and to quantify the hydraulic conductivity parameter of the GA equation, whereas the GA infiltration model distributes the total volume of the rainfall excess provided by the SCS-CN method.

40|$|Many coastal basins of the Brittany {{peninsula}} (France) {{display a}} high level of nitrate pollution, nine of them highlighted by the European Commission since 2007, as causing algal blooms in several coastal bays. To precisely diagnose and solve this issue the fluxes of every contributing basin have to be considered. However, this faces a strong data-scarce situation as most of the basins are ungauged. In this context, we propose to transpose hydrological information from one gauged basin to neighbouring points of interest. The methodology uses a simple geomorphology-based transfer function on the gauged basin, which allows assessment of the <b>net</b> <b>rainfall</b> time series through the de-convolution of the gauged discharge series.

40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{has a large}} {{impact on}} the vegetation dynamics. To quantify this impact in the Tibetan plateau a study was carried out using time-series of MODIS fAPAR satellite data products and NCEP <b>net</b> radiation and <b>rainfall</b> re-analysis data. The data set spanned over the years between 2000 and 2005. The NCEP data are used to construct a time series of a radiational indicator of drought: daily <b>net</b> radiation and <b>rainfall</b> data for each NCEP grid are integrated {{over a period of}} eight days to match the temporal sampling interval of MODIS data products. The ratio of <b>net</b> radiation over <b>rainfall</b> for a given period of time is a measure of excess energy relative to available water and is therefore a measure of drought hazard. Fourier analysis of time series of the MODIS fAPAR provides two indicators of the response of vegetation photosynthetic activity to drought, as measured by the indicator just described. The two indicators used in this study are the mean yearly fAPAR value and its annual amplitude. The algorithm used (HANTS) fits iteratively a Fourier series to a set of irregularly spaced observations, after elimination of outliers, such as due to cloud-contaminated observations. The relationships between photosynthetic activity of vegetation and the radiational drought hazard indicator are determined and quantified spatially and temporally. The response during the wettest respectively driest year during the period covered by available observations was compared. The drier areas prove to be the most sensitive to climate impact. The analysis should be extended {{over a longer period of}} time to obtain a more robust assessment of climate impact on vegetation dynamics, particularly as regards the response of vegetation to temporal respectively spatial variability of climat...|$|R

40|$|At {{the time}} this project was conceived, rising watertables and {{subsequent}} salinisation {{were considered to be}} the major threats to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the rice growing areas of southern NSW.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} potential hydrological {{impacts of}} changes in vegetation over a shallow sandy aquifer in subtropical Australia, we estimated groundwater recharge and discharge by evapotranspiration (. ET) under three vegetation covers. Estimates were obtained over two years (November 2011 -October 2013) using the water table fluctuation method and the White method, respectively. Depth-dependent specific yields were determined for estimation of recharge and ET. Our {{results show that the}} average annual gross recharge was largest at the sparse grassland (~ 52 % of <b>net</b> <b>rainfall),</b> followed by the exotic pine plantation (~ 39 % of <b>net</b> <b>rainfall)</b> and then the native banksia woodland (~ 27 % of <b>net</b> <b>rainfall).</b> Lower recharge values at forested sites resulted from higher rainfall interception and reduced storage capacity of the vadose zone due to lower elevations when the water table approaches the soil surface. During 169 rain-free days when the White method was applied, pine trees extracted nearly twice as much groundwater through ET as the banksia, whereas no groundwater use by grasses was detected. Groundwater use is largely controlled by meteorological drivers but further mediated by depth to water table. The resulting annual net recharge (gross recharge minus ET) at the pine plantation was comparable to that of the banksia woodland but only half of the corresponding value at the grassland. Vegetation cover impacts potential groundwater recharge and discharge, but in these subtropical shallow water table environments estimates of potential recharge based on rainfall data need {{to take into account the}} often limited recharge capacity in the wet season...|$|E

Observed and forecasted climate modifications in this region, such as the CO 2 concentration and temperature increase and the <b>net</b> radiation, <b>rainfall</b> and wind speed decrease, will likely alter vegetation water stress and modify productivity. In order to simulate how climatic change could alter soil moisture dynamic, biomass growth and fruit productivity, a water-driven crop model has been used in this study. The numerical model, previously calibrated on an olive orchard located in Sicily (Italy) with a satisfactory reproduction of historical olive yield data, has been forced with future climate scenarios generated using a stochastic weather generator and a downscaling procedure of an ensemble of climate model outputs. The stochastic downscaling is carried out using simulations of some General Circulation Models adopted in the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report (4 AR) for future scenarios. The outcomes state that climatic forcings driving potential evapotranspiration compensate for each other, resulting in a slight increase of this water demand flux; moreover, the increase of CO 2 concentration leads to a potential assimilation increase and, consequently, to an overall productivity increase in spite of the growth of water stress due to the rainfall reduction...|$|R

The rationale of this mixed procedure, named CN 4 GA (Curve Number for Green Ampt), {{is to use the}} GA infiltration model to distribute the total volume of the <b>net</b> hyetograph (<b>rainfall</b> excess) provided by the SCS-CN method over time. The initial abstraction and the total volume of rainfall given by the SCS-CN method are used to identify the ponding time and to quantify the hydraulic conductivity parameter of the GA equation. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis of the mixed CN 4 GA parameters is presented with the aim to identify conditions where the mixed procedure can be effectively used within the Prediction in Ungauged Basin (PUB) perspective. The effects exerted by changes in selected input parameters on the outputs is evaluated using rectangular and triangular synthetic hyetographs as well as 100 maximum annual storms selected from synthetic rainfall time series. When applied to extreme precipitation events, which are characterized by predominant peaks of rainfall, the CN 4 GA appears to be rather insensitive to the input hydraulic parameters of the soil, which is an interesting feature of the CN 4 GA approach and makes it an ideal candidate for the rainfall excess estimation at sub-daily temporal resolution at ungauged sites...|$|R

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture launched an ambitious program for constructing small hillside reservoirs in the northern and-central region of the country. At present, more than 720 reservoirs have been created. They consist of small compacted earth dams supplied with a, horizontal overflow weir. Due to lack of hydrological data and the area's extreme floods, however, {{it is very difficult to}} design the overflow weirs. Also, catchments are very sensitive to erosion and the reservoirs are rapidly silted up. Consequently, prediction of flood volumes for important rainfall events becomes crucial. Few hydrological observations, however, exist for the catchment areas. For this purpose a geomorphological model methodology is presented to predict shape and volume of hydrographs for important floods. This model is built around a production function that defines the <b>net</b> storm <b>rainfall</b> (portion of rainfall during a storm which reaches a stream channel as direct runoff) from the total rainfall (observed rainfall in the catchment) and a transfer function based on the most complete possible definition of the surface drainage system. Observed rainfall during 5 -min time steps was used in the model. The model runoff generation is based on surface drainage characteristics which can be easily extracted from maps. The model was applied to two representative experimental catchments in central Tunisia. The conceptual rainfall-runoff model based on surface topography and drainage. network was seen to reproduce observed runoff satisfactory. The calibrated model was used to estimate runoff from 5, 10, 20, and 50 year rainfall return periods regarding runoff volume, maximum runoff, as well as the general shape of the runoff hydrograph. Practical conclusions to design hill reservoirs and to extrapolate results using this model methodology for ungauged small catchments in semiarid Tunisia are made. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Measured annual runoff in the streams was compared to the seasonal <b>net</b> <b>rainfall</b> to give the difference as potential recharge. This was done for five separate sub-catchment where the hillslope catchments gave a smaller proportion of the <b>net</b> <b>rainfall</b> to occur as surface runoff compared to the valley-catchments.

Continuous measurements of standard weather data and momentum and sensible heat fluxes between the forest canopy and the atmosphere accompanied the investigation. The gross rainfall was corrected for catch losses due to high turbulence. Reliable <b>net</b> <b>rainfall</b> data were obtained from a combined application of simple storage gauges and troughs connected to automatic tipping bucket gauges. The evaporation rates from the wet canopy were calculated with the Penman–Monteith equation using the measured aerodynamic conductance to the momentum flux and, additionally, with the eddy covariance energy balance approach. Both methods agreed in the observation that the average wet canopy evaporation rate was slightly higher in the leafless period, due to higher wind speeds and the different aerodynamic properties of the canopy. Together with the lower average rainfall rate this counterbalanced the reduced storage capacity of the leafless canopy and maintained a relatively high interception loss throughout the year being 29 % of the gross rainfall in the leafed period and 20 % in the leafless period.

This paper attempts to fill this gap by assessing the viability of rainfall insurance contracts for agricultural production in Ghana’s Northern Region. Using a stop-loss framework, an optimal contract is determined by choosing its parameters by maximizing the objective function {{in the form of}} covariance between crop loss and indemnity payment, the objective function given a predetermined fair premium rate. The theoretical contract is implemented using monthly rainfall and annual maize crop yield data from 1998 to 2004 from 12 districts in the Northern Region under varying premium rates.

However, by considering the diffuse agricultural sources, the mountain areas are actually at low groundwater pollution risk. The results of overlaying the maps of land use and the groundwater vulnerability are closer to the reality. This study shows that the DRASTIC method is helpful for guiding the prevention practices of groundwater pollution at the catchment scale in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Active slow-moving {{landslides}} in clayey soils exhibit continuous movements generally controlled, {{both in the}} accelerating and decelerating phases, by the {{pore water}} pressure regime that, in turn, is strictly correlated to the <b>net</b> <b>rainfall</b> regime. The paper {{stresses the importance of}} a reliable groundwater model to predict these types of movements. To this aim a procedure is proposed to define the transient groundwater regime in the slope on the basis of recorded rainfall and monitoring data; the model is then used to derive the time-dependent shear strength along the main slip surfaces. The displacements at selected points along the slip surface are computed using a phenomenological (i. e. empirical) relationship between the local factor of safety and the displacement rate at those points. The procedure is employed for the analysis of a well-documented case history: the Porta Cassia landslide (central Italy) ...|$|E
40|$|In karstic areas, {{the mean}} annual stream flow {{is low in}} terms of mean annual <b>net</b> <b>rainfall</b> percentage, and, in many cases, stream flow is so rare to be {{considered}} an exceptional independent of the peak flow value. Nevertheless, many types of flooding processes can be identified in karsts. We consider the recharge-related flooding of a bare karst, with {{a case study of}} a Mediterranean area dominated by semi-arid climate. In these cases floods are rare, short, and sudden but the effects are often very dramatic. Three types of analyses were used. The historical analysis focused on the series of past or historical flood events, which provided a means to define the flood recurrence period and damage levels, and the main steps of anthropogenic development expressed by the population number and needs. The hydrological analysis considered long time series of annual maximum short rainfalls, in order to assess the return period of high intensity rainfall that caused the studied flood event. The geomorphological analysis considered rainfall, the hydrogeological characteristics of outcropping rocks and soils and the geomorphological data of the drainage basin to calculate <b>net</b> <b>rainfall</b> and peak flow characteristics. We explored historical flood events for the study area, characterising the role of human effects on damages, and used a recent flood event to test our capability to estimate ephemeral river flow on the basis of rainfall measurements. The historical analysis of floods and damages highlighted four flood periods, distinguished {{on the basis of the}} recurrence period and the level of damages. It is clear that the lessons of past flood events are quickly forgotten. The hydro-geomorphological analyses showed the peculiarities of the 2005 flood event. The maximum rainfall return period for the 2005 event was due to exceptional three-hour cumulative rainfall. This study shows that we can estimate peak flow characteristics even when time series of river flows are not available, thereby allowing us to improve our capability to forecast the flooding effects of severe storms in karstic areas...|$|E
40|$|Recommendation-oriented {{irrigation}} system evaluation procedures {{have been developed}} at Cal Poly State Umversity, San Luis Obispo, for six irrigation methods. These procedures have been adopted for use by private conSUltants and the Calif. Dept. of Water Resources (DWR) Mobile Lab irrigation evaluation teams. The development {{was funded by the}} Calif.

40|$|Climatic {{warming is}} {{substantially}} intensifying the global water cycle 1 and {{is projected to}} increase rainfall variability 2. Using satellite data, we show that higher climatic variability is associated with reduced tree cover in the wet tropics globally. In contrast, interannual variability in rainfall can have neutral or even positive effects on tree cover in the dry tropics. In South America, tree cover in dry lands is higher in areas with high year-to-year variability in rainfall. This is consistent with evidence from case studies suggesting that in these areas rare wet episodes are essential for opening windows of opportunity where massive tree recruitment can overwhelm disturbance effects, allowing the establishment of extensive woodlands. In Australia, wet extremes have similar effects, but the <b>net</b> effect of <b>rainfall</b> variability is overwhelmed by negative effects of extreme dry years. In Africa, effects of rainfall variability are neutral for dry lands. It is most likely that differences in herbivore communities and fire regimes contribute to regulating tree expansion during wet extremes. Our results illustrate that increasing climatic variability may affect ecosystem services in contrasting, and sometimes surprising, ways. Expansion of dry tropical tree cover during extreme wet events may decrease grassland productivity but enhance carbon sequestration, soil nutrient retention and biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the <b>net</b> precipitation and <b>rainfall</b> interception in a fragment of semideciduous forest at both early and advanced stages of regeneration in Viçosa city, Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil, from January 2012 through July 2013. Six plots were stablished, three in each regeneration stage area. For throughfall and stemflow quantification, 25 rain gauges and collectors were installed in trees having circumference higher than 15 cm, in each plot. An additional rain gauge was installed in an open area to quantify gross precipitation. Gross precipitation in the studied period was 1934 mm. On average, 79. 3 % and 72. 6 % of gross precipitation reached the soil via net precipitation in the areas at early and advanced regeneration stages, respectively. Rainfall interception by the forest canopy was higher in the advanced-regeneration area, corresponding to 25. 8 % of gross precipitation. In the early- regeneration area, on the other hand, rainfall interception accounted for 20. 2 % of gross precipitation. This suggests that more densely populated areas intercept more rainfall, and consequently have lower net precipitation. Thus, our study shows that rainwater distribution in forest environments changes according to their regeneration status. The replacement of species at different successional stages renders the water to follow different pathways, such as interception, stemflow, and throughfall. This information helps us understand that the succession process can be slow, yet it is the natural way of forest regeneration...|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{in general}} has been {{approximately}} 2 % hotter {{and at least}} 6 % drier over the ten years between 1997 and 2006 compared to the 1970 s. The use of water has also increased greatly over this same period. By 2000, 98. 6 % of that year’s surface water yield and 41 % of the annual utilisable potential of ground water was allocated to use. Irrigation agriculture, comprising 60 % of total consumption, {{is by far the}} largest single consumer of water. Given these climatic and water use changes as a backdrop, we employed a panel data econometric model to estimate how sensitive the nation’s agriculture may be to changes in <b>rainfall.</b> <b>Net</b> agricultural income in the provinces, contributing 10 % or more to total production of both field crops and horticulture, is likely to be negatively affected by a decline in rainfall, especially rain-fed agriculture. For the country as a whole, each 1 % decline in rainfall is likely to lead to a 1. 1 % decline in the production of maize (a summer grain) and a 0. 5 % decline in winter wheat. These results are discussed with respect to both established and emerging farmers, and the type of agriculture that should be favoured or phased out {{in different parts of the}} country, in view of current and projected trends in climate, increasing water use, and declining water availability...|$|R
