60|$|This was all over, {{now that}} the ocean of death had sucked in the {{slackening}} tide, and its source was dried up. We first had bidden adieu {{to the state of}} things which having existed many thousand years, seemed eternal; such a state of government, obedience, traffic, and domestic intercourse, as had moulded our hearts and capacities, as far back as memory could reach. Then to patriotic zeal, to the arts, to reputation, to enduring fame, to the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>country,</b> we had bidden farewell. We saw depart all hope of retrieving our ancient state--all expectation, except the feeble one of saving our individual lives from the wreck of the past. To preserve these we had quitted England--England, no more; for without her children, what name could that barren island claim? With tenacious grasp we clung to such rule and order as could best save us; trusting that, if a little colony could be preserved, that would suffice at some remoter period to restore the lost community of mankind.|$|E
60|$|And lo, finally! at Verdun on Sunday the 2d of September 1792, Brunswick is here. With his King {{and sixty}} thousand, {{glittering}} over the heights, {{from beyond the}} winding Meuse River, he looks down on us, on our 'high citadel' and all our confectionery-ovens (for we are celebrated for confectionery) has sent courteous summons, in order to spare the effusion of blood!--Resist him to the death? Every day of retardation precious? How, O General Beaurepaire (asks the amazed Municipality) shall we resist him? We, the Verdun Municipals, see no resistance possible. Has he not sixty thousand, and artillery without end? Retardation, Patriotism is good; but so likewise is peaceable baking of pastry, and sleeping in whole skin.--Hapless Beaurepaire stretches out his hands, and pleads passionately, in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>country,</b> honour, of Heaven and of Earth: to no purpose. The Municipals have, by law, the power of ordering it;--with an Army officered by Royalism or Crypto-Royalism, such a Law seemed needful: and they order it, as pacific Pastrycooks, not as heroic Patriots would,--To surrender! Beaurepaire strides home, with long steps: his valet, entering the room, sees him 'writing eagerly,' and withdraws. His valet hears then, in a few minutes, the report of a pistol: Beaurepaire is lying dead; his eager writing had been a brief suicidal farewell. In this manner died Beaurepaire, wept of France; buried in the Pantheon, with honourable pension to his Widow, and for Epitaph these words, He chose Death rather than yield to Despots. The Prussians, descending from the heights, are peaceable masters of Verdun.|$|E

5000|$|The rising {{popularity}} of digital mapping systems (such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Microsoft Bing Maps) pose a unique {{question about the}} role of cartography in representing occupied territories. These maps are used every day by a wide variety of people. The Google Maps mobile application itself sees an average of 79 million users per month. As seen with the Mercator projection, maps influence the way people view the world. Should these popular digital maps represent the perspective of the occupying countries or should they represent the occupied territories and countries? Do they change people’s worldview by representing the occupying countries? While parts of the occupied territories are labeled on the maps (for example, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip), the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>country</b> associated with these territories is not always labeled on the map (for example, Palestine).
