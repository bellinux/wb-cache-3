25|$|On 19 March, BC 605 and BC 606 were helilifted {{into the}} Tha Tham Bleung Valley; their {{objective}} was nearby Ban Hintang. The next day, GM 31 reached {{the bank of}} the Nam Ngum. BC 605 and BC 606 would have <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> in achieving their objective. They clashed twice with the PAVN before withdrawing southward on 27 March to friendly positions on Zebra Ridge.|$|E
25|$|The Grisons had <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck.</b> The Three Leagues were a loose {{federation}} of 48 individual communes that were largely independent; their common assembly held no real powers. While this had helped avoid major religious wars during {{and following the}} Reformation, feuds between leading clans (e.g. between the von Planta and the von Salis) were common. When such a feud spilled over into the Valtellina in 1619, a subject territory of the Three Leagues, the population there responded in kind, killing the Protestant rulers in 1620 and calling Habsburg Spain for help. For the next twenty years, the Grisons was ravaged by war. For the Habsburgs, the Grisons was a strategically important connection between Milan and Austria. The Valtellina became Spanish, and other parts in the north-east of the Grisons were occupied and re-Catholicised by Austria.|$|E

[...] During the storyline involving Robin and Sunny, Stephen commented [...] "Is she about to disappear into the sunset with someone else? <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck.</b> Looks like we're still {{going to have to pay}} a dingo to carry her off." [...] Following Sunny's departure, Stephen said [...] "The relief at Erinsborough becoming a Sunny-free zone is enormous".|$|E

6000|$|... "There's <b>no</b> <b>such</b> good <b>luck</b> as that, aunt Dorcas. I don't believe there's another feller in town named Joseph Potter, who's been sellin' {{newspapers}} an' {{then went}} into the fruit business. You see, that's me to a dot, an' now Plums an' Dan are in the scrape because they helped me away. Just as likely as not Dan will come here to-morrow {{to ask you to}} take him in, too, an' I've made up my mind that the princess an' I have got to leave. We're goin' away about noon, aunt Dorcas, an' some time I'll be back to pay you for bein' so good to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the true}} God {{as those of}} the new {{religion}} know him is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> God of <b>luck</b> and intervention. He is not to serve men's ends or the ends of nations or associations of men; he is careless of our ceremonies and invocations. He does not lose his temper with our follies and weaknesses. It is for us to serve Him. He captains us, he does not coddle us. He has his own ends for which he needs us. [...] .|$|R
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 28 December 2006 {{that the head}} coach Pat Howard would leave the club {{at the end of}} the season, to return to his native Australia. [...] He was succeeded by the then-head coach of , Marcelo Loffreda after the 2007 Rugby World Cup. [...] Loffreda guided Leicester through the group stages of the EDF cup to the semi final where they defeated Wasps in a knock-out game for the first time since the 1980s. [...] This set up a rematch of the previous years final against the Ospreys, which Leicester lost. After losing all away games in the Heineken Cup that season Leicester failed to progress to the quarter finals. [...] In the league Leicester struggled until a last minute last day try by Tom Varndell beat Harlequins to set up a rematch of the previous seasons Premiership Final against Gloucester. Once again Leicester were successful late on, this time utilising Andy Goode's kicking to secure a last minute victory. In the final they had <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> losing to perennial rivals Wasps. After this final; despite guiding Leicester to two Twickenham finals and only being in the job seven-months Loffreda was sacked.|$|E

60|$|That the two boys, {{instead of}} {{listening}} to her remonstrance, took to punching and kicking one another, was a mitigated form of evil for which she willingly compounded, having gone through so much useless interference already, that {{she felt as if}} she had no spirit left to keep the peace, and that they must settle their little affairs between themselves. It was the most innocent diversion in which she could hope to see them indulge. She only desired that it might last them past a thrush's nest, in the hedge between the park and plantation, a somewhat treasured discovery of Grace's. <b>No</b> <b>such</b> good <b>luck.</b> Either the thrush's imprudence or Grace's visits had made the nest dangerously visible, and it was proclaimed with a shout. Rachel, in hot haste, warned them against taking birds'-nests in general, and that in particular.|$|R
60|$|Can {{this tale}} be true? Is <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> {{given by the}} jealous fates mortalibus aegris? M. de Resbecq's find was made {{apparently}} in 1856, when trout were plenty in the streams, and rare books not so very rare. To my own knowledge an English collector has bought an original play of Moliere's, in the original vellum, for eighteenpence. But <b>no</b> one has <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> any longer. Not, at least, in London. A more expensive 'Pastissier' than that which brought six sous was priced in Bachelin-Deflorenne's catalogue at 240 pounds. A curious thing occurred when two uncut 'Pastissiers' turned up simultaneously in Paris. One of them Morgand and Fatout sold for 400 pounds. Clever people argued {{that one of the}} twin uncut 'Pastissiers' must be an imitation, a facsimile by means of photogravure, or some other process. But it was triumphantly established that both were genuine; they had minute points of difference in the ornaments.|$|R
60|$|At the age {{of twenty}} {{he was taken to}} the Brussels bank as a clerk; but here he soon gave visible signs of disliking the {{drudgery}} which was exacted from him. Not that he disliked banking. He would gladly have been a partner with ever so small a share, and would have trusted to himself to increase his stake. But {{there is a limit to}} the good nature of brothers-in-law, even in Belgium; and Alaric was quite aware that <b>no</b> <b>such</b> good <b>luck</b> as this could befall him, at any rate until he had gone through many years of servile labour. His sister also, though sisterly enough in her disposition to him, did not quite like having a brother employed as a clerk in her husband's office. They therefore put their heads together, and, as the Tudors had good family connexions in England, a nomination in the Weights and Measures was procured.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck!</b> The cost of living--ordinary plain, or garden living {{nowadays}} is, I assure you, {{if you do}} not know----" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} true. A burning house and Grizel among the flames, {{and he would}} have been the first on the ladder. But there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> for you, Tommy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} to hear it,' {{returned}} Martin, shaking hands with him again; 'for I assure you, I was thinking there could be <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> as Mr Pinch's turning out like you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The family {{influence}} must be supported," [...] said Lord Marney, [...] "and {{my mother}} {{will give you}} a thousand pounds; as I said, that will not do much for you, but I like her spirit. Contests are very expensive things, yet I quite approve of what you have done, especially as you won. It is a great thing in these ten pound days to win your first contest, and shows powers of calculation which I respect. Everything in this world is calculation; there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as <b>luck,</b> depend upon it; and if you go on calculating with equal exactness, you must succeed in life. Now the question is, {{what is to be done}} with your election bills?" ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, young people, young people, {{listen to}} what I say! You can be, you will be, you must be, the {{builders}} of your own good or bad fortunes. On you it depends whether your lives shall be honourable and happy, or dishonourable and sad. There is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as <b>luck</b> or fortune in this world. What is called Fortune is nothing else than the orderly and loving providence of the Lord Jesus Christ, who orders all things in heaven and earth, and who will, sooner or later, reward every man according to his works. Just in proportion as you do the will of your Father in heaven, just so far will doing His will bring its own blessing and its own reward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do; I am not delirious, Thomasin, {{nor have}} I been so at all. Don't {{you believe that}} if they say so. I am only in great misery at what I have done: and that, with the weakness, makes me seem mad. But it has not upset my reason. Do you think I should {{remember}} all about my mother's death if I were out of my mind? <b>No</b> <b>such</b> good <b>luck.</b> Two months and a half, Thomasin, {{the last of her}} life, did my poor mother live alone, distracted and mourning because of me; yet she was unvisited by me, though I was living only six miles off. Two months and a half--seventy-five days did the sun rise and set upon her in that deserted state which a dog didn't deserve! Poor people who had nothing in common with her would have cared for her, and visited her had they known her sickness and loneliness; but I, who should have been all to her, stayed away like a cur. If there is any justice in God let Him kill me now. He has nearly blinded me, but that is not enough. If He would only strike me with more pain I would believe in Him for ever!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah no!" [...] said Hans. [...] "Thalers {{are only}} thalers, as my good {{father used to}} say. They melt away like snow, and then nothing is left of them. I will trust <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> as that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He had an idea. [...] "I wish I {{could do}} {{something}} to start a strike or something. <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck.</b> Treat those workmen a sight too well. No, sink or swim, Crest Hill goes on until we're under water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{my husband}} would roam about {{a bit and}} bring back strange {{palatable}} dishes. <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck,</b> he's got asthma and has to keep on a gravel soil with a south aspect {{and all sorts of}} other restrictions." ...|$|E

"'Twould be <b>no</b> <b>such</b> {{bad thing}} if she struck on the rocks, if she brings <b>such</b> ill <b>luck</b> to the castle," [...] muttered Antonio, as he unfurled the sail and grasped the tiller. [...] "There {{would be some}} {{pickings}} for us, beyond doubt--some pretty pickings!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well done!" [...] exclaimed {{the captain}} heartily. [...] "If <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> always attends you, prince, we shall fare well on our journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No <b>such</b> <b>luck.</b> In any case, Richard {{would have}} been in well before me. I always {{maintained}} that he was the first of our googlie bowlers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> for me. I am {{connected}} with the bookkeeping and the blue-print department. I wish I were a first-class civil engineer. I might be earning a much larger salary;" [...] and the man drew down his mouth as he spoke. Evidently he was a fellow who {{was not at all}} satisfied with his position in life.|$|E
6000|$|But {{he was to}} have <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck.</b> Hugo crept {{behind the}} woman, {{snatched}} the package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of blanket which he carried on his arm. The hue and cry {{was raised in a}} moment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden, although she had not seen the pilfering done. Hugo thrust the bundle into the King's hands without halting, saying-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck,</b> Terence. I was in {{the city}} prison, in {{the centre of the}} town; and my window, instead of looking out into the street, was {{on the side of the}} courtyard. The window was {{strongly}} barred, no civilians were allowed to enter the prison, and I think that even you, who have a sort of genius for escapes, would have found it, as I did, simply impossible to get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't {{expect any}} <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> every time," [...] {{returned}} the boy, {{and then he}} {{told the story of}} his troubles in the first restaurant he had visited.|$|R
6000|$|... "No <b>such</b> <b>luck.</b> But they've {{found his}} bicycle. The fellow left his bicycle behind him. Come {{and have a}} look. It is within a hundred yards of the hall door." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The young spalpeen had the impudence to {{say that}} there was I, Captain O'Grady, just the same as when he first joined, and, barring the loss of an arm, divil a bit the better. And the worst of it is, it was true entirely. If I could but find a pretty cousin shut up in a convent you would see that I would not be {{backward}} in doing what had to be done; but <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> comes to me at all, at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah!... You {{drive me}} wild," [...] cried Moore, passionately. [...] "How can you? Where's all that feeling {{you seemed to}} have for me? You nursed me--you saved my leg--and my life. You must have cared about me. But now--you talk about that dolt--that spoiled old man's pet--that damned cur, as if you {{believed}} he'd ruin himself. <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck!</b> no such hope!... Every day things grow worse. Yet the worse they grow the stronger you seem! It's all out of proportion. It's dreams. Wade, I hate to say it, but I'm sure you're not always--just right in your mind." ...|$|E
60|$|But it won't do. It is {{too much}} of a Pisgah sight. We {{overlook}} too much. Descendez, cher Moïse. Vous voyez trop loin. You see too far all at once, dear Moses. Too much of a bird's-eye view across the Promised Land to the shore. Come down, and walk across, old fellow. And you won't see all that milk and honey and grapes the size of duck's eggs. All the dear little budding infant with its tender virginal mind and various clouds of glory instead of a napkin. Not at all, my dear chap. <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>luck</b> of a promised land.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never had}} <b>such</b> <b>luck,</b> really,' exclaimed coquettish Miss Price, after another hand or two. 'It's all along of you, Mr Nickleby, I think. I {{should like to}} have you for a partner always.' ...|$|R
