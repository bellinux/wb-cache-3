5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E

Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor.

5|$|By his own reckoning, Offenbach {{composed}} {{more than}} 100 operas. Both the <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> noun {{are open to}} question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to {{all but a few}} of his stage works as operettas, rather than operas. Offenbach reserved the term opérette (English: operetta) or opérette bouffe for some of his one-act works, more often using the term opéra bouffe for his full-length ones (though {{there are a number of}} one- and two-act examples of this type). It was only with the further development of the Operette genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term opérette began to be used for works longer than one act. Offenbach also used the term opéra-comique for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts.|$|E

5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing {{from left to right}} along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E

The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while on-duty.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> notion of armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to}} the diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{strontium}} is {{a mixture}} of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Their abundance increases with increasing mass <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heaviest, 88Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for 5% of the core inventory of 90Sr.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, {{the first player to}} pocket his private number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private <b>number,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but is not out of the game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E

Vibe magazine later revealed a marriage certificate that listed the couple married on August 31, 1994, in Sheraton Gateway Suites in Rosemont, Illinois. Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time, was listed as 18 on the certificate; the illegal marriage was annulled in February 1995 by her parents. The pair continued to deny marriage allegations, stating that neither was married. One particular allegation among the rumor was that Aaliyah wedded R. Kelly without her parents' knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform <b>number,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E
