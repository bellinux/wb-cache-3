5|$|Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian {{served as}} one of two honorary coaches in <b>Notre</b> Dame's 2007 spring game, an annual {{scrimmage}} held in April. Holtz's Gold team defeated Parseghian's Blue team, 10–6. The same year, <b>Notre</b> Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian's honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. In 2011, Miami also unveiled a statue in his honor {{to add to the}} RedHawks' Cradle of Coaches plaza. It shows him wearing a <b>Notre</b> Dame sweater as he kneels and looks ahead to the field.|$|E
5|$|Along with <b>Notre</b> Dame, South Bend was {{the site}} of the VII Special Olympics Summer World Games in 1987. <b>Notre</b> Dame also hosted the 1983 AAU Junior Olympics.|$|E
5|$|As {{had been}} the case at Northwestern, <b>Notre</b> Dame's {{football}} program {{was in a state}} of flux when Parseghian arrived. While <b>Notre</b> Dame built a proud history under Rockne and Frank Leahy, its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster. The team had finished 5–5 in 1962 under Joe Kuharich, who lost the confidence of his players and <b>Notre</b> Dame's administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich's surprise departure at the end of that season to become supervisor of officials in the National Football League, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, left the program in disarray. Devore, a long-time <b>Notre</b> Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. <b>Notre</b> Dame managed only a 2–7 finish that year.|$|E

5|$|For {{the third}} {{game of the}} season, Michigan faced <b>Notre</b> Dame in the 27th match between college football's winningest programs. Michigan won the game 21–14 {{in front of a}} crowd of 106,508, the sixth largest in the history of Michigan Stadium at that time. Under first year coach Bob Davie, <b>Notre</b> Dame had lost {{consecutive}} games to Purdue and Michigan State, and entered Michigan Stadium unranked {{for the first time since}} the creation of the AP Poll in 1936. <b>Notre</b> Dame ended the day with its first three-game losing streak in 12 years.|$|E
5|$|In the NCAA tournament Final Four UConn met <b>Notre</b> Dame for {{the fourth}} time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish {{prevailing}} and ending UConn's bid for a third straight National Championship. The keys to <b>Notre</b> Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore Skylar Diggins and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points. <b>Notre</b> Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were defeated by the Texas A Aggies.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{came back}} from a 17-point deficit to defeat <b>Notre</b> Dame 35–31, scoring the winning {{touchdown}} with two seconds remaining. <b>Notre</b> Dame started the scoring with two consecutive touchdowns in the first quarter, with the first coming from a seven-yard catch by Theo Riddick, and the second from a four-yard run by Cierre Wood. Michigan's only points of the first half came on a 43-yard reception by Junior Hemingway in the second quarter. <b>Notre</b> Dame answered with a 38-yard field goal by David Ruffer just before halftime to extend its lead to ten points. The score at halftime was 17–7 in favor of <b>Notre</b> Dame. The only points of the third quarter were when <b>Notre</b> Dame's T. J. Jones caught a 15-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter Michigan rallied from behind, scoring three consecutive touchdowns: first a one-yard run by Denard Robinson after Stephen Hopkins fumbled at the goal line, then a 47-yard catch by Jeremy Gallon, then a 21-yard catch by Vincent Smith to give them their first lead of the game. <b>Notre</b> Dame responded almost immediately, as Theo Riddick scored his second touchdown of the game less than a minute later on a 29-yard catch. Michigan received the ball on its 20-yard line with 30 seconds remaining, and drove 80 yards in 28 seconds with Roy Roundtree scoring the game-winning touchdown with two seconds left in the game.|$|E

5|$|<b>Notre</b> Dame {{nonetheless}} {{opened the}} season with a 31–7 victory over heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team's leading passer had over the entire 1963 season. <b>Notre</b> Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against Purdue and then Air Force and UCLA. <b>Notre</b> Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40–0 win over Navy in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against USC, who won 20–17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod Sherman. The loss unseated <b>Notre</b> Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the MacArthur Trophy, a championship awarded by the National Football Foundation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notre</b> Dame outgained Michigan {{in total}} offense {{by a margin of}} 354 yards to 345 yards. <b>Notre</b> Dame's {{offensive}} standouts were Powlus (177 passing yards) and Malcolm Johnson (106 receiving yards). However, <b>Notre</b> Dame was penalized 10 times for 92 yards, including six holding infractions, one of which nullified a pass interference penalty against Woodson. Michigan's offensive stars of the game were Griese (16-of-22 passing for 177 yards), Howard (91 rushing yards rushing on 16 carries) and Streets (3 receptions for 77 yards).|$|E
5|$|Rymkus's {{success in}} high school led to a {{scholarship}} to the University of <b>Notre</b> Dame, where he played from 1940 to 1942. He was known in college as a tough and durable tackle. In a 1941 game against Georgia Tech, Rymkus was elbowed in his upper lip. He left the game to get 14 stitches and returned {{to play in the}} 20–0 <b>Notre</b> Dame victory. <b>Notre</b> Dame went undefeated that season, coach Frank Leahy's first year at the school. During his junior year in 1942, Rymkus earned All-America honors, and in his final season at <b>Notre</b> Dame he was named the team's Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 {{regular season}} started with an {{overtime}} loss to Stanford {{in the second}} game of the season, ending a 47-games winning streak for UConn. Led by juniors Stewart and Jefferson and senior Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, UConn quickly recovered winning every other season game, including a 76–58 win against rival <b>Notre</b> Dame. In the National Tournament, both Connecticut and <b>Notre</b> Dame were seeded first in their respective playoff brackets; each advanced to the Final Four held in Tampa, Florida. Connecticut defeated Maryland 81–58, while <b>Notre</b> Dame narrowly beat South Carolina, 66–65, in the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|The South Bend area is home {{to several}} {{institutions}} of higher learning, {{the most famous of}} which is the University of <b>Notre</b> Dame. Located to the north of South Bend in <b>Notre</b> Dame, Indiana, the University of <b>Notre</b> Dame was founded in 1842 by Father Edward Sorin, a French priest, before South Bend was incorporated as a city in 1865. It has been an intrinsic part of the South Bend area and continues to have a great effect on South Bend's culture and economy.

5|$|Because of Kilmer's close {{identification}} with Roman Catholicism and his correspondence with many priests and theologians, a tree located near a grotto {{dedicated to the}} Virgin Mary at the University of <b>Notre</b> Dame in South Bend, Indiana, has been asserted as {{the inspiration for the}} poem. According to Dorothy Corson, the claim was first made by a priest named Henry Kemper. There are several accounts that Kilmer visited the campus of <b>Notre</b> Dame to lecture and to visit friends, but none of these accounts or occasions date before 1914.|$|E
5|$|Even if the Huskies {{were still}} a strong {{national}} contender, {{they were no longer}} viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe <b>Notre</b> Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. <b>Notre</b> Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East Tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately <b>Notre</b> Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's 2006 {{season began}} with a tough game against No. 2 <b>Notre</b> Dame.

Tech bounced back from the narrow loss by winning five straight games, including a 38-27 victory in Blacksburg, Virginia against the No. 11 Virginia Tech Hokies, who would later go on to finish second in the division.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 the <b>Notre</b> Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for a}} brief time.

5|$|<b>Notre</b> Dame {{began the}} scoring {{early in the}} first quarter with a 1-yard {{touchdown}} run by quarterback Dayne Crist; however, Crist suffered a concussion during the opening drive and was forced to miss the remainder of the first half. Michigan responded with three unanswered touchdowns. First was a 31-yard reception by Roy Roundtree midway through the first quarter, then a 1-yard run by Stephen Hopkins {{near the end of the}} first, and later an 87-yard run by QB Denard Robinson, the longest in <b>Notre</b> Dame Stadium history. After halftime, the Fighting Irish responded with two touchdowns and a field goal. First was a 53-yard pass to TJ Jones, followed by a 24-yard field goal by David Ruffer. Next was a 95-yard catch by Kyle Rudolph, which put <b>Notre</b> Dame ahead late in the game. Michigan retook the lead with 27 seconds left with a 2-yard run by Denard Robinson. Michigan's defense held off <b>Notre</b> Dame on its final drive of the game, with Crist's final pass sailing over everyone and out of the end zone.|$|E
