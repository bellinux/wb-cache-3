Grain size {{is one of the most}} investigated reasons of space and temporary variability in heavy metal concentration. In general, the data on grain size measurement afford to appreciate sorption capacity of sediments and arrange them. The dependence heavy metal content on grain size of sediments has been examined in the enormous amount of research works. The main conclusion is that if grain size decreases, metal content increases. We have carried out sediment grain size measurement of two lakes (Chebachje Lake, Piketnoye Lake) located in the South of Western Siberia, Russia. To define grain size of these sediments the sorting of samples collected layer-by-layer has been conducted by <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>sieves</b> (from 43 to 1000 µm).

40|$|Fractal {{geometry}} {{has become}} a widely accepted descriptive tool for speci"c physical properties of natural soils and fractal scaling has recently been proposed {{as a model for}} soil particle size distribution. In this work, the cumulative mass distribution of dry soil aggregates, M(r(R), was estimated and shown to be proportional to R �- �, where r is the aggregate size, R is a speci"c measuring scale and D is the fractal dimension, which is a measure of soil fragmentation: the larger its value, the greater the fragmentation. Aggregates were collected from a depth of up to 40 cm of a clay soil located at Metaponto (South Italy). The "eld of 23 � 25 m was sampled in 81 sites at the nodes of a semi-regular grid and aggregate size distribution was obtained by dry sieving the soil through a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>sieves</b> (sized 10, 5, 2, 1 and 0) 5 mm). The estimated D values were found to vary from 2 to 3 and were then interpolated by using the geostatistical procedure called ordinary kriging.

Gravimetric moisture content was calculated as {{the ratio of}} weight of water to weight of oven dry soil. It is a weight fraction calculated as subtracting weight of oven dried soil from initial fresh sample weight divided by dry weight of the sample. Following the methods described by Hao et al.

40|$|Iron ore {{samples were}} {{obtained}} from El Bajrawiya iron ore deposits in order to beneficiate these ores. Chemical analyses and microscopic examination have shown that these ores mainly contain valuable mixtures of weakly magnetic iron oxides; (goethite, limonite and hematite), and non magnetic gangue materials; (silica), and clay minerals as major impurities. These materials were prepared to be beneficiated by dry high intensity magnetic separation process, by crushing and grinding to liberate the iron oxide grains from the cement of the ore matrix. Crushing and grinding processes produced significant amounts of fine materials (- 53 μm), {{which could not be}} treated by the available machine within the Central Petroleum Laboratories (dry high intensity magnetic separator). Hence, all ground samples materials were washed to remove the fines by wet screening on the 53 micron sieve. The portions of each sample coarser than 53 μm were dried and screened on a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>sieves</b> to yield four size fractions each having closer ranges for the magnetic separation {{in order to avoid the}} gravity effect on the process. The Frantz Magnetic Barrier Laboratory Separator Model (LB- 1) was used to conduct the separation tests on each size fractions of the washed various ores. Recovery of iron values and the separation efficiency were assessed by determining the percentages of Fe in the concentrates and tailings by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) techniques [...] The separation process was applied on four mixtures of iron oxides as feed for the process. They were having average grades 32. 94, 41. 43, 17. 00 and 48. 00 % Fe. The process of treatment gave concentrates having average grades from the feed 39. 79, 49. 82, 47. 67 and 52. 76 % Fe and average iron recoveries were 86. 83, 87. 63, 76. 32 and 83. 51 %, respectively. The flow rates of the feed into the separator were: 19. 63, 20. 32, 25. 66 and 12. 37 g / minute, respectively. These results were achieved when the Frantiz separator was operated at 0. 8 ampere.

Continuous sampling of peat cores, from Travis Swamp, Halls Bush, Glendhu and Pomahaka, at one centimetre intervals allowed the detection of temporal and spatial differences in charcoal abundance. A set <b>of</b> <b>nested</b> <b>sieves,</b> with a mesh sizes of 250 μm, 125 μm and 63 μm, a digital camera, and image analysis software were successfully used to indicate charcoal abundance. Fire regimes prior to human arrival were controlled by fuel moisture levels and restricted by climatic influences on the lack of a suitable ignition source, resulting in significantly higher levels of fire activity in the Otago region compared with Canterbury. Regional fire activities changed over time due to changes in precipitation or evaporative rates. Polynesian exploration of the South island on arrival was rapid, resulting in a sudden increase in the frequency of fire simultaneously throughout the East Coast, approximately 700 years b. p. Deforestation in the Otago region was rapid and complete, due to low moisture levels, compared with a slower more gradual process of forest loss at the Canterbury sites. European settlement resulted in intensive burning associated with to farming practices, throughout the East coast. This change in fire regime resulted in the further deforestation of forest in the Canterbury region. After deforestation had occurred, fire became restricted due to lack of sufficient fuel continuity in the drier areas.

40|$|Often {{researchers}} find parametric models restrictive {{and sensitive}} to {{deviations from the}} parametric specifications; semi-nonparametric models are more flexible and robust, but lead to other complications such as introducing infinite dimensional parameter spaces {{that may not be}} compact. The method <b>of</b> <b>sieves</b> provides one way to tackle such complexities by optimizing an empirical criterion function over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces, called sieves, which are significantly less complex than the original parameter space. With different choices <b>of</b> criteria and <b>sieves,</b> the method <b>of</b> <b>sieves</b> is very flexible in estimating complicated econometric models. For example, it can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric components in semi-nonparametric models with or without constraints.

D.), Botany, Washington State UniversityThe {{distribution}} of photosynthetically derived assimilates through plants occurs in specialized cells called sieve {{elements that are}} connected to each other forming a microfluidic system within the plant. Sieve elements were discovered over 150 years ago, however their in vivo structure and complete assimilate transport properties eludes clarification. Microscopic investigation <b>of</b> <b>sieve</b> elements requires tissue manipulations that disrupt the natural state <b>of</b> translocating <b>sieve</b> elements resulting in interpretations <b>of</b> <b>sieve</b> element ultrastructure. Construed sieve element structures accommodate the osmotic pressure flow hypothesis. Assimilates are postulated to passively flow through sieve elements {{as a result of}} osmotically generated pressure differences from source to sink. The assimilate stream characteristics are considered to adhere to physical parameters <b>of</b> the <b>sieve</b> element geometry. For this theory to hold the sieve elements must be free major of obstructions. Presented below is a five year compilation on the investigations on sieve element structure and how the structure may relate to function. Cell wall geometries <b>of</b> the <b>sieve</b> elements were investigated with newly developed microscopy methods and the geometries were compared to phloem flow, implicating that phloem flow may not adhere to the dogma of osmotic pressure flow hypothesis.
