40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in identifying the exogenous policy actions of the Fed {{and a number of}} identification methods have been proposed. This paper deals with one of these, namely, using <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> in a recursive structural vector autoregression(VAR). A number of researchers [Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1994 ab, 1996, 1997), Evans and Marshall(1997), Strongin(1995), Pagan and Robertson(1995) and Brunner(1994) ] find evidence of a statistically significant liquidity effect using <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> in a VAR. The success in finding the liquidity effect with <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> in the VAR is attributed to innovations to <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> reflecting supply shocks while innovations to total reserves primarily reflect shocks to demand. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that the opposite is true. Evidence of the liquidity effect in recursive structural VARs depends critically on the existence of a negative covariance between the federal funds rate and <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves.</b> Under a variety of operating objectives, the Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has offset changes in bank-initiated discount window borrowing when implementing the Federal Open Market Committee's policy directive. This practice has created a negative contemporaneous covariance between <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> and the funds rate that has been incorrectly attributed to the liquidity effect. Once the Desk's practice is accounted for, there is no evidence of a statistically significant liquidity effect. Bank reserves; Open market operations; Liquidity (Economics) ...|$|E

The results suggest that the funds rate responded quite rapidly to a change in <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves,</b> but that the short-run <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> multiplier for transaction accounts was only about 18 percent of its theoretical maximum.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that efforts to {{identify}} it empirically have largely been futile, the liquidity effect plays {{a central role in}} conventional monetary theory and policy. Recently, however, an increasing volume of empirical work [Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992 a,b), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1994 a,b) and Strongin (1995) ] has supported the existence of a statistically significant and economically important liquidity effect when <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> is used as the indicator of monetary policy. This paper shows that there is an identification problem associated with using <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves.</b> Specifically, the strong negative relationship between <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> and the funds rate can stem from {{the presence or absence of}} a liquidity effect. The paper points out how changes in the demand for borrowed reserves can be used to identify whether the relationship between <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> and the funds rate is due to liquidity effect. The evidence presented suggests that the "liquidity effect" that Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans and others have identified is actually due to the interest sensitivity of the demand for borrowed reserves and the definition linking nonborrowed and borrowed reserves. Consequently, the evidence suggests that the liquidity effect is nil. Liquidity (Economics); Monetary policy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} U. S. Federal Reserve has adjusted high-powered money supply {{in response to}} macroeconomic indicators.

40|$|The {{expectations}} hypothesis (EH) of {{the term}} structure {{plays an important role}} in the analysis of monetary policy, where shorter-term rates are assumed to be determined by the market’s expectation for the overnight federal funds rate. With two exceptions, tests using the effective federal funds rate as the short-term rate easily reject the EH. These exceptions are when the EH is tested over the <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserve</b> targeting period and when the test is performed only using data for settlement Wednesdays—the last day of bank’s reserve maintenance period. This paper argues that these exceptions are anomalous: In the former case, the failure to reject the EH occurs when economic analysis suggests that the market should be less able to forecast the federal funds rate. In the latter case, it occurs when there are sharp spikes in the funds rate that cannot improve materially the market’s ability to forecast the funds rate. Additional analysis shows that these anomalous results are a consequence of the procedure used to test the EH. Rational expectations (Economic theory); Federal funds rate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of shocks to U. S. {{monetary}} policy on exchange rates. We consider three measures of these shocks: orthogonalized shocks to the federal funds rate, orthogonalized shocks to the ratio of <b>nonborrowed</b> to total <b>reserves</b> {{and changes in the}} Romer and Romer index of monetary policy. In sharp contrast to the literature, we find substantial evidence of a link between monetary policy and exchange rates. Specifically, according to our results a contractionary shock to U. S. monetary policy leads to (1) persistent, significant appreciations in U. S. nominal and real exchange rates and (2) significant, persistent deviations from uncovered interest rate parity in favor of U. S. interest rates.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that Federal Reserve’s money supply can be characterized by a simple rule, whereby {{the growth rate of}} <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> depends on expected in‡ation.

While these results appear to be consistent with empirical evidence on interest rate rules, our theoretical analysis gives rise to novel insights. Applying a New Keynesian model, money supply rules are shown to ensure saddle path stabil-ity, indicating that they do not allow for self-fulling expectations. Further, optimal monetary policy canbeimplementedby a money supplyrule witha negative in‡ation elasticity, implying that the pre- 1980 regime was less e¢cient in dampening macroeconomic ‡uctuations. On the transmission of money sup-ply shocks, we show that a negative in‡ation elasticity raises the likelihood of a liquidity e¤ect and lowers the persistence of the output response. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{central issue}} of {{monetary}} policy analysis is the specification of monetary policy shocks. In a structural vector autoregressive setting {{there has been}} some controversy about which restrictions to use for identifying the shocks because standard theories do not provide enough information to fully identify monetary policy shocks. In fact, to compare different theories it would even be desirable to have over-identifying restrictions that would make statistical tests of different theories possible. It is pointed out that some progress toward over-identifying monetary policy shocks can be made by using specific data properties. In particular, it is shown that changes in the volatility of the shocks can be used for identification. Based on monthly U. S. data from 1965 to 1996 different theories are tested and it is found that associating monetary policy shocks with shocks to <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> leads to a particularly strong rejection of the model whereas assuming that the Fed accommodates demand shocks to total reserves cannot be rejected.

He argues that, compared with Federal funds rate or nonborrowed reserve targeting, a procedure in which total reserves are targeted would minimize the number of difficult economic and political decisions the Fed has to make, protect against pressure to help finance the budget deficit, and make the Fed’s effort to stabilize the price level both more credible and more effective.

The results could be paraphrased as a new Keynesian-new classical synthesis: even though the general price level is sticky for a period of about a year, money may well be close to neutral. We provide a counterfactual analysis of the early 80 's, setting the monetary policy shocks to zero after December 1979, and recalculating the data.

In order to concentrate on the Greenspan period, a vector autoregression is fitted to US data, starting in 1986 and ending in September 2001. Monetary policy shocks are identified, using the new sign restriction methodology of Uhlig (1999), imposing the "conventional view" that contractionary policy shocks lead to a rise in {{interest rates}} and declines in <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves,</b> prices and output. We find that neither the Fed policy choices in 2001 nor those of 2000 were surprising. We provide a method to "explain" these interest rate movements by decomposing them into their sources.

40|$|The {{structural}} vector autoregression (SVAR) {{has become}} a central tool for research in empirical macroeconomics. Because {{the vast majority of}} these models are exactly identified, researchers have traditionally relied upon the informal use of prior information to compare alternative specifications. This paper surveys some of the structural dynamic restrictions used to evaluate SVARs. I provide a method for constructing prior distributions that incorporates this information on impulse responses. Based upon these Impulse Response Priors (IRPs) I employ a formal Bayesian model selection procedure for comparing SVAR specifications. I use this procedure to compare several alternative, six variable SVAR models of the interaction of real and monetary sectors of the U. S. economy. I make these comparisons under a variety of assumptions regarding the nature of the money supply rule, and lag length. Emprically, I find strong evidence in favor of interpreting shocks to the federal funds rate as monetary policy shocks, as opposed to shocks to <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves.</b> The most favored identification is one in which monetary policy reacts to contemporaneous movements in real variables and the price level.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Flow of Funds {{accounts}} {{to assess the}} impact of a monetary policy shock on the borrowing and lending activities of different sectors of the economy. Our measures of contractionary monetary policy shocks have the following properties: (i) they are associated with a fall in <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves,</b> total reserves, M 1, the Federal Reserves' holdings of government securities and a rise in the federal funds rate, (ii) they lead to persistent declines in real GNP, employment, retail sales and nonfinancial corporate profits as well as increases in unemployment and manufacturing inventories, (iii) they generate sharp, persistent declines in commodity prices and (iv) the GDP price deflator does not respond to them for roughly a year. After that the GDP price deflator declines. Our major findings regarding the borrowing activities of different sectors can be summarized as follows. First, following a contractionary shock to monetary policy, net funds raised by the business sector increases for roughly a year. Thereafter, as the recession induced by the policy shock gains momentum, net funds raised by the business sector begins to fall. This pattern is not captured by existing monetary business cycle models. Second, we cannot reject the view that households do not adjust their financial assets and liabilities for several quarters after a monetary shock. This is consistent with a key assumption of several recent monetary business cycle models. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the effects of {{monetary}} policy shocks in Peru, taking into account two important issues that have been addressed separately in the VAR literature. The first one is the difficulty to identify the most appropriate indicator of monetary policy stance, which is usually assumed rather than determined from an estimated model. The second one is the fact that monetary policy decisions are based on the analysis of a wide range of economic and financial data, which is at odds with the small number of variables specified in most VAR models. To overcome the first issue, Bernanke and Mihov (1998) proposed a semi-structural VAR model from which the indicator of monetary policy stance can be derived rather than assumed. Meanwhile, the data problem has been resolved recently by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) model. In order to capture these two issues simultaneously, we propose an extension of the FAVAR model that incorporates a semi-structural identification approach a la Bernanke and Mihov, resulting in a VAR model that we denominate SS-FAVAR. Using data for Peru, the results show that the SS-FAVAR's impulse-response functions (IRFs) provide a more coherent picture of the effects of monetary policy shocks compared to the IRFs of alternative VAR models. Furthermore, it is found that innovations to <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> can be identified as monetary policy shocks for the period 1995 - 2003.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} two potential {{channels for}} {{the transmission of}} monetary policy to the farm sector in the United States. The first one is the money channel where I use a relative-price model to explain the effect of monetary policy shocks on relative farm prices. The second one is the credit channel where I use the Flow of Funds Accounts (FOFA) data to assess the effect of monetary policy shocks on net funds raised in the farm sector;The equilibrium relative-price model provides a linkage between monetary policy shocks and relative farm prices. The model shows that monetary policy can affect relative farm prices if aggregate price information is imperfect and if supply and demand elasticities in the farm and nonfarm sectors are different. The short-run elasticity of supply of farm products is argued {{to be less than}} that of nonfarm products because of differences in the production processes. This characteristic of farm production causes relative farm prices to fall initially in response to a contractionary monetary policy shock;The credit channel for the transmission of monetary policy is another way monetary policy can affect the farm sector. The credit view holds that monetary policy affects the borrowing and lending activities of the farm sector primarily because it affects the extent of financial intermediation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{causality}} introduced by Wiener (1956) and Granger (1969) {{is defined in}} terms of predictability one period ahead. This concept can be generalized by considering causality at a given horizon h, and causality up to any given horizon h [Dufour and Renault (1998) ]. This generalization is motivated by the fact that, in the presence of an auxiliary variable vector Z, it is possible that a variable Y does not cause variable X at horizon 1, but causes it at horizon h > 1. In this case, there is an indirect causality transmitted by Z. Another related problem consists in measuring the importance of causality between two variables. Existing causality measures have been defined only for the horizon 1 and fail to capture indirect causal effects. This paper proposes a generalization of such measures for any horizon h. We propose nonparametric and parametric measures of unidirectional and instantaneous causality at any horizon h. Parametric measures are defined in the context of autoregressive processes of unknown order and expressed in terms of impulse response coefficients. On noting that causality measures typically involve complex functions of model parameters in VAR and VARMA models, we propose a simple method to evaluate these measures which is based on the simulation of a large sample from the process of interest. We also describe asymptotically valid nonparametric confidence intervals, using a bootstrap technique. Finally, the proposed measures are applied to study causality relations at different horizons between macroeconomic, monetary and financial variables in the U. S. These results show that there is a strong effect of <b>nonborrowed</b> <b>reserves</b> on federal funds rate one month ahead, the effect of real gross domestic product on federal funds rate is economically important for the first three months, the effect of federal funds rate on gross domestic product deflator is economically weak one month ahead, and finally federal fundsrate causes the real gross domestic product until 16 months.
