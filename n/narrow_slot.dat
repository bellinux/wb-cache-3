25|$|Attraction {{between the}} plates {{can be easily}} {{understood}} {{by focusing on the}} one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance a from one of two widely separated plates (distance L apart). With a << L, the states within the slot of width a are highly constrained so that the energy E of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region L, where there is a large number (numbering about L / a) of states with energy evenly spaced between E and the next mode in the <b>narrow</b> <b>slot</b> ndash& in other words, all slightly larger than E. Now on shortening a by da (< 0), the mode in the <b>narrow</b> <b>slot</b> shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to minus&da/a, whereas all the L /a states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to da/L (note the denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the L/a modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make a slightly smaller, the plates attracting each other across the thin slot.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at a juicy ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already <b>narrow</b> <b>slot</b> in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call it quits rather than {{spend a lot of money}} to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E

30|$|The fluidic {{channel is}} {{designed}} to be integrated with a hydrogel unit and used to build up a controllable fluidic condition (Fig.  1 b). The fluidic channel consists of two parts: fluidic chamber and latch structure. The fluidic chamber (12, 150  µm ×  3150  µm ×  1150  µm) is the place where hydrogel units have been assembled and the fluid flow. Latch structures are located along the fluidic chamber at both sides as the shape of the long groove and the <b>narrow</b> <b>slots.</b> The long groove (3150  µm ×  300  µm ×  130  µm) and the <b>narrow</b> <b>slots</b> (150  µm ×  300  µm ×  130  µm) of the latch structure are geometrically fitted with latch blocks of the hydrogel unit and prevent disassembly after assembly.|$|R
500|$|As mentioned, {{the main}} {{production}} batch of Southern-built locomotives {{differed from the}} two prototypes, Channel Packet and Union Castle. [...] The steam-operated firehole door treadle was removed, and {{a new type of}} boiler cladding was utilised in response to the worsening supply situation during the Second World War. [...] Modification was also made to the air-smoothed casing surrounding the smokebox after reports were made of drifting smoke obscuring the locomotive crew's vision ahead. Initially, the only form of smoke deflection was a <b>narrow</b> <b>slot</b> in front of the chimney, intended to enable air to lift the smoke when the locomotive was travelling. This proved inadequate because of the relatively soft exhaust blast that came from the multiple-jet blastpipe, which failed to be caught by the air flow. [...] After several trials, the air flow was increased by extending the casing roof over the front of the smokebox to form a cowling whilst side smoke deflector plates were also incorporated into the front of the air-smoothed casing. The latter added to the poor visibility from the footplate and the expedients combined never fully solved the smoke drift problem.|$|E

2500|$|Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The {{third rail}} was below street level. The tram {{picked up the}} current through a plough (U.S. [...] "plow") {{accessed}} through a <b>narrow</b> <b>slot</b> in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still {{be seen on the}} track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington DC, where the abandoned tracks have not been paved over. The slot can easily be confused with the similar looking slot for cable trams/cars (in some cases, the conduit slot was originally a cable slot). The disadvantage of conduit collection included much higher initial installation costs, higher maintenance costs, and problems with leaves and snow getting in the slot. For this reason, in Washington, D.C. cars on some lines converted to overhead wire on leaving the city center, a worker in a [...] "plough pit" [...] disconnecting the plough while another raised the trolley pole (hitherto hooked down to the roof) to the overhead wire. In New York City for the same reasons of cost and operating efficiency outside of Manhattan overhead wire was used. A similar system of changeover from conduit to overhead wire was also used on the London tramways, notably on the southern side; a typical changeover point was at Norwood, where the conduit snaked sideways from between the running rails, to provide a park for detached shoes or ploughs.|$|E
