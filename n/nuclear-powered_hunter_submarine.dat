50|$|As the {{likelihood}} of unrestricted submarine warfare has diminished, thinking about conventional submarines has focused on their use against surface warship. The mere existence of a submarine may curtail surface warships' freedom to operate. To counter the threat of these <b>submarines,</b> <b>hunter</b> <b>submarines</b> were developed in turn. The role of the submarine has extended {{with the use of}} submarine-launched autonomous unmanned vehicles. The development of new air independent propulsion methods has meant that the diesel-electric submarine's need to surface, making it vulnerable, has been reduced. Nuclear submarines, although far larger, could generate their own air and water for quite extended durations, meaning their need to surface was limited in any case.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1930s, {{the main}} focus of Soviet {{shipbuilding}} was building small patrol ships and boats with various duties. Among them, a large part consisted of <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter</b> boats. The MO class was the first Soviet built <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter</b> ship class, with the abbreviation meaning [...] "Small Hunter". Unlike torpedo boats, MO boats had no torpedo weapons, but instead had depth charge launchers.|$|R

50|$|The Aréthuse {{class were}} {{submarines}} {{built for the}} French Navy in the 1950s. They were designed as <b>hunter</b> killer <b>submarines</b> for anti-submarine warfare and were referred to as Sous-marins de Chasse by the Marine Nationale. These submarines had advanced sensors and were very quiet. They were influenced by the World War II German Type XXIII U-boat. They were always based in the Mediterranean.|$|R

50|$|The Thetis-class gunboats, was a {{class of}} five naval ships of the Hellenic Navy, {{originally}} developed for the German Navy as Class 420 and first commissioned in 1961. Similar in size to corvettes, all five vessels were built by Rolandwerft, Bremen. In the German Navy there were designated as <b>submarine</b> <b>hunters</b> (U-Jagdboote).|$|R
5000|$|For Operation [...] "L", the Japanese {{army had}} transported the 229th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Infantry Division from Hong Kong to Cam Ranh Bay in Indo-China. From there, eight {{transports}} departed on 9 February 1942, {{protected by a}} cruiser, four destroyers, five minesweepers and two <b>submarine</b> <b>hunters</b> {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Shintarō Hashimoto to invade Bangka and Palembang. The next day Rear Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa followed with the Western Covering Fleet, consisting of the flagship cruiser [...] with five other cruisers and three destroyers and an Air Group under the command of Rear Admiral Kakaji Kakuta consisting of the aircraft carrier [...] and one destroyer.

50|$|The Croatian Naval Legion {{was formed}} in July 1941. It was {{initially}} comprised some 350 officers and ratings in German uniform, but this eventually swelled to 900-1,000. Their first commander was Andro Vrkljan, later replaced by Stjepan Rumenović. The Croats' purpose in posting a naval contingent to the Black Sea was to evade the prohibition on an Adriatic navy imposed by the 18 May 1940 Treaty of Rome with Italy. This prohibition effectively limited the Croatian Navy (RMNDH) to a riverine flotilla. Upon its arrival at the Sea of Azov, managed to scrounge up 47 damaged or abandoned fishing vessels, mostly sailing ships, and to man them hired local Russian and Ukrainian sailors, many deserters from the Soviet Navy. The Legion later acquired 12 German <b>submarine</b> <b>hunters</b> and a battery of coastal artillery. Lieutenant Josip Mažuranić notably commanded the <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter</b> UJ2303.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy {{had been}} leased White's Island {{during the last}} year of the First World War as its Base 24, to service <b>submarine</b> <b>hunters</b> it was {{deploying}} to Europe as they crossed the Atlantic. It was also permitted to operate a supply station on Agar's Island. These facilities had both been closed on the end of hostilities.|$|R
25|$|HMS Shikari (D85) was an Admiralty S-class {{destroyer}} of the Royal Navy. She {{was built}} by William Doxford & Sons, Sunderland and launched on 14 July 1919.

In 1933, she was briefly commanded by Frederic John Walker, who was to rise to fame as the foremost Allied <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter</b> of World War II.|$|R
50|$|The Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) {{program of}} the United States Navy {{extended}} the lives of World War II-era destroyers by shifting their mission from a surface attack role {{to that of a}} <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter.</b> The FRAM program also covered cruisers, aircraft carriers, submarines, amphibious ships, and auxiliaries. The United States Coast Guard also used this term in the 1980s for the modernization of its s.|$|R

50|$|On 12 May, the {{destroyer}} entered the New York Naval Shipyard for major alterations during her Mark I Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM I) overhaul. Those modifications reflected the enormous technological advances registered in antisubmarine warfare {{since the end}} of World War II and might be considered the beginning of the final phase in the shift of mission for destroyers from a surface-attack role to that of a <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1942, the U.S. Army created {{pieces of}} heavy {{artillery}} (mobile howitzers) {{on both sides}} of the river in Burrwood.

The base was capable of supporting not only civilian pilot boats, tugs, dredgers, patrol boats, but also <b>submarine</b> <b>hunters,</b> mines, PT boats, and ships as large as destroyers.|$|R
50|$|Seawolf {{returned}} to Pearl Harbor on 27 January and sailed for San Francisco two days later. After undergoing a major overhaul at <b>Hunters</b> Point, the <b>submarine</b> headed west on 16 May, with Lieutenant Commander Richard Barr Lynch in command. When she reached Pearl Harbor, she was assigned {{the task of}} photographing Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, {{in preparation for the}} forthcoming attack on that stronghold. She carried out this mission despite constant enemy air patrols from 4 June-7 July.|$|R
50|$|On 15 April 1918, US Naval Captain, W. G. Cutter, {{arrived in}} Bermuda on the SS Arethusa to assume {{command of the}} new US Naval Base 24. Together with a US Naval detachment, {{operation}} a supply station on Agar's Island, this station operated {{for the remainder of}} the war, serving one hundred and twenty-six transiting <b>submarine</b> <b>hunters,</b> which travelled in convoys of between one and two dozen vessels (one vessel sank in Two Rock Passage, the main channel into Hamilton Harbour. It was refloated, but sank again off Agar's Island).|$|R

There were just 2 survivors, {{picked up by}} Farnborough; 35 of her crew perished. Farnborough was commanded by the <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter</b> Gordon Campbell and had on board later Victoria Cross recipients Ronald Niel Stuart and William Williams.|$|R
25|$|Boeing also {{developed}} hydrofoils in the 1960s. The screw-driven USS High Point (PCH-1) was an experimental <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter.</b> The patrol hydrofoil USS Tucumcari (PGH-2) was more successful. Only one was built, but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972. Its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the {{example for the}} later Pegasus-class patrol hydrofoils and the Model 929 Jetfoil ferries in the 1980s. The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton. While the Navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s, the Boeing Jetfoils are still in service in Asia.|$|R
50|$|The US Navy had {{operated}} from a base on White's Island (officially {{listed as}} its Base 24), in Hamilton Harbour {{during the last}} year of the First World War, servicing <b>submarine</b> <b>hunters</b> which travelled across the Atlantic to the European theatre of conflict in convoys of one to two dozen vessels. Many of these vessels had also made use of the Royal Navy's facilities at the HM Dockyard. In addition to White's Island, the United States operated a supply station on the British Army's formerly secret munitions depot, Agar's Island. Both US facilities were closed following the ceasation of hostilities.|$|R
5000|$|The German and Romanian {{formations}} {{suffered the}} loss of 57,000 men, many of whom drowned during the evacuation.

50|$|The Wasp HAS.1 was {{introduced}} to service in the small ships role in 1964, after an intensive period of trials by 700(W) IFTU between June 1963 and March 1964. It served in this primary role with 829 Naval Air Squadron, but also in training units to supply crews for the front line with 706 NAS between 1965 and 1967 and in 703 NAS between 1972 and 1981. Single airframes also served for light liaison duties in the Commando Assault squadrons, 845 NAS and 848 NAS until 1973. Although effective as a submarine killer, it was best deployed paired with a Wessex HAS.3 <b>submarine</b> <b>hunter.</b> In the late 1970s, the Westland Lynx started to replace the Wasp.|$|R
