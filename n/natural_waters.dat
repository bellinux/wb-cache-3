5|$|Boron has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E

500|$|The {{parasite}} [...] {{was first}} recorded in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, {{but until the}} 1990s whirling disease was considered a manageable problem only affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. It eventually became established in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is damaging several sport fishing rivers. Some streams in the western U.S. lost 90percent of their trout. Whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which {{is important for the}} tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, in 2005 anglers in Montana spent approximately $196,000,000 in activities directly related to trout fishing in the state. Some of the salmonids that [...] infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and anadromous forms of rainbow trout—steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their population decline.|$|E
500|$|M. cerebralis {{was first}} {{recorded}} in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards. Until the 1990s, whirling disease {{was considered a}} manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout. In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which {{is important for the}} tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, [...] "the Montana Whirling Disease Task Force estimated trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone". Making matters worse, some of the fish species that M. cerebralis infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations. [...] For reasons that are poorly understood, but probably have to do with environmental conditions, the impact on infected fish has been greatest in Colorado and Montana, and least in California, Michigan, and New York.|$|E

2500|$|Arsenic {{is unique}} among the trace {{metalloids}} and oxyanion-forming trace metals (e.g. As, Se, Sb, Mo, V, Cr, U, Re). It {{is sensitive to}} mobilization at pH values typical of <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> (pH 6.5–8.5) under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states (−3, 0, +3 and +5), but in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite [...] or pentavalent arsenate [...] Organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity, mostly in surface waters, but are rarely quantitatively important.

2500|$|Águas de São Pedro is one {{of eleven}} {{municipalities}} considered hydromineral spas {{by the government of}} the state of São Paulo, by fulfilling certain prerequisites set by state Law. Federal Law no.2,661 from 3 December 1955 states: [...] "It is considered thermomineral, hydromineral, or simply mineral spa the location recognized by state law, and which has springs of thermal or mineral, <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> exploited in compliance with the provisions of this law and the Federal Decree-Law no.7,841, from 8August 1945." [...] This recognition ensures these municipalities a larger budget from the state to invest in regional tourism.

2500|$|Giardia lamblia, {{also known}} as Giardia intestinalis, [...] is a flagellated {{parasite}} that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing giardiasis. The parasite attaches to the epithelium by a ventral adhesive disc, and reproduces via binary fission. Giardiasis does not spread via the bloodstream, nor does it spread {{to other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract, but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine. Giardia trophozoites absorb their nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine, and are anaerobes. [...] If the organism is split and stained, its characteristic pattern resembles the familiar [...] "smiley face" [...] symbol. Chief pathways of human infection include ingestion of untreated sewage, a phenomenon particularly common in many developing countries; contamination of <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> also occurs in watersheds where intensive grazing occurs.|$|E

[...] This conversion of a child to Judaism without {{the conversion of the}} mother is allowed by Conservative interpretations of halakha. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, the child may be immersed in the mikveh with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish. [...] If the mother does not convert, the child may be immersed in a mikveh, or body of <b>natural</b> <b>waters,</b> to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the mikveh, or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a Bar Mitzvah, and complete the conversion then.|$|E
