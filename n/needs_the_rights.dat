Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy {{agreements}} that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the rights to use the information and data to customize advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services, but that the competition uses [...] "more artful language" [...] in the agreements, and also stated that Google <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> in order to [...] "move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails".|$|E

Martin may not have much going for him but he has read [...] "Daniel Strong," [...] a best-selling, self-help novel by the popular TV guru Dr. Waxling (Dennis Hopper).

He sets out to meet with Dr. Waxling but ends up sleeping with Waxling's screenwriter-assistant Marie (Illeana Douglas) instead. Determined to make a movie, Martin and Marie move to New York.

If they aren't careful, this daring duo may not come out of this deal alive.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{analysis}} of a right to existential use of water resources (public waterways and water recipients) by owners of agricultural law located immediately next to these types of water resources. This right covers the right to drinkable water, livestock drinking water and basic irrigation without a use of special irrigation equipment. The right-holder of the listed types {{of the use of}} water resources is different from the right-holder of the general use of water resources. In the earlier case the right-holder is the owner of the riparian agricultural land. The holder of the general right of use may be any person, under equal terms, regardless of whether he owns agricultural or other type of land next to the waterway. The right of the riparian land owners differs from the general right of use because they enjoy priority over the right of use by other persons holding general rights of use over waterways. The water rights of riparian land owners overlaps with the general right of use in that it covers the use of water for existential <b>needs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rights</b> of the riparian land owner are different from the so called special or commercial use of water resources (use of water and water power for commercial purposes, such as production of electrical power, etc.). The difference is that the rights of the riparian land owners is derived directly from the law, without the need for any action by the state organs (water resource permits) and is free of charge. On the other hand, the right to commercial use of public water resources is always based on water use permits or approvals and concession agreements and is associated with a fee payable to the owners of the public water resource...|$|E
