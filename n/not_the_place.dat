If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E

2500|$|As the {{previous}} election had been close, the by-election campaign was an intense {{one in which}} the candidates addressed meetings [...] "at breakfast time, during the dinner hour, and in the evening".

Oldham included many non-conformists who were opposed to the Bill. When the issue of the Bill was raised, the Liberal candidates opposed it, arguing that Parliament was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> to discuss matters of faith; Churchill initially supported it on the basis that legislation was needed to maintain law and order. A Protestant delegation representing several organisations was pleased with the pledge to support the Bill and strongly endorsed Churchill and Mawdsley.

2500|$|In {{its early}} days, this notion was greatly {{influenced}} {{the philosophy of}} German idealism, from which its founders drew much inspiration: belief in humanity marching toward {{a full understanding of}} itself and the divine, manifested in moral progress towards perfection. This highly rationalistic view virtually identified human reason and intellect with divine action, leaving little room for direct influence by God. Geiger conceived revelation as occurring via the inherent [...] "genius" [...] of the People Israel, and his close ally Solomon Formstecher described it as the awakening of oneself into full consciousness of one's religious understanding. The American theologian Kaufmann Kohler also spoke of the [...] "special insight" [...] of Israel, almost fully independent from direct divine participation, and English thinker Claude Montefiore, founder of Liberal Judaism, reduced revelation to [...] "inspiration", according intrinsic value only to the worth of its content while [...] "it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where they are found that makes them inspired."

2500|$|On October 2, the PKI {{newspaper}} Harian Rakjat {{published an}} editorial {{that would eventually}} be used {{as evidence that the}} Communists had organized the coup attempt by Untung and his group. Anderson and McVey noted that the Harian Rakjat [...] "prided itself on well written and cogently argued editorials", but the editorial in question [...] "is no gem of style or clarity". They believed that the [...] "foolish hesitant editorial" [...] provided the Army an opportunity to place the blame of the coup on the PKI. Since the coup, Anderson and McVey noted that the Army's success in blaming the PKI was [...] "both because of actual PKI involvement, however confused, and because all groups now in power wish to believe it, since for years they lived in growing fear of a possible PKI takeover". To conclude their observations of the events of and following the coup, Anderson and McVey asserted, [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> here to go into the details of the anti-Communist campaign which developed {{in the wake of the}} Army coup of October 1." [...] However, they believed that the coup itself and subsequent events formed [...] "quite separate political phenomena" [...] despite being [...] "intimately related". Anderson and McVey believed this to be the case because of a three-week absence of violence that ended on October 21, when Communist youth elements clashed with the Army Para-Commando Regiment ( [...] , abbreviated as RPKAD) in Boyolali Regency.|$|E

2500|$|The ruling {{noted that}} the {{rejection}} of some past appeals by the Supreme Court were not necessarily {{a sign that the}} appeal was ill-founded, and such meaning should not be read into them ("this kind of action - or inaction - imports no expression upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times"). The ruling examined various dubious bases often allowed by States for marriage, and the extent of sanctimonious expressions used in discussing and practicing marriage, and the deference owed to individual states' legislative power to examine such questions at their own pace, and the fact that just one year had passed from the first legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States to the matters leading to this case. It concluded that [...] "what we are left with, is [...] by creating a status (marriage) and subsidizing it (with privileges) the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for the purposes of rearing offspring". The court also described the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Windsor as one that should be seen less as an affirmation of same-sex marriage, and instead, as a case concerning Federal law encroachment upon State law, in which it had been confirmed that it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of the Federal legislation to effectively seek to determine for all States how they should each treat same-sex marriage. Writing for the majority, Judge Jeffrey Sutton also dismissed the arguments made on behalf of same-sex couples in this case: [...] "Not one of the plaintiffs' theories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place it has been since the founding: in the hands of state voters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liquidation is the final, most frequent, {{and most}} basic {{insolvency}} procedure. Since registered companies became {{available to the}} investing public, the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844 and all its successors contained a route for a company's life {{to be brought to}} an end. The basic purpose of liquidation is to conclude a company's activities and to sell off assets (i.e. [...] "liquidate", turn goods into [...] "liquid assets" [...] or money) to pay creditors, or shareholders if any value remains. Either the company (its shareholders or directors) can initiate the process through a [...] "voluntary liquidation", or the creditors can force it through a [...] "compulsory liquidation". In urgent circumstances, a provisional liquidation order can also be granted if there is a serious threat to dissipation of a company's assets: in this case, a company may not be notified. By contrast, a voluntary liquidation begins if the company's members vote to liquidate with a 75 per cent special resolution. If the directors can make a statutory declaration that the company is solvent, the directors or shareholders remain in control, but if the company is insolvent, the creditors will control the voluntary winding up. Otherwise, a [...] "compulsory liquidation" [...] may be initiated by either the directors, the company, some shareholders or creditors bringing a petition for winding up to the court. In principle, almost any member (this is usually shareholders, but can also be anyone registered on the company's member list) can bring a petition for liquidation to begin, so long as they have held shares for over six months, or there is only one shareholder. In Re Peveril Gold Mines Ltd Lord Lindley MR held that a company could not obstruct a member's right to bring a petition by requiring that two directors consented or the shareholder had over 20 per cent of share capital. A member's right to bring a petition cannot be changed by a company constitution. However, in Re Rica Gold Washing Co the Court of Appeal invented an extra-statutory requirement that a member must have a sufficient amount of money (£75 was insufficient) invested before bringing a petition. For creditors to bring a petition, there must simply be proof that the creditor is owed a debt that is due. In Mann v Goldstein the incorporated hairdressing and wig business, with shops in Pinner and Haverstock Hill, of two married couples broke down in acrimony. Goldstein and his company petitioned for winding up, claiming unpaid directors fees and payment for a wig delivery, but Mann argued that Goldstein had received the fees through ad hoc payments and another company owed money for the wigs. Ungoed Thomas J held the winding-up petition was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> to decide the debt actually existed, and it would be an abuse of process to continue.|$|E
