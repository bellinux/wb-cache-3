25|$|Other {{eutrophication}} studies {{performed in}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008). To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes {{to look at}} the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supply</b> was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. This study suggests that eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the onset}} of the Green Revolution {{in the middle of the}} last century, vast amounts of {{nitrogen}} fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven fertilization. As discussed earlier, nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass. and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supply</b> over four years of growth. Global Change Biology. 6, 13-24. This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth rates will lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study. With this increase in productivity, an increase in soil activities and therefore respiration can be assured.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of nitrogen and sulfur as essential nutrients {{in the growth}} and development of plants is well documented. Nitrate concentration is an important criterion for food quality, and sulfur concentration affects the nutritive value and organoleptic properties of vegetables. Groundwater contamination due to nitrogen fertilizers {{is a major concern}} in agriculture. This research was done to determine if <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supplied</b> to lettuce could be reduced by addition of sulfur and what effect altering the nutrient balance would have on quality. ^ The first series of experiments was designed to modify a hydroponic system for 2 ̆ 7 Grand Rapids 2 ̆ 7 leaf lettuce production. The system was used to screen twenty-four nitrogen-sulfur combinations from which treatments for further experiments would be selected. The intent was also to determine if a {{reduction in the number of}} treatments per block using an incomplete factorial design would yield results equivalent to a complete factorial design. ^ Eight treatment combinations were selected from the preliminary screening for further study. The purpose was to determine the effect of various levels of <b>nitrogen</b> and sulfur <b>supplied</b> on: fresh weight, dry weight, leaf nitrogen content, leaf sulfur content, ascorbic acid content, color, and sensory attributes of leaf lettuce. ^ The incomplete design failed to yield results equivalent to the complete factorial design. Leaf nitrogen content increased as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supplied</b> increased, but declined at 240 ppm nitrogen. Leaf sulfur content increased with increased application of sulfur and <b>nitrogen.</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>supplied</b> affected color such that plants receiving 240 ppm nitrogen were a darker, duller green, and plants receiving 30 ppm nitrogen were a lighter, vivid yellow-green. Ascorbic acid content increased as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supplied</b> increased. Sulfur had no detectable effect on ascorbic acid content. Differences in sensory evaluation were due to <b>nitrogen</b> and sulfur <b>supplied.</b> Sulfur and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supplied</b> had similar effects on winter and spring grown lettuce, but the magnitude of difference was greater in the spring. ...|$|R

50|$|Nitrogen {{nutrition}} {{is another}} factor that affects the yield of Cicer arietinum, although the application itself differs from other perennial crops {{with regards to the}} levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant. Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of Cicer arietinum. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supply</b> all {{have an effect on the}} yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that Cicer arietinum differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supply</b> from soil during drought stress.

40|$|The {{effective}} <b>supply</b> of <b>nitrogen</b> to algal cultures is {{an important}} aspect of intensive cultivation and critical if the biomass is {{to be used as a}} source of protein. In this study two complementary experiments examine how variation in the <b>supply</b> of <b>nitrogen</b> to cultures influenced the biomass productivity and protein content of the freshwater macroalga, Oedogonium. The first examined how robust Oedogonium is to the intermittent <b>supply</b> of <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>supplied</b> weekly, every second week or every third week) by quantifying its biomass productivity, photosynthetic capacity and internal nitrogen content through time. Biomass productivity over a 12 -week period was highest (10. 6 g DW m− 2 day− 1) when <b>nitrogen</b> was <b>supplied</b> weekly and lowest (8. 1 g DW m− 2 day− 1) when <b>nitrogen</b> was <b>supplied</b> every third week. The second experiment examined the recovery of nitrogen and amino acids in the biomass following periods of nitrogen-depletion. Prolonged periods (2 weeks) without nitrogen reduced the internal nitrogen and amino acid content of the biomass by up to 80 %. However, in all treatments the internal nitrogen content recovered within 24 – 48 h and the amino acid content had recovered within 72 h following the resupply of external nitrogen. These results demonstrate that <b>nitrogen</b> should be <b>supplied</b> in a relatively constant manner to maximize the growth rates of Oedogonium; however, the protein in nitrogen-deplete cultures can be rapidly rejuvenated by the addition of nitrogen in the days prior to harvest...|$|R

50|$|A single {{plant with}} its {{associated}} fungus {{is not an}} isolated entity. It has been shown that mycelia from the roots of one plant actually colonize the roots of nearby plants, creating an underground network of plants of the same or different species.

For example, Cheng and Baumgartner found that about 25% of the labeled <b>nitrogen</b> <b>supplied</b> to a source plant, in this case a grass species, was transferred to the sink plant, grapevine.

50|$|Rhizo{{bacteria}} are root-colonizing {{bacteria that}} form symbiotic relationships with many plants. The {{name comes from}} the Greek rhiza, meaning root.

The two major classes of relationships are rhizospheric and endophytic. Rhizospheric relationships consist of the PGPRs that colonize the surface of the root, or superficial intercellular spaces of the host plant, often forming root nodules. The dominant species found in the rhizosphere is a microbe from the genus Azospirillum. Endophytic relationships involve the PGPRs residing and growing within the host plant in the apoplastic space.|$|E
