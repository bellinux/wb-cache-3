40|$|The modern pulp {{industry}} has endeavoured to maximize its efficiency and minimize its environmental impact for decades. The bleaching process {{has a major}} impact on the heat, power and chemical consumption of the pulp mill, and hence bleaching constitutes an at-tractive process to be optimized in order to increase the performance of the mill further. Catalytic bleaching is a novel discovery which could decrease the duration of the bleaching processes. So far the catalytic bleaching has been demonstrated to work successfully only in the HcatZP sequence. For this reason, the goal of this thesis was to clarify if <b>new</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp bleaching sequences with initial chlorine dioxide (D) stage and an intermediate Hcat stage could provide fully bleached pulps. In order to design the new catalytic sequences, a literature review was elaborated on diffrerences between softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, the basics of pulp bleaching, the reactions of lignin and carbohydrates during bleaching processes and the ideal operational parameters in these processes. The eucalyptus pulp bleaching sequences studied included D 0 EHcatP which achieved a final brightness of 88. 0 % ISO and HcatZ/DP which attained a brightness of 89. 2 % ISO. Addi-tionally, a reference trial AEOPDP was performed to check the bleachability of the pulp. This sequence achieved a brightness of 88. 0 % ISO, which suggested that the pulp used was quite hard to bleach. In conclusion, HcatZ/DP was the best sequence for catalytic bleaching of eucalyptus kraft pulp. The softwood bleaching sequence OEOPHcatDP reached a final brightness of 75. 2 % ISO...|$|E
40|$|The kraft process dominates {{pulp and}} paper {{production}} worldwide. Black liquor, a mixture of lignin and inorganic chemicals, is generated in this process as fiber is extracted from wood. At most kraft milIs today, black liquor is burned in Tomlinson boilers to produce steam for on-site heat and power and to recover the inorganic chemicals for reuse in the process. GlobalIy, the black liquor generation rate is about 85, 000 MW fuel (or 0. 5 InilIion tonnes of dry solids per day), with nearly 50 % of this in North America. <b>New</b> <b>kraft</b> production capacity is being added most rapidly in Brazil, Indonesia, and other regions with low wood production costs and relatively low per-capita levels of paper use.

40|$|Few western {{figures have}} {{received}} the attention George Armstrong Custer has. Since his death in 1876, his name and fame have alternately been attacked and defended by writers. Using a variety of primary and secondary sources, Louis Kraft 2 ̆ 7 s recent monograph falls into the latter camp. As Volume Five of the Custer Trail Series, Custer and the Cheyennes incorporates alternating points-of-view of both whites and natives, using extensive quotes to let the actors speak for themselves. In this manner, Kraft presents a chronological narrative of Custer 2 ̆ 7 s frontier beginnings on the Southern Plains of Kansas, Texas, and Indian Territory (Oklahoma) against the Tsistsistas (Southern Cheyennes). In addition to containing informative footnotes and bibliography, the book is handsomely designed with photos, art work, and maps. The price, however, may deter {{all but the most}} ardent Custerophiles. Kraft centers his discussion on General Philip Sheridan 2 ̆ 7 s use of total warfare against Indian nations to achieve total capitulation and, ultimately, total peace. Whereas summer war and winter peace had long been the unspoken rule for Indian warfare, Sheridan sent Custer on a winter campaign to catch the Southern Plains tribes when they were immobile and vulnerable. After reaching Chief Black Kettle 2 ̆ 7 s camp on the Washita River in late November of 1867, Custer attacked at dawn, destroying the band 2 ̆ 7 s remuda, lodges, and food supply. With the death and captivity of hundreds of T sistsistas men, women, and children, the survivors were left with the option of starving and freezing to death on the Plains or moving to the reservation. Placed in this no-win situation, a few Tsistsistas made it north of the Platte River to join the Northern Cheyennes and their friends the Dakotas in their resistance to the US military. The vast majority, however, were escorted to their reservation in Indian Territory. While the massacre at the Washita marked Custer 2 ̆ 7 s first major frontier victory since his court-martial in 1867 (an event Kraft attributes to Major General W. F. Hancock 2 ̆ 7 s ineptness), it also began several controversies that hounded Custer to his grave. The execution of women and children at the Washita, combined with Custer 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to search for and rescue his second in command, Joel Elliot, sparked resentment by some of Custer 2 ̆ 7 s officers, notably Frederick Benteen, and gained him negative publicity in the press. Kraft attributes both of these actions to insubordination and disobedience by Custer 2 ̆ 7 s men. Occasionally, Kraft becomes too attached to his subject. He insists Custer became something of a pacifist after the Battle of the Washita simply because he did not attack on several occasions when he had the chance. He also seems overly interested in the alleged sexual liaison between Custer and one of the pregnant Cheyenne captives, Meotzi, who may have born him a son. Although his book presents little that is <b>new,</b> <b>Kraft</b> has delivered an adequate retelling of Custer 2 ̆ 7 s winter campaign on the Southern Plains...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} report is the econometric analysis of product market definition and unilateral market power that the senior author presented as expert economic {{witness for the}} state of New York in State of <b>New</b> York v. <b>Kraft</b> General Foods et al. at trial in September 1994. It is the first, and to date as of September 1997, only full-scale attempt to present in a federal district court analysis of a mergers impact using scanner generated brand level data and econometric techniques to estimate brand and category level elasticities of demand. The court rejected this analysis [State of <b>New</b> York v. <b>Kraft</b> General Foods, 926 F. supp. 358 (S. D. N. Y. 1995) ]. We think that it should not have done so, and would like to make this work more readily available than the court record so that economists who are working on the analysis of market definition and market power can review it. Also, this study is the only public study to date that has had access to weekly brand level coupon distribution data by city, and Nielsen group rating points (GRP), which are weekly measures of ad exposure for a brand in local city market areas. Thus it provides own and cross brand coupon and advertising elasticities. The empirical results are generally as hypothesized; own advertising and couponing increase sales, competitor activities reduce sales. The genesis of this work during litigation is an interesting story for those who would attempt to do similar work on a merger case. The acquisition of Nabisco Shredded Wheat by Philip Morris via its Kraft General Foods subsidiary occurred in the fall of 1992. Robert Abrams, the New York Attorney General, announced his challenge of the merger in January 1993. For over a year litigation moved through a series of hearings and rulings. In the spring of 1994 and earlier, the state of New York asked via discovery for any scanner data on Ready-to-Eat (RTE) cereal that the defendants possessed. Defendants provided no data. In July 1994, in preparation for the trial that occurred in September/October 1994, the senior author of this report prepared Expert Report of Ronald W. Cotterill [93 Civ. 0811 (KMW) ]. Exhibit 6 of that report was an analysis of unilateral market power using brand level elasticities of demand from the business records of the defendants. It documented the exercise of unilateral market power between Post and Nabisco brands. The first section of that exhibit is reproduced as the foreword to this report because it nicely explains unilateral power analysis. 1 Defendants responded to this statistical analysis by introducing on the eve of trial (August 29, 1994) in Expert Report of Daniel L. Rubinfeld [their economist] a comprehensive scanner data set for the leading brands of breakfast cereal and an analysis to refute our work. Using the scanner data that finally became available, we had 18 days to produce the analysis presented in this {{research report}}. It was presented to the court as Exhibit C in Affidavit of Professor Ronald W. Cotterill, September 16, 1994 (State of <b>New</b> York v. <b>Kraft</b> General Foods et al. 93 Civ. 0811 [KMW]). One of defendants responses to this econometric study was to introduce data for four additional brands during trial and claim that their incorporation destroyed a key market definition result of this analysis. In fact, when those brands were included the general conclusions of this study did not change [trial transcript @ Vol. 7, p. 1249]. Defendants also presented other criticisms of this study at trial and we rebutted them. Here we are not presenting arguments made at trial surrounding this report, nor are we presenting any discussion from Judge Woods opinion wherein she rejects this analysis. A full understanding of this econometric foray into court requires reading of the defendants economist expert report, especially the statistical analysis, the trial transcript, and the courts opinion. The defendants economists report is briefly critiqued {{at the end of this}} report (pages 17 - 19). It is a classic example of garbage in garbage out analysis.

40|$|Human {{history is}} {{characterized}} by an abundance of cruelty but few people {{think of themselves as}} cruel. To help resolve this paradox and to understand how ordinary people can commit extraordinary acts of violence, I analyzed testimony from seventy-four perpetrators who committed violent political crimes in apartheid South Africa. Perpetrators gave their testimony to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in exchange for the opportunity to receive amnesty for their crimes, an exchange that provided strong incentive for detailed and comprehensive accounts of their destructive actions. Applying phenomenological analysis to the testimony, this study disclosed the beliefs, motivations, and incentives for committing violent political crimes and the responses to confronting the consequences of this violence. The testimony revealed that perpetrators became violent in a step-wise process, motivated by an abbreviated ideology that framed their actions as personally fulfilling, professionally beneficial, and morally justified. Perpetrators maintained their collective harm-doing with rational reasons, moral principles, a desire for group cohesiveness, and a drive to excel at what they considered meaningful work.

40|$|Chlorinated organic {{molecules}} may {{be removed from}} wastewaters by adsorption onto the biomass present in biological treatment systems. This study assessed the adsorption onto biological solids of Adsorbable Organic Halide (AOX) from two <b>New</b> Zealand <b>kraft</b> pulp and paper mill bleach plant wastewaters. Batch adsorption {{studies were carried out}} to determine the characteristics of this adsorption process, with activated sludge as an adsorbent. Different molecular weight AOX fractions from two bleach plants' wastewaters were studied. The first wastewater was a combined C and E stage effluent from the CEH bleach sequence previously used at the Tasman Pulp and Paper Co. Ltd, Kawerau. The second was a combined D and E o stage effluent from the OODEoD bleach sequence used at New Zealand Forest Products Kinleith Mill, Tokoroa. For each mill's wastewater, the adsorption isotherms were characterised for four different molecular weight fractions, and the unfractionated wastewater. Adsorption isotherm models used to fit the data for each of the fractions were the Freundlich, Langmuir and Irreversible isotherms. No single model was able to successfully describe the adsorption characteristics for all of the fractions analysed, indicating significant differences in the adsorption processes occurring in the various fractions. Analysis of the adsorption of the different molecular weight fractions demonstrated that the adsorption affinity of the AOX increased with increasing molecular weight. It appeared that molecules with higher chlorination levels were more effectively adsorbed onto the biomass. Competition for adsorption sites on the biomass by the different molecular weight fractions was a significant factor in the adsorption of the unfractionated wastewater. Analysis of the adsorption of AOX from the wastewaters at concentrations typical of those expected in different biological treatment systems showed that: • treatment systems with low biomass concentrations, such as aerated lagoons, would not be expected to remove significant amounts of AOX by adsorption. • treatment systems utilising higher biomass levels have the potential to remove significant amounts of AOX by adsorption. Conventional activated sludge systems could remove 15 - 20 %, and oxygen activated sludge systems 25 - 50 % of the AOX entering these systems. The impact of the modernisation of bleach sequences on the adsorption of AOX, by the introduction of oxygen delignification and chlorine dioxide substitution, was assessed. This was carried out by comparison of the adsorption characteristics of the two mills' wastewaters. The Tasman mill's bleach sequence was used as an example of older, conventional bleaching, and the Kinleith mill's sequence an example of modernised bleaching. Significant differences were found in the adsorptive behaviour of the molecular weight fractions, and that of the unfractionated wastewaters, between the two. From the analysis, adsorption onto biomass in a biological treatment system is predicted to alter the molecular weight distribution of the AOX in wastewaters. The conventional sequence's wastewater should show a decrease in the proportion of high molecular weight AOX due to this adsorptive removal, an effect not as significant in the adsorption of AOX from a modern bleach plant wastewater. Modern bleach sequence wastewaters are expected to reveal a decrease in the proportion of the low molecular weight material, an effect not as notable for the conventional sequence's AOX. Modernisation was found to decrease the adsorptive affinity of the wastewater, suggested to be due to the lower chlorination levels and average molecular weights of the molecules in the wastewater. It was concluded that the modernisation of bleach sequences has reduced the significance of adsorption onto biological solids as an AOX removal mechanis...|$|R
