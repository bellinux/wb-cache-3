Furthermore, the decreasing apoptotic events and reactive oxygen species production along with increasing expression of heat shock proteins also confirmed the beneficial effect of Selaginella bryopteris water extract.

This is a relevant aspect for threatened species, potentially menaced by an epizooty and from which {{it is difficult to}} obtain gametes. As a first step for properly cryobanking skin samples of a given species, the optimal conditions of culture and freezing have to be studied by covering a broad range of possibilities. This paper presents, for the first time, a systematic study of such conditions for the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). To that end, we have analyzed twenty different culture conditions and fifteen different <b>freezing</b> <b>solutions</b> for skin explants, as well as three <b>freezing</b> <b>solutions</b> for isolated cells derived from them. The culture conditions included both two different culture strategies and several combinations of nutritional supplements and mitotic agents. For the <b>freezing</b> <b>solutions,</b> we have considered different concentrations of the permeating cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide (Me(2) SO) either alone (5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 %, 12. 5 % and 15 % v/v for explants, 10 % for isolated cells) or along with the non-permeating cryoprotectant sucrose (0. 1 or 0. 2 M). Our results have been analyzed through several quantitative parameters and show that only thawed explants cryopreserved in Me(2) SO (10 %) either alone or with sucrose (0. 2 M) presented similar properties to those in optimal fresh cultures. In addition, for these freezing conditions, isolated thawed cells also presented high survival rates (90 %) and percentages of cellular functionality (85 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently {{described}} slow-cooling cryopreservation protocols involving elevated sucrose concentration {{have improved}} survival frequencies of human oocytes, potentially overcoming a major hurdle that has limited {{the adoption of}} oocyte storage. Because implantation rates of embryos from frozen oocytes remain generally low, it is still debated whether, irrespective of survival rates, this form of cryopreservation leads inevitably to the disruption or complete loss of the metaphase II (MII) spindle. METHODS: Human oocytes with an extruded polar body I (PBI) were cryopreserved using a slow-cooling method including 1. 5 mol/l propane- 1, 2 -diol (PrOH) and alternative sucrose concentrations (either 0. 1 or 0. 3 mol/l) in the <b>freezing</b> <b>solution.</b> Fresh control and frozen-thawed survived oocytes were analysed by confocal microscopy to evaluate MII spindle and chromosome organizations. RESULTS: Of the 104 oocytes included in the unfrozen group, 76 (73. 1 %) displayed normal bipolar spindles with equatorially aligned chromosomes. Spindle and chromatin organizations were significantly affected (50. 8 %) after cryopreservation involving lower sucrose concentration (61 oocytes), whereas these parameters were unchanged (69. 7 %) using the 0. 3 mol/l sucrose protocol (152 oocytes). CONCLUSIONS: Partial disruption of the MII spindle and associated chromosomes accompanies inadequate cryopreservation during slow cooling. However, protocols adopting higher sucrose concentration in the <b>freezing</b> <b>solution</b> promote the retention of an intact chromosome segregation apparatus comparable in incidence to freshly collected oocytes...|$|R

The standard laboratory freezing protocol of around 1 °C/min was used in the experiments. The efficiency of 1, 2 -propandiol on cryopreservation of hBMSCs was explored. We measured the post-thawing cell viability and early apoptotic behaviors, cell metabolic activities, and growth dynamics. Cell morphology and osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation capability were also tested after cryopreservation.

Fresh and frozen-thawed oocytes appeared rounded in section, with a homogeneous cytoplasm, an intact oolemma and a continuous zona pellucida. Disorganization of mitochondria-smooth endoplasmic reticulum aggregates and a decreased complement of microvilli and cortical granules were frequently observable in frozen-thawed oocytes. Increased density of the inner zona pellucida, possibly related to the occurrence of zona 'hardening', was sometimes found associated with a reduced amount of cortical granules.

The spacing between dendrites increase linearly with {{the distance from the}} chill surface and the square root of local solidification time (or square root of inverse freezing rate) for any fixed composition. For fixed freezing conditions, the dendrite spacings from multicomponent aqueous solutions were a function of the concentrations and diffusion coefficients of the individual solutes. The dendrite spacing produced by <b>freezing</b> of a <b>solution</b> was changed by the addition of a solute different from those already present. If the main diffusion coefficient of the added solute is higher than that of solutes already present, the dendrite spacing is increased and vice versa. The dendrite spacing in multi-component systems increases with the total solute concentration if the constituent solutes are present in equal amounts. The dendrite spacing obtained on freezing of these dilute multicomponent solutions can be expressed by regression equations of the type Image Full-size image (2 K) where L is the dendrite spacing in microns, C 1, C 2 and C 3 are concentrations of individual solutes, Θf is the total freezing time and A 1 −A 8 are constants. A Yates analysis of the dendrite spacings in a factorial design of quaternary solutions indicates that there are strong interactions between individual solutes in regard to their effect on the dendrite spacings. A mass transport analysis has been used to calculate the interdendritic supersaturation ΔC of the individual solutes, the supercooling in the interdendritic liquid ΔT, and the transverse growth velocity of the dendrites, VT. In ternary solutions if two solutes are present in equal amount the supersaturation of the solute with higher main diffusion coefficient is lower, and vice versa.

In this study, we investigated the impact of cryoprotectant agents (CPAs) on DNA methylation patterns in spermatozoa and the consequences on embryonic development and the survival rate of progeny. Global methylation was assessed by enzymatic reactions in Colossoma macropomum spermatozoa that were cryopreserved using dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, methanol, ethyl glycol and glycerol as CPAs. Fertilization was carried out to evaluate survival rates and abnormalities in embryonic development upon treatment with each of the CPAs. Fresh semen served as the control. Our results indicated that, compared to the control group, spermatozoa cryopreservation decreased the fertilization rate and delayed embryonic development from the midblastula stage. Furthermore, spermatozoa cryopreserved in all CPAs had lower methylation levels and exhibited more delays and abnormalities during embryonic development than did fresh semen. Methanol resulted in fertilization, hatching rates and embryonic development that were closer to the control but had lower methylation levels. In conclusion, ours results show significant alterations on spermatozoa DNA methylation patterns caused by CPAs that are used in the semen cryopreservation process.

Assim, a xantana apresentou capacidade antioxidante extracelular, sendo eficiente na diminuição das espécies reativas de oxigênio geradas no processo de congelamento...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cold {{acclimation}} is {{the process}} by which plants adapt to the low, <b>non</b> <b>freezing</b> temperatures that naturally occur during late autumn or early winter. This process enables the plants to resist the freezing temperatures of winter. Temperatures similar to those associated with cold acclimation are also used by the fruit industry to delay fruit ripening in peaches. However, peaches that are subjected to long periods of cold storage may develop chilling injury symptoms (woolliness and internal breakdown). In order to better understand the relationship between cold acclimation and chilling injury in peaches, we isolated and functionally characterized cold-regulated promoters from cold-inducible genes identified by digitally analyzing a large EST dataset. Results Digital expression analyses of EST datasets, revealed 164 cold-induced peach genes, several of which show similarities to genes associated with cold acclimation and cold stress responses. The promoters of three of these cold-inducible genes (Ppbec 1, Ppxero 2 and Pptha 1) were fused to the GUS reporter gene and characterized for cold-inducibility using both transient transformation assays in peach fruits (in fruta) and stable transformation in Arabidopsis thaliana. These assays demonstrate that the promoter Pptha 1 is not cold-inducible, whereas the Ppbec 1 and Ppxero 2 promoter constructs are cold-inducible. Conclusion This work demonstrates that during cold storage, peach fruits differentially express genes that are associated with cold acclimation. Functional characterization of these promoters in transient transformation assays in fruta as well as stable transformation in Arabidopsis, demonstrate that the isolated Ppbec 1 and Ppxero 2 promoters are cold-inducible promoters, whereas the isolated Pptha 1 promoter is not cold-inducible. Additionally, the cold-inducible activity of the Ppbec 1 and Ppxero 2 promoters suggest that there is a conserved heterologous cold-inducible regulation of these promoters in peach and Arabidopsis. These results reveal that digital expression analyses may be used in non-model species to identify candidate genes whose promoters are differentially expressed in response to exogenous stimuli. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study aerosol–cloud {{interactions}} in cirrus clouds, we apply a new multiple-mode ice microphysical scheme {{to the general}} circulation model ECHAM 5 -HAM. The multiple-mode ice microphysical scheme allows for analysis of the competition between homogeneous <b>freezing</b> of <b>solution</b> droplets, deposition nucleation of pure dust particles, and immersion freezing of coated dust particles and pre-existing ice. We base the freezing efficiencies of coated and pure dust particles on the most recent laboratory data. The effect of pre-existing ice, which has been neglected in previous ice nucleation parameterizations, is to deplete water vapour by depositional growth and thus prevent homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing from occurring...|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} correlation that {{is important}} in the calculation of homogeneous freezing probabilities, the “Turnbull correlation” for interfacial tensions, has been reevaluated and applied to systems of interest as possible components of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). The systems studied were: sulphuric acid <b>solutions</b> <b>freezing</b> to water ice and sulphuric acid tetrahydrate (SAT); and nitric acid <b>solutions</b> <b>freezing</b> to nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and nitric acid dihydrate (NAD). The calculations have been compared to experimental data: agreement is generally good, although aerosol freezing experiments, which would rigorously test the theory, have not been made for NAT. Of the three measurements of aerosol freezing to NAD, the calculations are closer to those measurements showing a lower freezing temperature, of about 175 – 177 K. The comparison substantially improves our confidence in our understanding of the mechanisms of PSC formation. Freezing of stratospheric aerosol to water ice remains the most plausible first step in solid-particle PSC formation if homogeneous freezing is the mechanism by which solid-particle PSC formation occurs...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} to cryogenically {{preserve}} hepatocyte monolayers is currently not available {{but such a}} technique would facilitate numerous applications {{in the field of}} biomedical engineering, cell line development, and drug screening. We investigated the effect of trehalose and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me 2 SO) in cryopreservation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG 2) cells in suspension and monolayer formats. HepG 2 cell monolayers were incubated for 24 h at varying concentrations of trehalose (50 – 150 mM) prior to cryopreservation to identify the optimum concentration for such preincubation. When trehalose alone was used as the cryoprotective agent (CPA), cells in monolayer format did not survive freezing while cells in suspension demonstrated 14 % viability 24 h after thawing. Only 6 – 13 % of cells in monolayers survived freezing in cell culture medium supplemented with 10 % Me 2 SO, but 42 % of cells were recovered successfully if monolayers were preincubated with 100 mM trehalose prior to freezing in the Me 2 SO supplemented medium. Interestingly, for cells frozen in suspension in presence of 10 % Me 2 SO, metabolic activity immediately following thawing did not change appreciably compared to unfrozen control cells. Finally, Raman spectroscopy techniques were employed to evaluate ice crystallization in the presence and absence of trehalose in <b>freezing</b> <b>solutions</b> without cells because crystallization may alter the extent of injury observed in cell monolayers. We speculate that biomimetic approaches of using protective sugars to preserve cells in monolayer format will facilitate the development of techniques for long-term preservation of human tissues and organs in the future...|$|R
