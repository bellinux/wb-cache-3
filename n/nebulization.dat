2500|$|The {{development}} of the APCI interface for LC-MS started with Horning and collaborators in the early 1973. However, its commercial application was introduced {{at the beginning of}} the 1990s after Henion and collaborators improved the LC-APCI-MS interface in 1986. The APCI ion source/ interface can be used to analyze small, neutral, relatively non-polar, and thermally stable molecules (e.g., steroids, lipids, and fat soluble vitamins). These compounds are not well ionized using ESI. In addition, APCI can also handle mobile phase streams containing [...] buffering agents. The liquid from the LC system is pumped through a capillary and there is also <b>nebulization</b> at the tip, where a corona discharge takes place. First, the ionizing gas surrounding the interface and the mobile phase solvent are subject to chemical ionization at the ion source. Later, these ions react with the analyte and transfer their charge. The sample ions then pass through small orifice skimmers by means of or ion-focusing lenses. Once inside the high vacuum region, the ions are subject to mass analysis. This interface can be operated in positive and negative charge modes and singly-charged ions are mainly produced. APCI ion source can also handle flow rates between [...] 500 and 2000 μl/min and it can be directly connected to conventional 4.6nbsp&mm ID columns.|$|E

MethodsBetween March 2001 and February 2002, 60 children (2 – 5 years old), admitted to the PER at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (Brazil), due to an episode of acute asthma, refractory to conventional therapy (an oral dose of steroids and at least three doses of inhaled albuterol, associated or not with oxygen) were enrolled in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. The randomization was performed in blocks of 10 patients, who received a “bronchodilator solution” (either saline or aminophylline), in two doses: on arrival at the PER and again 6 h later. The intervention group received aminophylline 5 mg/kg/dose diluted in normal saline (NS) solution up to a 20 mL volume, while the placebo group received plain NS, both in an infusion rate of 1 cc/min. The main outcomes were total length of hospital stay, length of supplemental oxygen use, number of bronchodilator <b>nebulizations</b> and/or aerosol inhalations performed and patient destination. The groups were compared using the Students t-test, Mann–Whitney test and Chi-Square test, accepting p< 0. 05 as significant. ResultsComparing the main outcomes, {{we did not find}} differences between the placebo and aminophylline groups: 29. 0 ± 14. 7 versus 26. 2 ± 13. 4 beta-agonist <b>nebulizations</b> per patient (p= 0. 46); 2. 4 ± 10. 6 versus 5. 6 ± 14. 2 aerosol inhalations per patient (p= 0. 32); 24. 7 ± 30. 0 versus 26. 0 ± 25. 2 h for oxygen supplement (p= 0. 86); 43. 2 ± 30. 0 versus 43. 6 ± 23. 7 h for length of hospital stay (p= 0. 95). We also did not find {{differences between the two groups}} related to the blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. ConclusionIn children aged 2 – 5 years admitted to a PER with asthma, two intravenous doses of 5 mg/kg of aminophylline given 6 h apart did not change the length of stay in hospital, the number of <b>nebulizations</b> given or the duration of oxygen therapy required.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of a nurse run asthma clinic on {{practice}} workload and the morbidity of patients in a four partner general practice. One hundred and fifteen asthmatic patients were studied and comparisons were made between the 12 months prior to the introduction of the clinic and the first 12 months after the clinic started. Morbidity was measured in terms of: the number of courses of oral steroids, the number of emergency salbutamol <b>nebulizations,</b> and the number of days lost from work or school. The number of consultations with the general practitioners were recorded. The repeat prescribing register was also monitored throughout the study to examine the effect of the clinic on prescribing in the practice. Consultations with general practitioners fell from a total of 818 to 414 during the study period (P less than 0. 001). This was offset by 496 consultations with the nurse in the first 12 months of the clinic. As a result of attending the nurse clinic significant reductions (P less than 0. 01) were found in the patients' requirements for courses of oral steroids, acute <b>nebulizations</b> and days lost from work or school. The results for the 46 children were similar to those for the 69 adults, confirming that the asthma clinic was effective for all ages. The clinic coincided with an increase in the number of patients receiving regular bronchodilator therapy and prophylactic medication. Eighty per cent of patients had their medication modified as a result of attending the clinic. The cost of prescribing remained remarkably stable. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

50|$|Thermospray was {{originally}} developed for coupling liquid chromatography to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Thermospray is the controlled partial vaporization of a liquid as it flows through a heated capillary tube.

When sufficient power is coupled to the flowing sample stream, a partially vaporized mixture is produced consisting of some fraction of vaporized sample and some remaining liquid sample.

METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, including children above 2 years of age with severe acute asthma admitted to the observation ward of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Hospital São Lucas. All patients received conventional treatment (oxygen, corticoids, beta-adrenergics) on admission, and later received one of the following solutions: a) IVMg (50 mg/kg); b) intravenous salbutamol (20 µg/kg); c) saline solution (1 ml/kg/min). Clinical assessments, electrolyte concentration, and arterial blood gas analyses were recorded before intravenous infusion and one hour after that.

The group that received IVMg presented lower blood pressure during administration, which reached normal levels one hour afterwards, along with an increase in serum magnesium (P < 0, 001) and serum pH, and reduction of PaCO 2. The group that received intravenous salbutamol had lower respiratory rate (P = 0. 05) and higher blood pressure (P = 0. 01), and one hour after administration, these patients showed decreased respiratory rate (P = 0. 02); lower levels of serum potassium (P = 0. 009); higher pH, and reduced PaCO 2.

40|$|SummaryMethacholine {{testing is}} an {{important}} diagnostic tool for asthma. Newly available dosimeter and software technology allows for simplification of the test. This study aimed to evaluate a single-concentration dosimeter protocol for methacholine testing by comparison with a multi-concentration dosimeter protocol similar to that recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) (standard protocol). Fifty young subjects with high pretest probability for bronchial hyperresponsiveness underwent two challenges in randomized order within one week. The novel protocol used a Medic-Aid Sidestream nebulizer and a fixed methacholine concentration of 16 mg/mL. Number and duration of <b>nebulizations</b> were matched to the last four doses of the standard protocol, and results were expressed cumulatively. The rank correlation between log slopes (n= 50) was 0. 86; that between log provocative doses (n= 18), which differed at low values, was 0. 58. When requiring a 20 % fall in FEV 1 at any methacholine dose, 18 subjects were hyperresponsive and 28 normoresponsive in both tests (46 / 50 concordant). One subject was positive only with the standard, and 3 only with the novel protocol (Cohen's kappa 83 %). The novel protocol for methacholine testing yielded qualitative results {{similar to those of}} the ATS multi-concentration protocol, although there were quantitative differences at low doses.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: Aerosol {{inhalation}} therapy {{is one of}} the methods to treat rhinosinusitis. However the topical drug delivery to the posterior nose and paranasal sinuses shows only limited efficiency. A precise sinusal targeting remains a main challenge for aerosol treatment of sinus disorders. This paper proposes a comparative study of the nasal deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles using planar gamma-scintigraphy imaging vs. a new 3 -dimensional (3 D) imaging approach based on SPECT-CT measurements. Methods: Radiolabelled <b>nebulizations</b> have been performed on a plastinated model of human nasal cast coupled with a respiratory pump. First, the benefits provided by SPECT-CT imaging were compared with 2 D gamma-scintigraphy and radioactive quantification of maxillary sinus lavage as reference for the sonic 2. 8 μm aerosol sinusal deposition. Then, the impact on nasal deposition of various airborne particle sizes was assessed. Results: The 2 D methodology overestimates aerosol deposition in the maxillary sinuses by a factor 9 whereas the 3 D methodology is in agreement with the maxillary sinus lavage reference methodology. Then with the SPECT-CT approach we highlighted that the higher particle size was mainly deposited in the central nasal cavity contrary to the submicron aerosol particles (33. 8 ± 0. 6 % of total deposition for the 2. 8 μm particles vs. 1 ± 0. 3 % for the 230 nm particles).

40|$|Background: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that nebulized budesonide would improve lung mechanics and oxygenation in patients with early acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during protective mechanical ventilation strategy without adversely affecting systemic hemodynamics. Methods: Patients with ALI/ARDS were included and assigned into two groups; budesonide group (30 cases) in whom 1 mg– 2 ml budesonide suspension was nebulized through the endotracheal tube and control group (30 cases) in whom 2 ml saline (placebo) were nebulized instead of budesonide. This regimen was repeated every 12 h for three successive days alongside with constant ventilator settings in both groups. Hemodynamics, airway pressures, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 were measured throughout the study period (72 h) with either nebulized budesonide or saline. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were analyzed serologically as markers of inflammation at pre- and post-nebulization sessions. Results: We found {{a significant difference between}} the two groups regarding PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P = 0. 023), peak (P = 0. 021), and plateau (P = 0. 032) airway pressures.

40|$|Abstract Background Inhaled short acting β 2 -agonists (SABA), e. g. albuterol, {{are used}} for quick {{reversal}} of bronchoconstriction in asthmatics. While SABA are not recommended for maintenance therapy, {{it is not uncommon}} to find patients who frequently use SABA over a long period of time and there is a suspicion that long term exposure to SABA could be detrimental to lung function. To test this hypothesis we studied the effect of long-term inhaled albuterol stereoisomers on immediate allergic response (IAR) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in mouse models of asthma. Methods Balb/C mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and then we studied the IAR to inhaled allergen and the AHR to inhaled methacholine. The mice were pretreated with <b>nebulizations</b> of either racemic (RS) -albuterol or the single isomers (S) - and (R) -albuterol twice daily over 7 days prior to harvest. Results We found that all forms of albuterol produced a significant increase of IAR measured as respiratory elastance. Similarly, we found that AHR was elevated by albuterol. At the same time a mouse strain that is intrinsically hyperresponsive (A/J mouse) was not affected by the albuterol isomers nor was AHR induced by epithelial disruption with Poly-L-lysine affected by albuterol. Conclusions We conclude that long term inhalation treatment with either isomer of albuterol is capable of precipitating IAR and AHR in allergically inflamed airways but not in intrinsically hyperresponsive mice or immunologically naïve mice. Because (S) -albuterol, which lacks affinity for the β 2 -receptor, did not differ from (R) -albuterol, we speculate that isomer-independent properties of the albuterol molecule, other than β 2 -agonism, are responsible for the effect on AHR. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Few {{data are}} {{available}} on the usefulness of short term treatment with low-medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in pre-school children with wheezing exacerbations. Methods To compare the efficacy of one week treatment with 400 μg b. i. d. nebulized beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), plus nebulized 2500 μg prn salbutamol (BDP group), versus nebulized b. i. d. placebo, plus nebulized prn 2500 μg salbutamol (placebo group), a post-hoc analysis was performed on data obtained in 166 pre-school children with multiple-trigger wheezing, recruited during an acute wheezing episode. Results The percentage of symptom-free days (SFDs) was significantly higher in the BDP group (54. 7 %) than in the placebo group (40. 5 %; p = 0. 012), with a 35 % relative difference. Day-by-day analysis showed that the percentage of SFDs was already higher in the BDP group after 2 days (7. 4 %), the difference reaching statistical significance at day 6 (12. 3 %; p = 0. 035). Cough score was also reduced in the BDP group (0. 11) as compared with the placebo group (0. 39; p = 0. 048), the difference reaching statistical significance after 5 days of treatment (0. 18 and 0. 47 respectively; p = 0. 047). The mean number of <b>nebulizations</b> per day of prn salbutamol was lower in the BDP group as compared to the placebo group (0. 26 and 0. 34, respectively), but the difference was not significant (p = 0. 366).

However, {{the validity of the}} enhanced Pause (Penh), an index of airflow limitation, remains controversial. We compared Penh with pulmonary resistance (R(L)) to test whether Penh detects tracheal subobstruction and carbachol-induced airflow limitation in spontaneously breathing, anaesthetised rats. Methods: Fourteen male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent tracheal catheterisation, followed by measurements of R(L) and Penh. Six rats underwent tracheal subobstruction by the consecutive insertion into the lumen of the tracheal tube of two catheters of decreasing diameter. Eight rats received an inhaled saline challenge, followed by two noncumulative <b>nebulizations</b> of carbachol (1. 25 mg/mL, 1 min). Results: In rats with tracheal calibre reductions, R(L) significantly increased at each reduction (0. 218 +/- 0. 052 vs. 0. 417 +/- 0. 058 vs. 0. 820 +/- 0. 258 cm H(2) O/mL s, p< 0. 05), whereas Penh only increased after the last reduction (1. 88 +/- 0. 25 vs. 2. 47 +/- 0. 26, p< 0. 05). Increases (Delta) of R(L) and Penh were not correlated. In comparison to postsaline values, carbachol induced a significant increase of Penh (1. 93 +/- 0. 44 vs. 4. 05 +/- 1. 45, p< 0. 005) and R(L) (0. 137 +/- 0. 04 vs. 0. 284 +/- 0. 084 cm H(2) O/mL. s, p< 0. 005). DeltaPenh and DeltaR(L) were significantly correlated (r= 0. 80, p< 0. 05). Discussion: This study showed, by comparing Penh with R(L), that single-chambered plethysmography measuring Penh allows to detect carbachol-induced airflow limitation in spontaneously breathing, anaesthetised Sprague-Dawley rats, but poorly detects an increase in R(L) due to tracheal calibre reductions. These findings suggest that Penh might be only be used as an index of airflow limitation under well-defined experimental conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} It {{is a complex}} problem and difficult treatment for tracheobronchial stenoses/occlusions involving in carina. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of argon plasma coagulation (APC) and bifurcated covered Z-type stents (CZTS) placement for the treatment of tracheobronchus stenoses and esophagorespiratory fistula (ERF). Methods Thirty-two cases with airway disorders were retrospectively reviewed for the treatment of APC and CZTS placement. Under the bronchoscopic guidance, APC was first given in patients with airway stenoses, then CZTS was placed under the fluoroscopic and flexible bronchoscopic guidance either with airway stenoses or ERF. Results APC was first given in 19 patients with airway stenoses. Airway structures were significantly improved after APC procedure (57. 4 %- 72. 1 % before APC vs 12. 8 %- 25. 8 % after APC). Thirty-two CZTS were technically successfully placed in 30 out of 32 cases involving in carinal bifurcation. After APC and stent placement, short breath index was significantly reduced and karnofsky physical score (KPS) increased obviously. The endobronchial defects were successfully palliated with bifurcated CZTS placed under fluoroscopy and flexible bronchoscopy in 12 out of 13 patients with ERFs. There is no bleeding introprocedure. Mucous retention was very common in all types of the stents less than 2 weeks after stenting, which required debridement by bronchoscopy and could be prevented by normal saline solution <b>nebulizations.</b> Granuloma developed at the ends of stents after 1 month of stenting which all of them were treated successfully with APC and CO 2 cryosurgery. Conclusion Utilization of APC and retrieval bifurcated CZTS placement is a simple and safe protocol for the management of airway complex stenoses involving the tracheal carina and ERF...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:Few {{data are}} {{available}} on the usefulness of short term treatment with low-medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in pre-school children with wheezing exacerbations. METHODS:To compare the efficacy of one week treatment with 400 μg b. i. d. nebulized beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), plus nebulized 2500 μg prn salbutamol (BDP group), versus nebulized b. i. d. placebo, plus nebulized prn 2500 μg salbutamol (placebo group), a post-hoc analysis was performed on data obtained in 166 pre-school children with multiple-trigger wheezing, recruited during an acute wheezing episode. RESULTS:The percentage of symptom-free days (SFDs) was significantly higher in the BDP group (54. 7 %) than in the placebo group (40. 5 %; p = 0. 012), with a 35 % relative difference. Day-by-day analysis showed that the percentage of SFDs was already higher in the BDP group after 2 days (7. 4 %), the difference reaching statistical significance at day 6 (12. 3 %; p = 0. 035). Cough score was also reduced in the BDP group (0. 11) as compared with the placebo group (0. 39; p = 0. 048), the difference reaching statistical significance after 5 days of treatment (0. 18 and 0. 47 respectively; p = 0. 047). The mean number of <b>nebulizations</b> per day of prn salbutamol was lower in the BDP group as compared to the placebo group (0. 26 and 0. 34, respectively), but the difference was not significant (p = 0. 366). There were no differences in positive effects of BDP treatment between children with and without risk factors for asthma. CONCLUSIONS:A 1 -week treatment with nebulized BDP and prn salbutamol is effective in increasing SFDs and improving cough in children with wheezing, providing a clinical rationale for the short term use of ICS in episodic wheeze exacerbations in pre-school children...|$|R
