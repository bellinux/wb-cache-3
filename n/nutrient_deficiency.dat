5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant <b>nutrient</b> <b>deficiency,</b> but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not necessarily in function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E

Several pro-apoptotic signals, such as TNF, TRAIL, and FADD, also induce autophagy. Additionally, Bcl-2 inhibits Beclin-1-dependent autophagy, thereby functioning both as a pro-survival and as an anti-autophagic regulator.|$|E

As a result, land use is being intensified and soil nutrient depletion may occur, resulting in <b>nutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of agricultural crops. This paper reviews <b>nutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in the agricultural crops of Papua New Guinea using the literature on agronomic trials, expert knowledge and Geographical Information System (GIS) soil fertility databases. One of the aims of this overview is to discuss the spatial distribution of common <b>nutrient</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> which will facilitate the formulation of future strategies on integrated nutrient management research. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> have been investigated systematically since the mid- 1950 s.

5000|$|The {{main focus}} {{of the program was}} the {{production}} of biodiesel from high lipid-content algae grown in ponds, utilizing waste [...] from coal-fired power plants. The lipids that they are referring to are another name for Triglycerides or TAGs, which are the primary storage form of natural oils. The program looked at <b>nutrient</b> <b>deficiency</b> in algae, because they wanted to study the lipid trigger. The hypothesis was that because when the algae is nutrient starved, oil production in the cells increases, so this might affect overall productivity. However, the study found that during <b>nutrient</b> <b>deficiency,</b> rates of oil production are lower. Higher levels of oil in the cells are more than offset by lower rates of cell growth.|$|E
