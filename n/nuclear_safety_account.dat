50|$|In 1994, Lithuania {{accepted}} US$36.8 {{million from}} the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Account</b> to improve safety at the Ignalina site. Under the grant, both the reactors had to be closed within 15-20 years. Moreover, in order to join the EU, Lithuania had to decommission one reactor immediately and the second by 2009. The EU agreed to pay for decommissioning costs and some compensation through 2013. Strong public opposition followed, because of fear for electricity price hikes.|$|E
50|$|The Chernobyl reactor is now {{enclosed}} {{in a large}} concrete sarcophagus, which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant.A New Safe Confinement {{was to have been}} built by the end of 2005; however, it has suffered ongoing delays and , when construction finally began, was expected to be completed in 2013. This was delayed again to 2016, the end of the 30-year lifespan of the sarcophagus. The structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails. It is to be a metal arch 105 m high and spanning 257 m, to cover both unit 4 and the hastily built 1986 structure. The Chernobyl Shelter Fund, set up in 1997, has received €810 million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work. It and the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Account,</b> also applied to Chernobyl decommissioning, are managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power sources}} (NPS) {{have been widely}} used in space {{missions}}. They are needed for deep space missions to the outer planets as well as many kinds of planetary surface missions. At present, launches with NPS onboard can be carried out by the U. S. and Russia, as these countries have established a corresponding safety framework and approval process. A European <b>nuclear</b> <b>safety</b> approach would be a prerequisite for the launch of future European missions with NPS on board from the Guyana Space Center in Kourou. Within this context, a study for outlining the possibilities for a “European Space <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Safety</b> Framework ” (ENSaF) has been carried out by co-operation of members from space industry, nuclear industry and four European TSOs. Some of the main results consist of the outline of a viable safety evaluation approval process with international participation on the European level.
