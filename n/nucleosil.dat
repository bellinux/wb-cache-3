The {{effect of the}} type of stationary phase, the chiral column Chirobiotic V or the achiral stationary phases <b>Nucleosil</b> 100 C 8 HD and <b>Nucleosil</b> 100 C 18 HD, and the concentration of vancomycin in the mobile phase on separation of the drug enantiomers were evaluated. All the drugs, except flobufen, were successfully enantioseparated on <b>Nucleosil</b> 100 C 8 HD with 4 mM vancomycin present in the mobile phase (composed of methanol and buffer) in the reversed phase mode. On the vancomycin-bonded chiral stationary phase, it was difficult to get enantioseparations of the profen NSAIDs. However, flobufen gave better enantioseparation on the vancomycin CSP. The better enantioresolution of the majority of profen derivatives on the achiral columns with vancomycin added to the mobile phase can be attributed in particular to the higher separation efficiency of this capillary chromatographic system. In addition, vancomycin dimers, formed in the mobile phase, seem to offer a better steric arrangement for stereoselective interaction to these analytes than the vancomycin bonded on the CSP. These substantial differences in the CS structure significantly influence the chiral discrimination mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Fragment based lead {{discovery}} (FBLD), where libraries {{of small}} fragments are screened andlater on developed to lead compounds, {{is an alternative}} to the classical drug discovery methods such as high trough-put screening. Weak affinity chromatography (WAC) is a new promising approach to the screening process of FBLD. WAC is performed by injections of fragments onto a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column in which a protein is immobilized to a silica support. The retention of the injected fragments is correlated to the binding affinity of the fragments towards the immobilized protein. Immobilization capacity of three different silica materials with varying pore size (Kromasil 240 Å, <b>Nucleosil</b> 1000 Å and Kromasil 300 Å) was evaluated by immobilization of trypsin. Retention of benzamidines on the trypsin columns was evaluated with different mobile phases. Contribution of non-specific binding in the interaction between the 4 -aminobenzamidine and thrombin was estimated by frontal chromatography on a capillary columnusing PBS and PBS/acetonitrile as mobile phases. This study showed that the Kromasil 300 Å had a superior immobilization capacity of trypsin compared to the Kromasil 240 Å andthe <b>Nucleosil</b> 1000 Å (100 mg compared to 87. 4 mg and 15. 1 mg trypsin/g silica, respectively). However, the <b>Nucleosil</b> 1000 Å might be a more suitable support for the immobilization of larger proteins. Adding 5 % methanol or acetonitrile to the mobile phase resulted in a significant (p < 0. 05) decreased retention of benzamidine fragments on the trypsin 240 Å column.

Samples were analyzed on <b>Nucleosil</b> C 18 column (150 mm× 4. 6 mm, 5 [*]μm) using an isocratic mobile phase which consisted of Brij 35 (5 % (w/v) aqueous solution; pH[*] 2. 3 ± 0. 1 by phosphoric acid) and 1 -butanol (6 % (v/v)); UV detection was at 220 [*]nm. Micellar mobile phase using allows to fully separate valerenic acids within 25 minutes. Linearity for hydroxyvalerenic, acetoxyvalerenic, and valerenic acids was 1. 9 – 27. 9, 4. 2 – 63. 0, and 6. 1 – 91 · 3 [*]μg. mL− 1, and limit of detection was 0. 14, 0. 037, and 0. 09 [*]μg·mL− 1, respectively. Intraday and interday precisions were not less than 2 % for all investigated compounds. The proposed method {{was found to be}} reproducible and convenient for quantitative analysis of sesquiterpenic acids in valerian root and related preparations...|$|E
30|$|All chemicals, solvents, and {{materials}} were purchased and directly used without further purification. [18 F]florbetaben (8 %[*]±[*] 2 % radiochemical yield (RCY) and 98 % radiochemical purity) [43, 44], [18 F]FIBT (20 %[*]±[*] 4 % RCY and 98 % radiochemical purity) [25], and [11 C]PiB (26 %[*]±[*] 5 % RCY and 98 % radiochemical purity) [45 - 47, 27] were synthesized following already published procedures. Analytical HPLC was performed using either a Chromolith RP-C 18 e (4.6 [*]×[*] 100  mm; Merck, Dramstadt, Germany) eluted {{with a mixture}} of acetonitrile/ 0.1 -M ammonium formate (MeCN content between 27.5 % and 50 %) at a flow rate of 5  mL/min or a <b>Nucleosil</b> 100, CN 4.6 [*]×[*] 250  mm reverse phase column, particle size 5  μm (CS-Chromatographie, Langerwehe, Germany) eluted with acetonitrile/ 0.1 -M ammonium formate (MeCN content between 40 % and 60 %). Both chromatography systems were fitted with a UV detector (Sykam Model S 3210 set at 254  nm; Sykam, Fürstenfeldbruck, Germany). Radiotracers had comparable specific activities of ≥ 18  GBq/μmol.|$|E
40|$|Peptido-keratan {{sulphate}} fragments {{were isolated}} from the nucleus pulposus of bovine intervertebral discs (2 -year-old animals) after digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase followed by digestion with diphenylcarbamoyl chloride-treated trypsin of A 1 D 1 proteoglycans and gel-permeation chromatography on Sepharose CL- 6 B. The peptido-keratan sulphate fragments were subjected to alkaline borohydride reduction. The reduced chains were treated with keratanase {{in the presence of}} the sialidase inhibitor 2, 3 -dehydro- 2 -deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid, and the digest was subjected to alkaline borohydride reduction. This produced oligosaccharides with galactitol at their reducing ends. This reduced digest was chromatographed on a <b>Nucleosil</b> 5 SB anion-exchange column and individual oligosaccharides were isolated. One of these was shown by 600 MHz 1 H-n. m. r. spectroscopy to have the following structure: NeuAc alpha 2 - 6 Gal beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc(6 -SO 4) beta 1 - 3 Gal-ol The structure of this oligosaccharide shows that keratan sulphate chains from bovine intervertebral disc have non-reducing termini with N-acetylneuraminic acid linked alpha(2 [...] 6) as well as alpha(2 [...] 3) to an unsulphated galactose...|$|E
40|$|Present study {{reports the}} {{development}} and validation of a simultaneous estimation of metformin and gliclazide in human plasma using supercritical fluid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. Acetonitrile:water (80 : 20) mixture {{was used as a}} mobile phase along with liquid CO 2 in supercritical fluid chromatography and phenformin as an internal standard. The modified plasma samples were analyzed by electro-spray ionization method in selective reaction monitoring mode in tandem mass spectrometry. Supercritical fluid chromatographic separation was performed using <b>nucleosil</b> C 18 containing column as a stationary phase. The separated products were identified by characteristic peaks and specific fragments peaks in tandem mass spectrometry as m/z 130 to 86 for metformin, m/z 324 to 110 for gliclazide and m/z 206 to 105 for phenformin. The present method was found linear in the concentration ranges of 6. 0 - 3550 ng/ml and 7. 5 - 7500 ng/ml for metformin and gliclazide, respectively. Pharmacokinetic study was performed after an oral administration of dispersible tablets containing 500 mg of metformin and 80 mg of gliclazide using same techniques...|$|E
