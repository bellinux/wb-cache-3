50|$|The {{first step}} is to lay out the grid, mark the Base Line {{along the length of the}} paper or plywood sheet. Then <b>nail</b> <b>Battens</b> every 12 inches (or more in some cases) where the station lines are to be set as a mark for the {{perpendicular}} line, which is marked with a T-square. The previous steps are followed in turn by marking the Top Line and the Water Line. Before continuing make sure to check the lines by using the Pythagorean theorem and make sure the grid is square.|$|R
60|$|A {{party of}} men were {{already at work}} <b>nailing</b> <b>battens</b> over the {{shattered}} stern of the Sea-horse. When this was done, sail-cloth was nailed over them, and a coat of pitch given to it. The operation took four hours, by which time all the other arrangements had been completed. The holds of the two privateers {{were found to be}} empty, and they learned from the French crews that the two craft had sailed from Bordeaux in company but four days previously, and that the Sea-horse was the first English ship that they had come across.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid the}} expense re-roofing {{a house that}} is simply {{suffering}} from nail fatigue, and to obtain optimum insulation, an 85mm layer of polyurethane foam can be sprayed onto {{the underside of the}} slates or tiles of a pitched roof. This stabilises and weatherproofs the roof by fixing the <b>nails,</b> <b>battens</b> and roofing felt. As the foam is a superior insulant, coupled with just 100mm of insulation at joist level, your roof will also meet the stringent thermal performance standards required for a new home. A typical roof can be insulated using the polyurethane treatment for around half the cost of re-roofing.|$|R
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{estimating}} the wind resisting property of a new type roofing tile which has peculiar overlaping corners, loading tests of roofing tiles were made assuming that the wind force acting on a roofing tile is perpendicular to the roofing surface. The test results showed {{that this kind of}} roofing tile is able to withstand strong gusts having velocities up to 60 m/s if all tiles are <b>nailed</b> on <b>battens</b> tightly. However, it was also found that the advantage gained by using this tile is almost lost if the tiles are <b>nailed</b> on <b>battens</b> at intervals of several rows following the conventional roofing method. ...|$|R
60|$|The beacon {{house was}} gained {{by means of}} one of the main beams, which had been {{converted}} into a stair, by the simple process of <b>nailing</b> small <b>battens</b> thereon, about a foot apart from each other. The men could only go up one at a time, but as they were active and accustomed to the work, were all speedily within their place of refuge. Soon afterwards the sea covered the rock, and the place where they had been at work was a mass of seething foam.|$|R
50|$|The ceiling framing, {{like the}} walls, {{is a mixture}} of timber and iron. The rafters and king-posts are iron, while the battens are timber. The gable roof is clad with 3-inch {{corrugated}} fibrous cement <b>nailed</b> to <b>battens.</b> The roof eaves are supported on timber and steel brackets. A corrugated iron awning over the eastern verandah is attached to the main roof and is supported on timber brackets. A large ventilator runs along the ridge of the roof and small circular one set into the roof is located near the north-west corner.|$|R
50|$|The {{second step}} is to mark the points from the table of offsets. All {{measurements}} off the table of offsets are listed in Millimeters or the Feet, Inches and Eighths. The points are plotted at each station then use a small <b>nail</b> and a <b>batten</b> to Fair (draw with a fair curve) the boat's lines.|$|R

50|$|Slate {{roof tiles}} are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is {{typically}} with double <b>nails</b> onto timber <b>battens</b> (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, {{although there are}} modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80-100 years. Slate roofs are still used today.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of a chartaque was an operation that lasted several weeks. In 1706, {{during the time of}} the Kuruc wars, precise details are known about the fortifications of the Kuruc schanzen in eastern Styria. For one four-man chartaque, thus a relatively small one (there were also chartaques for up to 20 men), which was to be built in Goritz bei Radkersburg, about three kilometres north of the town of Radkersburg, the following was assessed to be needed: 20 workers (socagers from the surrounding villages), eight log posts each of three fathoms (ca. 18 feet long), 24 logs for beams and wall benches, 18 logs for the upper and lower floors, 25 battens, 75 wide boards, 400 <b>batten</b> <b>nails,</b> 1,000 shingle nails, 67 carts and, as for tradesmen, master carpenter: 18 man days and carpenter's apprentices: 54 man days. Such a chartaque came at a cost of 28 guilders and 24 kreuzer (plus the [...] "free" [...] socage). For two or three chartaques an overseer was appointed in addition to the crews of each chartaque. For the rebuilding of another chartaque which was burned down to its supporting posts, the cost was estimated at 30 guilders. There were also chartaques that were additionally protected by a small redoubt (redutierte Tschartaken), the redoubt costing an estimated 40 guilders. For larger chartaques for 12-15 men, 32 construction-quality logs (Stubenb채ume), six rafter logs (Gesparrb채ume), four complete trees for the posts, 75 standard boards and 1,500 <b>batten</b> <b>nails</b> were needed.|$|R
6000|$|The {{master of}} the Nan-Shan, {{speaking}} just audibly and gazing at his boots as his manner was, remarked {{that it would be}} necessary to call at Fu-chau this trip, and desired Mr. Rout to have steam up to-morrow afternoon at one o'clock sharp. He pushed back his hat to wipe his forehead, observing {{at the same time that}} he hated going ashore anyhow; while overtopping him Mr. Rout, without deigning a word, smoked austerely, nursing his right elbow in the palm of his left hand. Then Jukes was directed in the same subdued voice to keep the forward 'tween-deck clear of cargo. Two hundred coolies were going to be put down there. The Bun Hin Company were sending that lot home. Twenty-five bags of rice would be coming off in a sampan directly, for stores. All seven-years'-men they were, said Captain MacWhirr, with a camphor-wood chest to every man. The carpenter should be set to work <b>nailing</b> three-inch <b>battens</b> along the deck below, fore and aft, to keep these boxes from shifting in a sea-way. Jukes had better look to it at once. [...] "D'ye hear, Jukes?" [...] This chinaman here was coming with the ship as far as Fu-chau--a sort of interpreter he would be. Bun Hin's clerk he was, and wanted to have a look at the space.

6000|$|The {{books have}} long ago {{told you how}} a Japanese house is constructed, chiefly of sliding screens and paper partitions, and {{everybody}} knows {{the story of the}} burglar of Tokio who burgled with a pair of scissors for jimmy and centrebit and stole the Consul's trousers. But all the telling in print will never make you understand the exquisite finish of a tenement that you could kick in with your foot and pound to match-wood with your fists. Behold a bunnia's[9] shop. He sells rice and chillies and dried fish and wooden scoops made of bamboo. The front of his shop is very solid. It is made of half-inch <b>battens</b> <b>nailed</b> side by side. Not one of the battens is broken; and each one is foursquare perfectly. Feeling ashamed of himself for this surly barring up of his house, he fills one-half the frontage with oiled paper stretched upon quarter-inch framing. Not a single square of oil paper has a hole in it, and not one of the squares, which in more uncivilised countries would hold a pane of glass if strong enough, is out of line. And the bunnia, clothed in a blue dressing-gown, with thick white stockings on his feet, sits behind, not among his wares, on a pale gold-coloured mat of soft rice straw bound with black list at the edges. This mat is two inches thick, three feet wide and six long. You might, if you were a sufficient pig, eat your dinner off any portion of it. The bunnia lies with one wadded blue arm round a big brazier of hammered brass on which is faintly delineated in incised lines a very terrible dragon. The brazier is full of charcoal ash, but there is no ash on the mat. By the bunnia's side is a pouch of green leather tied with a red silk cord, holding tobacco cut fine as cotton. He fills a long black and red lacquered pipe, lights it at the charcoal in the brazier, takes two whiffs, and the pipe is empty. Still there is no speck on the mat. Behind the bunnia is a shadow-screen of bead and bamboo. This veils a room floored with pale gold and roofed with panels of grained cedar. There is nothing in the room save a blood-red blanket laid out smoothly as a sheet of paper. Beyond the room is a passage of polished wood, so polished that it gives back the reflections of the white paper wall. At the end of the passage and clearly visible to this unique bunnia is a dwarfed pine two feet high in a green glazed pot, and by its side is a branch of azalea, blood red as the blanket, set in a pale grey crackle-pot. The bunnia has put it there for his own pleasure, for the delight of his eyes, because he loves it. The white man has nothing whatever to do with his tastes, and he keeps his house specklessly pure because he likes cleanliness and knows it is artistic. What shall we say to such a bunnia? ...|$|R
