For the next sixty-three years, he insinuates himself into the world of European politics.

5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the bread kosher (Angel Bakeries carries the hechsher of both the Edah HaChareidis and the Orthodox Union), Angel's son Ovadia, a trained chemist, collaborated with others at the Angel's-owned Adumim Chemicals plant {{to develop a new}} formula for the emulsifiers that bind water and oil in the bread-making process. In those early days, emulsifiers were made with animal-based fats which were not kosher. Ovadia Angel and his team produced emulsifiers from hydrogenated fats, a vegetable-based source, and later sold this <b>new</b> <b>knowledge</b> to other companies.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of <b>new</b> <b>knowledge</b> about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Constantinople (1453), the newly {{expanded}} Ottoman Empire welcomed European embassies in its capital, which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire. In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the Silk Road as had been transported in the previous two thousand years, mainly as bulbs. Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value. Initially Italy benefited from this <b>new</b> <b>knowledge,</b> especially Venice, which traded extensively with the East. From there these new plants rapidly spread {{to the rest of}} Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries <b>new</b> <b>knowledge</b> spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
5|$|The family Picidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. The phylogeny has been updated according to <b>new</b> <b>knowledge</b> about convergence patterns and evolutionary history. Most notably, the relationship of the picine genera has been largely clarified, and it was determined that the Antillean piculet is a surviving offshoot of proto-woodpeckers. Genetic analysis supports the monophyly of Picidae, which seems to have originated in the Old World, but the geographic origins of the Picinae is unclear. The Picumninae is returned as paraphyletic.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century saw {{the rise}} of Biblical criticism, <b>new</b> <b>knowledge</b> of {{religious}} diversity in other continents, and above all the growth of science.

25|$|Knowledge {{representation}} {{goes hand in}} {{hand with}} automated reasoning because one of the main purposes of explicitly representing knowledge is to be able to reason about that knowledge, to make inferences, assert <b>new</b> <b>knowledge,</b> etc. Virtually all knowledge representation languages have a reasoning or inference engine as part of the system.|$|E

40|$|This article {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point {{a number of}} models of creativity, which can be broadly subdivided into cognitive (Boden, Csikszentmihalyi, Weisberg, Finke et al); social (Csikszentmihalyi, Boden); behavioural (Amabile); and those related to personality trait (Simonton); and examines their various relationships to each other, and to the writing process. The article will also draw {{on a number of}} cultural, social and psychological theorists such as Foucault, Habermas, Deleuze & Guattari, Sternberg, Kaufman & Pretz, and Callois, in order to yield insights into how the creative process performs its functions as a process which generates <b>new</b> <b>knowledges</b> within the discipline of creative writing (and artistic endeavours more generally) as well as new writing for the publishing industry and public consumption.
