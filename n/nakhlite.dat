However, the lamellae are so small that they cannot be characterized by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA). Here we select several areas for focused ion beam (FIB) extraction, prepare transmission electron microscopy (TEM) foils, and identify and analyze the lamellae using TEM at the Johnson Space Center (JSC).

The Brachina olivine and pyroxene have distinctively higher Fe/Mn than the shergottites and Chassigny, further indicating that Brachina is unique. The Chassigny and 77005 olivines contain lower Cr 2 O 3 (0. 03 wt. pct) than the Brachina and 79001 olivines.

The iron/manganese ratio is consistent with that of other Martian meteorites, but the oxygen isotopes do not correlate with a Martian origin. The change in oxygen isotope ratios could be explained by removal or addition of heavier or lighter isotopes, or by mixing with a mass with a different isotopic ratio.
