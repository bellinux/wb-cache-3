40|$|Abstract Background Researchers {{and public}} health {{officials}} in Canada, the United States and Australia have for some time noted broader geographic accessibility to gambling establishments, above all in socioeconomically underprivileged communities. This increase in availability could lead {{to more and more}} gambling problems. This article focuses, in an ecological perspective, in particular on a spatial analysis of the geographic accessibility of sites possessing a VLT permit in the Montréal area, i. e. Montréal Island, the South Shore and Laval, {{from the standpoint of the}} development of an indicator of the vulnerability (socioeconomic components and demographic components) to gambling of populations at the level of certain <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units</b> (dissemination areas). With the recent development of geographic information systems (GIS), it is now possible to ascertain accessibility to services much more accurately, for example by taking into account the configuration of the road network. Results The findings of our analysis reveal widespread geographic accessibility to sites possessing a VLT permit in the downtown area and in pericentral districts. In some <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units,</b> a site possessing a VLT permit may be within a three-minute walk. In the region studied overall, average walking time to a VLT site is nine minutes. Access to this type of service on foot is usually limited in the outskirts. However, a number of groups of sites possessing VLT permits are found along certain axial highways. According to local spatial self-correlation analyses, the findings suggest a significant link between walking accessibility to sites possessing VLT permits and the vulnerability of the communities. In a number of <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units</b> with ready access to VLT's the populations display high vulnerability. Conclusion These findings reveal that accessibility to sites possessing a VLT permit is often linked to the vulnerability (socioeconomic and demographic components) of communities. Reliance in our analyses on <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units</b> with fairly small areas enabled us to emphasize the rectilinear dimension of the spatial distribution of sites possessing VLT permits. This is a significant link that public health officials must consider when elaborating programs to combat pathological gambling. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Identification of {{socioeconomic}} and health inequalities {{at the local}} scale is facilitated by using relevant small geographical sectors. Although these places are routinely defined according to administrative boundaries {{on the basis of}} statistical criteria, it is important to carefully consider the way they are circumscribed as they can create spatial analysis problems and produce misleading information. This article introduces a new approach to defining <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units</b> which is based on the integration of elements stemming from the socioeconomic situation of the area, its history, and how it is perceived by local key actors. Results Using this set of geographical units shows important socioeconomic and health disparities at the local scale. These disparities can be seen, for example, in a 16 -year difference in disability-free life expectancy at birth, and a $ 10, 000 -difference in average personal income between close <b>neighbourhoods.</b> The geographical <b>units</b> also facilitate information transfer to local stakeholders. Conclusion The context of this study has made it possible to explore several relevant methodological issues related to the definition of <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units.</b> This multi-perspective approach allows the combination of many different elements such as physical structures, historical and administrative boundaries, material and social deprivation of the population, and sense of belonging.

Supporting this argument, Isaacs pointed to examples of promotional material for new pre-planned neighbourhoods, as well as excerpts from government planning reports and information provided by social scientists - all championing the <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>unit</b> as a bastion for the gentry, keeping the undesirables, as well as through-traffic, out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background When {{measuring}} neighbourhood {{effects on}} health, {{it is both}} incorrect to treat individuals {{as if they were}} static and tied to their residential neighbourhood and to consider neighbourhoods rigid places whose geographical scales can be delineated a priori. We propose here to investigate the effects of residential medical density on health-seeking behaviours, taking into account the mono/polycentric structure of individual activity space (i. e., the space within which people move {{in the course of their}} daily activities) and exploring various <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units</b> based on administrative delineations and regular grids. Methods We used data collected in the SIRS cohort study, which was carried out over a 5 -year period (2005 – 2010) among a representative population living in 50 census blocks in the Paris metropolitan area. In the 662 women who lived in the same census blocks during the follow-up period and who had reported a recent cervical screening at baseline, we studied the association between residential medical density and individual activity space and the incidence of delayed cervical screening (> 3 years) in multilevel logistic regression models after adjustment for potential confounders. Results Among the 662 women studied, there were 94 instances of delayed cervical screening in 2010 (14 %). The women who indicated that their activity space was concentrated within their neighbourhood of residence were significantly more at risk for an incident delayed cervical screening. No significant association was found between residential medical density and the incidence of delayed cervical screening. However, we observed a significant interaction between individual activity space and residential medical density. Indeed, women living in neighbourhoods with a low medical density had a significantly higher risk of delayed screening, but only if they reported that their daily activities were centred within their neighbourhood of residence.

40|$|Housing layouts {{designed}} as <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units</b> are often {{assumed to be}} able to perform various practical and social functions. But whether the spatial pattern of the planned neighbourhoods itself can be given some explicit theoretical foundation and be subjected to functional formulation, is a problem which has been hardly tackled by architectural research. This dissertation is a study of the spatial layouts of some Swedish and Chinese <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>units.</b> It focuses on the morphological structures of these built forms and their relation to patterns of pedestrian movement. The purpose is to explore if and how far the spatial dimension of the neighbourhoods has any broad relevance to aspects of residential life, and how far this dimension can be also established as a well-defined problem of design. Space syntax theory and method are the major analytical tool used in the exploration. The results of the study are considered to have important implications for understanding the relationship between neighbourhood spatial form and function. Despite the substantial cultural and geometrical dissimilarities displayed by the sample of Swedish and Chinese cases, the planned neighbourhoods are found to possess a few common configurational properties which define these built forms as a particular class of layout. The spatial structures of the neighbourhoods are also found to have describable relations to patterns of pedestrian movement and encounter. These facts suggest strongly that the spatial structure of neighbourhoods is a relevant quality for indicating strategic differences and similarities between different layout patterns. More importantly, these results seem to have fundamental implications not only for a better understanding of neighbourhood morphologies and their relation to function, but also {{for the development of the}} knowledge-base of urban design. An attempt is made to link the key findings of this research to design. This leads to an exploration of the scope and possibilities in applying space syntax analysis to the evaluation of plan design and to the formulation of design choices themselves...|$|R
