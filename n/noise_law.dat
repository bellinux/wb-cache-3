40|$|We {{consider}} a finite horizon linear discrete time varying system whose input is a random noise with an imprecisely known probability law. The statistical uncertainty {{is described by}} a nonnegative parameter a which constrains the anisotropy of the noise as an entropy theoretic measure of deviation of the actual noise distribution from Gaussian white <b>noise</b> <b>laws</b> with scalar covariance matrices. The worst-case disturbance attenuation capabilities of the system {{with respect to the}} statistically uncertain random inputs are quantified by the a-anisotropic norm which is an appropriately constrained operator norm of the system. We establish an anisotropic norm bounded real lemma which provides a state-space criterion for the a-anisotropic norm of the system not to exceed a given threshold. The criterion is organized as an inequality on the determinants of matrices associated with a difference Riccati equation and extends the Bounded Real Lemma of the H-infinity-control theory. We also provide a necessary background on the anisotropy-based robust performance analysis.

40|$|Abstract: Growth in the commercialization, {{mobility}} and urbanization of human settlements {{across the globe}} has greatly exposed world urban population to potentially harmful noise levels. The situation is more disturbing in developing countries like Nigeria, {{where there are no}} sacrosanct <b>noise</b> <b>laws</b> and regulations. This study characterized noise pollution levels in Ibadan and Ile-Ife, two urban areas of Southwestern Nigeria that have experienced significant increases in population and land use activities. Eight hundred noise measurements, taken at 20 different positions in the morning, afternoon, and evening of carefully selected weekdays, in each urban area, were used for this study. Findings put the average noise levels in the urban centers at between 53 dB(A) and 89 dB (A), {{a far cry from the}} World Health Organization (WHO) permissible limits in all the land use types, with highest noise pollution levels recorded for transportation, commercial, residential and educational land use types. The result of the one-way ANOVA test carried out on the dependent variable noise and fixed factor land use types reveals a statistically significant mean noise levels across the study area (F(3, 34) = 15. 13, p = 0. 000).

It appears that 14 m-line sources ensure an estimation of all descriptors with errors below 2 dB(A) if traffic dynamics is precisely described.

Time series 2. 5 to 13 years long from a homogeneously reprocessed solution of 275 globally distributed stations are analyzed in terms of noise content and velocity uncertainty assessment. Several noise models were tested, including power law and Gauss-Markov processes. The best noise model describing our global data set was a combination of variable white <b>noise</b> and power <b>law</b> <b>noise</b> models with mean amplitudes of ∼ 2 mm and ∼ 6 mm, respectively, for the sites considered. This noise model provided a mean vertical velocity uncertainty of ∼ 0. 3 mm/yr, 4 – 5 times larger than the uncorrelated data assumption. We demonstrated that correlated noise content with homogeneously reprocessed data is dependent on time series length and, especially, on data time period. Time series of 2 – 3 years of the oldest data contain noise amplitude similar to that found for time series of 12 years. The data time period should be taken into account when estimating correlated noise content, when comparing different noise estimations, or when applying an external noise estimation to assess velocity uncertainty. We showed that the data period dependency cannot be explained by the increasing tracking network or the ambiguity fixation rate but is probably related to the amount and quality of recorded data...|$|R
