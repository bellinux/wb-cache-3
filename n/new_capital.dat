5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, {{the capital of}} Egypt was moved with different cultures through multiple locations {{up and down the}} Nile, such as Thebes and Memphis, depending on which dynasty was in power. After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt around 331 BC, the capital became the city named for him, Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast. This situation remained stable for nearly a thousand years. After the army of the Arabian Caliph Umar captured the region in the 7th century, shortly after the death of Muhammad, he wanted to establish a <b>new</b> <b>capital.</b> When Alexandria fell in September 641, Amr ibn al-As, the commander of the conquering army, founded a <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> on the eastern bank of the river.|$|E

Quezon. The move ended any implementation of the Burnham Plan's intent for the government centre to be at Luneta.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the growth}} of Canberra and the ACT was slow. The American {{architect}} Walter Burley Griffin won the competition to design Australia's <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> and was appointed to oversee its construction. He was frequently dogged by disputes with Australian authorities and the onset of World War I, which hindered progress. In 1921, Burley Griffin was fired, and multiple planning bodies were established, but achieved little, {{in part due to}} the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 1930, Japan {{signed the}} London Naval Treaty, placing further {{restrictions}} on her maritime forces.

After minor fitting-out work, her reconstruction begun in 1926 was declared complete on 1 October 1931. On 8 November 1931, she served as the Emperor's ship during his official visit to Kumamoto prefecture.|$|E

5|$|Space {{and life}} in the <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> were {{strictly}} regimented: residential areas were separated from the markets, and the military was given its own cantonments, separated from the ordinary populace and each {{the home of a}} specific ethnic contingent of the army (e.g. the Turks, Faraghina, Maghariba and Shakiriyya regiments). The city was dominated by its mosques (most famous among which is the Great Mosque of Samarra built by Caliph al-Mutawakkil in 848–852) and palaces, built in grand style by both the caliphs and their senior commanders, who were given extensive properties to develop. Unlike Baghdad, however, the <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> was an entirely artificial creation. Poorly sited in terms of water supply and river communications, its existence was determined solely by the presence of the caliphal court, and when the capital returned to Baghdad, sixty years later, Samarra was rapidly abandoned. Due to this fact, the ruins of the Abbasid capital are still present on site, and the city can be mapped with great accuracy by modern archaeologists.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} Song forces regrouped {{under the}} self-proclaimed Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127–1162) and withdrew {{south of the}} Yangtze to establish a <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> at Lin'an (modern Hangzhou).

5|$|Abdül Kadir was to {{have been}} the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnought battleship. She {{followed}} a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1876, Sultan Murad V was deposed; the Ottoman Navy had {{played a role in the}} coup, which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne. The new sultan was as a result suspicious of the navy, and attempted to reduce its power by withholding funding and ordering no <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> ships over the course of the following decade. By the late 1880s, however, the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming obsolescent, especially compared to foreign designs like the British s.|$|E
50|$|New {{cities were}} also {{established}} in the post-colonial period, {{but not for the}} same reasons as in the colonial period. The seaport Tema in Ghana was built awaiting great industrial growth. Later, <b>new</b> <b>capitals</b> were built, inspired by the planned city of Brasília in Brazil. This happened in Malawi (Lilongwe), Côte d'Ivoire (Yamoussoukro) and Nigeria (Abuja) (Stock, 1995). The <b>new</b> <b>capitals</b> were meant to give the nation a 'fresh start', {{they were supposed to be}} the beginning of a new golden future promised by the liberation politicians.|$|R

50|$|WRGB has the {{distinction}} of being the very first affiliated station of the NBC Television Network. The Albany TV DMA is served by the following stations, providing programming from many of the English-language American broadcast television networks: WRGB (CBS), WTEN (ABC), WNYT (NBC), WXXA (Fox), WMHT (PBS), WCWN (CW), WNYA (MyNetworkTV), and WYPX (ION). There are currently no local affiliates for any of the Spanish-language domestic broadcast television networks, however the national service of Univision is provided via cable TV. Local cable TV operator Charter Communications provides a 24-hour cable news television channel, Spectrum <b>News</b> <b>Capital</b> Region (formerly <b>Capital</b> <b>News</b> 9, YNN <b>Capital</b> Region, and Time Warner Cable <b>News</b> <b>Capital</b> Region; now covering Albany and Glens Falls). Christian television networks TBN and 3ABN are available via low-power translator service to the immediate metro area. Unlike many television markets around the country, TV stations from neighboring markets cannot normally be received in the greater Albany area due to distance and terrain.|$|R
5|$|After the Order emerged victorious {{from the}} siege, it {{received}} {{financial support from}} Europe, which was used to construct the <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> city on the Sciberras Peninsula. The Italian engineer Francesco Laparelli was sent by the Pope to design the city's fortifications, which were designed along the Italian bastioned system. Laparelli's original design consisted of a bastioned enceinte, with nine cavaliers and a ditch. The city was to be designed along a grid plan, and was to include a naval arsenal and a Manderaggio (a harbour for small ships).|$|E
5|$|At this point, time {{appeared}} to be on Trunajaya's side, as further delay {{would allow him to}} strengthen his fortifications and reinforcements, while disease would weaken the VOC's forces. Therefore, Speelman decided to attack. On 12–13 May, the VOC delivered a heavy artillery bombardment on Trunajaya's main works, followed by an assault. The attack succeeded after hard fighting, and Trunajaya retreated inland to establish his <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> at Kediri, capital city of the ancient Kediri Kingdom. In the retreat, he left behind sixty-nine iron cannons and thirty-four bronze cannons (twenty of them small ships' cannons, bassen) and only saved twenty bronze pieces.|$|E

In {{the days after the}} storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the <b>new</b> <b>capital,</b> Belmopan, was completed in 1970.

40|$|Practitioners have {{observed}} that scenario planning contributes to building <b>new</b> social <b>capital.</b> In scenario planning terms, <b>new</b> social <b>capital</b> can provide access to new information, novel strategic options and unprecedented collaborative opportunities. However, there is no description or explanation in the literature as to how scenario planning can build <b>new</b> social <b>capital.</b> Reporting on research into the scenario planning process of two organizations, we find that scenario planning generates <b>new</b> social <b>capital</b> through learning with the conceptual future, which is a direct investment in building new shared systems of meaning – the cognitive dimension of social capital. This then enables the structural and relational dimensions of <b>new</b> social <b>capital</b> to emerge as by-products. The building of <b>new</b> social <b>capital</b> provides another purpose for scenario investments and another quality criterion by which to assess {{the value of these}} interventions. The insights of the research will be of interest to: scenario planning scholars; leaders interested in how to purposefully design and conduct scenario planning if a core intent is to build new social capital; and scholars interested in the cognitive dimension of social capital and its creation...|$|R

Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May1, 1813, after Pennington suggested it would be safer than Vincennes. For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal {{allies of the}} K'iche' Maya. The growing power of the Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their <b>new</b> <b>capital</b> upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines. Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held the real power.|$|E
