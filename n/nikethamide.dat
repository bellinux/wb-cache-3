50|$|In some sports, <b>nikethamide</b> {{is listed}} by the World Anti-Doping Agency as a banned substance. Croatian tennis player Marin Čilić was {{suspended}} from competition {{for nine months}} after he tested positive for <b>nikethamide</b> in April 2013. This ban was later reduced to four months after Cilic appealed and claimed he had unintentionally ingested it in a glucose tablet bought at a pharmacy. Polish kart driver Igor Walilko was given a two-year ban, later reduced to eighteen months, from competition in 2010 due to testing positive for <b>nikethamide</b> after a win in Germany in July, 2010.|$|E
50|$|Combination of Essentiale with cordiamin (<b>nikethamide)</b> {{and vitamin}} E (50 mg/kg for 35 days) {{considerably}} activates the mono-oxygenase, glucoro- and glutathione transferase {{systems of the}} liver, resulting in the free-radical processes becoming less intense.|$|E
5000|$|Coramine {{was used}} by {{suspected}} serial killer John Bodkin Adams when treating patient Gertrude Hullett, whom he was suspected of murdering. However, the toxicity of <b>nikethamide</b> is quite low ( [...] rabbits 650 mg/kg oral, LD50 rats 240 mg/kg subcutaneous).|$|E
50|$|Etamivan (INN, or ethamivan (USAN); {{trade names}} Analepticon and Vandid) is a {{respiratory}} stimulant drug related to <b>nikethamide.</b> It was mainly {{used in the}} treatment of barbiturate overdose and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but has now largely fallen into disuse.|$|E
50|$|Guignard came {{third in}} the giant slalom at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1989 in Vail, but her doping sample was found {{positive}} for <b>nikethamide</b> and she lost the bronze medal. She was also banned from sport for 1 year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nikethamide</b> is a {{stimulant}} which mainly {{affects the}} respiratory cycle. Widely {{known by its}} former trade name of Coramine, it {{was used in the}} mid-twentieth century as a medical countermeasure against tranquilizer overdoses, before the advent of endotracheal intubation and positive-pressure lung expansion. It is no longer commonly considered to be of value for such purposes.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory stimulants such as <b>nikethamide</b> were {{traditionally}} used {{to counteract}} respiratory depression from CNS depressant overdose, but offered limited effectiveness. A new respiratory stimulant drug called BIMU8 {{is being investigated}} {{which seems to be}} significantly more effective and may be useful for counteracting the respiratory depression produced by opiates and similar drugs without offsetting their therapeutic effects.|$|E
50|$|An {{analeptic}}, in medicine, is {{a central}} nervous system stimulant. The term analeptic typically refers to respiratory analeptics (for example, doxapram). Analeptics are central nervous system stimulants that include {{a wide variety of}} medications used to treat depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and respiratory depression. Analeptics can also be used as convulsants, with low doses causing patients to experience heightened awareness, restlessness and rapid breathing.The primary medical use of these drugs is as an anesthetic recovery tool or to treat emergency respiratory depression.Other drugs of this category are prethcamide, pentylenetetrazole, and <b>nikethamide.</b> <b>Nikethamide</b> is now withdrawn due to risk of convulsions. Analeptics have recently been used to better understand the treatment of a barbiturate overdose. Through the use of agents researchers were able to treat obtundation and respiratory depression. Various analeptics contain epononymous names. E.g. Etamivan has the tradname of Analepticon & synephrine is called Analeptin.|$|E
5000|$|It later {{turned out}} that she had used the banned {{substance}} <b>nikethamide.</b> She was banned for two years effective from July 18, 2004, missing the 2004 Summer Olympics. In August 2004, Edwards appealed the ban, and an arbitration panel acknowledged that Edwards [...] "conducted herself with honesty, integrity and character ... she has not sought to gain any improper advantage or to 'cheat' in any way." [...] In November 2005, her two-year ban was shortened to 15 months when the World Anti-Doping Agency downgraded <b>nikethamide</b> infractions to maximum one-year suspensions. The drug had come from pills she had taken at a meet in Martinique to combat a minor illness. Though arbitrators decided Edwards had taken the drug inadvertently, saying in their ruling that she had conducted herself with [...] "honesty, integrity and character," [...] they did not overturn the suspension, because the glucose tablets given to her by her doctor contained a warning for athletes advising that the pills could cause a positive doping test. Therefore, Edwards did not take performance enhancement drugs to improve her performance.|$|E
50|$|The coma {{cocktail}} {{is thought}} to have been created in United States as a first line treatment for an unconscious patient in an era where intensive care was new and difficult to maintain. Original coma cocktails included methylxanthines, physostigmine, physical stimulation (such as cold water baths or ammonium carbonate ("smelling salts")), amphetamines, strychnine, picrotoxin, <b>nikethamide</b> and camphor. As medicine and assessment techniques have advanced, the proceeding drugs have been mostly replaced by the modern coma cocktail as described above.|$|E
50|$|After their {{introduction}} in {{the early}} 20th century, analeptics were used to study the new life-threatening problem of barbiturate overdose. Prior to the 1930s naturally occurring stimulants such as camphor and caffeine were utilized {{in the treatment of}} barbiturate overdose. Between 1930 and 1960 synthetic analeptics such as <b>nikethamide,</b> pentylenetetrazol, bemegride, amphetamine, and methylphenidate replaced the naturally occurring compounds in treating barbiturate overdose. Recently, analeptics have been turned to the treatment of ADHD due to more efficient ways to treat barbiturate overdoses.|$|E
5000|$|On December 29, 2008, Russian {{investigators}} {{revealed that}} he suffered from myocarditis, a condition where not enough blood gets to the heart, {{and that he should}} not have been playing professional hockey. The federal Investigative Committee also announced that a chemical analysis of Cherepanov's blood and urine samples allowed experts to conclude [...] "that for several months Alexei Cherepanov engaged in doping". Official sources have stated the banned substance taken was <b>nikethamide,</b> a stimulant, and that it had been taken 3 hours prior to the game in which he died.|$|E
5000|$|Hofmann {{became an}} {{employee}} of the pharmaceutical-chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories (now a subsidiary of Novartis), located in Basel as a co-worker with professor Arthur Stoll, {{founder and director of the}} pharmaceutical department. He began studying the medicinal plant squill and the fungus ergot as part of a program to purify and synthesize active constituents for use as pharmaceuticals. His main contribution was to elucidate the chemical structure of the common nucleus of the Scilla glycosides (an active principal of Mediterranean Squill). While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on 16 November 1938. The main intention of the synthesis was to obtain a respiratory and circulatory stimulant (an analeptic) with no effects on the uterus in analogy to <b>nikethamide</b> (which is also a diethylamide) by introducing this functional group to lysergic acid. It was set aside for five years, until 16 April 1943, when Hofmann decided to reexamine it. While re-synthesizing LSD, he accidentally touched his hand to his mouth, nose or possibly eye, accidentally ingesting a small amount and discovered its powerful effects. He described what he felt as being: ...|$|E
5000|$|At Wimbledon Čilić had to {{pull out}} before his second round match due to a left knee injury where he was {{scheduled}} to play Kenny de Schepper of France. However, a month later it was revealed that Čilić had pulled out as he had been informed that he had failed a drugs test in Munich, allegedly for [...] "incautious use of glucose." [...] On 16 September 2013, he received a backdated nine-month ban for traces of <b>nikethamide</b> in a urine test. Čilić stated that someone from his team bought Coramine glucose tablets at a pharmacy and as a result the independent tribunal found that he did not intend to enhance his performance. The suspension ran until 1 February 2014 and all prize money and points since the positive test including the Munich tournament were null and forfeited. Čilić appealed against this ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who reduced the ban from nine months to four months on October 25. They stated that, [...] "the degree of fault committed by the athlete was inferior to that established in the (tribunal) decision and the sanction imposed was too severe in view of the degree of fault" [...] and concluded that it should be reduced to four months. Čilić, whose ranking had dropped to number 47, received an immediate boost as results at the French Open, Queen's and Wimbledon were reinstated.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>nikethamide</b> (N,N-diethylnicotinamide, CoramineR) is metabolized very rapidly to nicotinamide. Hence, there is {{difficulty}} in proving that <b>nikethamide</b> {{has been used as a}} doping substance because nicotinamide is a normal physiological metabolite in the organism as well as a vitamin preparation. However, an intermediate metabolite (N-ethylnicotinamide) was found by us in the urine of horses treated with CoramineR. This was characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and synthesized and identified as being N-ethylnicotinamide. The excretion and metabolism of <b>nikethamide</b> after intramuscular injection in the horse was followed using quantitative gas chromatography of urine extracts over a period of several hours and the results of these experiments are reported. Changes in urinary pH had no significant effect upon either the metabolism or rate of excretion of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Nicotine-selective poly(acrylamide/maleic acid) (AAm/MA) hydrogels {{prepared}} by g-irradiation {{were used in}} experiments on swelling, diffusion, and interactions of the pharmaceuticals nicotine, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and <b>nikethamide.</b> For AAm/MA hydrogel containing 60 mg maleic acid and irradiated at 5. 2 kGy, the studies indicated that swelling increased in the following order; nicotine>nicotinamide>nikethamide>nicotinic acid>water. Diffusions of water and the pharmaceuticals within the hydrogels {{were found to be}} non-Fickian in character. AAm/MA hydrogel sorbed only nicotine and did not sorb nicotinamide, <b>nikethamide</b> and nicotinic acid in the binding experiments. S-type adsorption in Giles’s classification system was observed. Some binding and thermodynamic parameters for AAm/MA hydrogel-nicotine system were calculated using the Scatchard method. The values of adsorption heat and free energy of this system were found to be negative whereas adsorption entropy was found to be positive. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{the purpose}} of the study: Local people of Lakshmipur {{district}} of Bangladesh use leaves of Peperomia pellucida in the treatment of excited mental disorder but its neuropharmacological effect has not yet been explored. In the present study depressant effects of leaves of this plant was investigated. Methods: Petroleum ether and ethyl acetate soluble fractions of ethanol extract of Peperomia pellucida leaves were administered to mice intraperitonealy and their effects on duration of diazepam-induced sleep, nikethamide-induced toxicity, light-dark test and force swimming test were determined. Results and major conclusion: The duration of diazepam-induced sleep was extended by administration of these fractions. <b>Nikethamide</b> at high doses caused death of mice and administration of these fractions delayed the time that <b>nikethamide</b> caused the death of animals. In light-dark test and force swimming test these fractions showed diazepam type effects. The changes in doses (50 - 200 mg/kg) resulted in modification of efficiency of these effects. These results suggest that both fractions of P. pellucida leaves have dose dependent depressant effects...|$|E

Fifteen replies were received. Seven replies cited a total of 67 references: 31 contained relevant original data and only 13 were controlled trials, all of which had serious methodological flaws. There were four reports of changes in advertising claims and one company ceased marketing <b>nikethamide</b> in the third world.

40|$|Rats {{treated with}} phenobarbitone, phenaglycodol, glutethimide, <b>nikethamide,</b> meprobamate, chlorbutol and {{chlorpromazine}} showed an increased metabolism of pentobarbitone and, {{at the same}} time, a diminished sleeping-time after pentobarbitone. This effect developed 24 hr after treatment, the maximum increase in metabolism occurring after about 48 hr. The increased pentobarbitone metabolism was inhibited by ethionine injected shortly before treatment. Using a liver slice preparation, increased pentobarbitone metabolism was also observed in vitro. These results are {{in accord with the}} view that the capacity of compounds to increase pentobarbitone metabolism may be related to their ability to act directly on microsomal enzyme systems...|$|E
40|$|An analeptic, a {{respiratory}} stimulant, and an {{opiate antagonist}} were studied {{with respect to}} their effect on experimentally induced somatic pain. The method of tibial pressure algesimetry was used. Naloxone invariably abolished the analgesia produced by both morphine and pethidine. <b>Nikethamide</b> produced a transient reversal of the analgesic state while doxapram had no effect on either morphine or pethidine analgesia. Respiratory depression is one of the well-recognized hazards of opiate administration and can produce problems when large doses of these drugs are used in the relief of postoperative pain. Many adjuncts have been studied with the objective of assessing their effectiveness in reducing the respiratory depressant effects of narcotic analgesics without also reducing their analgesic effect, but have proved singularly un-successful in this respect. If available, such a drug should have a great clinical potential. This pape...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (1), a comparison {{was made of}} the action of caffeine and 1 -ethyl theobromine. Although in certain respects the latter appeared more potent than caffeine, particularly in animals, the degree of differ-ence between the 2 compounds was not great enough apparently to be of practical interest. However, the results were sufficiently encouraging to warrant a further study of other analogues. Included in this investigation were the ethyl, n-pro-pyl, n-butyl, isoamyl, allyl, methallyl, crotyl, and methoxyethyl theobromines. The well-known products, caffeine and, in certain instances, theophylline, the-obromine, d-amphetamine sulfate, lobeline sulfate, and <b>nikethamide,</b> were also employed for the sake of comparison. We are greatly indebted to Dr. L. P. Kyrides, of the Monsanto Chemical Company, who supplied us with all the derivatives of theobromine. The majority of the chemicals tested are not new. Van der Slooten (2) was the first to prepare successfully 1 -alkyl theobromiiie derivatives. In spite of many reports describing preparation of these substances, pharmacologic studie...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRAcT KLAASSEN, CURTIS D. : Biiary flow after microsomal enzyme induction. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 168 : 218 - 223, 1969. Biliary {{flow and}} wet liver weight were {{determined}} in rats after treatment with various microsomal enzyme inducers for one, two, three, five or seven days. Phenobarbital (PB) {{was the only}} agent which produced {{a significant increase in}} biliary flow (control vs. treated: 60 vs. 90 Ll/min/kg). With chlordane, <b>nikethamide,</b> phenylbutazone and chlorcyclizine treatment, there was a tendency in the direction of an increase in biiary flow (60 vs. approximately 75 d/min/kg), but the increases were not statistically significant. Biiary flow was not altered in rats pretreated with 3, 4 -benzpyrene and 3 -methylcholanthrene. Significant increases in drug-metabolizing activity were demonstrated by a decrease in zoxazolamine paralysis time with PB, 3 -methylcholanthrene, 3, 4 -benzpyrene and chlordane, but only PB significantly enhanced biiary flow. Therefore, microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme induction itself does not result in an increase in biliary flow. Livers from the PB- and 3 -methylcholanthrene-treated rats exhibited the greatest increase in wet weight followed by 3, 4 -benzpyrene, nikethamid...|$|E
40|$|Gastric {{haemorrhage}} {{was produced}} regularly in mice within 6 {{hours of the}} subcutaneous injection of a large dose (2 to 10 mg. /kg.) of reserpine or of deserpidine. Rescinnamine, syrosingopine (SU- 3118), and tetrabenazine (Ro 1 - 9569) were less active. Gastric haemorrhage was also produced within 6 hours when 5 -hydroxytryptamine (10 mg. /kg.) was injected every half-hour. Neither reserpine nor 5 -hydroxytryptamine produced gastric haemorrhage in mice which had been vagotomized by tying the oesophagus at the cardio-oesophageal junction or which had been pre-treated with iproniazid. Amphetamine was less effective than iproniazid in preventing gastric haemorrhage after reserpine, and the following drugs were ineffective: cocaine, methyl phenidate (Ritalin), amarin, caffeine, <b>nikethamide,</b> lysergic acid diethylamide and its 2 -bromo derivative (BOL 148). Gastric haemorrhage was not observed in mice which had been given substantial doses of atropine or of hexamethonium before reserpine. The incidence of haemorrhage was substantially reduced by treatment with an antacid mixture. It is concluded that reserpine-like drugs cause gastric haemorrhage by a mechanism which has an important central component and which involves the liberation of 5 -hydroxytryptamine...|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} 5, 5 -diethyl- 1, 3 -oxazine- 2, 4 -dione (dioxone) {{has been studied}} in rats, rabbits, cats and dogs. Dioxone {{produced}} a marked stimulation of respiration in anaesthetized, decerebrate and spinal animals when given in doses that did not induce convulsions. This effect was generally accompanied by a rise in blood pressure, which was more marked in cats than in dogs and rabbits. Dioxone antagonized the respiratory and circulatory depression due to pentobarbitone. The respiratory stimulating effect of dioxone appears to be 2 or 3 times {{greater than that of}} leptazol, and comparable to that of megimide. Like leptazol, <b>nikethamide</b> and megimide, dioxone has no direct effect on cardiac function. Dioxone did not elicit respiratory and blood pressure changes when allowed to come in contact with the carotid sinus receptors. Dioxone enhanced the reflex excitability of bulbar centres, as demonstrated by the increase in respiratory response either to temporary common carotid artery occlusion in dogs or to electrical stimulation of the central cut end of Hering's nerve in the cat. Dioxone also reduced the inhibition of respiration induced by electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the vagus nerve. Whether this central action of dioxone is direct or not cannot at present be elucidated, though a section at intercollicular level did not prevent the respiratory stimulation produced by this substance...|$|E
40|$|An {{association}} is described between hypothermia occurring in anaesthetized babies and early postoperative morbidity and death. Sixty-seven children under one year old had operations in 1960, of whom twelve died; seven {{of these cases}} (which are described) were associated with hypothermia. While other factors were undoubtedly involved it seems that hypothermia was the principal factor responsible for the deaths. Hypothermia {{is most likely to}} occur during long operations, in air-conditioned theatres and when respiration is controlled. Ways of preventing inadvertent hypo-thermia are discussed and the importance of temperature monitoring and of rigid maintenance of normal temperatures is emphasized. Ibadan in Western Nigeria is in the tropical forest belt 180 m (600 ft.) above sea level, 7 ° north of the equator. The average midday temperature is above 27 °C (80 °F) and the average relative humidity above 65 per cent (wet bulb temperature 24 °C (75 °F)). The tempera-tures of patients who undergo operations in these theatres tend to remain steady except in the cases of small children in whom temperature drops are common. At first this was not thought to be harmful but in August 1959 the following event occurred. CASE 1. A 7 -day-old baby underwent a resection of gangrenous bowel following a volvulus of the small intestine. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and oxygen using intermittent suxa-methonium (total dose 70 mg) and controlled respira-tion. The operation lasted 105 minutes, during which time the temperature fell from 38. 7 °C (98 °F) to 35 °C (95 °F). After operation the respiration was inadequate and was not improved by atropine 0. 25 mg and neostigmine 0. 025 mg nor by intra-muscular <b>nikethamide.</b> The baby felt cold to the touch and was therefore wrapped up and placed in the warm recovery room. Artificial respiration with oxygen was given, but 1 | hours after operation the circulation failed and the child died. During 1960 there were seven more post-operative deaths in infants who were hypother-mic during operation. An investigation of th...|$|E
