After that, the germinative and somatic cells of testes parenchyma were isolated by digesting the whole testes by a standard method. Next, viability, apoptosis, and necrosis of the cells were evaluated by TUNEL kit and flow cytometry. Results: The rates of apoptosis and necrosis of the testicular cells were increased (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 001, respectively), but viability of these cells decreased in testes of rats exposed to <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> (P = 0. 003).

40|$|It {{has been}} almost forty years since {{cisplatin}} was introduced in clinical practice as a potent and promising anti-neoplastic drug. Since then, the usage of cisplatin for treating a variety of cancers in both {{children and young adults}} has increased. Ototoxicity is one of the dose limiting side effects of cisplatin. Currently, {{there is not a single}} good otoprotecting drug against cisplatin ototoxicity in clinical practice. We planed to study the effect of <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> against cisplatin ototoxicity alone and in combination with two other thiol based otoprotectors, namely L-NAC and D-MET, at very low dosages which had shown otoprotection against cisplatin ototoxicity. Although these two otoprotectors have shown promising results in animal studies at high dosages, there is concern that high dose of L-NAC and D-MET could have negative effects on chemotherapy, leading to reduced chemotherapeutic efficacy. In an attempt to avoid this negative chemotherapeutic effect, studies have been conducted administrating the otoprotecting drug at varying times and space. The underlined hypothesis of this thesis is that a tolerable stress before an intolerable cisplatin insult could better prepare the hair cells for the intolerable cisplatin insult. Above all, an acute <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> alone could potentially activate antioxidant enzymes, heat shock proteins, glucocorticoids, and stress activated protein kinases that could protect the hair cells from cisplatin toxicity. We used <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> to enhance the otoprotective effects of L-NAC and D-MET. Moreover, we were interested in studying the effect of <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> alone. Results of our studies have demonstrated that the <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> technique maximizes the otoprotecting efficacy of 275 mg/kg L-NAC and 300 mg/kg D-MET, where 300 mg/kg D-MET + <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> being the best among all treated groups. More interestingly, we found that <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> alone showed better results against cisplatin ototoxicity when compared with the cisplatin only group. Both Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and TRITC-conjugated phalloidin staining were essentially consistent with the ABR findings. Even minor otoprotection by an acute <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> could change the current course of drug-only otoprotection approach against cisplatin ototoxicity. In clinic, this would let us use certain frequencies of sound by a headphone before or after the cisplatin treatment to protect at least the speech perception frequencies of patients...|$|E

Naloxone pretreatment was also investigated. <b>Noise</b> <b>stress</b> was produced by a sound source, nociception was measured by the hot-plate test and binding characteristics were evaluated by a radioligand binding technique using membrane preparation from the total frontal cortex. Acute <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> provoked an antinociceptive effect, associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels, a {{decrease in the number of}} 5 -HT 2 receptors in stressed male and female mice and a decrease in the number of mu receptors in both sexes. The behavioural and biochemical effects were antagonized by 1 mg/kg of naloxone. Acute <b>noise</b> <b>stress</b> behaves like other types of stress on nociception. The opioidergic system seems to be involved in this behaviour but also the serotonergic system may play a role. Sex differences were detected in the number of 5 -HT 2 and mu receptors between male and female mice not subjected to stress, while the percentage decrease in 5 -HT 2 and mu receptors did not differ significantly between the two sexes...|$|E
40|$|Survival and {{percolation}} probabilities {{are most}} important quantities in the theory and {{in the application of}} growth models with spreading. We construct field theoretical expressions for these probabilities which are feasible for perturbation expansions. The outstanding role of the absorbing <b>noise</b> is <b>stressed</b> to obtain survival probabilities monotonic decreasing with time. We briefly consider some fundamental growth models equipped with absorbing noise which are representations of known universality classes of spreading phenomena. The critical scaling properties of their survival and percolation and probabilities are stated. In an appendix we consider shortly the renormalized field theory of compact directed percolation.

40|$|Introduction: Individuals’ jobs {{performance}} is one {{the most important}} factors in industries and organizations. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the simultaneous effect of exposure to noise, lighting and heat stress on the workers’ job performance.. Material and Method: In this analytical-descriptive study, 30 employees of the auto parts manufacturer, in Tehran city, were chosen by simple random sampling. By controlling and limiting confounding factors, the simultaneous effect of noise, lighting and heat stress on the participants’ job performance was investigated, using tow series of mental and manual testes. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 18, using descriptive statistic, ANOVA and Tukey testes and also person correlation coefficient.. Result: The results showed that by increasing the <b>noise</b> and heat <b>stress</b> (P = 0. 046, r= 0. 344) and decreasing of lighting (P = 0. 008, r = - 0. 472), the required time for performing the Minnesota placement test has been gone up. Moreover, the result revealed that by increase in <b>noise</b> and heat <b>stress</b> (P = 0. 007, r = 0. 478) and decrease in lighting (P= 0. 003, r = 0. 523) the required time for competing hand tool dexterity test has been also increased at surface and mid level.. Conclusion: Finding of the present research manifested that increase in <b>noise</b> and heat <b>stress</b> and also reduction in lighting lessen the speed of manual tests and time and accuracy of mathematical calculations. Therefore this result confirm the effects of various environmental factors on individuals’ job performance, in a way that by variation of different environmental factors, time of manual test and time and accuracy of mental tests would be changed...|$|R
