Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was natural}} perversity; {{sometimes}} I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was false pride at getting over sea-sickness; sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was reading 'Robinson Crusoe,' and books warning of {{me not to}} go to sea." ...|$|R

We <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the States where it exists, but that it is a wrong which in its tendency, to say the least, affects the existence of the whole nation. Because we <b>think</b> <b>it</b> wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong.|$|R
