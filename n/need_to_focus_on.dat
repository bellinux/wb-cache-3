5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the intrinsic elements of a work {{as the best way}} to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Zvi Aharoni, {{one of the}} Mossad {{agents who}} had been {{involved}} in the Eichmann capture, was placed in charge of a team of agents tasked with locating Mengele and bringing him to trial in Israel. Inquiries in Paraguay gave no clues as to his whereabouts, and they were unable to intercept any correspondence between Mengele and his wife Martha, then living in Italy. Agents following Rudel's movements did not produce any leads. Aharoni and his team followed Gerhard to a rural area near São Paulo, where they located a European man believed to be Mengele. Aharoni reported his findings to Harel, but the logistics of staging a capture, budgetary constraints, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the nation's deteriorating relationship with Egypt led the Mossad chief to call a halt to the operation in 1962.|$|E
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static rocket motor, which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.|$|E

5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of}} the game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E

25|$|On 25 June 1879, however, Stout {{resigned}} {{both from}} cabinet and from parliament, citing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> his law practice. His {{partner in the}} practice was growing increasingly ill, {{and the success of}} his firm was important to the welfare of both Stout and his family. Throughout his career, Stout found the cost of participating in politics a serious worry. His legal career, however, was probably not the only contributing factor to his resignation, with a falling out between Stout and George Grey having occurred shortly beforehand.|$|E
25|$|Vanuatu were undefeated {{throughout}} the tournament, defeating Papua New Guinea {{in the final}} to win the gold medal {{for the first time}} (and become the first country other than PNG to win a gold medal in men's Pacific Games cricket). Tonga defeated New Caledonia in the bronze-medal play-off. Only four teams participated in the tournament, the same as at the 2011 tournament and two less than in the women's tournament. Because the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier was held at the same time, Papua New Guinea fielded a development squad at the Pacific Games, coached by John Ovia. Fiji and Samoa did not send men's teams, despite both their women's teams competing in the games. Cricket Fiji cited logistical reasons for not sending a team, stating their <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> their participation at the 2015 WCL Division Six tournament.|$|E
500|$|Australia {{finished}} the Games with two bronze medals. Jason Hellwig {{stated that the}} aim was to win between two and five medals. He said: [...] "wo medals absolutely is a pass ... so we're really pleased with that but we're absolutely disappointed we didn't get the mission done to win that gold medal, but I tell you what, we are absolutely determined to get it done in four years' time. It hasn't been easy, we've come in under the most difficult of circumstances that I've ever seen a team [...] at a major Games." [...] Chris Nunn, Chef de Mission, pointed to the future by stating that [...] "We really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> having good-quality athletes who are robust and have financial support to get overseas. It's not like living in Austria, Sweden or Germany where you can do this on the weekend and after work." ...|$|E

2500|$|One Synod father {{mentioned}} {{the need for}} a better approach to pastorally care for those who cohabitate before marriage. [...] Koch spoke about the large numbers of unmarried couples who live together because they do not see marriage as important.

5000|$|In smaller {{high-tech}} {{firms or}} start-ups, product marketing and product management functions can be blurred, and both tasks may be borne by one individual. However, {{as the company}} grows someone <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> creating good requirements documents for the engineering team, whereas someone else <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> how <b>to</b> analyze the market, influence the [...] "analysts", and understand longer term market direction. When such clear demarcation becomes visible, the former falls under the domain of product management, and the latter, under product marketing. In Silicon Valley, in particular, product marketing professionals have considerable domain experience in a particular market or technology or both. Some Silicon Valley firms have titles such as Product Marketing Engineer.|$|R

Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a [...] "world-shaking" [...] story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to [...] "some weird succession thing".

2500|$|In {{arguing against}} the term Global War on Terror, Francis Fukuyama said the United States was not {{fighting}} terrorism generically, as in Chechnya or Palestine. Rather, {{he said the}} slogan [...] "war on terror" [...] is directed at [...] "radical Islamism, a movement that makes use of culture for political objectives." [...] He suggested it might be deeper than the ideological conflict of the Cold War, but {{it should not be}} confused with Samuel Huntington's [...] "clash of civilizations." [...] Addressing Huntington's thesis, Fukuyama stressed that the US and its allies <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> specific radical groups rather than clash with global Islam.|$|E

She joined the school's musical theater program, where she felt she was [...] "meant to be." [...] In April 2011, Black dropped out in favor of homeschooling, citing both a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> her career and a desire to avoid taunts from her former classmates.

2500|$|In 1929, Mannerheim {{refused the}} right-wing radicals' plea {{to become a}} de facto {{military}} dictator, although he did express some support for the right-wing Lapua Movement. After President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was elected in 1931, he appointed Mannerheim as chairman of Finland's Defence Council. At the same time, Mannerheim received a written promise that {{in the event of}} war, he would become the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army. (Svinhufvud's successor Kyösti Kallio renewed this promise in 1937). In 1933, Mannerheim received the rank of Field Marshal (sotamarsalkka, fältmarskalk). By this time, Mannerheim had come to be seen by the public, including some former socialists, as less of a [...] "White General", and more of a national figure. This feeling was enhanced by his public statements urging reconciliation between the opposing sides in the Civil War and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> national unity and defence.|$|E
2500|$|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe says, [...] "Treat {{people as}} they were {{that they ought to}} be and you may help them to become what they are capable of being". As a leader, there are two qualities that you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> in an organization: the {{structure}} of the organization and how followers are involved. The type of leadership you want in an organization would be a democratic approach. A democratic leader does not feel threatened when followers make suggestions, but instead accepts the contributions to help improve the overall quality of decision-making. Having a democratic system allows for the followers to set goals for the organization, and this creates two-way communication that openly flows between the leader and followers. The leader wants to have more interaction with the followers. Through interaction it allows followers to be engaged in the organization, but they also have a higher participation rate. The democratic style of leadership communication is often most effective. Generally, the benefits derived from democratic communication far outweigh any potential cost.|$|E
2500|$|Trengove's 2013 {{pre-season}} was {{hampered by}} a navicular bone stress fracture, which forced {{him into a}} moon boot for six weeks and miss twelve weeks of training. Along with Jack Grimes, he was retained as co-captain for the 2013 season. A reduction in fitness due to the foot injury and Melbourne having one of its poorest seasons in history saw Trengove's form drop. Questions were raised over {{how much of an}} impact captaining Melbourne's dismal season was having on him and whether his form would improve if he relinquished the captaincy. In November, he stepped down as captain, citing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> his playing form. After the revelations of the Essendon Football Club supplements saga and sport scientist Stephen Dank's involvement, Trengove was linked to Dank after texts between Dank and Melbourne's doctor surfaced in April regarding treatment of his foot. He was cleared by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority over a year later in June 2014. He missed two matches during the year, the round one match against [...] at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the round seven match against [...] at the Melbourne Cricket Ground due to a calf injury, to finish with twenty matches during the year.|$|E
