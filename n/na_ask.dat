Few from either fellowship experienced discouragement of community activity outside the fellowship. The NA sample differed from the AA sample in some ways. NA members had less time in their fellowship and perceived their activity as relating to skills and encouragement they found in it. AA members were very long-term participants who saw their community work as one way of giving back {{what they had been}} given by their 12 -step recovery.

[...] Womack concluded with analyzing the incorporation of religious themes by Nas in his composition, stating [...] "Nas clung to spiritual questioning, expressing a desire to be like the early mystics, in order to possess their knowledge and powers. While he expresses that he has the potential of the greats, in 'One Mic' he asks God to show him how to do things his son did. Nas intertwined his day-to-day life and decisions with the pressures felt by Jesus and others, doing so almost as a means to somehow transfer their spiritual gifts to himself." ...|$|R

Soon after the truce with Razadarit, Minkhaung sent in an army to occupy Arakan, which had been raiding his territory. To reduce the probability of an opportunistic attack by Razadarit from the south, Minkhaung also sent a letter of alliance to the king of Lan <b>Na</b> (Chiang Mai) <b>asking</b> the latter to threaten Hanthawaddy from the east. But the letter was intercepted by Razadarit's men. Moreover, Minkhaung appointed his eldest son Minye Kyawswa as heir apparent.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new critical edition of “Se·l mals d’amor m’auzi ni m’es noisens” by Blacasset and “Dieus es amors e verais salvamens by Pujol”. These two poets discuss {{a topic that}} is entirely new to Occitan lyric poetry: two young women about to enter a convent. While Blacasset expresses sadness about their choice {{of life in a}} convent, using elements of the funeral lament, Pujol praises it and believes it to be the only remedy for the corruption of the world. The tenso between women “Na Carenza al bel cors avenenç” seems to be conceived as a parody of this lyric debate: in the dialogue Alaisina and Yselda, who have doubts about becoming mothers, <b>ask</b> <b>Na</b> Carenza whether it is better to stay virgins or to marry; the latter advises them, in cryptic terms that are difficult to interpret, to become nuns, thereby gaining a husband (God) but not children. I will suggest that the question of female authorship for this text be reconsidered, while proposing a new interpretation {{in the light of the}} lively debate in the medieval period about the suitability and prerogatives of virginity...|$|R
6000|$|Immediately {{after the}} service, forgetting that his {{intention}} {{had been to}} get the long-waited-for look at Mary {{in the light of}} the sun, Shefford hurried back to camp and to a secluded spot among the cedars. Strikingly it had come to him that the fault he had found in Gentile religion he now found in the Mormon religion. An old question returned to haunt him--were all religions the same in blindness? As far as he could see, religion existed to uphold the founders of a Church, a creed. The Church of his own kind was a place where narrow men and women went to think of their own salvation. They did not go there to think of others. And now Shefford's keen mind saw something of Mormonism and found it wanting. Bishop Kane was a sincere, good, mistaken man. He believed what he preached, but that would not stand logic. He taught blindness and mostly it appeared to be directed at the women. Was there no religion divorced from power, no religion as good for one man as another, no religion in the spirit of brotherly love? Nas Ta Bega's [...] "Bi Nai" [...] (brother)--that was love, if not religion, and perhaps the one and the other were the same. Shefford kept in mind an intention to <b>ask</b> <b>Nas</b> Ta Bega what he thought of the Mormons.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of The Firm, future members and affiliates of the group were at transitional stages of their careers. Following the acclaim of his landmark debut album Illmatic (1994), Queensbridge-based emcee Nas decided to concentrate his efforts in a mainstream direction. Despite its significant impact on hip hop at the time, Illmatic did not experience the larger sales of most major releases of the day, due in part to Nas' shy personality and withdrawal from promoting the record. Nas began to make appearances on other artists' work, including [...] "Fast Life" [...] on Kool G Rap's [...] "4,5,6" [...] and [...] "Verbal Intercourse" [...] on Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995), which made him the first non Wu-Tang member to appear on one of their recordings. Nas began to dub himself as Nas Escobar on these guest appearances. Meanwhile, his excessive spending habits had left him with little money, as <b>Nas</b> had to <b>ask</b> for a loan to purchase clothes to wear to the 1995 Source Awards. The success of fellow East Coast act The Notorious B.I.G. at the awards show sent a message to Nas to change his commercial approach, resulting in his hiring of Steve [...] "The Commissioner" [...] Stoute as manager. While Illmatic attained gold status, Stoute convinced Nas to aim his efforts in a more commercial direction for his second album, after which Nas enlisted production team the Trackmasters, who were known for their mainstream success at the time.|$|R

The main goal {{of the game is}} to win 1 million polish zloty (€240,000) by answering twelve multiple-choice questions correctly. In previous editions, there were three or four lifelines - fifty fifty (pół <b>na</b> pół, 50:50), <b>ask</b> the audience (pytanie do publiczności) and ask the expert (pytanie do eksperta), the experts were: Bartosz Węglarczyk, Michał Ogórek, Szymon Hołownia, Dorota Wellman and Jan Wróbel; in the previous season - Andrzej Fabianowski, Piotr Gąsowski and Kazimiera Szczuka. Earlier there was (and since 2017 there is) phone a friend telefon do przyjaciela instead of ask the expert pytanie do eksperta. Since March 2010 until February 2017, contestant could choose risk game. If the contestant wanted risk game, a new lifeline called switch the question (zmiana pytania) was added - if the contestant chose to play the version with this lifeline, the second guaranteed sum (40,000 zł) was not guaranteed. The first series of Milionerzy was broadcast from 3 September 1999 to 26 January 2003, and the second version has been broadcast since 19 January 2008.

6000|$|Then when {{he looked}} at future action he felt a strange, {{unalterable}} purpose to save Fay Larkin. She was very young--seventeen or eighteen, she had said--and there could be, there must be some happiness before her. It had been his dream to chase a rainbow--it had been his determination to find her in the lost Surprise Valley. Well, he had found her. It never occurred to him to <b>ask</b> <b>Nas</b> Ta Bega how he had discovered that the Sago Lily was Fay Larkin. The wonder was, Shefford thought, that he had so long been blind himself. How simply everything worked out now! Every thought, every recollection of her was proof. Her strange beauty like that of the sweet and rare lily, her low voice that showed the habit of silence, her shapely hands with the clasp strong as a man's, her lithe form, her swift step, her wonderful agility upon the smooth, steep trails, and the wildness of her upon the heights, and the haunting, brooding shadow of her eyes when she gazed across the cañon--all these fitted so harmoniously the conception of a child lost in a beautiful Surprise Valley and growing up in its wildness and silence, tutored by the sad love of broken Jane and Lassiter. Yes, to save her had been Shefford's dream, and he had loved that dream. He had loved the dream and he had loved the child. The secret of her hiding-place as revealed by the story told him and his slow growth from dream to action--these had strangely given Fay Larkin to him. Then had come the bitter knowledge that she was dead. In the light of this subsequent revelation how easy to account for his loving Mary, too. Never would she be Mary again to him! Fay Larkin and the Sago Lily were one and the same. She was here, near him, and he was powerless for the present to help her or to reveal himself. She was held back there in that gloomy hall among those somber Mormons, alien to the women, bound in some fatal way to one of the men, and now, by reason of her weakness in the trial, surely to be hated. Thinking of her past and her present, of the future, and that secret Mormon whose face she had never seen, Shefford felt a sinking of his heart, a terrible cold pang in his breast, a fainting of his spirit. She had sworn she was no sealed wife. But had she not lied? So, then, how utterly powerless he was! ...|$|R
40|$|This {{compendium}} updates a 2003 {{literature review}} of surveys {{of knowledge and}} opinions of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Its purpose {{is to ensure that}} results of comparable surveys are considered in surveys conducted by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). Over twice as many studies related to the DOE survey have been published since 2003 than prior to that date. The fact that there have been significantly more studies implies that there have been further demonstration projects and/or increased interest in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. The primary findings of these 15 new surveys, all of which were conducted in Europe (E) or North America (NA), to the DOE surveys are as follows: 1. Respondents who are more educated are more accepting of hydrogen technologies (NA). 2. Respondents who are more knowledgeable about hydrogen and/or fuel cells are more accepting of hydrogen technologies (E, <b>NA).</b> 3. When <b>asked</b> about issues of trust, respondents generally expressed distrust of the government or political parties but trusted scientists and environmental protection organizations (E). 4. Technical knowledge about hydrogen and fuel cell technologies is low (E, NA). 5. Respondents may express opinions about a technology even when they are lacking in knowledge of that technology (E). 6. Women and men have different priorities when deciding on an automobile purchase (E). 7. Public acceptance to hydrogen is vulnerable to perceptions of decreased safety (E, NA). 8. Public acceptance to hydrogen is vulnerable to perceptions of increased cost (E, NA). The DOE surveys are similar to surveys that examine technical knowledge of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, although the technical questions are certainly different. The DOE surveys are also similar to the opinion surveys in that they address many of the same issues, such as safety, sources of energy information, or trust. There are many differences between the surveys reviewed in this compendium and the DOE surveys. The information for many of the surveys is collected face-to-face or electronically; however, all of the DOE surveys are conducted via telephone interviews. Most of the surveys concentrated on a specific population group, while the DOE surveys addressed five different populations (general public, students, government agencies, end users, and safety and codes officials). No survey (except the DOE survey) conducted since 2003 surveyed students knowledge and opinions of hydrogen and fuel cells. Although several surveys have solicited opinions of users (e. g., passengers of fuel-cell vehicles), no surveys were conducted of end users (industrial users needing large power supplies, commercial users needing uninterrupted power, or transportation businesses). While the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has surveyed its membership concerning standards, the population of safety and codes officials has not been surveyed. The greatest impact and importance of the DOE surveys is that five distinct population groups are surveyed for both knowledge and opinions on hydrogen and fuel cells. Knowledge levels can be computed for each population group and can be compared across the populations and across time. Opinions can be compared with knowledge levels. A baseline of knowledge levels was derived using the results of the 2004 surveys; this baseline will be compared with the results of the knowledge evaluation for the surveys of 2008 / 2009 and 2011 / 2012. The DOE knowledge and opinion surveys are unique in coverage and purpose. It must be noted, however, that response rates for telephone surveys have decreased dramatically over time. Developments in survey methodology research will have to be followed {{over the next few years}} so that necessary adjustments are made in the 20112012 DOE hydrogen survey design, to account for cell-phone-only individuals as well as other changes in telephone usage demographics...|$|R
