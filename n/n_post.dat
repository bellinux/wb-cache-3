40|$|Biochemical {{markers of}} bone {{resorption}} {{can be used}} clinically to predict the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures (prognostic tool) and to assess the response of an osteoporotic patient to an antiresorptive therapy (monitoring tool). Our aim {{was to assess the}} ability of four currently marketed biochemical markers of bone resorption, based on the measurement of degradation products from collage type I telopeptides to monitor the elevated resorption associated with menopause. Women (846) were stratified for menopause, age, and bone mineral density and the following markers were measured: urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx), the levels of breakdown products of type I collagen C-telopeptides in serum (S-CTx), and in urine, by ELISA (U-CTx-E), and RIA (U-CTx-R). Furthermore, the ratio (a/b) between the aL form of CTx measured in the CTx RIA and the bL form measured in the ELISA was calculated. The mean difference was calculated for each marker in women with osteopenia (Op) or osteoporosis (PMO) (WHO definition) compared with healthy premenopausal (Pre) women and postmenopausal (<b>N</b> <b>Post)</b> women with normal bone mass. Serum CTx showed the highest elevation in post- compared with premenopausal women. All marker values were significantly higher in Op and PMO subjects compared with both Pre and to <b>N</b> <b>Post</b> women. Compared with premenopausal values, the largest elevation in both Op and PMO women was observed for serum CTx. Compared with <b>N</b> <b>Post,</b> urine NTx showed the highest increase in OP subjects. The a/b CTx ratio was elevated in post- compared with Pre women, but {{there was no difference in}} the ratio among <b>N</b> <b>Post,</b> Op, or PMO women. In conclusion, postmenopausal women showed elevated turnover with all bone resorption markers, but with substantial individual variation in resorption levels. Furthermore, the turnover process in postmenopausal women appears to be quantitatively different from the premenopausal stage, apparent as altered a/b CTx ratios. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Astaxanthin (ATX) is a dietary {{carotenoid}} of crustaceans {{and fish}} {{that contributes to}} their coloration. Dietary ATX is important for development and survival of salmonids and crustaceans and {{has been shown to}} reduce cardiac ischemic injury in rodents. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether ATX can protect against ischemic injury in the mammalian brain. Adult rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with ATX or vehicle prior to a 60 -min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). ATX was present in the infarction area at 70 - 75 min after onset of MCAo. Treatment with ATX, compared to vehicle, increased locomotor activity in stroke rats and reduced cerebral infarction at 2 d after MCAo. To evaluate the protective mechanisms of ATX against stroke, brain tissues were assayed for free radical damage, apoptosis, and excitoxicity. ATX antagonized ischemia-mediated loss of aconitase activity and reduced glutamate release, lipid peroxidation, translocation of cytochrome c, and TUNEL labeling in the ischemic cortex. ATX did not alter physiological parameters, such as body temperature, brain temperature, cerebral blood flow, blood gases, blood pressure, and pH. Collectively, our data suggest that ATX can reduce ischemia-related injury in brain tissue through the inhibition of oxidative stress, reduction of glutamate release, and antiapoptosis. ATX may be clinically useful for patients vulnerable or prone to ischemic events. —Shen, H., Kuo, C. -C., Chou, J., Delvolve, A., Jackson, S. <b>N.,</b> <b>Post,</b> J., Woods, A. S., Hoffer, B.

Department of Biology of Physical Activity. Science of Sports Coaching and Fitness Testing. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine physiological consequences on 8 -day strenuous military field exercise. 26 men (20 ± 1 yrs, 53, 7 ± 4, 5 ml/kg/min, 178, 4 ± 7, 2 cm, 71, 2 ± 7, 2 kg) in the end of their military service participated in the study. The research data was collected in five testing day (pre 1, pre 2, middle, post and follow-up); body composition, physical performance and basal blood levels were measured. The changes in body composition were calculated with the information from total body water measurements with deuterium dilution techique. Serum hormones analysed from the basal blood were total testosterone and cortisol and carrier protein SHBG. Bilateral isometric leg and arm extension force were used to describe physical performance. RESULTS: Total body mass decreased by 1. 8 ± 1 kg (p< 0. 001) during the 8 -day field exercise. Fat mass absolute decrease was 2. 0 ± 1 kg (p< 0. 001) and a relative change was - 18. 7 ± 13 %. The absolute change in total fat percentage was - 2. 4 ± 2 % (p< 0. 001). Maximum voluntary contraction decreased during the field exercise in bench press and regained in the end of the field exercise; 761 ± 131 N (pre 1); 758 ± 127 N (pre 2); 676 ± 137 N (middle, p< 0. 001); 727 ± 117 <b>N</b> (<b>post,</b> p< 0. 05) measurements. Relative change between pre 2 and middle measurements is 11 %. Maximum voluntary contraction decreased in leg press also and regained in the end of field exercise; 2560 ± 512 N (pre 1); 2592 ± 520 N (pre 2); 2401 ± 584 N (middle, p< 0. 01); 2499 ± 541 <b>N</b> (<b>post,</b> p< 0. 01). Relative change in maximum voluntary contraction between pre 2 and middle measurements is 7 %. Significances compared to pre 2 measurement. Maximal rate of force development in the bench press was 24492 ± 12919 N/s (pre 1); 22865 ± 13253 N/s (pre 2); 15564 ± 7397 N/s (middle, p< 0. 01); 15942 ± 7276 N/s (post p< 0. 01). Maximal rate of force development in the leg press was 28767 ± 8570 N/s (pre 1); 25119 ± 8945 N/s (pre 2); 16684 ± 7404 N/s (middle, p< 0. 001); 16720 ± 7362 N/s (post p< 0. 001). Significances compared to pre 2 measurement. The changes in physical performance did not relate with the energy balance. Plasma serum cortisol (from 498 to 648 nmol/L) and SHBG (from 37. 1 to 41. 3 nmol/L) concentrations increased significantly (p< 0. 001) and serum total testosterone (from 21. 1 to 14. 9 nmol/L) decreased significantly (p< 0. 001) in the middle measurements compared to pre 2 measurements. In the post measurements the cortisol was normalized on the pre 2 levels. Testosterone regained slightly from middle to post measurement (p< 0. 001) but it still differed significantly from pre 2 measurement. The SHBG concentration increased more after the middle measurement, post and follow measurement levels differed significantly compared to middle measurement (p< 0. 001). In testo/cortisol-ratio there was a significant decrement in the middle measurement compared to pre 2 measurement (p< 0. 001). Testo/SHBG-ratio decreased significantly in middle and post measurements compared to pre 2 measurement (both p< 0. 001). IN CONCLUSION: High physical loading and sleep deprivation or lack of rest was enough strenuous to affect the physical performance during the field exercise. Maintenance in muscular strength may be facilitated by the energy balance and adequate sleep...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{quantitative}} evaluation of the myotatic reflex in a group of 26 patients affected by stationary spastic paresis (6 : hemiparesis; 5 : paraparesis; 8 : tetraparesis; 7 : multiple sclerosis) before and after a treatment of hydro-kinesy therapy. The treatment was carried out in an indoor pool containing warm (32 degrees C) sea water and consisted of active and passive motion exercises, coordination exercises and immersion walking. The measured parameters were: (i) the peak input force (F-pH) measured by means of an instrumented hammer with which the patellar tendon was hit; and (ii) the peak value of the corresponding reflex force of the quadriceps femoris (F-pQ) measured by means of a load cell connected to the subject's ankle. The peak values of the reflex response (F-pQ) were found to increase {{as a function of the}} intensity of the imposed stimulus and to reach a plateau between 15 and 30 N of F-pH, A Student's t test applied to the paired values of F-pQ (as measured at plateau conditions) on both the lower limbs, before and after therapy, showed no significant changes due to the treatment in the four groups of subjects. However, if all subjects were grouped regardless the type of illness: 1) the average reflex response of the affected limb (the one characterized before therapy by the higher F-pQ values) was found to decrease following the treatment (75. 1 +/- 26. 7 N pre therapy and 69. 1 +/- 29. 3 <b>N</b> <b>post</b> therapy, p = 0. 07, n = 26); and 2) the effect of the treatment was found to be significantly larger (p = 0. 04, n = 26) on the affected limb (Delta F-pQ = 6. 07 +/- 16. 5 N) as respect with the contra lateral one (Delta F-pQ = - 0. 16 +/- 12. 1 N).

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] local anaesthetics such as lidocaine are administered by the hypodermic parenteral route but it causes pain or anxiety to patients. Alternatively, an ointment formulation may be applied which involves a slow drug diffusion process. In addressing these two issues, this paper aims to understand {{the significance of the}} ‘poke and patch’ microneedle (MN) treatment on skin in conjunction to the lidocaine permeation, and in particular, the vertical (depth averaged) and horizontal (e. g. lateral) permeation profiles of the drug in the skin. The instantaneous pharmacokinetics of lidocaine in skin was determined by a skin denaturation technique coupled with Franz diffusion cell measurements of the drug pharmacokinetics. All pharmacokinetic profiles were performed periodically on porcine skin. Three MN insertion forces of 3. 9, 7. 9 and 15. 7 N were applied on the MN to pierce the skin. For the smaller force (3. 9 <b>N),</b> <b>post</b> MN-treated skin seems to provide an ‘optimum’ percutaneous delivery rate. A 10. 2 -fold increase in lidocaine permeation was observed for a MN insertion force of 3. 9 N at 0. 25 h and similarly, a 5. 4 -fold increase in permeation occurred at 0. 5 h compared to passive diffusional delivery. It is shown that lidocaine permeates horizontally beyond the area of the MN-treated skin for the smaller MN insertion forces, namely, 3. 9 and 7. 9 N from 0. 25 to 0. 75 h, respectively. The lateral diffusion/permeation of lidocaine for larger MN-treated force (namely, 15. 7 N in this work) seems to be insignificant at all recorded timings. The MN insertion force of 15. 7 N resulted in lidocaine concentrations slightly greater than control (passive diffusion) but significantly less than 3. 9 and 7. 9 N impact force treatments on skin. We believe this likelihood is due to the skin compression effect that inhibits diffusion until the skin had time to relax at which point lidocaine levels increase...|$|E
40|$|Multilayer hard {{coatings}} containing Ti, TiN#delta#, TiC_xN_y, (TiC_m) a-C:H, (TiC_n) a-C:H, and (Ti) a-C:H were deposited on commercially pure titanium substrates {{by using an}} asymmetric bipolar pulsed-dc reactive magnetron sputtering of a titanium target, with Ar, Ar+N_ 2, Ar+N_ 2 +CH_ 4, and Ar+CH_ 4 gas mixtures. The microstructures, elemental compositions and bonding states of the interlayers and the coating surfaces were studied by using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The microstructure development of the multilayer coating was strongly influenced by target poisoning. As {{a result of the}} complete poisoning of the titanium target during the deposition of TiN#delta# and TiC_xN_y interlayers, the a-C:H interlayers containing graded titanium and nitrogen contents were found to develop successively to the TiC_xN_y interlayer without the formation of near-stoichiometric TiC. The (TiC_m) a-C:H interlayer consisted of nano-particles of distorted fcc crystal structure embedded in the a-C:H matrix. The (TiC_n) a-C:H and (Ti) a-C:H top layers were found to be a-C:H matrix without nano-particles. In the (Ti) a-C:H top layer there was no measurable amount of Ti observed, regardless of the variation of CH_ 4 concentration between 37. 5 and 60 % flow rate in Ar+-CH 4 gas mixture. The top layer (Ti) a-C:H was found to contain approximately 10 atomic % nitrogen, due to N_ 2 contamination during deposition caused by low conductance of N_ 2 through the nominally closed valve of the mass flow controller. The change of the CH_ 4 concentration during deposition of the top layer (Ti) a-C:H, however, showed a strong influence on the hydrogen content. The comparison of the fluorescence background of the Raman spectra revealed that hydrogen-less (Ti) a-C:H was deposited at a CH_ 4 concentration of less than 50 % flow rate in Ar. The hardness and adhesion of the multilayer coated titanium substrates were assessed by using microindentation hardness and scratch tests, respectively. A simple hardness model containing parameters that assess the contributions from the coating and the substrate to the measured hardness was developed to describe hardness variation as a function of indentation size. This model allowed the determination of a coating hardness and an effective substrate hardness under interfacial constraint. The critical load of failure in the scratch test obtained for multilayer coated titanium substrates was in the range of 10 to 20 <b>N.</b> <b>Post</b> examination of the scratches showed that the interfacial region TiN#delta#/TiC_xN_y/(TiC_m) a-C:H was prone to delamination, in response to the scratch test. Complete de-bonding of this interfacial region was observed in the multilayer coating where a sharp interface between the TiC_xN_y interlayers of two different microstructures was present.
