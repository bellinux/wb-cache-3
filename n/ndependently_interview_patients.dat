40|$|Background: Cancer is {{the third}} {{cause of death in}} Iran. Approximately 5 - 10 % of all human cancers are thought to be caused by {{occupational}} exposure to carcinogens. Dif-fuse mesotheliomas of the peritoneum and pleura are considered "signal tumors," or pa-thognomonic of exposure to asbestos. There is also evidence that nonasbestos agents can induce malignant mesotheliomas. So, we need to study the history of exposure to asbestos in patients suffering from mesothelima to determine relationship between them in Iran, especially in occupational settings. Methods: We received the data of 272 mesothelioma's patients having been registered in 1385 to 1389 in Cancer Bureau, in Ministry of Health. One hundred fifty four of them had telephone number. Finally we could interview with 60 families and gathered data of patient's history of occupation, cigarette smoking and residence place interred in the designed questionnaire. Then we brought out the variants of age, sex, the province of birth place and the involved organs from the data of Cancer Bureau. Analysis of frequency of variants was carried out and compared once in 272 patients being registered in Cancer Bureau and then in the <b>interviewed</b> 60 <b>patients.</b> Results: Distribution of age, sex, the province of birth and living place and the involved organ were similar in cancer registry's data and the <b>interviewed</b> <b>patients.</b> Distribution of cigarette smoking and exposure to asbestos in the <b>interviewed</b> <b>patients</b> were 28 % and 63 % respectively. Occupational distribution of <b>interviewed</b> <b>patients</b> consisted of con-struction workers 20 %, oil company employees 13. 3 %, administrative staff 8. 3 % and drivers 6. 7 %. Conclusion: The results of our study specified the jobs with high risks of exposure to asbestos and approved the relationship between the exposure to asbestos and the inci-dence of mesothelioma in Iran, according to researches in other countries. So the con-sumption of asbestos in Iran, like 20 other countries in the world is necessary to be banned...|$|R

30|$|This study {{provides}} a considerable volume of rich data directly elicited from patients with diversity in HNSCC locations and other clinical characteristics, {{and uses the}} input of several sources to yield a conceptual model. The study findings are therefore generalisable to patients with a similar presentation to the inclusion criteria presented in Table 1, i.e. those with a diagnosis of recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC who have received treatment in the preceding 12  months. However, some {{limitations of this study}} are to be acknowledged. The majority of the <b>interviewed</b> <b>patients</b> were male and all were Caucasian; hence, differences in experience are only present according to these characteristics. The fact that the majority of <b>interviewed</b> <b>patients</b> had received higher education is another limitation in light of assessing item understanding; a greater number of patients who had received lower education would increase confidence in the generalisability of these findings. In addition, there was limited opportunity to understand the impacts and side effects associated with immunotherapy; only two patients had received this (as part of a clinical trial) and did not attribute any specific side effects to this treatment type.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Guidelines on {{apology and}} {{disclosure}} after adverse events and errors {{have been in}} place for over 5 years. This study examines whether patients consider recommended responses to be appropriate and desirable, and whether clinicians 2 ̆ 7 actions after adverse events are consistent with recommendations. METHODS: Patients who believed that something had gone wrong during their cancer care were identified. During in-depth <b>interviews,</b> <b>patients</b> described the event, clinicians 2 ̆ 7 responses, and their reactions. RESULTS: 78 <b>patients</b> were <b>interviewed.</b> <b>Patients</b> 2 ̆ 7 valued apology and expressions of remorse, empathy and caring, explanation, acknowledgement of responsibility, and efforts to prevent recurrences, but these key elements were often missing. For many patients, actions and evidence of clinician learning were most important. CONCLUSION: Patients 2 ̆ 7 reports of apology and disclosure when they believe something has gone wrong in their care suggest that clinicians 2 ̆ 7 responses continue to fall short of expectations. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians preparing to talk with patients after an adverse event or medical error should be aware that patients expect their actions to be congruent with their words of apology and caring. Healthcare systems need to support clinicians throughout the disclosure process, and facilitate both system and individual learning to prevent recurrences...|$|R
