40|$|This {{research}} analyzes {{whether the}} sole proprietorship policy can support <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> monitoring andhow this policy is {{implemented in the}} banking globalization, legal protection for <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> and concept of <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> development in globalization era {{in relation to the}} objectives of welfare state. The research uses normative juridical method with descriptive analysis. The findings are: first, the sole proprietorship policy does not apply to under 25 % shareholding of a bank or share acquisitions in several banks. Second, the nature of sole proprietorship policy is futuristic, so it can reduce the discretion for <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> shareholding by foreign/global investors. Third, legal protections for <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> towards domination of <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> shareholding have been ineffective because the sole proprietorship policy only incorporates the same proprietorship of several banks. Fourth, in globalization era, the concept of <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> regulation independency for capital is adjusted to the business segment of each bank. In addition, an integrative monitoring should be applied to <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> activities, particularly to foreign parties who hold shares in several <b>national</b> <b>banks</b> without highly influenced by global banking regulation recommendation...|$|R
50|$|The {{granting}} of charters {{led to the}} creation of many <b>national</b> <b>banks</b> and a <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> system which grew at a fast pace. The number of <b>national</b> <b>banks</b> rose from 66 immediately after the Act to 7473 in 1913. Initially, this rise in <b>national</b> <b>banking</b> came at the expense of state banking—the number of state banks dwindled from 1466 in 1863 to 247 in 1868. Though state banks were no longer allowed to issue notes, local bankers took advantage of less strict capital requirements ($10,000 for state banks vs. $50,000-200,000 for <b>national</b> <b>banks)</b> and opened new branches en masse. These new state banks then served as competition for <b>national</b> <b>banks,</b> growing to 15,526 in number by 1913.|$|R

It then argues that, for the most part, the differences were not due to subtle differences in the banking legislation in the two countries. Rather, it argues that the differences were due to Japan’s lesser degree of experience with banks and less developed banking institutions when the system was adopted.

The McFadden Act specifically prohibited interstate branching by allowing <b>national</b> <b>banks</b> to branch only within the state in which they were situated.
