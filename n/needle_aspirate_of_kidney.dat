40|$|Fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> 5 primary {{hepatocellular}} carcinomas and 24 carcinomas metastatic to {{the liver}} were studied using vimentin and endothelial cell-specific monoclonal antibodies. Numerous endothelial cells dispersed and in bundles overlying clumps of tumor cells were positively stained by both antibodies in smears of primary hepatocellular carcinomas while such cells were rare or absent in metastatic carcinomas, {{with the exception}} of clear cell carcinoma <b>of</b> the <b>kidney.</b> It is concluded that endothelial cells, if present in large numbers in fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> a hepatic carcinoma and arranged in bundles that envelope the clumps of tumor cells, can (1) suggest the presence of a primary hepatocarcinoma and (2) narrow the differential diagnosis with the most common metastatic cancers to renal cell carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Apocrine {{metaplastic}} {{cells are}} frequently encountered in fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> breast lesions. Atypical apocrine metaplastic cells with signet ring features can also occur, and their presence may present a diagnostic dilemma in the differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions. CASE: A fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirate</b> <b>of</b> a 2. 551. 0 -cm, subareolar mass in a 47 -year-old female showed atypical cells with signet ring morphology. Also present were clusters of cells that were enlarged and showed nuclear atypia, prominent nucleoli and cytoplasmic granules. Papillary cohesive clusters of ductal cells were also identified. The fine needle aspiration diagnosis was mucinous carcinoma. The nodule was excised, and the histologic diagnosis was sclerosing ductal papilloma with atypical apocrine metaplasia. CONCLUSION: Atypical apocrine cells can be misinterpreted as mucinous carcinoma or usual duct adenocarcinoma on fine needle aspiration cytology. We present clues {{that may help}} in rendering the correct interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{analysis}} of single cells obtained from <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> tumors is {{constrained by the}} need for processing. To this end, we investigated two microflu-idic approaches to measure the expression of surface proteins in single cancer cells or in small populations (< 50 cells). Methods: One approach involved indirect fluorescence labeling of cell-surface proteins and channeling of cells in a microfluidic device past a fluorescence detector for signal quantification and analysis. A second approach channeled cells in a microfluidic device over detection zones coated with ligands to surface proteins and mea-sured rates of passage and of retardation based on transient interactions between surface proteins and ligands...|$|R

The first case had been diagnosed initially as a carcinoma, and the patient underwent bilateral mastectomy. Acute leukemia was only revealed by histology of the surgical specimen. In the second case a second neoplasia, occurring during acute leukemia, was suspected: a fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirate</b> <b>of</b> the breast mass showed a leukemic infiltrate. Involvement of breast during acute myeloid leukemia is a rare event and, in our experience, of bad prognostic significance.

40|$|Alcohol-fixed fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> 82 non-Hodgkin's {{malignant}} lymphomas (NHLs) {{were tested}} {{for the presence of}} vimentin and leukocyte-common antigen (LCA) by means of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and indirect immunofluorescence. All NHLs stained positively for vimentin; the staining was strong in all except three cases. Of the 69 NHLs tested for LCA, 1 (a large cell T-cell lymphoma) was negative while the staining was weak in 6. Thus, vimentin and LCA MAbs are sensitive, specific and reliable complementary diagnostic adjuncts that are useful in the definitive diagnosis of NHLs in alcohol-fixed fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates.</b> Their presence in the aspirate confirmed a cytologic diagnosis of NHL in 47 cases, helped to diagnose NHL in 31 cases in which a cytologic differential diagnosis with small cell anaplastic carcinoma could not be made with confidence and helped to change the initial cytologic diagnosis of anaplastic carcinoma to NHL in 4 cases...|$|R
40|$|A {{scoring system}} for the {{assessment}} <b>of</b> fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> benign and malignant breast lesions was devised which showed a positive correlation (r = 0. 67) between the scores obtained from the fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> from ductal carcinomas and the Bloom and Richardson-type scores for their paired excision biopsy specimens. This system permitted grades II and III ductal breast carcinoma to be distinguished reliably from grade I tumours but no correlation with the lymph node state of patients with breast carcinoma was shown.

After 2 weeks, the snake presented again because of continued anorexia and poor quality of life. Euthanasia was performed. Gross necropsy revealed a multilobulated mass attached to and effacing the splenopancreas. Histologically, the mass was composed of cuboidal to columnar neoplastic epithelial cells forming tubules surrounded by variable amounts of fibrovascular stroma. Histological examination and immunohistochemical staining of other tissues revealed local invasion in the subserosa and tunica muscularis of the stomach, metastasis within the liver, in the mesovarium, and an intravascular metastasis within the ventricle of the heart surrounded by a thrombus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An 11 -year-old, Black and Tan Coonhound dog was {{presented}} {{with a history of}} lameness of the right hind leg for 2 months, osteolysis in the right distal femur, a pulmonary mass, and a presumptive diagnosis of osteosarcoma. By cytologic examination, neoplastic melanocytes were noted from fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> the femoral and pulmonary masses. Postmortem examination revealed a disseminated melanoma involving the right femoral bone marrow, lung, multiple lymph nodes, and adrenal gland, with diffuse infiltration of the leptomeninges of the brain and spinal cord. This case report describes a unique presentation of canine melanoma, which in some ways resembles leptomeningeal melanomatosis, a rare human melanoma variant. Key words: Bone marrow metastasis; dogs; leptomeningeal melanomatosis; melanoma. Melanomas account for 7 % of all malignant canine tumors. 15 Most canine melanomas involve the oral cavity, mucocutaneous junctions, nailbed, and eye.

40|$|Ranula {{refers to}} a {{collection}} of extra-glandular and extra ductal saliva in {{the floor of the}} mouth originating from the sublingual salivary gland. It may rarely originate from injury to the submandibular gland (SMG) duct. It is a pseudocyst, as it does not contain an epithelial lining. It classically presents as a soft submucosal swelling in the floor of the mouth. A plunging ranula extends into the submandibular triangle of the neck through a defect in the mylohyoid muscle, or less commonly, by passing behind the posterior edge of the muscle. A ranula may also track posteriorly along tissue planes into the parapharyngeal space. The simplest way to clinch the diagnosis is by examining a <b>needle</b> <b>aspirate</b> <b>of</b> the typically thick, straw coloured saliva. However, the diagnosis can be easily missed if the patient does not have any introral lesion. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present clinical and radiographic findings of a rare case of plunging ranula without any intraoral lesion along with the relevant review of the literature...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cytological nuclear grading {{is one of}} {{the several}} key {{prognostic}} factors that should be addressed in cytological analysis of breast carcinomas. Aims: To evaluate different cytological nuclear grading methods on fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> breast carcinomas and its correlation with histopathological nuclear grading {{as well as with the}} immunocytochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and Methods: The smears from 30 cytologically proven cases of breast carcinoma were graded by - Nottingham&#x 2032;s modification of Scarff Bloom Richardson, Fisher&#x 2032;s modification of Black&#x 2032;s nuclear grading and Robinson&#x 2032;s cytological grading methods. 18 cases were available for correlation with histology grading.

40|$|Filariasis is a {{major public}} health problem in {{developing}} countries, and the diagnosis is conventionally made by demonstrating microfilariae in the peripheral blood smear. However, microfilariae have been incidentally detected in fine <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> various lesions in clinically unsuspected cases of filariasis with absence of microfilariae in the peripheral blood. Cases: In case 1, a 21 -year-old woman presented with multiple left axillary lymphadenopathy of 3 months 9 ̆ 2 duration. In case 2, a 32 -year-old woman presented with a thyroid nodule of 7 months 9 ̆ 2 duration. Fine needle aspiration smears from both cases showed sheathed microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti. In both cases, microfilariae could not be demonstrated in the peripheral blood smears and the blood eosinophil counts were within normal limits. The histopathologic examination showed neither microfilariae nor adult worm. Conclusion: Although microfilariae in cytologic material are considered incidental findings, these cases illustrate the value of routine fine needle aspiration cytology in the detection of asymptomatic and clinically unsuspected cases of bancroftian filariasis. Absence of microfilariae in the peripheral blood does not exclude filarial infectio...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the National Breast Screening Programme has created a demand for the widespread availability of fine needle aspiration cytology services.

Initial trials with this system have been encouraging and it is envisaged that this system will be of value both in training and as an aid to routine diagnosis...|$|R
5000|$|One way to {{diagnose}} C. felis is by taking blood and performing a peripheral blood smear {{to look for}} the erythrocytic piroplasms. [...] The erythrocytic piroplasms are usually shaped like signet rings and are 1 to 1.5 µm. [...] Not all cats that are infected will have the piroplasms on their blood smear, especially if they are early in disease course. Another method of diagnosing infection in sick cats is to take <b>needle</b> <b>aspirates</b> <b>of</b> affected organs and find the schizonts inside mononuclear cells in the tissues; examination of tissue is also useful for the diagnosis after cats have died. Blood samples can be sent away for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to confirm infection. Other diseases that might resemble cytauxzoonosis should be ruled out. A major rule-out for C. felis is Mycoplasma haemofelis (formerly known as Haemobartonella felis); clinical signs can be similar to cytuaxzoonosis and the organism may be confused on the peripheral smear. [...] Because it causes similar signs in outdoor cats during the spring and summer, tularemia is another disease the veterinarian may want to rule out.|$|R
