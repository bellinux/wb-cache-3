40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{articulate}} an approach for discursive research on welfare cultures of ageing that responds to the challenges facing contemporary research on old age and ageism. It is based on the assumption that to understand conditions under which people are ageing in different countries, various societal levels and actors need to be examined and their roles in setting the old age agenda need to be accounted for. Additionally this paper reflects upon the welfare spaces of ageing in Poland, spaces where people in Poland grow old and/or are allowed to do so. As a result, this paper indicates the lack of spaces of ageing in the welfare context in Poland. People are expected not to grow old; old age remains a misunderstood phenomenon. Contrary to the excessive knowledge against old age, there is considerable lack of knowledge/br old age. Therefore, spaces of <b>non-ageing</b> are invoked in order to elaborate on these processes. Spaces of <b>non-ageing</b> identify various societal domains and show what needs to be done in order not to grow old. Spaces of <b>non-ageing</b> repudiate the idea of old age as something terrifying and, on many occasions, immoral...|$|E

It has not been tested whether other <b>non-age</b> variables influence care decisions made by allied health professionals. This paper explores demographic and stroke-related variables that are putatively associated {{with the quality of}} care provided to acute stroke patients by allied health professionals. Methods: Data were retrospectively audited from 300 acute stroke patient records regarding allied health care. Compliance with each of 20 indicators of allied health care quality was established. The influence of various demographic and stroke-related variables on each performance indicator was examined. We undertook a series of analyses using univariate logistic regression models to establish the influence of these variables on care quality. Results: Patient age had a significant correlation with only one process indicator (early mobilization). Seven variables, including stroke severity and level of dependence, were associated with patient age. The majority of these age proxies had significant associations with process indicator compliance. Correlations between <b>non-age</b> variables, in particular stroke severity and comorbidity, suggest the potential for complex confounding relationships between <b>non-age</b> variables and quality of allied health care. Conclusion: Compliance with individual indicators of allied health care was significantly associated with variables other than patient age, and included stroke severity, previous independence, comorbidities, day of admission, stroke unit admission, and length of stay. The inter-relationships between these <b>non-age</b> variables suggest that their influence on quality of care is complex.

40|$|According to the {{antagonistic}} pleiotropy {{theory of}} ageing, natural selection has favoured genes conferring short-term {{benefits to the}} organism {{at the cost of}} deterioration in later life. The 'disposable soma' theory expresses this as a life-history strategy in which somatic maintenance is below the level required to prevent ageing, thus enabling higher immediate fertility. It has been argued that a <b>non-ageing</b> strategy will always be bettered by a low but non-zero rate of ageing, because the costs of such ageing will be felt only in the distant future when they are of negligible importance. Here, we examine this argument critically. We find that a <b>non-ageing</b> strategy will be locally optimal if, in the presence of ageing, the onset of deterioration is sufficiently rapid or early. Conversely, ageing will be optimal if deterioration is sufficiently slow or late. As the temporal profile of ageing changes from one of steady deterioration to one involving a sudden loss of vitality after a period of little or no decline, the conditions for a <b>non-ageing</b> strategy to be locally optimal become progressively more stringent. But for all forms of profile considered, conditions can be found for which a strategy involving no ageing is locally optimal...|$|E

Secondly, it appears necessary to study the effect of nanomaterials and nanoparticles throughout their life cycle including both initial forms and physico-chemically modified form (i. e. aggregated or agglomerated forms) resulting from an ageing process.

Both ageing and <b>non-ageing</b> nCeO 2 suspensions were fully characterized using dynamic light scattering (ZetaSizer, Malvern Instruments) or laser diffraction (MasterSizer, Malvern Instruments) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the interaction between NPs and algae were investigated using flow-cytometry and environmental scanning electron microscope technique (E-SEM). The results obtained showed that the algae growth inhibition was similar after exposure to <b>non-ageing</b> or ageing nCeO 2 suspensions. The results obtained from flow-cytometry and E-SEM proved that the ceria NPs are able to tightly entrap the algae cells, which could in part contribute to the effect recorded.

Moreover by comparison to our previous studies performed with other ceria suspensions, it was shown that the primary particle size and consequently the particle surface area is a relevant parameter in assessing the ecotoxicity of nanoparticles...|$|E

Both age- 1 mutants and wild-type controls display a linear loss of movement as the nematodes age. age- 1 mutant strains moved faster early in life when compared with <b>non-Age</b> strains and continued low rates of movement at older ages than did <b>non-Age</b> strains. Movement rates were not, in general, a good predictor of movement rates at any later age or of life span.
