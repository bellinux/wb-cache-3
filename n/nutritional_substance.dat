The whole process is biochemically sound and mediated by microbial metabolic activities that produce heat, water, CO 2 {{and results in}} mineralization, transformation, and humification (Shilev et al. 2007). The technology is cheaper and sustainable {{in terms of its}} requirements for ingredients, manpower, energy, water, time, resource integration, and reproducibility.

After production of good-quality compost using windrows, biofortification of the raw product can be done with the use of beneficial microbial inoculants (plant growth-promoting bacteria, mycorrhiza, and biocontrol fungi) (Muttalib et al. 2016). Enrichment of raw compost material with organic inputs like humic acid, amino acids, phytohormones, mineral nutrients (zinc, iron, boron), phytonutrients, botanicals and vermicompost can further add value to the products that can help in organic farming (Mohler and Johnson 2009).|$|E

40|$|Gene-environment {{interaction}} {{is behind the}} pathogenesis of most widespread diseases, and nutrition is among the environmental factors with the highest impact on human health. The mechanisms involved in the interaction between nutritional factors and the genetic background of individuals are still unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether resveratrol (RES), an antioxidant polyphenol of red wine, can influence the activity of PPARalpha in the rat hepatoma cell line McArdle-RH 7777. PPARalpha is a transcriptional factor that regulates gene expression when activated by endogenous or exogenous long-chain fatty acids. Its activation results in significant protection from cardiovascular diseases in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: By means of the electromobility shift assay (EMSA), we observed that PPARalpha is redox-sensitive as it displays reduced DNA-binding activity following in vivo treatment of the cells with 1 mmol/L diethylmaleate (DEM), a glutathione-depleting agent. This finding could be relevant considering the important role of redox balance in pathological and physiological processes. We also observed a dual effect of 100 mumol/L RES on PPARalpha activity: it was able to prevent, to a large extent, the DEM-induced reduction of DNA-binding activity at earlier time points, when the effect of DEM was stronger, but it depressed PPARalpha activity at later time points, when the effect of DEM was greatly reduced. CONCLUSION: A <b>nutritional</b> <b>substance,</b> such as RES, is able to influence the activity of gene-regulating factors, but the net effect is difficult to predict when the compound involved has multiple biological properties. Caution is therefore warranted before drawing conclusions about the potential benefits of RES for human health...|$|E

Glucose is an essential <b>nutritional</b> <b>substance</b> for brain function sustenance, which cannot be synthesized by the brain. Its transport primarily depends on the glucose transporters on the brain capillary endothelial cells. In this paper, the brain-targeted properties of glucose-modified liposomes using polyethylene glycols with different chain lengths as the linkers were compared and evaluated to establish an optimized drug-delivery system. Methods: Coumarin 6 -loaded liposomes (GLU 200 -LIP, GLU 400 -LIP, GLU 1000 -LIP, and GLU 2000 -LIP) composed of phospholipids and glucose-derived cholesterols were prepared by thin-film dispersion-ultrasound method. The BBB model in vitro was developed to evaluate the transendothelial ability of the different liposomes crossing the BBB. The biodistribution of liposomes in the mice brains was identified by in vivo and ex vivo nearinfrared fluorescence imaging and confocal laser scanning microscopy and further analyzed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Glucose-derived cholesterols were synthesized and identified, and coumarin 6 -loaded liposomes were prepared successfully. The particle sizes of the four types of glucose-modified liposomes were around or smaller than 100 nm with a polydispersity index less than 0. 300. GLU 400 -LIP, GLU 1000 -LIP, and GLU 2000 -LIP achieved higher cumulative cleared volumes on BBB model in vitro after 6 hours compared with GLU 200 -LIP (P &lt; 0. 05) and were significantly higher than that of the conventional liposome (P &lt; 0. 001). The qualitative and quantitative biodistribution results in the mice showed that the accumulation of GLU 1000 -LIP in the brain was the highest among all the groups (P &lt; 0. 01 versus LIP). Conclusion: The data indicated that GLU 400 -LIP, GLU 1000 -LIP, and GLU 2000 -LIP all possess the potential of brain targeting, among which GLU 1000 -LIP, as a promising drug-delivery system, exhibited the strongest brain delivery capacity.
