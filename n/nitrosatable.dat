The test found 0.781 mg/kg, while the German Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung (BedGgstV) consumer food and product standard provides for a limit of 0.1 mg/kg. Vulli initially said that another regulation applies, the EU guidelines for toys, with a limit of 1 mg/kg, and obtained a preliminary injunction of the District Court in Berlin banning publication of Öko-Tests report. The story {{was removed from the}} magazine's website. This injunction was lifted in January 2012. The Chemische und Veterinäruntersuchungsamt Stuttgart (CVUA) reproduced Öko-Tests claims resulting in the German Technischer Überwachungsverein (TÜV) safety agency pressing charges against Vulli, and Öko-Test restored the online report to their web site. Vulli responded by recalling Sophie the Giraffe and similar products from German retailers, and offering to exchange it with one produced on or after March 2012, which Vulli says adhere to the stricter German limit.|$|E

Experimental data from animal studies suggest that exposure to these compounds might reduce fetal birthweight.

Information was collected by telephone interview on type and frequency of medication use, diet, supplementation, demographic characteristics, and maternal health. Overall, prenatal use of <b>nitrosatable</b> drugs {{was not associated with}} SGA except for a few notable exceptions. Relative to women who reported no <b>nitrosatable</b> drug use anytime during pregnancy, women who took <b>nitrosatable</b> amides during the third trimester of pregnancy {{were more likely to have}} SGA births (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1. 4 [95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0, 2. 1]). This association was stronger among full term SGA births (OR 1. 6 [95 % CI 1. 1, 2. 3]). Dietary nitrites modified the associations between <b>nitrosatable</b> drugs and SGA but lower odds of SGA were observed among women with higher nitrite intake. Higher intake of dietary vitamin C (? 85 mg/day) in combination with daily vitamin C supplementation reduced the associations between SGA and secondary amine use during the second trimester of pregnancy (aOR 1. 0 [95 % CI 0. 65, 1. 6]) compared with < 85 mg of dietary vitamin C and less than daily use of vitamin C supplement (OR 4. 0 [95 % CI 1. 5, 10. 9]).

Previous studies examining prenatal exposure to medications classified as <b>nitrosatable</b> have observed {{an increased risk of}} preterm delivery. Vitamin C is a known nitrosation inhibitor. Using data from mothers (controls) of babies without major birth defects from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, we examined the relation between preterm births and: 1) prenatal <b>nitrosatable</b> drug usage; 2) dietary intake of nitrates/nitrites; 3) joint exposures to <b>nitrosatable</b> drugs and nitrate/nitrite intake; and 4) <b>nitrosatable</b> drugs and vitamin C intake among 496 case-mothers of preterm infants and 5398 control-mothers who delivered full term babies from 1997 - 2005.

This study describes the prevalence and patterns of <b>nitrosatable</b> drug use among U. S. women during early pregnancy and examines maternal factors associated with such use. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and included 6807 mothers who gave birth to babies without major congenital malformations during 1997 to 2005. Information was collected by telephone interview about medication use, demographic factors, and maternal health. Drugs taken during the first trimester were classified according to nitrosatability, amine and amide functional groups, and primary indication of use. RESULTS: Approximately 24 % of the women took one or more <b>nitrosatable</b> drugs during the first trimester, including 12. 4 %, 12. 2 %, and 7. 6 % who respectively took secondary amines, tertiary amines, or amides.

Piperazine isa highly effective and widely used anthelmintic {{agent in the}} management of round worm (Ascaris lumbri-coides) and pin worm (Oxyuris vermicularis) infections (1). Recently, piperazine was found to react with sodium nitrite under in vitro and in vivo conditions to yield N-nitroso (MNP) 1 and N,N'-dinitroso (DNP) derivatives (2 - 6). Both MNP and DNP were carcinogenic to mice and rats (7 - 11). Concurrent oral administration of piperazine and sodium nitrite to mice produced lung adenomas attributable to in vivo nitrosation of the drug (7). The recommended maximum oral dose of piperazine (as its adipate, calcium editate, citrate or tartrate salt) is 3. 5 g/day for 2 days for ascariasis and 2. Sg/day for 8 days for oxyuriasis. Because of this high intake of a readily <b>nitrosatable</b> drug, some investigators have expressed concern regarding its nitrosative toxification in the stomach, especially in the absence of proper attention to dietary intake of nitrite (4, 6, 7).

Tissue ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) levels were enhanced over a 90 -day test period when shikimate was fed alone or in conjunction with BBN and MNNG as initiators and with cyclophosphamide, saccharin and lithocholate as promoters, suggesting that shikimate might be a tumour promoter. Quercetin, was able to enhance ODC levels in conjunction with cyclophosphamide, BBN and MNNG as initiators and with cyclophosphamide, saccharin and lithocholate as promoters. However, it did not enhance tissue ODC levels when administered alone. Bracken, shikimate and quercetin induced a macrocytic, normochromic, non-regenerative anaemia with thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia at the termination of the 90 -day study. The bracken-induced ataxia of monogastrics was attributed additionally to nitrite and cyanide, due to the very high levels found in the urine and serum respectively of bracken-fed rats over a 28 -day test period. The high urinary nitrite levels of the bracken-fed rats prompted {{an investigation into the}} role of N-nitrosation in bracken-induced carcinogenesis.

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{has shown that}} the daily intakes of various N -nitroso-precursor classes in a typical European diet span five orders of magnitude. Amides in the form of protein, and guanidines in the form of creatine and creatinine, are the <b>nitrosatable</b> groups found most abundantly in the diet, approaching Ievels of 100 g/day and 1 gjday, respectively. Approximately 100 mg of primary amines and amino acids are consumed daily, whereas aryl amines, secondary amines and ureas appear to lie in the 1 - 10 mg range. The ease of nitrosation of each precursor was estimated, the reactivities being found to span seven orders of magnitude, with ureas at the top and amines {{at the bottom of the}} scale. From this infonnation and an assessment of the carcinogenicity of the resulting N-nitroso derivatives, the potential health risk due to gastric in vivo nitrosation was calculated. The combined effects of these risk variables were analysed using a simple mathematical model: Risk = [daily intake of precursor] x [gastric concentration of nitrite]^n x [nitrosatability rate constant x [carcinogenicity of derivative]. The risk estimates for the various dietary components spanned nine orders of magnitude. Dietary ureas and aromatic amines combined with a high nitrite burden could pose as great a risk as the intake of preformed dimethylnitrosamine in the diet. In contrast, the risk posed by the in vivo nitrosation of primary and secondary amines is probably negligib 1 y small. The risk contribution by amides (including protein), guanidines and primary amino acids is intermediate between these two extremes. Thus three priorities for future work are a comprehensive study of the sources and Ievels of arylamines and ureas in the diet, determination of the carcinogenic potencies of key nitrosated products to replace the necessarily vague categories used so far, and the development of short-term in situ tests for studying the alkylating power or genotoxicity of N-nitroso compounds too unstable for inclusion in long-term studies...|$|E
