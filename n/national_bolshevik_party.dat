After the Revolution of 1905, Lenin proposed that the <b>Bolshevik</b> <b>Party</b> [...] "open its gates" [...] to the militant working class, who were rapidly becoming political radicals, in order for the Party to become a mass-action political party with genuine roots in the working class movement.|$|R
