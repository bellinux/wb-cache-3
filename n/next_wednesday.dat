The following Saturday, Liverpool put out a weakened side against Fulham ahead of their semi-final first leg with Chelsea and won 2–0, with Jermaine Pennant and Peter Crouch getting on the scoresheet. On 22 April, Liverpool played Chelsea at Anfield in the Champions League semi-final first leg. Liverpool looked to be going into the second leg with a 1–0 advantage through Dirk Kuyt, but {{in the final minute}} of stoppage time John Arne Riise accidentally headed a Salomon Kalou cross into his own net, giving Chelsea a slight advantage through the away goal. The next Saturday, at Birmingham City, Liverpool again put out a weakened side before the 2nd leg with Chelsea. Damien Plessis started again, and Liverpool fought back from 2–0 down to 2–2, with Crouch and Benayoun scoring. That point secured fourth spot for Liverpool.

[...] "I've never felt abandoned by her", Connolly explained in 2009. [...] "My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that's where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy comes along and says, 'I love you. Come with me.' Given the choice, I think I'd have gone with him. It looks as though it might all end <b>next</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> from where you're standing. I don't have an ounce of feelings that she abandoned me. She tried to survive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Production for {{the episode}} started {{after the first}} run of the series' fourth season, which {{consisted}} of four episodes. At {{the beginning of the}} second run of six episodes (which started broadcasting in June 2000), the episode was assigned a production code number of 405 (meaning the 5th episode of the 4th season), and it was planned to air in June or July that year. However, given the complicated nature of the episode's look, where a lot of things had to be designed from scratch, the studio did not have enough time to finish the episode that summer, and it was moved to the next batch of episodes. As it was already in production before the run, [...] "Pip" [...] was a [...] "banked" [...] episode of South Park, one of the first in the series' history. Whereas most episodes of South Park are done within a week, from scratch, the creators sometimes try to have one episode [...] "in the bank" [...] – meaning that they have [...] "at least half-start" [...] animating it. This way they can take off a few days at one point during the two-month-long, demanding run, and then go back and finish work on the banked show. After finishing the previous episode, [...] "Helen Keller! The Musical", which aired on November 22, 2000, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving (November 23), the creators went to spend time with their families for the holiday, and then came back on Sunday, November 26, to finish [...] "Pip". The episode aired the <b>next</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> on November 29, 2000 on Comedy Central in the United States, as the 14th episode of the season, and the fourth episode of the winter run. Since its original airing, it has been re-run infrequently on Comedy Central.|$|E

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} metaphors {{are often used}} interchangeably, and thus, offer a unique way of exploring the relationship between language and thought. Both spatial {{and temporal}} speaking incorporates two systems of motion. The first is an ego-moving system, when the individual moves from one point to another, spatially, or from the past to the future, temporally. The second is the object- (or time-) moving system, when the individual is stationary and observes objects, or time, moving towards him/her. This study explored {{the effect of a}} spatial environment on the ambiguous temporal question: <b>Next</b> <b>Wednesday’s</b> meeting has been moved forward two days [...] What day is the meeting now? Results reveal that when participants are immersed in an ego-moving spatial environment, such as a virtual reality game, and receive a prime that causes them to think in an object-moving way, {{they are more likely to}} perform a target task in a way consistent with the way they have been primed to think, although it contradicts the spatial motion they subsequently experience in the testing environment...|$|R

[...] In the entry, she said she no longer had any confidence in acting in a story that was unconvincing and had been forcibly extended. She also said, [...] "Due to {{the flow of the}} drama, which is becoming increasingly difficult to understand, I cannot force the viewers to accept my insincerity and I am no longer confident in portraying a character that changes at every episode."
