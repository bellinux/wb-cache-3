5|$|A <b>neutron</b> star is {{a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a <b>neutron</b> star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed <b>neutron</b> star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a <b>neutron</b> into a proton, or a proton into a <b>neutron.</b> The <b>neutron</b> to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to <b>neutron</b> transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a <b>neutron.</b>|$|E

500|$|One isotope of cadmium, 113Cd, absorbs <b>neutrons</b> {{with high}} selectivity: [...] With very high probability, <b>neutrons</b> with energy below the cadmium cut-off will be absorbed; those {{higher than the}} cut-off will be transmitted. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5eV, and <b>neutrons</b> below that level are deemed slow <b>neutrons,</b> {{distinct}} from intermediate and fast <b>neutrons.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} way of spotting {{land mines}} through nuclear reactions {{with the help}} of <b>neutrons</b> is that of measuring the thermalization of <b>neutrons.</b> In this technique the soil is irradiated by fast <b>neutrons</b> and the flux of thermal <b>neutrons</b> scattering back is measured. The motivation for this technique is that explosives contain much higher concentrations of hydrogen, which is a very effective moderator of <b>neutrons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Californium-249 {{is formed}} from the beta decay of berkelium-249, {{and most other}} {{californium}} isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense <b>neutron</b> radiation in a nuclear reactor. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high <b>neutron</b> capture) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high <b>neutron</b> cross-section).|$|E
5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong <b>neutron</b> emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a <b>neutron</b> startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) <b>neutron</b> source for <b>neutron</b> activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E

50|$|The <b>neutrons</b> {{in nuclear}} {{reactors}} are generally categorized as slow (thermal) <b>neutrons</b> or fast <b>neutrons</b> {{depending on their}} energy. Thermal <b>neutrons</b> are similar in energy distribution (the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) to a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium but are easily captured by atomic nuclei and are the primary means by which elements undergo nuclear transmutation.|$|R
25|$|Also {{because of}} the short range of the strong binding force, large stable nuclei must contain {{proportionally}} more <b>neutrons</b> than do the lightest elements, which are most stable with a 1to1 ratio of protons and <b>neutrons.</b> Nuclei which have more than 20protons cannot be stable unless they have more than {{an equal number of}} <b>neutrons.</b> Extra <b>neutrons</b> stabilize heavy elements because they add to strong-force binding (which acts between all nucleons) without adding to proton–proton repulsion. Fission products have, on average, about the same ratio of <b>neutrons</b> and protons as their parent nucleus, and are therefore usually unstable to beta decay (which changes <b>neutrons</b> to protons) because they have proportionally too many <b>neutrons</b> compared to stable isotopes of similar mass.|$|R
5|$|Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, {{especially}} isotopes with odd mass {{numbers and}} neutron-poor isotopes like 152Eu, have high cross sections for <b>neutron</b> capture, often {{high enough to}} be <b>neutron</b> poisons.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-99, which decays to form technetium-99m, can {{be formed}} by the <b>neutron</b> {{activation}} of molybdenum-98. When needed, other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission, but are manufactured by <b>neutron</b> irradiation of parent isotopes (for example, technetium-97 {{can be made by}} <b>neutron</b> irradiation of ruthenium-96).|$|E
5|$|<b>Neutron</b> {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; <b>neutron</b> radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. <b>Neutron</b> moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable <b>neutron</b> source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in <b>neutron</b> radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E

50|$|These fast {{reactors}} {{are better}} suited for the transmutation of other actinides than thermal reactors. Because thermal reactors use slow or moderated <b>neutrons,</b> the actinides that are not fissionable with thermal <b>neutrons</b> tend to absorb the <b>neutrons</b> instead of fissioning. This leads to buildup of heavier actinides and lowers the number of thermal <b>neutrons</b> available to continue the chain reaction.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are certain}} {{conditions}} {{that must be}} met for this chain reaction to occur. Certain fuel densities are necessary, or the <b>neutrons</b> won't impact {{a sufficient number of}} other unstable atoms before escaping the reactor. It is also easier for unstable nuclei to absorb <b>neutrons</b> when the <b>neutrons</b> are traveling at a certain speed. For , slower <b>neutrons</b> are more likely to cause a fission reaction. In order to slow down the <b>neutrons</b> in a reactor core, a moderator is used. Water is the most common moderator in use today. The <b>neutrons</b> are slowed down as they travel through the water. As the reaction speeds up and the temperature of the reactor increases, increasing the temperature of the moderator, the <b>neutrons</b> aren’t slowed down as effectively. This in turn reduces the rate of nuclear reactions inside the core, since the faster <b>neutrons</b> aren’t as easy to absorb. This effect, the negative temperature coefficient, makes the reactor inherently resistant to [...] "excursion", or a sudden, uncontrolled increase in temperature.|$|R

Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, {{and are therefore more}} strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E

The first method is most important for applications, as only <b>neutron</b> irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during <b>neutron</b> irradiation.|$|E
