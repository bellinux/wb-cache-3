40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} into <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection.</b> Current methods are looked into and a novel method is proposed. An index was developed {{during the course of}} the study called the Stationarity Index. The method of <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection</b> proposed is based on this index and it gives a measure that varies directly proportionally to changes in the dynamic behavior of the signal. This allows not only for the detection of nonstationarity but also serves as a means of determining relatively how much it is changing. The Stationarity Index maps changes in the dynamics to a range of 0 − 100 in the similar manner to the mapping of measures to percentages. This allows for the comparison of the variation of dynamics between separate signals. This ability sets the test apart from current tests. Most current tests simply determine if nonstationarity is present or not, and do not allow for the kind of measure that allows relative comparisons between signals. The index is then used to successfully distinguish between stationary and nonstationary chaotic signals. It is then used in the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) profiles. It is able to clearly pick out the changes in the dynamics that are the result of the onset of partial seizures. It shows potential for use in the identification of certain dynamic traits in ECG and EEG profiles. Its ability to discriminate between stationarity and nonstationarity also shows potential for use in the segmentation of nonstationary biomedical signals into partially (quasi) stationary segments...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{filters are}} {{frequently}} employed in many applications, such as, system identification, adaptive echo cancellation (AEC), {{active noise control}} (ANC), adaptive beamforming, speech signal processing and other related problems, in which the statistic of the underlying signals is either unknown a priori, or slowly-varying. Given the observed signals under study, we shall consider, in this dissertation, the time-varying linear model with Gaussian or contaminated Gaussian (CG) noises. In particular, we focus on recursive local estimation and its applications in linear systems. We base our development {{on the concept of}} local likelihood function (LLF) and local posterior probability for parameter estimation, which lead to efficient adaptive filtering algorithms. We also study the convergence performance of these algorithms and their applications by theoretical analyses. As for applications, another important one is to utilize adaptive filters to obtain recursive hypothesis testing and model order selection methods. It is known that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) may lead to large variance or ill-conditioning problems when the number of observations is limited. An effective approach to address these problems is to employ various form of regularization {{in order to reduce the}} variance at the expense of slightly increased bias. In general, this can be viewed as adopting the Bayesian estimation, where the regularization can be viewed as providing a certain prior density of the parameters to be estimated. By adopting different prior densities in the LLF, we derive the variable regularized QR decomposition-based recursive least squares (VR-QRRLS) and recursive least M-estimate (VR-QRRLM) algorithms. An improved state-regularized variable forgetting factor QRRLS (SR-VFF-QRRLS) algorithm is also proposed. By approximating the covariance matrix in the RLS, new variable regularized and variable step-size transform domain normalized least mean square (VR-TDNLMS and VSS-TDNLMS) algorithms are proposed. Convergence behaviors of these algorithms are studied to characterize their performance and provide useful guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters in practical applications. Based on the local Bayesian estimation framework for linear model parameters developed previously, the resulting estimate can be utilized for recursive <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection.</b> This can be cast under the problem of hypothesis testing, as the hypotheses can be viewed as two competitive models between stationary and nonstationary to be selected. In this dissertation, we develop new regularized and recursive generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), Rao’s and Wald tests, which can be implemented recursively in a QRRLS-type adaptive filtering algorithm with low computational complexity. Another issue to be addressed in <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection</b> is the selection of various models or model orders. In particular, we derive a recursive method for model order selection from the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) based on recursive local estimation. In general, the algorithms proposed in this dissertation have addressed some of the important problems in estimation and detection under the local and recursive Bayesian estimation framework. They are intrinsically connected together and can potentially be utilized for various applications. In this dissertation, their applications to adaptive beamforming, ANC system and speech signal processing, e. g. adaptive frequency estimation and <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection,</b> have been studied. For adaptive beamforming, the difficulties in determining the regularization or loading factor have been explored by automatically selecting the regularization parameter. For ANC systems, to combat uncertainties in the secondary path estimation, regularization techniques can be employed. Consequently, a new filtered-x VR-QRRLM (Fx-VR-QRRLM) algorithm is proposed and the theoretical analysis helps to address challenging problems in the design of ANC systems. On the other hand, for ANC systems with online secondary-path modeling, the coupling effect of the ANC controller and the secondary path estimator is thoroughly studied by analyzing the Fx-LMS algorithm. For speech signal processing, new approaches for recursive <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection</b> with automatic model order selection are proposed, which provides online time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) parameter estimation and the corresponding stationary intervals with low complexity. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{understanding}} of nonstationarity, from both a dynamical and a statistical point of view, has turned from a constraint on {{application of a}} specific type of analysis (e. g. spectral analysis), into a new insight into complex system behavior. The application of <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection</b> in an EEG time series {{plays an important role in}} the characterization of brain processes and the prediction of brain state and behavior such as seizure prediction. In this study, we report a very significant difference in the mean stationarity duration of an EEG over the frontal and temporal regions of the brain, comparing 22 healthy subjects and 16 patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The findings help illuminate the interpretation of the EEG’s duration of dynamical stationarity and proposes to be useful for distinguishing AD patients from control patients. This study supports the idea of a compensatory activation of the fronto...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Data-adaptive optimal {{modeling}} and identification of real-world vector sensor data {{is provided by}} combining the fractional tap-length (FT) approach with model order selection in the quaternion domain. To account rigorously for the generality of such processes, both second-order circular (proper) and noncircular (improper), the proposed approach in this paper combines the FT length optimization with both the strictly linear quaternion least mean square (QLMS) and widely linear QLMS (WL-QLMS). A collaborative approach based on QLMS and WL-QLMS is shown to both identify the type of processes (proper or improper) and to track their optimal parameters in real time. Analysis shows that monitoring {{the evolution of the}} convex mixing parameter within the collaborative approach allows us to track the improperness in real time. Further insight into the properties of those algorithms is provided by establishing a relationship between the steady-state error and optimal model order. The approach is supported by simulations on model order selection and identification of both strictly linear and widely linear quaternion-valued systems, such as those routinely used in renewable energy (wind) and human-centered computing (biomechanics).

40|$|Neurological {{diseases}} in newborns are usually first revealed by seizures, which are characterised by a synchronous discharge {{of a large}} number of neurons. Failure to control seizures may lead to brain damage or even death. The importance of this problem prompted many researchers to look for accurate automatic methods for seizure <b>detection.</b> <b>Nonstationarity</b> and multicomponent behaviour of newborn EEG signals made this task very challenging. The significant overlap in the characteristic of background and seizure activities in newborn EEG signals added to the difficulty of seizure detection. This research uses time-frequency based methods for automatic seizure detection. Since time-frequency signal analysis methods use joint representation in both time and frequency domains, they proved to be very suitable for analysis and processing of nonstationary and multicomponent signals such as newborn EEG. Before using any seizure detector, the EEG data is pre-processed in order to reduce the noise effects using a time-frequency based technique. The proposed method is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique applied to the matrix representing the time-frequency distribution (TFD) of the EEG signal. It has been shown that by appropriately filtering the singular vectors associated with the TFD, one can effectively enhance the desired information embedded in the signal. Neonatal EEG seizures can have signatures in both low frequency (lower than 10 Hz) and high frequency (higher than 70 Hz) areas. The seizure detection techniques proposed in the literature concentrated on using either low frequency or high frequency signatures but not both simultaneously. These methods tend to miss the seizures that reveal themselves only in one of the two frequency areas. In this research, we propose a detection method that uses seizure features in both low and high frequency areas. To detect EEG seizures using the low frequency signatures, an SVD-based technique is employed. The technique uses the estimated distribution function of the singular vectors associated with the time-frequency distribution of EEG epochs to discriminate between seizure and nonseizure patterns. The high frequency signatures of seizures are mostly the result of spike events in the EEG signals. To detect these spike events, the signal is mapped into the TF domain. The high instantaneous energy of spikes is reflected as a localised energy in the high frequency area of the TF domain. Consequently, a spike can be seen as a ridge in this area of the TF domain. It has been shown that during seizure activity there is regularity in the distribution of the interspike intervals. This feature has been used as the basis for discriminating between seizure and nonseizure patterns. The performance results obtained by applying the proposed methods on EEG signals extracted from a number of newborns show the superiority of these methods over the existing ones...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new recursive <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection</b> method based on time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) modeling. A local likelihood estimation approach is introduced which gives more weights to observations near the current time instant but less to those distance apart. It thus allows the Wald test to be computed based on RLS-type algorithms with low computational cost. A reliable and efficient state regularized variable forgetting factor (VFF) QR decomposition (QRD) -based RLS (SR-VFF-QRRLS) algorithm is adopted for estimation for its asymptotically unbiased property and immunity to lacking of excitation. Advantages {{of the proposed}} approach over conventional approaches are 1) it provides continuous parameter estimates and the corresponding stationary intervals with low complexity, 2) it mitigates low excitation problems using state regularization, and 3) stationarity at different scales can be detected by appropriately choosing a certain window size. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by testing vocal tract changes in real speech signals. © 2012 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 124 - 132 In this thesis, two new speech variation {{measures for}} speech spectrum <b>nonstationarity</b> <b>detection</b> are proposed. These measures {{are based on}} the Line Spectrum Frequencies (LSF) and the spectral values at the LSF locations. They are formulated to be subjectively meaningful, mathematically tractable, and also have low computational complexity property. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the non-stationarity detector, two applications are presented: The first application is an implicit speech segmentation system which detects non-stationary regions in speech signal and obtains the boundaries of the speech segments. The other application is a Variable Bit-Rate Mixed Excitation Linear Predictive (VBR-MELP) vocoder utilizing a novel voice activity detector to detect silent regions in the speech. This voice activity detector is designed to be robust to non-stationary background noise and provides efficient coding of silent sections and unvoiced utterances to decrease the bit-rate.
