25|$|Thus, {{nonlinear}} problems {{cannot be}} posed {{in general and}} thus not solved within distribution theory alone. In the context of quantum field theory, however, solutions can be found. In more than two spacetime dimensions the problem {{is related to the}} regularization of divergences. Here Henri Epstein and Vladimir Glaser developed the mathematically rigorous (but extremely technical) causal perturbation theory. This does not solve the problem in other situations. Many other interesting theories are <b>non</b> <b>linear,</b> like for example the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.|$|E
