Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> get involved at all. Thomas asked me if I wanted {{to tell the story of}} my life. Then they would know what to do with it." [...] Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron: Legacy score, but this never happened.|$|E
500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E

500|$|During the film's fire scene, Cody {{appears as}} a {{character}} in the barroom. [...] "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics {{and all that stuff}} which is why I don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon was {{introduced}} to Aeschylus through T. S. Eliot's 1939 play The Family Reunion, in which the protagonist Harry is haunted by [...] "the sleepless hunters / that will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> sleep". In Eliot's play, the Furies serve as embodiments of the remorse and guilt felt by Harry, who harbours a dark family secret, shared only with his sister. Bacon was captivated by Aeschylus' play, and keen {{to learn more about}} Greek tragedy, although he said many times that he regretted being unable to read the original in Greek. In 1942, he read the Irish scholar William Bedell Stanford's Aeschylus in his Style, and found the theme of obsessive guilt in The Oresteia to be highly resonant. In 1984, Bacon told Sylvester that although his painting's subject matter did not have a direct relationship with the poet's work, for him Eliot's work [...] "opened the valves of sensation".|$|E
500|$|With Karmal's {{ascension}} to power, Parchamites {{began to}} [...] "settle old scores". Revolutionary Troikas {{were created to}} arrest, sentence and execute people. Amin's guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued. Those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested, filling the prisons. The Soviets protested, and Karmal replied, [...] "As long as you keep my hands bound and do <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> deal with the Khalq faction {{there will be no}} unity in the PDPA and the government cannot become strong... They tortured and killed us. They still hate us! They are the enemies of the party..." [...] Amin's daughter, along with her baby, was imprisoned for twelve years, until Mohammad Najibullah, then leader of the PDPA, released her. When Karmal took power, leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Parchamites. The Khalq faction was removed from power, and only technocrats, opportunists and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government. Khalqists remained in control of the Ministry of Interior, but Parchamites were given control over KHAD and the secret police. The Parchamites and the Khalqists controlled an equal share of the military. Two out of Karmal's three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khalqists. Khalqists controlled the Ministry of Communications and the interior ministry. Parchamites, on the other hand, controlled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. In addition to the changes in government, the Parchamites held clear majority in the PDPA Central Committee. Only one Khalqi, Saleh Mohammad Zeary, {{was a member of the}} PDPA Secretariat during Karmal's rule.|$|E

2500|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 20th century in the Pirot District, south-eastern Serbia, the head of household would go out to his woodpile, where he would invite German (pronounced [...] ) – a male mythological being associated with bringing rain and hail. He would take with him a loaf of bread called good luck, prepared particularly for this ritual, rakia, wine, and a wax candle. At the woodpile, he would shout three times, [...] "German, German, wherever you are, come to dinner right now, and in the summer do <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see your eyes anywhere!" [...] He would then light the candle, take a sip of rakia, taste some bread, drink wine, and go back into his house. Asked what happened with German, he would answer, [...] "He came, so we dined and drank amply of rakia and wine, and then we parted." [...] This ritual was intended to prevent summer hailstorms.|$|E
2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I wonder if we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to <b>NOT</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
