50|$|The <b>national</b> <b>access</b> <b>code</b> of Mymensingh is 091. The digital {{telephone}} exchange of Mymensingh {{was set up}} in 2001. It was upgraded in 2008 with a capacity of 20 thousand telephone connections.|$|E
50|$|Area {{codes are}} often quoted by {{including}} the <b>national</b> <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> For example, a number in London should be listed as 020 7946 0321. Users must correctly interpret the 020 as the code for London. If they call from another station within London, they may merely dial 7946 0321, or if dialing from another country, the initial 0 should be omitted after the country code: +44 20 7946 0321.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, {{the other}} {{counties}} were given new area codes (30 to 69). The previous area code system {{did not follow}} the country administrative regions. Outside county dialing required a <b>national</b> <b>access</b> <b>code</b> 0 (01-xxx-xxxx to Bucharest and 0pp-xxx-xxx {{for the rest of}} the country). In-county calling could be done without prefixes at all (xxx-xxxx to Bucharest and xxx-xxx {{for the rest of the}} country). Calling from outside meant +40-1-xxx-xxxx for Bucharest and +40-pp-xxx-xxx for the rest of the country. An international access code for calling abroad, 00, was adopted. County codes were selected on a geographical order, starting with northern Moldavia (Suceava County had 30), then going southwards to eastern Wallachia, than westwards to Banat, then northern Transylvania and it ends in the southern Transylvania, until the highest prefix, 69 (used for Sibiu County). The short numbers for special services started with 9 and were three digits long. Each town or county has its own special services, callable with the same number throughout the country.|$|E
2500|$|Within Australia, mobile numbers {{must always}} be dialed with all 10 digits, {{regardless}} of the caller's location. 04 is the <b>National</b> Trunk <b>Access</b> <b>Code</b> plus a prefix indicating the service required and not an [...] "area code", as such.|$|R
50|$|The {{telephone}} {{numbering plan}} of the Netherlands is divided into geographical, non-geographical, and special public resource telephone numbers. The dial plan prescribes that within the country dialling both geographical and non-geographical numbers requires a <b>national</b> network <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> which is the digit 0. The following list includes this <b>national</b> trunk <b>access</b> digit when it must be dialled before the number.|$|R
50|$|The 1998 National Electricity Code did {{not allow}} the ACCC to roll forward {{automatically}} {{the value of the}} regulatory asset base from one regulatory period to the next (in contrast to the 1997 <b>National</b> Third Party <b>Access</b> <b>Code</b> for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems). however, under both the current National Electricity Rules and National Gas Rules, the regulatory asset base is locked-in using the asset base roll forward equation below. The telecommunications regime has also been amended from 1 January 2011 to allow the ACCC to make access determinations that include 'fixed principles'. The amendment will allow the ACCC to lock-in the value of the asset base across regulatory periods.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} years, {{landline}} usage started to drop within Romania, as the mobile phones market was growing fast. Mobile phone companies were {{running out of}} numbers, as both the main mobile companies claimed millions upon millions of subscribers. Also, as the imminent joining of the EU, was going to cause the state-owned company to lose its landline monopoly, a reform was introduced in 2002. This modified the system to a 10 digits system, of which the first is always a <b>national</b> <b>access</b> <b>code</b> 0. The first 4 digits, including the leading 0, give the area code, in the format 0ZYX, where X, Y are digits from 0 to 9 and Z is a digit from 2 to 9. The geographic area codes for Bucharest are 0Z1, with a digit less {{than all the other}} area codes and an extra digit to the local number. For example, the Romtelecom area code for Bucharest is 021-xxx-xxxx, and for Neam»õ County is 0233-xxx-xxx.|$|E
5000|$|The {{area code}} is usually preceded in the dialing {{sequence}} {{by either the}} <b>national</b> <b>access</b> <b>code</b> ("0" [...] for many countries, [...] "1" [...] in USA and Canada) or the international access code and country code. However, {{this is not always}} the case, especially when 10-digit dialing is used. For example, in Montreal, where area codes 514, 438, 450 and 579 are in use, users dial 10-digit numbers (e.g., 514 555 1234), dialing a 1 before this results in a recording advising not to dial a 1 as it is a local call. For non-geographic numbers, as well as mobile telephones outside of the North American Numbering Plan area, the area code does not correlate to a particular geographic area. However, until the 1990s, some areas in the United States and Canada required the use of a 1 before dialing a 7-digit number within the same area code if the call was beyond the local toll-free area, indicating that the caller wished to make what was referred to as a toll call.|$|E
50|$|A dialer (American English) or dialler (British English) is an {{electronic}} device that {{is connected to}} a telephone line to monitor the dialed numbers and alter them to seamlessly provide services that otherwise require lengthy <b>National</b> or International <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> to be dialed. A dialer automatically inserts and modifies the numbers depending {{on the time of}} day, country or area code dialed, allowing the user to subscribe to the service providers who offer the best rates. For example, a dialer could be programmed to use one service provider for international calls and another for cellular calls. This process is known as prefix insertion or least cost routing. A line powered dialer does not need any external power but instead takes the power it needs from the telephone line.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{currently}} only one known working phone number {{in this area}} code. [...] A special <b>access</b> <b>code</b> of 12 digits is required for using the service. Upon dialing this phone number, the caller hears a mechanical beep which prompts the caller to enter the <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> If a correct code is entered, they are prompted to dial the destination number (area code + number). If an <b>access</b> <b>code</b> is not entered at the beep, the call is then redirected to a live human operator who then asks for the <b>access</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{well known}} {{cryptographic}} primitive is so called random <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> Namely, Alice {{is to send}} to Bob one of two bits, so that Bob has the choice which bit he wants to learn about. However at any time Alice should not learn Bob's choice, and Bob should learn only the bit of his choice. The task is impossible to accomplish by means of either classical or quantum communication. On the other hand, a concept of correlations stronger than quantum ones, exhibited by so called Popescu- Rohrlich box, was introduced and widely studied. In particular, {{it is known that}} Popescu-Rohrlich box enables simulation of the random <b>access</b> <b>code</b> with the support of one bit of communication. Here, we propose a quantum analogue of this phenomenon. Namely, we define an analogue of a random <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> where instead of classical bits, one encodes qubits. We provide a quantum non-signaling box that if supported with two classical bits, allows to simulate a quantum version of random <b>access</b> <b>code.</b> We point out that two bits are necessary. We also show that a quantum random <b>access</b> <b>code</b> cannot be fully quantum: when Bob inputs superposition of two choices, the output will be in a mixed state rather than in a superposition of required states...|$|R
