40|$|Objective: To detect single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cod transferrin gene by comparing the sequences from Norwegian (<b>North</b> East <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean)</b> and Canadian (<b>North</b> West <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean)</b> specimen, and to quantify the genetic variation and differentiation in East and West Atlantic cod populations. Methods: cDNA sequences between individuals of Canadian (<b>North</b> West <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean)</b> and Norwegian (<b>North</b> East <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean)</b> origin were aligned. Allele frequencies of the SNPs were used to discriminate the different Atlantic cod populations in West/East <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> and the Baltic Sea. Results: The sequence alignment detected 19 SNPs, of which 18 of them resulted in amino acid changes in the transferrin protein. Nonsynonymous to synonymous site substitution ratio (dn/ ds) was by far greater than 1 providing an evidence {{for the existence of}} positive selection. The West Atlantic cod populations showed high values of heterozygosity and the Baltic populations were found to be inbred. Conclusions: This study identified and indicated transferrin gene polymorphisms {{that can be used for}} population differentiations...|$|R

5|$|The 1910 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the period {{during the summer}} and fall of 1910 in which tropical cyclones formed in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The season was fairly inactive, with only five storms; however, three grew into hurricanes and one became a major hurricane. The season got off to a late start with the formation of a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea on August 23. September saw two storms, and the final tropical cyclone—Hurricane Five—existed during October. All but one of the storms made landfall, and the only cyclone which remained at sea had some effects on the island of Bermuda.|$|E

It also allows estimates of such measures as the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation and Southern Oscillation indices for this period.|$|R

5|$|The area of {{disturbed}} {{weather that}} would soon become Chantal began in a large envelope of low pressure {{on the morning of}} September 10. The disturbed weather, nested off the coast of Bermuda, was one of the remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from Hispaniola to the central <b>north</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> This particular area of disturbed weather become part of the northeast portion of a low-pressure system. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30mph (50km/h) and a 1010millibar (29.83inHg) pressure reading. This reading indicated the system developed into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{areas of}} {{tropical}} cyclone formation {{are divided into}} seven basins. These include the <b>north</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean, the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans, and the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least of Category 3 intensity).|$|E
5|$|A strong ridge {{over the}} <b>north</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> turned Emmy sharply eastward on August 29. The {{hurricane}} continued to strengthen, and Emmy attained a peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) shortly after {{turning to the}} east while located 500miles (800km) northeast of Bermuda. The hurricane maintained its peak intensity for 42hours while moving eastward at 17mph (27km/h), and slowly weakened after peaking in strength. On September 1, Emmy turned to the east-southeast, and a day later it turned to the northeast as its forward motion decreased. Emmy passed through the Azores on September 3, and the following day it became extratropical {{to the north of}} the islands. The extratropical remnant persisted another six hours before being absorbed by approaching Hurricane Frances.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{hurricane}} season {{is defined as}} beginning on June1 and ending on November30, {{there have been several}} off-season storms. Since 1870, there have been 32 off-season cyclones, 18 of which occurred in May. In the same time span, nine storms formed in December, two in April, and one each in January, February and March. During four years (1887, 1953, 2003, and 2007), tropical cyclones formed in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> both during or before May and during December. In 1887, four storms occurred outside the season, the most in a single year. High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the off-season.|$|E
5|$|Debby {{began to}} slow down to 5mph (10km/h) early on September17 as another trough in the {{westerlies}} arrived and the system entered it. As the hurricane entered the trough, its forward speed picked up from 5mph (10km/h) to 30mph (50km/h). During this time, Debby reached Category4 strength, reaching a peak intensity of 130mph (215km/h) and a minimal pressure of 950mbar (28.05inHg). Early on September19, Debby passed just south of Cape Race, Newfoundland and started accelerating to the east at 60mph (100km/h) on the following day. Debby remained a tropical cyclone while crossing the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and weakened to a tropical storm at 0600UTC September20. Debby was rapidly approaching the British Isles on September 20 shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September10, the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961mbar (28.38inHg) but sustained winds did not exceed 90mph (140km/h) according to the NHC. Luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula in eastern Newfoundland early on September11. While tracking over Newfoundland, cold, dry air became entrenched in Luis's circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough. The NHC issued their final advisory on Hurricane Luis at 0900UTC on September11 as it tracked nearly 65mph (100km/h) to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants persisted for 30more hours over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of Greenland late on September12.|$|E

5|$|Early on September 24, Karl {{continued}} its north-northeast track over the open north-central Atlantic {{and continued to}} gradually weaken. It started to {{come in contact with}} the baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics, while still a Category1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47°N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical cyclone {{moved away}} from the coast and {{strengthened}} to the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on November1. It began a weakening trend on November2 while taking a wavering path across the <b>north</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> On November4, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November6 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter-clockwise loop over northwest France until dissipating the storm on November8.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Chantal began affecting Bermuda on July 30, producing scattered {{storms and}} increased cloud cover. The {{next day the}} system dropped more rainfall as it passed {{to the west of}} the island, and in the two-day period precipitation accumulated to 2.12inches (53.8mm) at the Bermuda International Airport, accounting for 35% of the monthly rainfall total. Thunderstorms were reported on the island, and maximum reported winds on the island reached 45mph (72km/h). After Chantal passed Bermuda, a ship with the call sign C60Y4 recorded sustained winds of 37mph (59km/h) over the open waters of the <b>north</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> At around 2300UTC on July 31, a buoy to the southeast of Nova Scotia reported a pressure of 995mbar as Chantal passed nearby.|$|E
