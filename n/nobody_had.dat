5|$|Mr. <b>Nobody</b> <b>had</b> {{its world}} premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival where it {{received}} the Golden Osella and the Biografilm Lancia Award. Critical response was generally strong {{and the film}} was nominated for seven Magritte Awards, winning six, including Best Film and Best Director for Van Dormael. The film was mostly funded through European financiers and was released in Belgium on 13 January 2010. Since its original release, Mr. Nobody has become a cult film, noted for its philosophy and cinematography, personal characters and Pierre Van Dormael's soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's {{office in}} Medan filed charges against Jassin, {{charging}} him with blasphemy {{after he was}} unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin's true name. At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story {{was a product of}} the author's imagination, it should not be considered an insult to Islam; he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the Quran and Sufi literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A witness for the prosecution, noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E

40|$|How is it {{possible}} to justify a lengthy review of the physics of the magnetic monopole when <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> ever seen one? In spite of the unfortunate lack of favorable experimental evidence, there are sound theoretical reasons for believing that the magnetic monopole must exist. The case for its existence is surely as strong as the case for any other undiscovered particle. Moreover, as of this writing (early 1984), it is not certain that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> ever seen one. What seems certain is that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> ever seen two...|$|R

5|$|The Mint then struck silver or gold in {{response}} to deposits by those holding bullion, and made little profit from those transactions. By the 1840s, profits, or seignorage, from monetizing copper into cents helped fund the Mint. In 1849, copper prices rose sharply, causing the Department of the Treasury to investigate possible alternatives to the large one-cent pieces. The cent was unpopular in trade; as {{it was not a}} legal tender, <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> to take it, and banks and merchants often refused it. The cent was disliked for its large size as well. In 1837, the eccentric New York chemist Lewis Feuchtwanger had experimented with a smaller cent size in making model coins as part of a plan to sell his alloy (similar to base-metal German silver) to the government for use in coinage. His pieces circulated as hard times tokens in the recession years of the late 1830s and early 1840s.|$|E
5|$|An earlier, longer, {{work-in-progress}} {{version of}} the film was rejected for competition by the Cannes Film Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. Nobody an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau turned that down. The decision by the Cannes Film Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. Nobody screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release. Mr. <b>Nobody</b> <b>had</b> its American premiere on 25 June 2011, at the Los Angeles Film Festival, nearly two years since its original debut. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown at the festival. The Consul General of Belgium, Geert Criel, held a second United States screening of Mr. Nobody on 21 December 2011, at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū began 2004 {{with two}} {{consecutive}} perfect 15–0 tournament wins (zensho-yūshō) in January and March. <b>Nobody</b> <b>had</b> attained a zensho-yūshō since 1996; yet Asashōryū {{went on to}} add three more such titles after 2004, for a career total of five. Only Hakuhō, with twelve, Taihō, with eight, and Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi with seven, have recorded more 15–0 scores. His unbeaten run continued into the first five days of the May 2004 tournament, giving him a winning streak of 35 bouts in total, the longest run since Chiyonofuji's 53 in 1988. Although he was then upset by maegashira Hokutōriki, he gained revenge by defeating Hokutōriki in a playoff {{on the final day}} to claim the championship. On 27 November 2004, Asashōryū became the first wrestler to win five tournaments in a year since Chiyonofuji achieved the feat in 1986, and won his ninth Emperor's Cup. Asashōryū's below average 9–6 score in the Autumn basho of 2004, the only one he did not win, was attributed in part to the official ceremony for his marriage, which was held in August 2004 (although he had actually married in December 2002). The hectic social round that inevitably follows Japanese weddings affected his pre-tournament preparations, as it prevented him from doing any training.|$|E

5|$|The {{agreement}} {{to withdraw the}} special police and the JNA largely restored status quo ante bellum. 17 of the 32 arrested policemen returned to service by 5 March; charges were eventually filed against five, including Vezmar. The incident had a lasting significance {{because it was the}} first serious skirmish in what would become the Croatian War of Independencea full-scale war between Croatia and its rebel Serb population supported by Serbia and the JNA. The Serbian government used the Pakrac clash to strengthen nationalist propaganda claims that Croatia was committing genocide against its Serb population. Up to 40 deaths from the clash were reported by Serbian and Montenegrin media outlets. In an indication of the confused and highly inaccurate nature of the reporting, the Belgrade daily newspaper Večernje novosti reported on its front page that the town's Orthodox priest had been killed, on its second page that he had been wounded, and on its third page it printed a statement from him. The Yugoslav presidency finally issued a statement that <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> been killed in Pakrac.|$|E

25|$|Egypt's former Interior {{minister}} Habib Ibrahim El Adly said on 23 January {{that evidence}} {{proved that the}} Gaza-based Army of Islam planned and executed the attack. The group, which has received sanctuary from Hamas and earlier collaborated in the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit, quickly denied the charge, while also reportedly expressing support for the bombing. In July 2011 however, <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> yet been brought to trial and the Coptic Church threatened to sue the Interior Ministry. On the other hand, various reports claim that Habib Ibrahim El Adly himself {{was involved in the}} bombings.|$|E

Moreover, the grave had to be excavated and prepared within two days, forcing last minute changes in the plumbing system of the Basilica.

His grave is marked by a simple tombstone engraved with just his Christian name and first surname, on the choir side of the main high altar (between the altar and the apse of the Church; behind the altar, {{from the perspective of a}} person standing at the main door).|$|E

The player's Guardian becomes the first to penetrate the Exclusion Zone and heads to the Garden's Spire, which charges the Gate Lord's eye. They also travel to the Buried City, the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an AI that used to be linked to the Warmind of Mars, but is now controlled by Rasputin. With the Vex now present on Mars, the Guardian finds out what they are doing; they are returning to their home, the Black Garden.|$|E
25|$|What <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> {{anticipated}} was {{the tens}} of thousands of Hmong left behind in Long Tieng and Laos would follow Vang Pao and other Hmong leaders to Thailand. By the end of 1975 about 40,000 Hmong had succeeded to reaching Thailand, traveling on foot through the mountains and floating across the Mekong River. How many died or were killed in the attempt to escape Laos is not known, but the flight of Hmong and other Laotian highland peoples into Thailand would continue for many more years. They faced repression at home from the communist government as the price of their collaboration with the Americans. Most of the Hmong in Thailand would eventually be resettled in the United States and other countries. Between 1975 and 1982, 53,700 Hmong and other highland Laotian refugees were resettled in the United States and thousands more in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Beurling's coffin {{was kept}} {{for three months}} in a {{warehouse}} in the Verano Monumental Cemetery, as <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> claimed the body. Then his widow, Diana Whittall Gardner, had him buried in the Protestant Cemetery behind the Cestia Pyramid, between the graves of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats. In November 1950, two and half years after his death, Beurling's casket arrived at Haifa Airport. His coffin, draped with the blue and white Israeli flag, was laid in a nearby air force base, where an honour guard of young airmen mounted a silent watch. During the long funeral {{in the streets of}} Haifa, Israeli Air Force aircraft paid homage to Beurling. At last, he was re-interred in the military cemetery at the foot of Mount Carmel. The grave is marked, as are the others in Israel Defense Forces cemeteries, with only name, serial number and rank: for Beurling that of segen, lieutenant.|$|E
