5|$|In 1963, three Avro 748s were {{in service}} {{and two of}} Skyways Coach-Air's Dakotas were {{converted}} to freighters. During the winter of 1962–63, the 748s continued to operate a normal service out of Lympne. In October 1964, Skyways Coach-Air moved out of its London offices and all operations were <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Lympne, although a sales office was retained in London. The Cinque Ports Flying Club was restarted in 1964 by Barry Damon and had 120 members by 1968. The club aircraft were a Beechcraft Bonanza, Beechcraft Musketeers and a Bölkow Monsun.|$|E

5|$|Mauna Loa has {{probably}} been erupting for at least 700,000years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which {{has been responsible for}} the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years. The slow drift of the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from <b>now,</b> <b>at</b> which point it will become extinct.|$|E

5|$|Nothhelm died on 17 October 739. and {{was buried}} in Canterbury Cathedral. He is {{considered}} a saint, and his feast day is 17 October. The antiquaries and writers John Leland, John Bale, and Thomas Tanner all felt that Nothhelm {{was the author of}} various works, but later research has shown them to be authored by other writers. A verse eulogy for Nothhelm, of uncertain date, survives in a 16th-century manuscript <b>now</b> <b>at</b> the Lambeth Palace library.|$|E

5|$|Since the Separatists are {{secretly}} {{building a}} battle droid army, Palpatine uses {{the situation to}} have himself granted emergency powers. Palpatine feigns reluctance to accept this authority, promising to {{return it to the}} Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow the creation of a clone army to counter the Separatist threat; this results in the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. With the galaxy <b>now</b> <b>at</b> war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for a new superweapon.|$|E
5|$|The book {{attracted}} academic interest, {{and scholars}} discussed it {{in at least}} three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, who grow up under a totalitarian regime; and ethnographic and literary studies of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Texas State University, published an article in 1997. Müller's Herztier is one of the four titles discussed in Glajar's 2004 monograph The German Legacy, on German-language literature from Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was <b>now</b> <b>at</b> MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, North Carolina had a {{first down}} at the Tech 34-yard line. Keldorf threw an eight-yard pass to Crumpler, North Carolina, was stopped for a one-yard loss on a running play, then the Tar Heels earned {{a first down}} with a four-yard run by Geter. On first down, Keldorf threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Second down resulted in a 15-yard gain and a first down on a run by Geter along {{the left side of}} the field. <b>Now</b> <b>at</b> the Tech eight-yard line, Geter ran straight ahead for a five-yard gain. Geter was stopped for a two-yard loss on the next play, but North Carolina recovered from the loss with a five-yard pass from Keldorf to Carrick for a touchdown. The extra point kick was blocked, but a penalty against Virginia Tech allowed Carolina kicker Josh McGee another chance at the extra point. The second attempt was successful, and the kick gave the Tar Heels a 423 lead with 5:01 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Al Lowe, {{a former}} high school teacher, had carved a niche for himself at Sierra with his work on such Disney-licensed {{edutainment}} titles as Donald Duck's Playground, Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood, and The Black Cauldron, which he wrote, designed and programmed. In 1982, Sierra had released a text-only game on the Apple II titled Softporn Adventure (it was the only text adventure that was released by a company which had established its name on providing a graphical alternative to such games). In 1986, after Sierra lost a Disney license, Al Lowe suggested that Sierra remake Softporn Adventure with the improved tools <b>now</b> <b>at</b> their disposal, and Ken Williams agreed.|$|E
