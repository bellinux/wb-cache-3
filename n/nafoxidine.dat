50|$|<b>Nafoxidine</b> (INN) (developmental code names U-11,000A, NSC-70735), or <b>nafoxidine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (USAN), is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) {{or partial}} antiestrogen of the triphenylethylene {{group that was}} developed {{for the treatment of}} advanced breast cancer by Upjohn in the 1970s but was never marketed. It was developed at around the same time as tamoxifen and clomifene, which are also triphenylethylene derivatives. The drug was originally synthesized by the fertility control program at Upjohn as a postcoital contraceptive, but was subsequently repurposed for the treatment of breast cancer. <b>Nafoxidine</b> was assessed in clinical trials in the treatment of breast cancer and was found to be effective. However, it produced side effects including ichthyosis, partial hair loss, and phototoxicity of the skin in almost all patients, and this resulted in the discontinuation of its development.|$|E
50|$|Modifications of {{the first}} dihydronapthalene SERM, <b>nafoxidine</b> (see figure 10) that was a {{clinical}} candidate {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer but had side effects including severe phototoxicity, resulted in lasofoxifene ((5R,6S)-6-phenyl-5-4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol; see figure 11). <b>Nafoxidine</b> has all three phenyls constrained in a coplanar arrangement like tamoxifen. But with hydrogenation, the double bond of nafoxidene were reduced, and both phenyls are cis-oriented. The amine-bearing side chain can then adopt an axial conformation and locate this group orthogonally to the plane of the core, like ralofoxifene and other less uterotropic SERMs.|$|E

50|$|Nitromifene (INN; also as the citrate salt {{nitromifene}} citrate (USAN), developmental code names CI-728, CN-5518, CN-55945) is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) {{related to}} triphenylethylenes like tamoxifen {{that was never}} marketed. It {{is a mixture of}} (E)- and (Z)-isomers that possess similar antiestrogenic activity. The drug was described in 1966.

The antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is also closely related, but is technically not a derivative of TPE and is instead a triphenylethanol derivative. The tamoxifen metabolite and aromatase inhibitor norendoxifen is also a TPE derivative. In addition to their estrogenic activity, various TPE derivatives like tamoxifen and clomifene have been found to act as protein kinase C inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nafoxidine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (Upjohn, 11100 A) {{injected with}} oestradiol into immature chicks inhibits the hormone-induced increase in [3 H]oestradiol-binding activity in salt extracts of liver nuclei {{as well as}} the subsequent production by liver of egg-yolk phosphoprotein. Substantial inhibition of both oestradiol-induced responses is seen when <b>nafoxidine</b> is given in a dose approximately equimolar with that of oestradiol. In vitro <b>nafoxidine</b> competitively inhibits binding of [3 H]oestradiol in nuclear extracts. The Ki for the inhibition is 43 nM, which indicates an affinity of <b>nafoxidine</b> for the binding protein about 4 % of that of oestradiol. The inhibitory action of <b>nafoxidine</b> in vivo thus is more potent than the relative binding affinity determined in vitro might indicate. One possible explanation is that the primary site of <b>nafoxidine</b> action is at a point proximal to nuclear receptor interaction. <b>Nafoxidine</b> injected alone into the chick does not induce phosphoprotein synthesis, but it does increase [3 H]oestradiol-binding activity in extracts of liver nuclei to a limited extent. No differences in the properties of the oestradiol-binding activity in extracts from nafoxidine-treated chicks or from oestradiol-treated chicks were detected. Chick liver cytosol does not contain detectable high-affinity oestradiol-binding activity. A low-affinity oestradiol-binding component with a sedimentation coefficient of 3. 5 S was found, but it was unaffected by treatment of chicks with earlier <b>nafoxidine</b> or oestradiol. The results suggest a difference in the mechanism of oestradiol action in the chick liver and in the widely studied rat uterus, on which the usual model for oestradiol action is largely based...|$|E

The differences in remission rates was almost significant (0. 05 less than P less than 0. 10). Life-threatening complications were more frequent with ethinyloestradiol than with <b>nafoxidine</b> but the latter produced specific toxic reactions on {{skin and hair}} that may limit its practical usefulness.

40|$|We {{have used}} the whole-cell patch clamp {{technique}} to study {{the effect of the}} partial anti-oestrogens clomiphene and <b>nafoxidine,</b> the pure anti-oestrogens ICI 182, 780 and RU 58, 668 and the oestrogen β-estradiol, on the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) in cultured pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells. In contrast to the pure anti-oestrogens and β-estradiol, clomiphene and <b>nafoxidine</b> potently inhibited the volume-sensitive chloride current, ICl,swell, activated by challenging CPAE cells with a 25 % hypotonic solution. For clomiphene, the estimated IC 50 and Hill coefficient were 1. 03 ± 0. 14 [*]μM and 1. 40 ± 0. 21 respectively. In the case of <b>nafoxidine,</b> these values were 1. 61 ± 0. 29 [*]μM and 1. 24 ± 0. 19. The inhibition induced by the pure enantiomers of clomiphene, zuclomiphene and enclomiphene, was not {{different from that of the}} racemic mixture, indicating that the interaction between clomiphene and VRAC is not stereoselective. Clomiphene and <b>nafoxidine</b> inhibited proliferation of CPAE cells. Half-maximal inhibition was found at 1. 98 ± 0. 17 and 1. 66 ± 0. 21 [*]μM respectively, concentrations similar to those for half-maximal block of VRAC. In conclusion, the nonsteroidal partial anti-oestrogens <b>nafoxidine</b> and clomiphene are potent inhibitors of volume-regulated anion channels. The inhibition by clomiphene is not stereoselective and occurs at concentrations close to therapeutically relevant concentrations. Finally, both drugs inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} <b>nafoxidine</b> on the earlier biological processes of angiogenesis and explored the role of different signaling pathways involved in the in vitro response of endothelial cells (HUVEC). <b>Nafoxidine</b> significantly inhibited adhesion, spreading, migration and invasion of HUVEC at concentrations ranging from 1 to 2. 5 ÌM. Endothelial cord formation on Matrigel was inhibited by <b>nafoxidine</b> and cotreatment with phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) clearly prevented the antiangiogenic effect of the antiestrogen. On the contrary, cotreatment with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide potentiated inhibition of cord formation. PMA also inhibited the nafoxidine-induced secretion of metalloproteinase- 2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 in HUVEC monolayers.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we reported that <b>nafoxidine</b> (UA) stimulated {{the synthesis of}} a uterine protein showing the same electrophoretic mobility as the 'estrogen-induced protein' (E 2 -IP) first described by Notides and Gorski. In the present work, we analyzed the IP-containing electrophoretic zone by SDS polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and found that estradiol- 17 β (E 2) and <b>nafoxidine</b> stimulated the synthesis of different proteins. As expected, estradiol- 17 β stimulated the synthesis of the E 2 -IP of 46, 000 M(r). On the other hand, UA stimulated the synthesis of 27, 000 and 30, 000 M(r) proteins (UA-IP). These UA-IP were not precipitated by an antiserum raised against E 2 -IP. Therefore, UA-IP appear to be independent entities and not degradation or precursor products of E 2 -IP. Both UA-IP are constitutively present in the uterus and even in higher relative amounts in rat brain. The present finding, that an 'anti-estrogen', such as <b>nafoxidine,</b> stimulates the synthesis of different proteins than estrogen, provides {{a new approach to}} the study of the molecular mechanism of estrogen action.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{estradiol}} and <b>nafoxidine</b> on nuclear estrogen receptor binding, RNA polymerase activities, and uterine ultrastructure were studied. Animals were either injected with estradiol, implanted with estradiol/paraffin pellets, or injected with <b>nafoxidine.</b> Animals treated with <b>nafoxidine</b> or estradiol implants showed sustained long-term nuclear retention of estrogen receptor and increased nuclear RNA polymerase activities {{for up to}} 72 hr. A single injection of estradiol caused initial increases in these variables which returned to control levels by 24 hr after hormone treatment. Uterine tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy 72 hr after hormone treatments. Uteri from eith estradiol-implanted or nafoxidine-treated animals showed markedly increased hypertrophy of the luminal epithelial cells. Nuclei in sections of the uteri of these hyperestrogenized animals displayed a large number and wide array of nuclear bodies composed of a filamentous capsule and granular cores. We conclude that hyperestrogenization, a condition that eventually results in abnormal cell growth, is correlated with increased and sustained nuclear binding of the estrogen receptor, increased and sustained RNA polymerase activity, {{and the appearance of}} nuclear bodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} estradiol, <b>nafoxidine,</b> and clomiphene on uterine {{histology}} and nuclear type I and type II estrogen binding sites were examined 96 h following administration of these com-pounds to mature. ovariectomized rats by beeswax implant. Histological examination revealed that estradiol treatment resulted in dramatic {{stimulation of the}} luminal epithelium, stroma, and myo. metrium. Clomiphene and <b>nafoxidine</b> treatment resulted in intense stimulation of the luminal and glandular epithelium; however, these compounds were only partial agonists in the stroma and myometrium. Increases in uterine wet weight and DNA content correlated with this differential cell stimulation. To examine the biochemical basis for this differential cellular response, nuclear levels of type I and type II estrogen binding sites were measured in isolated uterine luminal epithelium, stroma, and myometrium. Estradiol, <b>nafoxidine,</b> or clomiphene treatment caused the accumulation of type I sites in the nuclei of the luminal epithelial, stromal, and myometrial cells. In addition, estradiol stimulation was associated with dramatic increases in nuclear levels of type II sites in the luminal epithelium (13 -fold), stroma (10 -fold), and myometrium (30 -fold).

If eosinophil counts in the deep stroma were considered, a strong parallelism was revealed between this response {{and the increase in}} wet weight. These results represent a further argument for a dissociation between early and late effects of oestrogen and for the existence of separate sites of hormone action.

40|$|Patients with {{advanced}} breast cancer may develop acute, severe hypercalcemia when treated with estrogens or antiestrogens. In this study, {{we examined the}} effects of estrogens and related compounds on the release of bone resorbing activity by cultured human breast cancer cells in vitro. We found that the estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 releases bone resorbing activity in response to low concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol. Bone resorbing activity was also released in response to the antiestrogen <b>nafoxidine.</b> Other steroidal compounds had no effect on the release of bone resorbing activity. Estrogen-stimulated release of bone resorbing activity occurred with live bone cultures, but not with devitalized bones, indicating that the effect was bone cell mediated. The breast cancer cell line MDA- 231, which does not have estrogen receptors, did not release bone resorbing activity in response to 17 beta-estradiol or <b>nafoxidine.</b> Release of the bone resorbing activity by MCF- 7 cells incubated with 17 beta-estradiol was inhibited by indomethacin (10 microM) and flufenamic acid (50 microM), two structurally unrelated compounds that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and <b>nafoxidine</b> that caused increased release of bone resorbing activity by the breast cancer cells caused a four- to fivefold increase in release of prostaglandins of the E series by MCF- 7 cells.

40|$|The antiestrogens {{represent}} {{a group of}} compounds, not necessarily steroidal, which are able to decrease the specific uptake of estrogens in vitro and in vivo by various target tissues in the rat and in man. This action is explained either by competitive binding to estrogen receptor sites or, more probably, by failure of the antiestrogen complex, translocated into the nucleus, to stimulate neoformation of receptors in the cytoplasm. This explains the transient estrogenic effect of antiestrogen. Antiestrogens used in humans are hormone specific and antagonize also non-steroidal estrogens, like stilbestrol. Three compounds {{have been used in}} advanced breast cancer with the same indications as the older hormonal treatments. They are clomiphene citrate, <b>nafoxidine</b> and tamoxifen. <b>Nafoxidine</b> and tamoxifen are probably equally active. The response rate is between 28 and 35 %, with a median duration of nine months. <b>Nafoxidine</b> is toxic for the skin and tamoxifen is the preferred compound. A randomized trial comparing ethinyl estradiol and an antiestrogen showed similar rates of response with the two compounds in advanced breast cancer. The uniformity of results of treatment of advanced breast cancer by hormonal agents including antiestrogens and their limitations, probably justifies the present day concept which assigns hormonal treatment a secondary role, either as a supplement to cytotoxic chemotherapy or for old and debilitated patients. However, as a supplement to chemotherapy, hormonal agents are probably important since recent studies have shown that apparently all breast cancers have positive receptor sites, albeit in variable amounts. Because of their lack of toxicity, antiestrogens are probably the best hormonal agents available at present. SCOPUS: re. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this report}} experiments in vivo that demonstrate that antiestrogens promote DNA binding of the estrogen receptor without efficiently inducing transcription.

In addition, we show that both estrogen and an antiestrogen, <b>nafoxidine,</b> effect very similar alterations in chromatin structure at a responsive promoter.

In this regard, antihormones can function by establishing receptor-DNA complexes that are transcriptionally nonproductive...|$|E
40|$|The {{antagonistic}} {{effects of}} progesterone {{and of the}} anti-estrogens, tamoxifen and <b>nafoxidine,</b> to estrogen responses were studied in the target tissues of fetal and newborn guinea pigs. In the fetal uterus, progesterone inhibits the stimulatory effect provoked by estradiol on uterine growth, on progesterone receptor and on the acetylation of nuclear histones. Progesterone also blocks the synthesis of new progesterone receptor protein in organ culture. Tamoxifen or <b>nafoxidine</b> (1 or 10 mg/kg/day injected to the mother for 3 days) provoke a uterotrophic effect {{similar to that of}} estradiol (1 mg/kg/day injected to the mother for 3 days) but these anti-estrogens have a limited effect on the progesterone receptor. Tamoxifen given together with estradiol antagonizes the effect of the estrogen on the acetylation of histones but the anti-estrogens do not block the effect of estradiol on uterine growth. Histological studies show that both estradiol and tamoxifen provoke a dramatic hypertrophic and hyperplastic effect particularly in the uterine epithelium. In the newborn uterus (6 -day old), tamoxifen (s. c. injection of 0. 6 micrograms/g body weight) and estradiol (injection of 30 ng/g body weight) provoke a similar uterotrophic effect and both have a limited effect on the progesterone receptor. In the fetal thymus estradiol provokes a selective decrease in the larger and actively proliferating lymphoid cells of the cortical zone. Tamoxifen has a similar effect but to a much lesser extent than estradiol. On the other hand, tamoxifen antagonizes the effect of estradiol on this fetal tissue. It is concluded that during fetal life progesterone antagonizes the effect of estradiol but tamoxifen can act as an agonist or an antagonist of estrogen action which {{is a function of the}} type of response or organ considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubilization}} of oestrogen receptors from uterine nuclei by micrococcal nuclease and deoxyribonuclease I {{was examined}} after the injection of oestradiol or <b>Nafoxidine</b> into castrated female rats. At 1 h after an injection of oestradiol, 30 % (0. 18 pmol/mg of DNA) {{of the nuclear}} oestrogen receptors was solubilized by 5 min of mild digestion with either nuclease. No further receptor release occurred, although DNA hydrolysis continued throughout a 20 min interval. The limitation in receptor solubilization was not due to an artifact of digestion conditions or insufficient nuclease concentrations. Similar patterns of receptor solubilization and DNA hydrolysis were obtained with both nucleases whether the animals had been injected with oestradiol 1 h before death or if the uteri from uninjected animals were incubated with [3 H]oestradiol for 1 h in vitro. When uterine nuclei were digested with these enzymes 12 h after the animal was injected with oestradiol there was little change in the quantity of nuclease-sensitive sites (0. 11 pmol/mg of DNA); however, the quantity of nuclease-resistant sites decreased 10 -fold. These values correspond quantitatively to the changes in salt-resistant and salt-extractable sites observed over a 12 h interval after oestradiol treatment. Nuclease digestion of uterine nuclei obtained 16 h after <b>Nafoxidine</b> treatment gave a pattern qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that observed 1 h after oestradiol treatment, a result consistent with the agonist/antagonist action of this compound. An analysis by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation of {{the time course of}} nuclease-dependent receptor solubilization indicated that the solubilized receptors were not associated with discrete nucleosomal fragments.

Estrogens did not similarly affect two other receptor cell lines studied.

Concurrent incubation of the HeLa cells and estrogens with the antiestrogen <b>nafoxidine</b> blocked the subsequent increase in adherence.

The stimulation of labelling caused by oestradiol is completely abolished by pretreatment of the animals with the anti-oestrogen, <b>nafoxidine.</b> The stimulation is given by lower doses of oestradiol, by stilboestrol and oestriol, but is not given by testosterone.

In this study, the interaction of these and related compounds with calmodulin was examined using the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE) assay. Neither of the steroids gave any significant inhibition of the calmodulin dependent cAMP-PDE activity up to a final concentration of 20 μM.

The addition of estradiol- 1 7 (3 (0. 1 nM, 1 nM, 100 nM), progesterone (100 nM, 500 nM) or cortisol (100 nM) to the culture medium did not affect BFR (95 to 100 %, Experiment 1). Similarly, adding charcoal-stripped lamb serum to the medium instead of normal lamb serum in the absence or presence of I nM estradiol- 1 7 (3 had no effect (93 to 95 % BFR, Experiment 2). The antiestrogen <b>Nafoxidine,</b> however, at a concentration of 15 pg/mi, significantly (/Y(0. 01) reduced BFR to 13. 3 ± 5. 8 % compared to controls (93. 3 ± 4. 2 %, Experiment 3). Supplementation with estradioi- 1 7 (3 (1 nM) {{in the presence of}} 15 pg/mI <b>Nafoxidine</b> significantly (p< 0. 01) improved BFR to 57. 2 ± 8. 9 %. Higher concentrations of estradiol- 1 7 f 3 (100 nM, 100 pM) did not further enhance BFR. The stimulatory effects of estradiol- 1 7 (3 were specific since the BFR remained low in the presence of 100 nM progesterone (10. 0 ± 4. 5 %) or 100 nM cortisol (3. 3 ± 3. 3 %). Addition of 5 % estradiol- 1 713 -antiserum to the culture medium (Experiment 4) significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced BRF to 51. 9 ± 6. 7 % compared to controls (93. 1 ± 2. 2 %). Supplementation with 100 pM es-tradiol- 1 7 (3 in the presence of 5 % estradioi- 1 7 (3 antiserum significantly (p< 0. 05) improved BFR (79. 7 ± 4. 7 %). It is concluded that estradioi- 1 7 (3 is an essential factor for the transformation of the compacted morula to the cavi-tated biastocyst stage. Our observations suggest that this effect is mediated through specific binding sites for es-trogens...|$|E
40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonance}} biosensor {{technology was}} used to directly measure the binding interactions of small molecules to the ligand-binding domain of human estrogen receptor. In a screening mode, specific ligands of the receptor were easily discerned from nonligands. In a high-resolution mode, the association and dissociation phase binding responses were shown to be reproducible and could be fit globally to a simple interaction model to extract reaction rate constants. On average, antagonist ligands (such as tamoxifen and <b>nafoxidine)</b> were observed to bind to the receptor with association rates that were 500 -fold slower than agonists (such as estriol and β-estradiol). This {{finding is consistent with}} these antagonists binding to an altered conformation of the receptor. The biosensor assay also could identify subtle differences in how the same ligand interacted with two different isoforms of the receptor (α and β). The biosensor's ability to determine kinetic rate constants for small molecule/protein interactions provides unique opportunities to understand the mechanisms associated with complex formation as well as new information to drive the optimization of drug candidates...|$|E
40|$|Because men and {{pregnant}} women show increased susceptibility to extrapulmonary dissemination of coccidioidomycosis, studies {{were conducted to}} determine the direct effect of human sex hormones and related compounds on the growth and maturation of Coccidioides immitis in vitro. 17 beta-Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were highly stimulatory for the parasitic phase of C. immitis growth whereas cholesterol, ergosterol, and 17 alpha-estradiol (a physiologically inactive stereoisomer of 17 beta-estradiol) lacked such effects. Rates of spherule maturation and endospore release were accelerated, in a dose-dependent fashion, by concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol occurring in normal women, with the most striking effects seen at levels encountered in advanced pregnancy. A stimulatory effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the saprobic phase of fungal growth was also detected. The nonsteroidal "antiestrogens" tamoxifen and <b>nafoxidine</b> had either stimulatory or inhibitory effects, depending on fungal strain and experimental conditions. Diverse strains of Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida sp, and Petriellidium boydii were unaffected by hormones that had distinct effects on C. immitis. These studies suggest that direct stimulation of C. immitis by human sex hormones may help to account for sex- and pregnancy-related predisposition to dissemination of coccidioidomycosis...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{is present}} that {{alpha-fetoprotein}} (AFP), a serum globulin, accounts mainly, if not entirely, {{for the high}} estrogen-binding properties of uterine cytosols from immature rats. By the use of specific immunoadsorbents to AFP and by competitive assays with unlabeled steroids and pure AFP, it has been demonstrated that in hypotonic cytosols AFP is present partly as free protein with a sedimentation coefficient of about 4 - 5 S and partly in association with some intracellular constituent(s) to form an 8 S estrogen-binding entity. The AFP leads to 8 S transformation results {{in a loss of}} antigenic reactivity to antibodies against AFP and a significant change in binding specificity. This change in binding specificity is manifested by an increase in binding affinity for estradiol, estriol, diethylstillbestrol, and <b>nafoxidine</b> (a non-steroidal anti-estrogen), and by a concomitant decrease in estrone binding. Both the antigenic and binding properties of native AFP are recovered after dissociation of the 8 S complex in 0. 4 M KC 1. An AFP-mediated mechanism of early intracellular events associated with estrogen entry in target cells is suggested and discussed with regard to current views on steroid action...|$|E
