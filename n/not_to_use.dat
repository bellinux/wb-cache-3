5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E

5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E

5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability.

It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself.
