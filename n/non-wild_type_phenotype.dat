40|$|Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli {{have become}} a major public health concern to both humans and animal health. While the {{frequency}} of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinical E. coli is monitored regularly in human medicine, current frequency of AMR in companion animals remains unknown in Australia. In this study we conducted antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and where possible, determined potential risk factors for MDR infection among 883 clinical Escherichia coli isolated from dogs (n = 514), cats (n = 341) and horses (n = 28). AST was undertaken for 15 antimicrobial agents according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and interpreted using epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) as well as CLSI veterinary and human clinical breakpoints. The AST revealed complete absence of resistance to carbapenems while resistance to amikacin was observed at a low level in isolates from dogs (1. 6 %) and cats (1. 5 %) compared to horses (10. 7 %). Among dog isolates, resistance to fluoroquinolones ranged from 9. 1 %– 9. 3 % whereas among cat isolates, it ranged from 3. 2 %– 5 %. Among dog isolates, the proportion showing a 3 rd generation cephalosporin (3 GC) <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> <b>phenotype</b> was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI, n = 122) isolates (17. 2 %– 20. 5 %) compared to urinary tract infection (UTI, n = 392) isolates (9. 9 %– 10. 2 %). The frequency of multidrug resistance was 18. 1 %, 11. 7 % and 42. 9 % in dog, cat and horse isolates, respectively. Risk factor analysis revealed that MDR E. coli isolated from UTI were positively associated with chronicity of infection and previous antimicrobial treatment. Dogs and cats with chronic UTI that had been previously treated with antimicrobials were eight times and six {{times more likely to}} be infected with MDR E. coli compared to dogs and cats with non-chronic UTI, and no history of antimicrobial treatment, respectively. This study revealed that pre-existing disease condition and prior antimicrobial use were the major risks associated with UTI with MDR E. coli in companion animals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEffects of {{danofloxacin}} or consecutive fluoroquinolone and macrolide treatments {{on resistance}} development in have remained uncharacterised. Therefore we analysed {{the development of}} resistance in porcine before and after danofloxacin and tylosin treatments at a farrowing farm. Danofloxacin-treated (= 12, group A) and control pigs (= 15, group B) were subsequently treated with tylosin and sampled longitudinally. were isolated and susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin were assessed, isolates were genotyped with PFGE and resistance-related mutations were identified. Isolates from the danofloxacin-treated pigs had more frequently <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> MICs (above the epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF)) for ciprofloxacin (< 0. 001) and erythromycin (< 0. 05) than those isolated before danofloxacin or those from the controls. Subsequent tylosin treatment increased proportion of isolates with <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> MICs for erythromycin in both group A and B (< 0. 01) and, interestingly, proportion of isolates with <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> MICs for ciprofloxacin in group B (< 0. 001) with high MICs (128 μg/ml). PFGE analysis revealed treatments selecting predominant genotypes with variable resistance patterns and decreasing initial diversity of genotypes. The most common genotype had mainly high MICs for ciprofloxacin among danofloxacin-treated pigs but wild type MICs (below the ECOFF) among the controls housed in the same pens. This suggests that the <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> isolate was rarely transmitted or outcompeting wild type genotype in the control pigs without selection pressure. Isolates exhibiting <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> MICs for ciprofloxacin harboured the C 257 T (Thr- 86 -Ile) mutation in the gene. In conclusion, a high dose of danofloxacin used at the farm did not prevent emergence of isolates with high MICs for ciprofloxacin. After subsequent tylosin treatment isolates had even higher MICs for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin than before the treatment. Therefore, controlled use of antimicrobials in food animal production is essential...|$|R

This study describes the prevalence and molecular characteristics of E. coli with <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> susceptibility to cefotaxime in veal calves at slaughter. Methods - Faecal samples from 100 herds, 10 individual animals per herd, were screened for E. coli with <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> susceptibility for cefotaxime. Molecular characterization of ESBL/AmpC genes and plasmids was performed on one isolate per herd by microarray, PCR and sequence analysis.

40|$|Antimicrobial drugs play a {{key role}} in {{managing}} the health of fish in aquaculture. However, public health concerns about antimicrobial resistance [...] the ability of microorganisms to resist standard antimicrobial treatments [...] include the potential for antimicrobial use in aquaculture to select for resistant bacteria in and around fish farms. Recent approval of two antimicrobial drugs to treat farmed freshwater fish with infections caused by the aquatic bacteria Flavobacterium columnare and F. psychrophilum created an important need for research to monitor these bacteria for changes in antimicrobial susceptibility and to decide when the antimicrobials should be used. Therefore three studies were conducted. The initial study optimized methods for broth microdilution testing F. columnare and F. psychrophilum and conducted a multi-laboratory standardization trial that set quality control parameters for nine antimicrobials commonly used in aquaculture, thus creating the first standardized testing method. In the second study, we constructed frequency distributions using minimal inhibitory concentrations determined from testing 134 F. columnare with the standardized method. Analysis of the distributions determined the drug concentration [...] called an epidemiological cutoff value (ECV) [...] which separated the wild type isolates with no acquired or selected resistance from the <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> isolates. The ECV indicated 22 of 134 isolates had decreased their susceptibility to at least 1 antimicrobial. In addition, we developed a laboratory disease model with juvenile channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. We compared the virulence of three F. columnare isolates with wild type or three isolates with <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> florfenicol susceptibility using the model. We found that five isolates had similar high level virulence and were not affected by differences in florfenicol susceptibility. Finally, we studied if decreased <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> florfenicol susceptibility affected the ability of the approved florfenicol treatment to control F. columnare infections. The approved treatment significantly reduced catfish mortality following exposure to an isolate with typical wild type florfenicol susceptibility but mortality was not reduced following exposure to an isolate with <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> susceptibility. Taken together, these studies provide methods and research needed to monitor F. columnare for changes in antimicrobial susceptibility and to rationally use florfenicol to control F. columnare infections...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Initial and {{secondary}} ischaemia are important determinants of outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Cerebral ischaemia {{is a potent}} stimulus for expression of genes that may influence recovery. We investigated whether functional polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (APOE), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-A), interleukin- 1 A (IL- 1 A), interleukin- 1 B (IL- 1 B), and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) genes are related with outcome after aneurysmal SAH. Methods Genotyping of the polymorphisms was performed in a consecutive series of 167 patients with aneurysmal SAH. The risk of a poor outcome was analysed with logistic regression with adjustment for prognostic factors for outcome after SAH, using the homozygotes for the wild type alleles as a reference. Results Patients carrying any IGF- 1 <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> allele had a lower risk of a poor outcome (OR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 1. 0), while carriers of the TNF-A <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> allele had a higher risk (OR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 4). We could not demonstrate an association with outcome for APOE (APOE epsilon 4 OR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 1 - 1. 2; APOE epsilon 2 OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 2. 4), IL- 1 A (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI 0. 8 - 4. 0), IL- 1 B (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 3 - 1. 5) and IL- 6 (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 3 - 1. 8) polymorphisms. Conclusions Variation in some genes that are expressed after cerebral ischaemia may partly explain the large differences in outcome between patients with aneurysmal SAH. SAH patients homozygote for the IGF- 1 wild type allele or carriers of the TNF-A <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> allele have {{a higher risk of}} poor outcome.

40|$|To {{gain more}} {{information}} on the genetic basis of the rapid {{increase in the number of}} isolates exhibiting <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) for cefotaxime observed since 2003, beta-lactamase genes of 22 Salmonella enterica and 22 Escherichia coli isolates from broilers in 2006 showing this phenotype were characterized by miniaturized micro-array, PCR and DNA-sequencing. Presence and size of plasmids were determined by S 1 -digest pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and further characterized by PCR-based replicon typing. Transfer of resistance plasmids was tested by conjugation and transformation experiments. To link resistance genes and plasmid type, Southern blot hybridization experiments were conducted. In 42 isolates, five (blaCTX-M- 1, blaCTX-M- 2, blaTEM- 20, blaTEM- 52, blaSHV- 2) different extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -genes and two (blaACC- 1, blaCMY- 2) AmpC-genes were present. Three of the detected ESBL-genes (blaCTX-M- 1, blaTEM- 52 and blaCTX-M- 2) were located on similar types of plasmids (IncI 1 and IncHI 2 /P) in both E. coli and Salmonella. Two other detected ESBL- and AmpC-genes blaSHV- 2 and blaCMY- 2 respectively (on IncK plasmids), were only found in E. coli, whereas the AmpC-gene blaACC- 1 (on non-typable plasmids), and the ESBL-gene blaTEM- 20 (on IncI 1 plasmids), were only detected in Salmonella. In two isolates, no ESBL- or AmpC-gene could be detected through these methods. The increase in the number of E. coli and S. enterica isolates from the gastro-intestinal tract of broilers exhibiting <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> MICs for cefotaxime is mainly due to an increase in IncI 1 plasmids containing blaCTX-M- 1. The reason for the successful spread of this plasmid type in these species is not yet understood...|$|R
40|$|The susceptibilities of 106 {{strains of}} Aeromonas salmonicida to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SFT) were {{determined}} in two laboratories using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's M 42 -A disc diffusion protocols. The data {{generated by the}} use of discs containing 25 μg SFT (SFT 25) allowed the strains to be placed into two groups. Strains in one group (17 strains) generated no inhibition zones and the zones obtained from the other 89 strains were distributed over a wide range but showed no natural division into separate sub-classes. A further investigation performed by one of the participating laboratories, of the susceptibility of 91 of these 106 strains used discs containing 100 μg sulfmethoxazole (SFM 100) and 5 μg trimethoprim (TMP 5). Application of normalised resistance interpretation to these data allowed the estimation of epidemiological cut-off values for WT strains of ≥ 9 mm for SFM 100 and ≥ 21 mm for TMP 5. This investigation demonstrated the presence of three distinct phenotypic classes, one containing strains manifesting wild type susceptibility to both agents, another containing strains manifesting <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> susceptibility to both and a third containing strains manifesting wild type susceptibility with respect to TMP but <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> with respect to SFM. Analysis demonstrated the inability of SFT 25 discs to generate data that allowed the separate identification of strains that were fully susceptible to both TMP and SFM from those that were fully susceptible to TMP but were not fully susceptible to SFM. It is recommended that, in investigation of the susceptibility to potentiated sulphonamides of isolates from diseased fish, separate discs, containing the individual components of the mixture, should be employed.

40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is {{a severe}} colitis of pigs caused by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (Harris, 1999). The control of SD is still mainly {{based on the}} use of few antimicrobials, such as pleuromutilins, macrolides and lincosamides. However {{more than half of the}} Italian isolates of B. hyodysenteriaewere shown to be resistant to pleuromutilins, with a significant increasing trend in the last 10 years (Rugna, 2015). The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae versus tiamulin, valnemulin, doxycycline, aivlosin, lincomycin and tylosin. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 206 B. hyodysenteriae isolates from Italian herds from 2005 - 2013 was evaluated by a broth microdilution test. The MIC values were interpreted using clinical breakpoints (Ronne and Szancer, 1990) and epidemiological cut-offs (Pringle, 2012). The vast majority of the isolates (above 80 %, approximately) showed MIC values above the epidemiological cut offs, indicating a previous exposure to antimicrobials. Moreover, most isolates (98 %) were clinically resistant to tylosin, about half (56 %) to lincomycin and roughly a third (34 %) to tiamulin. Furthermore, a significant increase of non-susceptible isolates (resistant or intermediate) was seen for both lincomycin and tiamulin from 2008 to 2013. A non-negligible proportion of isolates (54 %) showed no susceptibility to tylosin, lincomycin and tiamulin, with a significant increase from 2010 to 2013 compared to 2008. Finally, a correlation was found between the <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> status of isolates to aivlosin and tylosin (p= 0. 025) and between <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> status of isolates to tylosin and lincomycin (p= 0. 016). In conclusion, the decreased susceptibility of Italian isolates of B. hyodysenteriae is not restricted to pleuromutilins, but involves most of the antibiotics used for the control of SD. An increase of multiresistant isolates was recorded in the last eight years, posing a significant threat to pig industry...|$|R
40|$|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a {{plasma protein}} that plays a {{prominent}} role in lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport. The gene is polymorphic: three alleles, ε 2, ε 3, and ε 4 code for three different protein isoforms, E 2, E 3, and E 4 respectively, each of which has different genetic implications. Carriers of ε 2 and ε 4 alleles have shown greater susceptibility to diseases such as lipid metabolism problems, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Although ε 4 is the ancestral form of the gene, the most common allele in the human population currently is the ε 3 allele. The three isoforms of ApoE generally occur in all populations at different frequencies. However, the frequencies of the various alleles have not been examined in the Midwest. The purpose of this project was to determine if a correlation existed between frequencies of ApoE mutation and heritage in Midwest individuals by using real-time PCR. It was hypothesized that this method could be an alternative and cost effective method to sequence an individual’s genome for personalized healthcare purposes. In 2000, Dr. Vann and her research assistants collected saliva samples from approximately 300 anonymous volunteers participating in the UniverCity fair hosted by Ball State University. The samples were catalogued in an Excel database with their corresponding information (gender, self- reported lineage). From this database, 50 samples were randomly selected for this study and the DNA was screened by real-time PCR for isoforms of ApoE. A handful of individuals with altered alleles were identified. The specific number of each isoform and the genotype of each individual were determined. Only one of the 50 individuals resulted in a <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> haplotype. A confirmatory melt curve analysis of this major heritage group A individual resulted in a homozygous E 4 genotype. Unfortunately, a correlation between frequencies of ApoE mutation and heritage in Midwest individuals could not be inferred based on one differing individual. Thus, we did not have sufficient <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> haplotypes to permit us to amplify the variable regions of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA for sequencing. Those sequences could have been aligned with the Cambridge Reference Sequence (Mitomap 2006) to determine maternal lineage or haplotype, which could then be correlated with self-reported lineage, and the presence of specific isoforms of ApoE.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} wild-type minimum {{inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) distributions for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as the background data for defining susceptibility breakpoints are limited. METHODS: We determined wild-type MIC distributions of M. tuberculosis using a 96 -stick replicator in Middlebrook 7 H 10 (7 H 10) medium for ethionamide (ETH), prothionamide, thiacetazone, cycloserine, rifabutin (RFB), clofazimine and linezolid in consecutive susceptible clinical isolates (n = 78). RESULTS: Tentative epidemiological wild-type cut-offs (ECOFF) were determined for all investigated drugs where World Health Organization recommended critical concentrations for 7 H 10 are lacking, except for ETH. As the ECOFF was {{closely related to the}} non-wild-type strains for ETH and thiacetazone, the use of an intermediary (1) category in drug susceptibility testing could increase reproducibility. The cross-resistance between ETH and isoniazid was 21 %. Applying 0. 5 mg/l as a breakpoint for RFB classified two <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> and rpoB mutated isolates as susceptible for RFB and resistant against rifampicin. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that wild-type MIC distributions should be used as a tool to define clinical breakpoints against second-line drugs.

The epidemiological cutoff value (ECOFF) separating wild-type susceptible strains from non-wild-type strains is an important but rarely used tool for indicating susceptibility breakpoints against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this study, we established wild-type MIC distributions on Middlebrook 7 H 10 medium for amikacin, kanamycin, streptomycin, capreomycin, and viomycin using 90 consecutive clinical isolates and 21 resistant strains. Overall, the MIC variation between and within runs did not exceed +/- 1 MIC dilution step, and validation of MIC values in Bactec 960 MGIT demonstrated good agreement. Tentative ECOFFs defining the wild type were established for all investigated drugs, including amikacin and viomycin, which currently lack susceptibility breakpoints for 7 H 10. Five out of seven amikacin-and kanamycin-resistant isolates were classified as susceptible to capreomycin according to the current critical concentration (10 mg/liter) but were <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> according to the ECOFF (4 mg/liter), suggesting that the critical concentration may be too high. All amikacin- and kanamycin-resistant isolates were clearly below the ECOFF for viomycin, and two of them were below the ECOFF for streptomycin, indicating that these two drugs may be considered for treatment of amikacin-resistant strains. Pharmacodynamic indices (peak serum concentration [C-max]/MIC) were more favorable for amikacin and viomycin compared to kanamycin and capreomycin.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antimicrobials (nine classes) were determined on 405 S. suis isolates categorised by sampling period and disease association to assess changes in resistance over time and association with disease. First, isolates were characterized as resistant or susceptible using published clinical breakpoints. Second, epidemiological cut-offs (ECOFF) were derived from MIC values, and isolates classified as wild type (WT) below the ECOFF and <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> (NWT) above the ECOFF. Finally, isolate subsets were analysed for shifts in MIC distribution. NCC isolates were more resistant than CC isolates to cephalosporins, penams, pleuromutilins, potentiated sulphonamides and tetracyclines in both study periods. Resistance levels among CC isolates increased in 2013 - 2014 relative to 2009 - 2011 for antimicrobials including aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, pleuromutilins, potentiated sulphonamides and tetracyclines. The prevalence of isolates categorised as NWT for five or more classes of antimicrobials was greater among NCC than CC isolates for both time periods, and increased with time. This study used standardised methods to identify significant shifts in antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of S. suis isolated from pigs in England, not only over time but also between isolates from known clinical cases or disease-free pigs...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the reading frame, Crick also used suppressor mutations to determine codon size. It was found that while one and two base insertions/deletions of the same sign resulted in a mutant phenotype, deleting or inserting three bases could give a wild <b>type</b> <b>phenotype.</b> From these results {{it was concluded that}} an inserted or deleted triplet does not disturb the reading frame and the genetic code is in fact a triplet.|$|R
50|$|Complementation is the {{phenomenon}} which enables {{generation of the}} wild <b>type</b> <b>phenotype</b> when organisms carrying recessive mutations in different genes are crossed. Thus if an organism has one functional copy of the gene, then this functional copy is capable of complementing the mutated or the lost copy of the gene. In contrast, if both the copies of the gene are mutated or lost, then this will lead to allelic non-complementation (Figure 3) and thus manifestation of the phenotype.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{exceptions}} to these rules. Two non-allelic mutants may occasionally fail to complement (called [...] "non-allelic non-complementation" [...] or [...] "unlinked non-complementation"). This situation is rare and {{is dependent on}} the particular nature of the mutants being tested. For example, two mutations may be synthetically dominant negative. Another exception is transvection, in which the heterozygous combination of two alleles with mutations {{in different parts of the}} gene complement each other to rescue a wild <b>type</b> <b>phenotype.</b>|$|R
40|$|Quinolone {{resistance}} is studied and reported increasingly in isolates from humans, food-producing animals and companion animals. Resistance {{can be caused}} by chromosomal mutations in topoisomerase genes, plasmid-mediated resistance genes, and active transport through efflux pumps. Cross sectional data on quinolone resistance mechanisms in non-pathogenic bacteria from healthy veal calves is limited. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the prevalence and characteristics of quinolone resistance mechanisms in Escherichia coli isolates from veal calves, after more than 20 years of quinolone usage in veal calves. MIC values were determined for all isolates collected as part of a national surveillance program on antimicrobial resistance in commensal bacteria in food-producing animals in The Netherlands. From the strains collected from veal calves in 2007 (n = 175) all isolates with ciprofloxacin MIC = 0. 125 mg/L (n = 25) were selected for this study, and screened for the presence of known quinolone resistance determinants. In this selection only chromosomal mutations in the topoisomerase type II and IV genes were detected. The number of mutations found per isolate correlated with an increasing ciprofloxacin MIC. No plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were found. The contribution of efflux pumps varied from no contribution to a 16 -fold increase in susceptibility. No correlation was found with the presence of resistance genes of other antimicrobial classes, even though all quinolone <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> isolates were resistant to 3 or more classes of antibiotics other than quinolones. Over twenty years of quinolone usage in veal calves in The Netherlands did not result in a widespread occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance, limiting the transmission of quinolone resistance to clonal distributio...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Air {{pollution}} {{is associated with}} adverse human health, but mechanisms through which pollution exerts effects remain to be clarified. One suggested pathway is that pollution causes oxidative stress. If so, oxidative stress-related genotypes may modify the oxidative response defenses to pollution exposure. METHODS: We explored the potential pathway by examining whether an array of oxidative stress-related genes (twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs in nine genes) modified associations of pollutants (organic carbon (OC), ozone and sulfate) with urinary 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxygunosine (8 -OHdG), a biomarker of oxidative stress among the 320 aging men. We used a Multiple Testing Procedure in R modified by our team to identify {{the significance of the}} candidate genes adjusting for a priori covariates. RESULTS: We found that glutathione S-tranferase P 1 (GSTP 1, rs 1799811), M 1 and catalase (rs 2284367) and group-specific component (GC, rs 2282679, rs 1155563) significantly or marginally significantly modified effects of OC and/or sulfate with larger effects among those carrying the wild type of GSTP 1, catalase, <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> of GC and the non-null of GSTM 1. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms of oxidative stress-related genes modified effects of OC and/or sulfate on 8 -OHdG, suggesting that effects of OC or sulfate on 8 -OHdG and other endpoints may be through the oxidative stress pathway.

40|$|Copyright Â© 2016. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Whole genome {{sequencing}} (WGS) {{offers the potential}} to predict antimicrobial susceptibility from a single assay. The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) established a subcommittee to review the current development status of WGS for bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). The published evidence for using WGS {{as a tool to}} infer antimicrobial susceptibility accurately is currently either poor or non-existent and the evidence/knowledge base requires significant expansion. The primary comparators for assessing genotypic-phenotypic concordance from WGS data should be changed to epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) in order to improve differentiation of wild <b>type</b> from <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> isolates (harbouring an acquired resistance). Clinical breakpoints should be a secondary comparator. This assessment will reveal whether genetic predictions could also be used to guide clinical decision making. Internationally agreed principles and quality control (QC) metrics will facilitate early harmonization of analytical approaches and interpretative criteria for WGS-based predictive AST. Only datasets that pass agreed QC metrics should be used in AST predictions. Minimum performance standards should exist and comparative accuracies across different WGS laboratories and processes should be measured. In order to facilitate comparisons, a single public database of all known resistance loci should be established, regularly updated and strictly curated using minimum standards for the inclusion of resistance loci. For most bacterial species the major limitations to widespread adoption for WGS-based AST in clinical labs remain the current high-cost and limited speed of inferring antimicrobial susceptibility from WGS data as well as the dependency on prior culture since analysis directly on specimens remains challenging. For most bacterial species there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of WGS-inferred AST to guide clinical decision making. WGS-AST should be a funding priority if it is to become a rival to phenotypic AST. This report will be updated as the available evidence increases. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a validated protocol, using a novel, specifically formulated medium, to perform broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility assays of the salmonid bacterial pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for florfenicol and oxytetracycline against 58 P. salmonis isolates recovered from various outbreaks occurred in Chilean salmonid farms were determined using this protocol. Normalized resistance interpretation (NRI) analysis {{was applied to}} these data to calculate appropriate protocol-specific epidemiological cut-off values. These cut-off values allow the isolates to be categorized as either fully susceptible wild type (WT) members of this species, or as manifesting reduced susceptibility <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> (NWT). The distribution of MIC values of florfenicol was bimodal {{and the distribution of}} the normalized values for the putative WT observation had a standard deviation of 0. 896 log 2 μg mL- 1. This analysis calculated a cut-off value of ≤ 0. 25 μg mL- 1 and categorized 33 (56 %) of the isolates as manifesting reduced susceptibility to florfenicol. For the oxytetracycline MIC data the NRI analysis also treated the distribution as bimodal. The distribution of the normalized values for the putative WT observation had a standard deviation of 0. 951 log 2 μg mL- 1. This analysis gave a cut-off value of ≤ 0. 5 μg mL- 1 and categorized five isolates (9 %) as manifesting reduced susceptibility to oxytetracycline. The susceptibility testing protocol developed in this study was capable of generating MIC data from all the isolates tested. On the basis of the precision of the data it generated, and the degree of separation of values for WT and NWT it achieved, it is argued that this protocol has the performance characteristics necessary for it to be considered as a standard protocol...|$|R

40|$|Scrapie is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease occurring in goats and sheep. Several haplotypes of the prion protein increase resistance to scrapie infection and {{may be used in}} selective breeding to help eradicate scrapie. In this study, frequencies of the allelic variants of the PrP gene are determined for six goat breeds in the Netherlands. Overall frequencies in Dutch goats were determined from 768 brain tissue samples in 2005, 766 in 2008 and 300 in 2012, derived from random sampling for the national scrapie surveillance without knowledge of the breed. Breed specific frequencies were determined in the winter 2013 / 2014 by sampling 300 breeding animals from the main breeders of the different breeds. Detailed analysis of the scrapie-resistant K 222 haplotype was carried out in 2014 for 220 Dutch Toggenburger goats and in 2015 for 942 goats from the Saanen derived White Goat breed. Nine haplotypes were identified in the Dutch breeds. Frequencies for <b>non-wild</b> <b>type</b> haplotypes were generally low. Exception was the K 222 haplotype in the Dutch Toggenburger (29 %) and the S 146 haplotype in the Nubian and Boer breeds (respectively 7 and 31 %). The frequency of the K 222 haplotype in the Toggenburger was higher than for any other breed reported in literature, while for the White Goat breed it was with 3. 1 % similar to frequencies of other Saanen or Saanen derived breeds. Further evidence was found for the existence of two M 142 haplotypes, M 142 /S 240 and M 142 /P 240. Breeds vary in haplotype frequencies but frequencies of resistant genotypes are generally low and consequently selective breeding for scrapie resistance can only be slow but will benefit from animals identified in this study. The unexpectedly high frequency of the K 222 haplotype in the Dutch Toggenburger underlines the need for conservation of rare breeds in order to conserve genetic diversity rare or absent in other breeds. </p...|$|R
