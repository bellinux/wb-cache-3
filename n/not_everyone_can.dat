500|$|In the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe, {{there are}} people who are able to manipulate, or [...] "bend", the four elements: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Along with the four elements, there are four nations that {{correspond}} with each element. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> bend an element, and those that can can only bend one. However, the Avatar is a being able to manipulate all four elements as well as communicate with the spirits. The Avatar is also born into one nation, and after dying, is reincarnated into another nation following the pattern of Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. The series takes place 100 years after the Fire Nation declares war against all other nations and has killed off all airbenders in search of finding the Avatar, who has been reincarnated as an airbender named Aang. The Avatar, trapped in ice for 100 years, knows nothing of the war. The series starts with Aang being accidentally freed by Katara, a waterbender. The series then primarily follows the adventures of Aang and his companions, Sokka, Katara, and later Toph and Zuko, as he tries to master all four elements and defeat the Fire Nation. There is also a strong secondary focus on Zuko, the banished and disinherited crown prince of the Fire Nation. Zuko was scarred in a duel with his own father, the current Fire Lord, and is obsessed with trying to capture Aang to regain his father's favor and in doing so restoring his honor.|$|E

But when there are thousands of players all playing the same game, clearly <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> be the hero. This problem became obvious to some in the game EverQuest, where groups of players would compete and sometimes harass each other in order to get monsters in the same dungeon to drop valuable items, leading to several undesirable behaviors such as kill stealing, spawn camping, and ninja looting. In response—for instance by Richard Garriott in Tabula Rasa (2007)—developers began turning to instance dungeons as a means of reducing competition over limited resources, as well as preserving the gaming experience—though this mechanic has its own set of detractors.|$|E

30|$|It {{is to be}} {{expected}} that every program and course have their leaders, managers, owners, but this does <b>not</b> mean <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> do as they please. For instance, formal programs offered by HEI in Colombia must be framed within the qualification standards outlined by the National Ministry of Education (MINEDUCACION, 2003). Some other types of programs are framed by the authorizations granted by the academic authorities of the respective HEI. Courses, in turn, are part of the approved curriculum and the guidelines prepared by the National Ministry of Education (MINEDUCACION, 2012) for the design, production and implementation of virtual courses. Since this does not generate a normative context for the courses and programs in the bLearning modality, it is considered a good practice to have a curricular administration bLearning committee where the respective innovation is to be implemented. This committee focuses on the updating and adjustment of these types of programs and courses and operates as a mechanism for consultation and authorization if need be.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ability of}} {{entrepreneurs}} to innovate relates to innate traits, including extroversion and a proclivity for risk-taking. According to Joseph Schumpeter, {{the capabilities of}} innovating, introducing new technologies, increasing efficiency and productivity, or generating new products or services, are characteristic qualities of entrepreneurs. Also, many scholars maintain that entrepreneurship {{is a matter of}} genes, and that it is <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> who <b>can</b> be an entrepreneur. Some people may be able to use [...] "an innate ability" [...] or quasi-statistical sense to gauge public opinion and market demand for new products or services.

40|$|One robust {{finding in}} the social {{cognition}} literature is that people tend to think they are superior to others {{and more likely to}} encounter positive future events than others across a number of domains (Taylor and Brown, 1988). These types of belief have been described as illusory because, while it is possible that any one individual might be better than average, it is <b>not</b> possible that <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> be better than average. With respect to driving, it has been found that people tend to rate themselves as more skilful than average, safer than average (Groeger and Brown, 1989; Svenson, 1981), slower than average (Walton and Bathurst, 1998), and less likely to have an accident than average (McKenna, 1993).

It was launched in 1989. “One of my proudest accomplishments as AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer was our creation of the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute to recruit and train organizers,” he commented in 1995. The OI has trained and graduated thousands of union members, staffers, and students, who have gone on to help organize countless American workers into unions. It was emulated nine years later by the Trades Union Congress in Britain which created its own Organising Academy.|$|R

Interactive architecture suggest new modes of interacting and interfacing between users and their environments offering the potential for richer and more intuitive dialogues between users, each other and our wider environments. Harnessed in a sustainable platform like a supermarket, it can become a manageable grassroots solution that serves the civic, cultural and social needs of a community.

30|$|In Quick Fixes, policymakers {{scramble}} {{to balance the}} need for more flexible labour markets with the need to avoid more extreme income and wealth inequalities. Jobless growth is increasingly accepted as a facet of late-stage capitalism, and policymakers look to radical redistribution mechanism, including high wealth taxation to enable investment in livelihoods for all. In a world of digitally empowered but increasingly fragmented and polarised societies, implementation of new policy experiments centred in the concept of “universal basic income” is delayed until after 2025. Many young people in mature industrial economies are no longer interested in lifelong jobs so much as meaningful work, work-life cycle balance, and portfolio careers. As more and more entrepreneurs sell their commodities online from developing, emerging and advanced economies, policy makers are faced with a new challenge that <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> wants or <b>can</b> be an entrepreneur.

30|$|Drawing {{from the}} functionalist view of inequality, {{it does not}} matter that many African regions do not use some {{internet}} applications, content and services, if, {{at the end of the}} day, certain societies and (western) regions, or population benefit from the information and resources provided by those internet vendors. Functionalist theorists would argue in this case that what matters is <b>not</b> whether <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> access those internet services, but whether the world (although polarised to the West) benefits in general, while ignoring the countless number of others in the global population system (especially from the developing regions) not using those internet services. Therefore, the argument that the inequality attached to this particular division of benefits becomes justified and thus becomes the byproduct of a social order that constitutes the internet economy. Taking from the functionalist position on social order, the overwhelming evidence of internet inequality in this article focuses on how internet applications, contents, and services are accessible from certain locations but restricted for certain African regions. In this article, we argue that these kind of restrictions are perhaps a demonstration of a functionalist social structure in the internet ecosystem (cf. Witte and Mannon 2010). Although on a peripheral level, Witte and Mannon (2010) discuss how internet conglomerate Yahoo! focuses on sharing targeted contents that are aligned with the interests and needs of a privileged group of Internet users. This perhaps might also be an example of internet inequality: though open for the public, but targeted towards a particular group of people.|$|R
