5|$|Called by <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> {{different}} names and with varying words, melodies and purpose but common themes, the song's history reflects {{many of the}} evolutionary changes and cross-currents of American music. It begins early in the 19th century with a backwoods preacher who wrote hymns, persists through that century, manifests itself in a 1930s gospel blues recording done in a prison by a blind inmate convicted of murder, and sees use in the 1950s as a folk song, before attaining its realization by Jefferson Airplane. Several of these different variants of the song are still performed in the 21st century.|$|E
