5|$|According to the medievalist Katharine Keats-Rohan, Gervase {{was the son}} of Roger, who was the <b>nephew</b> of Hubert the queen's chamberlain. Other {{scholars}} are less sure that Gervase was Roger's son, and argue that Gervase was Hubert's <b>nephew.</b> Gervase was likely born around 1110.

5|$|Alexander was a <b>nephew</b> of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, {{probably}} {{the son of}} Roger's brother Humphrey.

Other relatives included Nigel, another <b>nephew</b> of Roger's; and Adelelm, later Treasurer of England, who was recorded as Roger's <b>nephew</b> but perhaps was his son.

Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, Richard FitzNeal, who later became Treasurer of England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had a <b>nephew</b> William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.|$|E
