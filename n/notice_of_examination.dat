The main finding during postmortem examination was a severe focally extensive pneumonia. Icterus and a chronic mastitis were also <b>noticed.</b> Histologic <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the lungs detected fibrinonecrotic pneumonia, with large number of oat cells and intralesional Gram-negative bacterial colonies. Samples from lung lesions were collected, and a pure growth of Escherichia fergusonii was obtained. E. fergusonii {{is a member of}} Enterobacteriaceae, related to Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. In veterinary medicine, E. fergusonii has been reported in calves and sheep with clinical cases suggestive of salmonellosis; in a horse and a goat with enteritis and septicemia; and in ostriches with fibrinonecrotic typhlitis. To our knowledge, this report represents the first description of E. fergusonii associated with an acute pneumonia in cattle...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination. The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination.

40|$|Education and {{examination}} are inseparable, and {{the importance}} <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> at any level cannot be overemphasized. It has remained a potent instrument for judgement of knowledge acquired. In recent times, the conduct <b>of</b> <b>examinations</b> has generated serious concern and discussions among stakeholders. The conduct <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> has been fraught with various dimensions <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> malpractices. Just like corruption, examination malpractice has permeated the entire educational system in Nigeria. Government functionaries, school authorities, invigilators, examiners, parents and students are all guilty of the iniquitous trend <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> malpractice and the consequent undermining and rubbishing <b>of</b> the <b>examination</b> process and examination bodies.
