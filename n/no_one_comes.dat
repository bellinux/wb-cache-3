2500|$|The Christian {{movement}} {{was referred to}} as 'The Way' (...) based upon the well known statement by Jesus: [...] "I am the way, the truth, and the life. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> to the Father except through Me." [...] Consequently, it appears in the Acts of the Apostles, , [...] and [...] ). Some English translations of the New Testament capitalize 'the Way' (e.g. the New King James Version and the English Standard Version), indicating that this was how 'the new religion seemed then to be designated' [...] whereas others treat the phrase as indicative - 'the way', 'that way' [...] or 'the way of the Lord'.

2500|$|... "Via, Veritas, Vita" [...] is a Latin phrase {{which means}} “The Way, The Truth, and The Life.” Chosen by the University as its motto, this phrase is {{attributed}} to Jesus Christ and {{is found in the}} Gospel of John chapter 14, verse 6, which reads “5Thomas said to him, [...] "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" [...] 6Jesus answered, [...] "I am the way and the truth and the life. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>comes</b> to the Father except through me. 7If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." [...] (New International Version) [...] The choice of the motto is firmly rooted in the University’s belief that religious instruction, particularly in the teachings of Jesus Christ, is essential to the moral development of every young person. [...] Incidentally, the motto has been adopted by the Province of Negros Oriental by incorporating it in its provincial seal.|$|E
