On March24, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket {{there was the}} least expensive of tickets to potential US targets, which included Chicago and Houston.

5|$|The {{aforementioned}} Baysdorfer provided Omaha {{with another}} invention by successfully flying an airship {{in the city}} in 1889. In 1929 a bond was passed that would construct the Omaha Municipal Airport in East Omaha. This was thought to embody the city's hope for the future; however, air travel did not become popular in Omaha until the 1960s.

The 747-400ERF entered service with Air France in October 2002, while the 747-400ER entered service with Qantas, its sole customer, in November 2002.

5|$|Trials {{conducted}} using a conventional, powered C-47, first conducting ordinary deadstick landings, then being towed by another C-47, {{indicated that the}} scheme was feasible. Therefore, a C-47-DL was taken in hand for conversion into a glider, which was given the designation XCG-17. The aircraft, formerly a <b>Northwest</b> <b>Airlines</b> DC-3 that had been impressed into military service {{at the start of}} World War II, was modified by the removal of the aircraft's engines; the nacelles, containing the landing gear, remained in place, covered with aerodynamically profiled hemispherical domes for streamlining, containing fixed weight to compensate for the removal of the engines. Other equipment, no longer necessary with the conversion to an unpowered configuration, was also removed to save weight; items removed included the aircraft's wiring and bulkheads, along with the navigator's and radio operator's positions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when <b>Northwest</b> <b>Airlines</b> placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E
