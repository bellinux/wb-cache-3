5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} by others that adrenergic <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> cerebral blood vessels bind norepinephrine more avidly than do <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> vessels outside the brain. This suggestion {{is supported by the}} present data which show that in the rat intraperitoneal reserpine depletes norepinephrine less readily from <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> cerebral blood vessels than from <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> extracerebral blood vessels. Alternate hypotheses to explain our data are contradicted by available evidence, except for the hypothesis of unequal distribution of reserpine between perivascular nerves in various locations. No evidence has been located to favor the latter hypothesis. The postulate of increased norepinephrine binding by <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> cerebral vessels not only explains the present data, but also can account for the surprisingly small responses of cerebral vessels to exogenous norepinephrine or to sympathetic stimulation.

5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, the {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell).

Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E

The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 World Championship {{began with}} O'Sullivan {{defeating}} Dave Harold 10–4, {{followed by a}} struggle through to a 13–10 win in his second-round match against Welshman Ryan Day. A similar quarter-final match ensued against Mark Williams. O'Sullivan led 10–6 going into the final session. A fightback by Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames; but O'Sullivan held his <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> take the match 13–11, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi–finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8–8 {{at the end of}} the second session. Cue-tip problems, which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event, recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing the tip of his cue. This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip the cue, before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made. The incident drew criticism from his opponent, and from Steve Davis and John Parrott. Dott then took all eight frames of the third session, leaving himself one frame away from his second final in three years. The final session saw O'Sullivan stage a minor fightback, taking three frames in a row, before a mistake let Dott back in for an eventual clearance on the black. After Dott's win, O'Sullivan gave his cue and case to a boy in the crowd. A BBC report claimed he had used as many as 21 different tips during the fortnight; O'Sullivan later stated that he had used seven tips before arriving in Sheffield, and a further eight during the week, and that he would return next season with a new cue. O'Sullivan's decision not to enter the Malta Cup cost him the number-one rank for the following season.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations of}} the three in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned with {{taking care of his}} soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would be out of the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> go through with it.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic <b>Nerve</b> <b>to</b> build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
