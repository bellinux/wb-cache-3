5|$|Bangui {{serves as}} an administrative, trade, and {{commercial}} centre. During the Second World War the country became wealthier as exports of rubber, cotton, coffee, uranium and diamonds increased.

40|$|The <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> of sub-state <b>national</b> {{societies}} {{are divided into}} two or three competing currents. Thus, <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> tend to bifurcate into independentists and autonomists, or at times, trifurcate into independentists, autonomists, and federalists. These internal currents within <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> tend to vary over time, experiencing moments of foundation, growth, development, and decay. Both the Catalan and Quebecois <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> experienced the foundation and growth of new political orientations within the institutional component of these <b>national</b> <b>movements.</b> I compare the process {{that led to the}} founding of the ADQ (autonomism) in Quebec in 1994, with the process that culminated in the transformation and de facto refounding of ERC (independentism) in Catalonia during 1986 - 89. Using the cases of two nationalist parties in two different <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> that have successfully established new political orientations, we will explore the political origins of this form of temporal variation within <b>national</b> <b>movements.</b> My outcome variable is the “tipping point” at which these nationalist political parties get established. This “tipping point” was reached through a temporal sequence that evolved in four phases, which can be conceptualized as: the pre-embryonic period phase, the embryonic period phase (in Catalonia from 1975 to 1981 and in Quebec from 1982 to 1992), the impulse phase, and the formation and founding phase. In each of these phases, a key variable was involved: the existence of a preexistent ideology, the occurrence of a central state constitutional moment, an impulse from the sphere of sociological nationalism, and the consolidation of a new leadership nucleus...|$|R

5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung {{up across the}} country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions.

5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} other parties abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian <b>national</b> <b>movement,</b> which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E
5|$|The city {{started to}} lose its {{importance}} under the reign of Maria Theresa's son Joseph II, especially after the crown jewels were taken to Vienna in 1783 {{in an attempt to}} strengthen the union between Austria and Hungary.

The first newspapers in Hungarian and Slovak were published here: Magyar hírmondó in 1780, and Presspurske Nowiny in 1783.

40|$|The {{paper is}} an {{interpretation}} of the theory of <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> of "small Nations" formulated by the Czech historian Miroslav Hroch in his book Social Preconditions of National Revival in Europe and later writings. In his interest for Hroch’s typology of <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> the author was motivated by the idea to explore its applicability in understanding the process of emergence of Serbian and other South Slavic (Balkan) nations. Since Hroch’s writings are virtually unknown in domestic academic literature, {{in the first part of}} the paper the basic theoretical assumptions and the results of his comparative study of emergence, developmental dynamics and structure of "national revivals" of non-dominant ethnic groups or European "small nations" are presented. Next, in the second part of the paper Hroch’s typology of <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> is described in more detail, with special attention paid to his characterization of the "insurgent" or "Balkan" type of these movements. The closing part of the paper is devoted to Hroch’s comparison of old and new (postcommunist) <b>national</b> <b>movements,</b> where the use of Hroch’s historical approach in understanding the phenomenon of "postcommunist nationalism" is exposed to critical consideration...|$|R

Nevertheless, distinct Welsh groups and individuals rose to prominence and were vocal in the rise of suffrage in Wales and the rest of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} one-party Socialist federal {{unit of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was ruled by the Communists and enjoyed a degree of {{autonomy}} within the Yugoslav federation. In 1967, a group of Croatian authors and linguists published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language, demanding greater autonomy for the Croatian language. The declaration contributed to a <b>national</b> <b>movement</b> seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E

The revolutions of 1848 also revealed that the German liberals, who were opposed to Habsburg absolutism, were equally hostile to Czech national aspirations. It had become clear that the Czech <b>national</b> <b>movements</b> had to contend not only with Habsburg absolutism but also with increasingly virulent German nationalism.|$|R
5|$|Although {{hesitant}} {{at first}} to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah {{played an important role}} in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> (LNM). The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders. Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son of former President Camille Chamoun.|$|E
5|$|Central Province is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} <b>national</b> <b>movement</b> of Zambia. The United National Independence Party (UNIP) was founded in Kabwe by Kenneth Kaunda, who later became the first President of Zambia and remained in office from 1964 to 1991. The provincial capital is Kabwe, home of the Mulungushi Rock of Authority. This is a historic site, an isolated flat-topped hill, where in 1960, UNIP met for the first time, away from the eye of the colonial administration. It is still used for political gatherings, but the open air assemblies have been replaced by a conference centre built nearby at Mulungushi University. Mulungushi is the name of a river in the province and many historical policies, buildings and organizations are named after it. The 1968 Mulungushi Declaration proclaimed the country as a socialist nation. Mulungushi Hall in the capital is the venue for most international conventions. The city of Kapiri Mposhi was a historic site during the post-colonial era fight against White minorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Zaprešić {{railway station}} was a sight of two anti-Hungarian demonstrations caused by {{installing}} of panes with Hungarian inscriptions on railway objects across Croatia. The demonstrations {{were part of}} a wider <b>national</b> <b>movement</b> that swept the country at a time. In both occasions the demonstrations turned into a scuffle with local gendarmes which ended up with several peasants killed and dozens of locals arrested. Peasants that were killed or injuerd by the gendarmes are traditionally celebrated as a heroes and national martyrs. In their honour, two separate memorial boards were placed on the building of Zaprešić railway station in 1928. and 2003. After the First World War, the oldest meat industry in Croatia, the Industrija mesnih proizvoda, was founded.|$|E
