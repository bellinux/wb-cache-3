25|$|In 1911, Starewicz {{moved to}} Moscow and began {{work with the}} film company of Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. There he made two dozen films, most of them puppet {{animations}} using dead animals. Of these, The Beautiful Leukanida (premiere - 1912), first puppet film with a plot inspired {{in the story of}} Agamenon and Menelas, earned international acclaim (one British reviewer was tricked into thinking the stars were live trained insects), while The Grasshopper and the Ant (1911) got Starewicz decorated by the czar. But the best-known film of this period, was Mest' kinematograficheskogo operatora (Revenge of the Kinematograph Cameraman, aka The Cameraman's Revenge) (1912), a cynical work about infidelity and jealousy among the insects. Some of the films made for Khanzhonkov feature live-action/animation interaction. In some cases, the live action consisted of footage of Starewicz's daughter Irina. Particularly worthy of note is Starevich's 41-minute 1913 film The <b>Night</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> an adaptation of the Nikolai Gogol story of the same name. The 1913 film Terrible Vengeance won the Gold Medal at an international festival in Milan in 1914, being just one of five films which won awards among 1005 contestants.|$|E

500|$|Serbian ethnologist Petar Vlahović has {{proposed}} that the noun badnjak and the related adjective badnji (attributive [...] "Christmas Eve") are derived from {{the root of the}} verb bdeti ("to be awake"), referring to a custom of staying awake through the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas</b> Day.

2500|$|Very Serious Paper Cuts, {{a series}} of poems created using cut-up {{technique}} to create new poetry by cutting up and rearranging the pages of well-known books.

Other poems in this series have included The Arabian <b>Nights</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> Romeo and Dracula and Juliet, and variations on Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven. These poems are then collected into books, with some books distributed by secretly placing on the shelves of libraries and bookstores, in what Millikin calls [...] "reverse shoplifting." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{published}} synopsis in The Nickelodeon {{reads as}} follows, [...] "The <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> Alice, {{a child of}} wealth, after going through the usual form of hanging up her stocking, is put to bed by her maid. Alice falls asleep and dreams. Enter Santa Claus and Gnomes who tell Alice to follow her and they will show her part of their Funnyland. Alice follows the little people under the special protection of a policeman two foot high. The little party are seen trotting through beautiful glens and dales until they reach Funnyland. Santa Claus tells {{her that if she}} is a good girl all the animals and toys here are hers; as Alice touches each one they come to life. The teddy bear steps out to dance with Alice. As Alice removes the cover from Doll's box the doll dances out, a little king gives a magical entertainment, a clown is very active and all the animals and dolls do some interesting act much to the surprise and delight of little Alice. At last, tired out, Alice falls asleep reclining upon the shoulders of Teddy bear. Then we see her again back in her own little bed. It is now Christmas morning. Her maid awakens and dresses her for the great event, takes her to the drawing room where she is welcomed by her parents to find that her dream has come true." [...] Originally the film was billed as being released for December 19, 1910 and then it was later claimed to be December 26, 1910. This release was attributed in an issue of The Nickelodeon. However, the film was not released on December 19 because an advertisement in Moving Picture World in January 1911 said that the release would be delayed for a [...] "few days". It is unknown, and unlikely, if the film actually was released because no other publications, ads or materials surrounding the Gnome Motion Picture Company followed.|$|E

50|$|Blue Christmas, {{also called}} the Longest Night in the Western Christian tradition, is {{a day in the}} Advent season marking the longest night of the year. On this day, some churches hold a church service that honours people who have lost loved ones in that year. The Holy Eucharist is {{traditionally}} a part of the service of worship on this day. Some churches hold a service of worship on the longest night of the year, which falls on or about December 21st, the Winter Solstice. There is an interesting convergence for this day as it is also the traditional feast day for Saint Thomas the Apostle. This linkage invites making some connections between Thomas's struggle to believe the tale of Jesus' resurrection, the long <b>nights</b> just <b>before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> and the struggle with darkness and grief faced by those living with loss.|$|R
