5000|$|The {{system was}} later {{extended}} to cover larger ranges {{and some of}} its practical shortcomings were addressed by the Austrian scientist Josef Maria Eder (1855-1944) and Flemish-born botanist [...] (1896-1960), (who, in 1919/1920, jointly developed their Eder-Hecht <b>neutral</b> <b>wedge</b> sensitometer measuring emulsion speeds in Eder-Hecht grades). Still, it remained difficult for manufactures to reliably determine film speeds, often only by comparing with competing products, so that an increasing number of modified semi-Scheiner-based systems started to spread, which no longer followed Scheiner's original procedures and thereby defeated the idea of comparability.|$|E
5000|$|Eder {{was born}} in Krems an der Donau in 1855. He studied chemistry, physics and {{mathematics}} at the Vienna University of Technology and at the University of Vienna. In 1876, he received his PhD and in 1879, after his habilitation, became lecturer at the Vienna University of Technology. His research then {{was focused on the}} chemistry of photography. After spending some time at the Staatliche Gewerbeschule Vienna, he became lecturer at the Höhere Gewerbeschule Vienna. This change improved his possibilities for doing research. In the following years, Eder developed sensitized gelatin silver process. Orthochromatic photographic plates, in combination with a color filter counter-acting the plates' inhomogeneous sensitivity to light of different wavelengths, yielded black and white images showing all colors of the light in their true brightness. Eder was a professor at the Vienna University of Technology from 1892 to 1925. Eder tried to implement science methods into the development of photographic processes. In particular, he used spectroscopy methods and invented several new instruments including the [...] "Eder-Hecht <b>neutral</b> <b>wedge</b> photometer" [...] (with [...] (1896-1960)). His another invention was the [...] "mercury oxalate photometer" [...] which was a chemical photometer to measure the intensity of UV radiation. After the effect of X-rays on photographic material was published, Eder did research to improve the sensitivity of photographic material to X-rays. By 1884, Eder started writing his Extensive Handbook of Photography, which is still available as reprint. He was awarded the Lieben Prize in 1895 and {{became a member of the}} Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1930. Eder founded the Institute for Photography and Reproduction Techniques (today the :de:Höhere Graphische Bundes- Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt).|$|E
30|$|The focal dome {{osteotomy}} is an osteotomy {{created with}} {{the centre of}} the dome coincident to the CORA (centre of rotation angulation) derived from deformity calculations. The concavity of the dome faces proximally and the osteotomy creates a large bone interface. Incisions can be performed midline longitudinal or percutaneously. The division is through a percutaneous osteotomy or with a Gigli saw. A fibular osteotomy and fixation of the tibia with an external fixator is usually done. In order to tighten the lateral collateral ligament, a distal transport of the fibula can be performed with the focal dome osteotomy. If, on the other hand, tightening of the medial collateral ligament is needed, the focal dome, open wedge, <b>neutral</b> <b>wedge,</b> open wedge-focal dome or neutral focal dome osteotomies all serve to achieve this [29]. A circular external fixator can be used for fixation in this osteotomy [30]. In the circular fixator technique, the fibular osteotomy is made at the start through a posterolateral incision 10  cm distal to the fibular head. The bone is cut in an oblique fashion in order to enable the translation in the coronal plane. Two tensioned wires and a half pin are used for the proximal ring; two tensioned wires and a half pin are applied to the distal upper ring which is positioned perpendicularly to the tibial axis. Two tensioned wires are used for the most distal ring. All wires should not engage the fibula. The tibia is osteotomized just distal to the tibial tubercle with an osteotome or a Gigli saw. The lateral and anteromedial cortex are cut with precision with the osteotome. The cutting is completed in the posterior cortex with a turning movement of the osteotome (osteoclasis). The correction is achieved under fluoroscopy with alignment of the two rings [31].|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{influence}} of concomitant heeled footwear when wearing a lateral wedged insole for medial compartment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, between everyday walking shoes for outdoor use and socks or flat footwear without a heel for indoor use. DesignA total of 227 outpatients were prospectively randomized and treated with a <b>neutral</b> <b>wedged</b> insole inserted into shoes (placebo with shoes; n= 45), a wedged insole inserted into shoes (inserted insole with shoes; n= 45), a sock-type ankle supporter with a wedged insole when wearing socks or flat footwear (inserted insole without shoes; n= 46), a subtalar strapped insole when wearing shoes (strapped insole with shoes; n= 45), and the strapped insole with socks or flat footwear (strapped insole without shoes; n= 46). The Lequesne index of knee OA at week 12 was compared with the baseline in each treatment group. ResultsTwenty patients withdrew from the study, and the 207 patients who completed the 12 -week study were evaluated. At the final assessment, participants wearing the inserted insole without shoes (P= 0. 003), the strapped insole with shoes (P< 0. 0001), and the strapped insole without shoes (P< 0. 0001) demonstrated significantly improved Lequesne index scores in comparison with their baseline assessments. No {{significant differences were found}} in the placebo (P= 0. 16) or the inserted insole with shoes (P= 0. 2) groups. ConclusionConcomitant heeled footwear may decrease the efficacy of an inserted lateral wedged insole. The optimal usage of a lateral wedged insole for knee OA would be the combination with socks or flat footwear without heels...|$|R
50|$|The Qarlugh Kingdom prospered as a <b>neutral</b> state <b>wedged</b> {{between two}} {{powerful}} empires, the Delhi Sultanate {{to the east}} and south, and the Mongol Empire under Möngke Khan to the north. Muhammad Qarlugh maintained independence and prosperity for his kingdom through balanced diplomacy and extensive trade between the two empires, and through allying himself with neighboring local rulers like Jalal ad-Din Mas’ud Shah in Lahore, and Izz al-Din Balban Kashlu Khan, governor of Multan and Sind. Trade between the Mongol lands and the Indian subcontinent flourished during Muhammad Qarlugh's reign as testified by the large number of coins found in the Salt Range that bear his name. The kingdom fell some time after 1266 with its lands being incorporated into the Chagatai Khanate.|$|R
40|$|Of the {{numerous}} methods for {{the estimation of}} haemoglobin the one which gives the most generally reliable results is that using oxyhaemoglobin in the Medical Research Council <b>neutral</b> grey <b>wedge</b> photometer (Macfarlane, King, Wootton, and Gilchrist, 1948; King, Wootton, Donaldson, Sisson, and Macfarlane, 1948). An experiment using this method at various levels of haemoglobin showed that in a routine laboratory it gave results on single samples of blood with an average standard deviation of 1. 6 % of haemoglobin (see experiment I). This remarkably small technical error suggests that a difference of 50 % between two readings on one patient would usually indicate that a real change in haemoglobin level had occurred. In other words, if two readings on one patient were 100 and 9500 on 19 out of 20 occasions, these readings would indicate a real change in haemoglobin level. In the routine use of the M. R. C. photometer it is soon apparent that this precision is not reached. Much larger differences in haemoglobin than 5 % may result from random variation. This increased variability is not due to technical inaccuracy but to the differences between two samples of blood. The haemoglobin level of th...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the photographic sensitivity of three emulsions {{has been investigated}} over the restricted platen temperature range of approximately 16 °C to - 55 °C. Exposures on Tri -X and Plus -X were made in neutral, red (6050 Å), and blue (4490 Å light. The exposures on 103 a - 0 were made only in neutral and blue light due to the insensitivity of 103 a - 0 to light redder than about 5500 Å. In each exposure a 12 -step <b>neutral</b> density <b>wedge</b> was imaged on the film. The results are straightforward. Each emulsion displayed a sensitivity dependence with temperature in each color. The Tri -X and Plus -X showed points of optimum temperature (at maximum density) within the range employed. The optimum temperature however was not constant but varied with emulsion, color, and light level. The optimum temperature in general increased with increasing light level and was apparently higher at all light levels for the red exposures than for the blue. The 103 a - 0 displayed a nearly linear decrease in sensitivity with decreasing temperature. The point of optimum temperature for the 103 a - 0 is therefore higher than 16 °C at these light levels. A comparison of the blue exposures of 103 a - 0 and Tri -X reveals greater response for the Tri -X at the fainter light levels. However, the effect is reversed in the higher light levels. This response is interpreted as a difference in gamma of the two emulsions. The fact that the optimumly cooled Tri -X is more sensitive to blue light than the 103 a -O at the lower light levels is not important to astronomical photography unless the same effect occured at much longer exposure times and fainter light levels...|$|R
40|$|Importance There is no {{consensus}} regarding the efficacy of lateral wedge insoles {{as a treatment for}} pain in medial knee osteoarthritis. Objective To evaluate whether lateral wedge insoles reduce pain in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis compared with an appropriate control. Data Sources Databases searched include the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, AMED, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and BIOSIS from inception to May 2013, with no limits on study date or language. The metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the NHS Evidence website were also searched. Study Selection Included were randomized trials comparing shoe-based treatments (lateral heel wedge insoles or shoes with variable stiffness soles) aimed at reducing medial knee load, with a <b>neutral</b> or no <b>wedge</b> control condition in patients with painful medial knee osteoarthritis. Studies must have included patient-reported pain as an outcome. Data Extraction and Synthesis Trial data were extracted independently by 2 researchers using a standardized form. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool by 2 observers. Eligible studies were pooled using a random-effects approach. Main Outcome and Measures Change in self-reported knee pain at follow-up. Results Twelve trials met inclusion criteria with a total of 885 participants of whom 502 received lateral wedge treatment. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) suggested a favorable association with lateral wedges compared with control (SMD, − 0. 47; 95...|$|R
