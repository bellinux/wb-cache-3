5|$|In 1996, Kimberley Davies, {{who played}} Annalise Hartman, quit the series. Then Caroline Gillmer fell ill and her {{character}} Cheryl Stark was temporarily recast with former Prisoner actress Colette Mann. This made producers <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> viewing figures might decrease, so they implemented {{a series of}} plots to keep viewers interested. These included a cameo from Clive James and an explosion, which destroyed the doctor's surgery in the Lassiter's complex.|$|E
5|$|Producer Lindsay Doran, a {{longtime}} admirer of Austen's novel, hired Thompson {{to write the}} screenplay. The actress spent five years drafting numerous revisions, continually working on the script between other films as well as into production of the film itself. Studios were <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> Thompson – a first-time screenwriter – was the credited writer, but Columbia Pictures agreed to distribute the film. Though initially intending to have another actress portray Elinor, Thompson was persuaded to take the role.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) {{leaves his}} trailer for work, as he {{approaches}} a bear growling outside. He wants {{to move back to}} Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, but Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) insists that they must go forward in life. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into the emergency room, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) wants to ask the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for a job as an attending surgeon, but is <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> he will reject her, and goes out to lunch with her girlfriend Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw).|$|E
5|$|The scene then flashes {{forward to}} a plane {{returning}} Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane {{and goes back to}} his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes is his half-sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl is <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> Frank has not yet arrived at work. However, Frank eventually arrives and they discuss their next case.|$|E
25|$|Hancock's II Corps {{advanced}} {{across the}} Po, but he became <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> the Confederates had the Block House Bridge heavily defended {{and decided to}} delay his attack until the morning. This error was fatal to Grant's plan. That night, Lee moved two divisions of Jubal Early's corps from Spotsylvania Court House into position against Hancock. Mahone's division was placed directly in Hancock's path of advance while Henry Heth's division swung around to approach Hancock's right flank.|$|E

25|$|The {{persistent}} {{courage of}} Clinton, Superior Court Judge, later Mayor, Fletcher Bowron, and former L.A.P.D. detective Harry Raymond turned the tide. The police became so <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> the Intelligence Squad blew up Raymond's car and nearly killed him. The public was so enraged by the bombing that it quickly voted Shaw out of office, {{one of the}} first big-city recalls in the country's history. The head of the intelligence squad was convicted and sentenced to two years to life. Police Chief James Davis and 23 other officers were forced to resign.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{division}} of the spoils is unclear, Maelgwn appears to have gained Anglesey whilst the sons of Cynan held the cantrefs of Meirionnydd, Eifionydd and Ardudwy between them. However Dafydd appears at to have been recognised as pre-eminent amongst them and was regarded in some way as the overall leader. Naturally, once he'd enjoyed some {{of the benefits of}} power, Dafydd felt disinclined to share, as well as no doubt <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> he might also soon share the fate of his predecessor Hywel; in 1173 he acted against his brother Maelgwn and drove him into exile in Ireland thereby gaining possession of all Anglesey for himself.|$|E
25|$|A one-state {{solution}} is generally endorsed by Israeli Arabs. Many are becoming <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> {{a two-state solution}} would result in official pressures for them {{to move into a}} Palestinian state in the West Bank and/or Gaza Strip and so lose their homes and access to their communities, businesses and cities inside Israel. Some Israeli government spokespeople have also proposed that Palestinian-majority areas of Israel, such as the area around Umm el-Fahm, be annexed to the new Palestinian state. As this measure would cut these areas off permanently from the rest of Israel's territory, including the coastal cities and other Palestinian towns and villages, Palestinians view this with alarm. Many Palestinian citizens of Israel would therefore prefer a one-state solution because this would allow them to sustain their Israeli citizenship.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, {{producers}} {{decided to}} have Shortland Street undergo a cot death storyline and {{the decision was made}} for the character of Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm) to undergo it. Needing a suitable father character, writers paired Ellen with the relatively new character of David. Ellen and David had been dating for several months but the arrival of his ex-wife Isobel Kearney (Jennifer Ward-Lealand) lead to Ellen thinking the two had reconciled, causing her to flee to Fiji. In a specially shot episode in the country, David tracked her down and the two reconciled, only for Ellen to announce she was pregnant. The couple decided to get married to support the child and lured their friends to the ceremony under the pretense that it was Grace Kwan's (Lyentte Forday) birthday. Producers encountered a problem when developing the storyline, when they realized they had accidentally over run Ellen's pregnancy. A quick fill in story was devised where Ellen was <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> the baby was so late. In the casting of Ellen and David's child, the daughter of the show's medical adviser was chosen. Having set the storyline up to unfold in 1998, crew members began to get cold feet due to the uneasiness of shooting the scene using one of their co workers own children and the fact that two of the storyliners had fallen pregnant. On screen, Ellen had an unscheduled birth, giving birth to Rose Crozier-Kearney (Georgia Bishop) in her bathroom, but help arrived in the form of Caroline Buxton (Tandi Wright) just in time. Due to the tenderness of the storyline, it was continuously pushed back until the stage where it was nearing the point of improbability. The plot was ultimately scheduled to air in the last possible week with the potential of cot death to occur. In February 1998, Ellen and David were shocked to discover her baby daughter Rose, had died in her sleep. The scene was shot with the baby's actress but Malcolm was directed to quickly pick her up and then the shot was changed to a close up, to avoid any movements from the child. The couple's devastation at Rose's death saw them break up and date other characters. However, over a year later they finally put Rose to rest and reconciled. The storyline landed Malcolm with her first ever television acting nomination. The subject of a child's death was dealt with once more in the soap, 5 years later in the death of Te Ngakau Hudson.|$|E

500|$|After being cast, Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim were <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> their characters' {{relationship}} would foster negative perceptions of Korean people; the former {{felt that it}} was an outdated depiction which would influence a society little exposed to Korean culture. The actors discussed this with the series' producers, leading to the writing of [...] "House of the Rising Sun" [...] and the multifaceted depiction of their relationship. [...] "House of the Rising Sun" [...] first aired on October 27, 2004, on the American network ABC. An estimated 16.83 million viewers watched the episode on its first broadcast, and it earned a ratings share of 6.4/17, a slight increase from the previous episode. It received mainly positive reviews, with critics focusing on the revelations surrounding Jin and Sun's relationship.|$|E

[...] He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles <b>nervous</b> <b>that</b> they might also be murdered. He told Mojo magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, [...] "All Those Years Ago", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released [...] "Here Today" [...] in 1982, a song Everett described as [...] "a haunting tribute" [...] to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.|$|E

[...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
