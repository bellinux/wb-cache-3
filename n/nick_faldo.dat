5|$|Golf {{has been}} {{prominent}} in England; {{due in part}} to its cultural and geographical ties to Scotland, the home of Golf. There are both professional tours for men and women, in two main tours: the PGA and the European Tour. England has produced grand slam winners: Cyril Walker, Tony Jacklin, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> and Justin Rose in the men's and Laura Davies, Alison Nicholas, and Karen Stupples in the women's. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, played both in England and Scotland. The biennial golf competition, the Ryder Cup, is named after English businessman Samuel Ryder who sponsored the event and donated the trophy. <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> is the most successful Ryder Cup player ever, having won the most points (25) of any player on either the European or US teams.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, {{the winner}} of the {{previous}} year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner {{at the end of the}} tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.|$|E
5|$|Nicklaus has {{the most}} Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Palmer and Tiger Woods won four each, and five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the {{champion}} in 1980 and 1983.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> Championship Golf is a third-person golf video game, which Grandslam Entertainment {{published}} for Amiga, Amiga CD32, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS between 1992 and 1994.|$|R
25|$|Montgomerie was {{not part}} of <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> 2008 Ryder Cup team, with the wildcards going to Paul Casey and Ian Poulter. Montgomerie captained the Great Britain & Ireland team in the first four stagings of the Seve Trophy, losing in 2000 but winning in 2002, 2003, and 2005.|$|R
50|$|In June 2010, Lowry {{qualified}} {{for his first}} major championship, the Open Championship at St Andrews. During the qualification, Lowry equalled <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> course record at Sunningdale when he posted a 62. Lowry went on {{to make the cut}} at St Andrews and eventually finished in a tie for 37th place.|$|R
5|$|Current {{members include}} former Yankees manager Joe Torre, and actors Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. Around 2003, members {{included}} Rudy Giuliani, Jack Nicholson, Hugh Grant, George Steinbrenner, and Regis Philbin. Visiting players include Ron Howard, Regis Philbin, and Bobby Bonilla, who {{came for the}} course's reopening in 2002, and professional golfer <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo.</b> Other visitors include Michael Jordan, former New York City mayors Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani, and Billy Crystal, who joined Trump and members Bill Clinton and Joe Torre for the 2008 Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation Golf Classic at the club.|$|E
5|$|During this period, no golfer {{suffered}} from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman. In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters. In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship). Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force a Monday playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.|$|E
25|$|In the past, Wilson has {{had many}} of the world best golfers under contract, {{including}} 6 time major winner <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo.</b> Wilson Staff currently has endorsement deals with many professional golfers who compete on all the major tours.|$|E
50|$|Fisher {{was born}} in Chingford, London. He was a winner of the <b>Faldo</b> Series, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> {{development}} programme for young golfers, in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and as such was {{regarded as one of}} the best prospects of his generation. In 2005 he became the youngest player to take part in the Walker Cup.|$|R
50|$|On 16 June 2013, Rose won his maiden major {{championship}} at the U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club by two strokes over Phil Mickelson and Jason Day. He {{became the first}} Englishman in 43 years to win the U.S. Open. He also ended a 17 year major drought for English golfers since <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> win at the 1996 Masters.|$|R
25|$|A runner-up {{finish at}} the 2008 French Open in June boosted him {{back up the}} rankings, but his good play was short-lived, {{and as a result}} Montgomerie failed to qualify for <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> 2008 Ryder Cup team. In March 2009, Montgomerie played in his {{milestone}} 500th European Tour event at the Open de Andalucia where he played well and made the cut, but was not a factor on the weekend.|$|R
25|$|McIlroy {{employs the}} {{interlocking}} grip on full shots. He {{has worked with}} various professional golfers since he was young, including Darren Clarke, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> and Graeme McDowell. McDowell frequently plays practice rounds at Tour events with McIlroy.|$|E
25|$|He has {{represented}} Europe {{for the last}} ten Ryder Cups. In October 2010, Westwood became the World number one golfer, ending the reign of Tiger Woods, and becoming the first British golfer since <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> in 1994 to hold that position. He held the number one position for a total of 22 weeks.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 Matches, Westwood sat out for {{the first}} session in his Ryder Cup career during the matches after a {{controversial}} decision by captain <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo.</b> The European Team ended up losing to the U.S. 16½–11½. In October 2010, Westwood {{was a member of the}} European team that won the 2010 Ryder Cup with a one-point win over the USA.|$|E
5000|$|Tilghman drew {{criticism}} for remarks about Tiger Woods during a January 4, 2008 PGA Tour Telecast. In response to co-anchor <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> joke that younger players should [...] "gang up" [...] on Woods, Tilghman replied [...] "Lynch {{him in a}} back alley". Tilghman was laughing during the exchange with Faldo at the Mercedes-Benz Championship, and Woods' agent at IMG {{was quoted as saying}} he didn't think there was any ill intent.|$|R
50|$|From Scotland, Lyle was {{the first}} winner of the Masters from the United Kingdom, which had four {{consecutive}} with <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> playoff wins in 1989 and 1990 and Ian Woosnam's one-stroke victory in 1991. Decades later, Lyle's approach shot from the bunker on the final hole is still regularly referred to by BBC commentators, particularly Peter Alliss, who almost without fail, remark that any shot rolling back to the pin on the 18th has 'shades of Sandy Lyle' about it.|$|R
50|$|Clarke {{ended his}} winless streak in April 2008 {{when he won}} the BMW Asian Open in an {{emotional}} victory after a birdie on the 72nd hole to see off Robert-Jan Derksen by one stroke. This was Clarke's first win in almost five years and the 11th of his career. The win broke the shackles from the slump in form he went through in the previous years and his 12th victory was not far around the corner. Clarke won again in the Netherlands at the KLM Open finishing the tournament four shots ahead of Paul McGinley. Clarke ended his comeback year 13th in the Order of Merit Standings, however he missed out on a place in <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> Ryder Cup team, the first time Clarke had done so in over 10 years.|$|R
25|$|Westwood {{made his}} Ryder Cup debut in 1997 where he partnered fellow Englishman <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> in {{both sets of}} fourballs and foursomes. In the 1999 Ryder Cup, he partnered Darren Clarke for the fourballs and foursomes, picking up 2 points. At The Belfry in 2002 he teamed up with Sergio García in a {{successful}} partnership in which they won 3 and lost 1 of their four matches.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Westwood won {{his first}} {{professional}} tournament, the Volvo Scandinavian Masters, closely followed by the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in Japan. His success continued in 1997, defending his Japanese title and winning the Malaysian Open, the Volvo Masters in Spain, and the Holden Australian Open, beating Greg Norman in a playoff. He also partnered with <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> in the Ryder Cup that year.|$|E
25|$|After {{a career}} slump {{in the early}} 1990s, Norman turned to renowned coach Butch Harmon for help. Together, the two rebuilt Norman's game by solving {{mechanical}} problems that had crept into his swing. As {{a result of this}} training, Norman earned his second major at Royal St George's in the 1993 Open Championship. There, in ideal conditions, Norman defeated a leaderboard consisting of <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> Bernhard Langer and Corey Pavin. Norman's final round 64 was the lowest score by a winner in Open history until Henrik Stenson's 63 at the 2016 Open Championship.|$|E
500|$|The {{defending}} champion, as host, selects {{the menu}} for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served finely prepared cuisine by the Masters chef {{from their home}} regions. Notable examples have included haggis, served by Scotsman Sandy Lyle in 1989, and bobotie, a South African dish, served {{at the behest of}} 2008 champion Trevor Immelman. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo's</b> fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion Fuzzy Zoeller created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of Phil Mickelson was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that Seve Ballesteros would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died [...] weeks later.|$|R
25|$|At the 1989 Masters, Norman {{missed a}} 12-foot par putt on the 72nd hole {{which would have}} put him into a playoff with <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> and Scott Hoch. Norman had another chance at a major in 1989, this time at the Open Championship at Royal Troon. He played a final-round of 64, {{starting}} his round with six straight birdies, to force his way into a playoff with Mark Calcavecchia and Wayne Grady. Going into the final playoff hole, Norman and Calcavecchia were tied, but two successive bunker shots by Norman gave Calcavecchia the victory.|$|E
25|$|Many of the world's top {{professional}} golfers {{have used}} Wilson equipment, including Gene Sarazen (who had a 75-year {{relationship with the}} company, the longest-running contract in sports history). Other golfers who have used Wilson Staff equipment include Sam Snead, Walter Hagen, Arnold Palmer, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> Payne Stewart, John Daly, Ben Crenshaw, and Vijay Singh. Palmer and Crenshaw both used Wilson 8802 putters, with Crenshaw's receiving the moniker Little Ben due to his proficiency with it. Current Wilson Staff players include Open and USPGA champion Pádraig Harrington as well as Kevin Streelman.|$|E
25|$|Watson {{won five}} Opens, {{more than anyone}} else has since the 1950s, but his final win in 1983 brought down the curtain on an era of U.S. domination. In the next 11 years there was only one American winner, with the others coming from Europe and the Commonwealth. The European winners of this era, Spaniard Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle, who was the first Scottish winner in over half a century, and the Englishman <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> were also leading lights among the group of players who began to get the better of the Americans in the Ryder Cup during this period.|$|E
25|$|With a {{two-shot}} win at the 1971 PGA Championship in February over Billy Casper, Nicklaus {{became the}} first golfer to win all four majors twice in a career. In this championship, Nicklaus was the only player to break 70 consecutively {{in the first two}} rounds under windy conditions and finished at seven-under par 281. Nicklaus finished second twice and fifth in the remaining three major championships for the year. While he finished tied for second in the Masters with Johnny Miller, Nicklaus made a big enough impression on a young <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> (watching on TV in England) in order for Faldo to take up the game seriously.|$|E
25|$|He was {{introduced}} to golf at an exceptionally young age by his father, who coached him. Gerry McIlroy is a fine golfer himself, who once played at a scratch handicap level. He asked his father virtually every day {{to take him to}} Holywood Golf course. Family lore relates that he received a new golf club as a present, being shown the correct grip by his father, then taking the club to bed with him that night, with his hands holding the club properly. McIlroy joined Holywood Golf Club and became the youngest member at the club. A video on golf technique produced by champion <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> was his early favourite.|$|E
25|$|Kaymer {{came close}} to picking up his third win {{of the year at}} the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, but he fell to Robert Karlsson in a three-man playoff that also {{included}} Ross Fisher. Kaymer recorded another runner-up finish at the Volvo Masters, finishing two strokes behind winner Søren Kjeldsen. Kaymer earned €1,794,500 in 2008 and finished 8th on the Order of Merit. Kaymer narrowly missed selection for the 2008 Ryder Cup, but European captain <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> invited Kaymer to assist the European side in a non-playing capacity which Kaymer accepted. Kaymer represented his country at the 2008 Omega Mission Hills World Cup with Alex Čejka. The pair finished in fifth.|$|E
25|$|Kaymer was {{a member}} of the winning European Ryder Cup team in 2010. He won both four-balls (partnered with Westwood and Poulter), halved his foursome and lost his singles match. A week later he won the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews with Danny Willett coming in three strokes behind. He was the first player since Tiger Woods in 2006 to win three {{successive}} tournaments in a year and the first European to achieve this since <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> in 1989. The win took him to a career high of third in the Official World Golf Ranking. Kaymer and Graeme McDowell shared the European Tour Golfer of the Year award.|$|E
25|$|Despite his disappointments in the majors, Montgomerie is {{heralded as}} one of the {{greatest}} Ryder Cup players of all time. To date he has been a member of the European team on eight occasions, and has never lost in a singles match. He holds a win-lose-draw record of 20–9–7, thus giving him a total points scored tally of 23.5, only 1.5 points behind the all-time record held by <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo.</b> He has played pivotal roles in several of the matches. He halved the last hole with Scott Hoch to obtain the half-point that won Europe the cup in 1997, and sank the winning putt, in what is considered to be his finest hour in the 2004 staging of the event.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Norman {{opened the}} 1996 Masters Tournament with a course record-tying 63 which {{put him at}} the top of the leaderboard. He held the lead through three days of play. Norman took a six-stroke lead into the final round and lost the tournament to <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> by five strokes, shooting a Sunday 78 to Faldo's 67. In January 1997, Norman won his largest winner's check to date, one million dollars, when he won the Andersen Consulting World Championship of Golf. Norman then won two tournaments in 1997, but they were his final victories on the PGA Tour. In 1998, Norman missed part of the season after suffering hip and shoulder injuries. He contended in the 1999 Masters tournament, tying for the lead with five holes remaining before finishing third, three strokes behind, and again in the 1999 Open Championship, eventually finishing 6th, three strokes behind.|$|E
25|$|Norman won the Doral-Ryder Open and Memorial Tournament in March 1990 {{after having}} {{missed the cut}} {{for the first time}} at the 1990 Masters. In the 1990 Open Championship at St Andrews, Norman began with two rounds of 66, leaving himself sharing the lead with <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> after 36 holes and the pair four shots ahead of the rest of the field. Faldo then shot a third round of 67, but Norman could only manage 76. Norman {{finished}} the tournament tied for sixth place, while Faldo won by five shots. Although 1990 was not Norman's strongest majors year, he finished at the top of the PGA Tour money list for the second time in his career and won the Vardon Trophy and Byron Nelson Award. Later that year, he won the Australian Masters in his home country for a final and record sixth time.|$|E
500|$|The first {{winner of}} the Masters Tournament was Horton Smith in 1934, and he {{repeated}} in 1936. The player with the most Masters victories is Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have each won four, and Jimmy Demaret, Gary Player, Sam Snead, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> and Phil Mickelson have three titles to their name. Player was the tournament's first overseas winner with his first victory in 1961. [...] Two-time champions include Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, José María Olazábal, and Bubba Watson.|$|E
500|$|Jack Nicklaus {{holds the}} record for the most Masters victories, winning the tournament six times during his career. Nicklaus is also the oldest winner of the Masters: he was 46 years 82 days old when he won in 1986. Nicklaus, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> and Tiger Woods co-hold {{the record for}} most {{consecutive}} victories with two. Woods was the youngest winner of the Masters, 21 years 104 days old when he won in 1997. Woods also set {{the record for the}} widest winning margin (12 strokes), and the lowest winning score, with 270, 18 below par (-18) in 1997. The latter was equaled by Jordan Spieth in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Lowest score after 36 holes: 130, <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo</b> (66-64), 1992; Brandt Snedeker (66-64), 2012 ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Calcavecchia, John Daly, David Duval (4), <b>Nick</b> <b>Faldo,</b> Todd Hamilton (4), Paul Lawrie (4), Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard (5,15,19), Sandy Lyle, Mark O'Meara, Tom Watson, Tiger Woods (4,5,11,12,13) ...|$|E
