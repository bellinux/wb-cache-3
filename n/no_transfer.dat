In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is <b>no</b> <b>transfer</b> of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change.

5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline. Since the CCDI {{does not have the}} power to prosecute, it is supposed to transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes <b>no</b> <b>transfer)</b> of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{began his}} career as a trainee with Charlton Athletic, and was a regular in the club's Under-18 team, where he played in defence. He progressed through the club's youth system, and {{featured}} in Charlton's reserve side throughout the club's 2005–06 campaign, making a total of 16 appearances for the reserve side as a second-year scholar. However, he failed to make any first-team appearances and was subsequently allowed to search for a new club. In February 2006, he played for Luton Town's reserve side in a match against Stevenage Borough reserves at Kenilworth Road, although <b>no</b> <b>transfer</b> materialised. He was officially released by Charlton in April 2006. A month later, Wilson went on trial at League Two side Shrewsbury Town, and played the whole match in Shrewsbury's 2–1 pre-season friendly home win against Rotherham United, although he was unsuccessful in his attempt to earn a professional contract with the club. In August 2006, Wilson signed a one-year deal with Colchester United. Similarly to his time at Charlton, Wilson featured regularly for the club's reserve side throughout the 2006–07 season, but failed to make any first-team appearances, making the substitute's bench once in a 1–0 loss to MK Dons in the League Cup. He was loaned out to Conference South side Welling United in December 2006. He made his debut for Welling in the club's 1–0 win away at Cambridge City, but was sent-off after just 27 minutes for violent conduct. He returned to first-team action in Welling's 0–0 draw with Basingstoke Town at Park View Road in the FA Trophy, and also played the whole match in Welling's 2–1 away win against Thurrock. Wilson played his last game for Welling in the club's 2–0 win at home to Fisher Athletic in early January 2007. He played a total of four times for Welling during his one-month loan spell at the club. On returning to Layer Road, Wilson was released at the end of the 2006–07 season, and failed to make a first-team appearance for Colchester. Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Wilson spent pre-season trialling at Brentford and Stockport County respectively, training with Stockport for a number of weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies, but was ultimately not offered a contract.|$|E
