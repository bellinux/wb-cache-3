40|$|Malawi {{is one of}} the African {{countries}} that hosts thousands of refugees mostly from Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and other African countries. These refugees come from various cultural backgrounds. Their cultural diversity is visible in languages, tribes, spiritual beliefs, food, dances and etiquette. Even though these refugees are all around the country, their concentration at Dzaleka Refugee Camp is usually over 10, 000 at any given period of the year. Amidst the refugees finding a relatively safe place in Dzaleka Refugee Camp, they however face community health challenges as any other reasonably stable community. In worst cases, health challenges in the camp are worse than the surrounding communities. In response to these health challenges, the need for a hygienic environment and health community members, various organizations provide <b>non-formal</b> health <b>education</b> in the camp. These organizations come from within and outside the camp. <b>Non-formal</b> health <b>education</b> in the camp strives to help the community use the information for sanitary living as a preventative measure to illness. However, <b>non-formal</b> health <b>education</b> finds itself taking place in this culturally diverse community. This project interviewed 40 <b>non-formal</b> health <b>education</b> participants in the community to inquire about their views on cultural diversity 2 Ì† 7 s interaction with <b>non-formal</b> health <b>education.</b> This project finds that communication, personal value judgement and lack of <b>non-formal</b> health <b>education</b> resources are the main perceived challenges that cultural diversity poses in <b>non-formal</b> health <b>education</b> in the camp. Finally, the project finds that creating a support system through recruiting local staff and making use of community relationships are key strategies in adapting <b>non-formal</b> health <b>education</b> in such a culturally diverse community...|$|R

Data were collected and analysed through an interpretivist window and involved: (1) a historical and content analysis of recommendations from United Nations-sponsored conferences related to environmental education; (2) interviews with academics, Chinese officials, and Chinese civil organisations representatives; and (3) document analysis of academic literature as well as governmental and non-governmental publications related to environmental recommendations. Findings were compared, contrasted and interpreted {{in order to assess}} patterns of influence and consistency. Briefly, results showed that international recommendations for environmental education did not directly influence <b>non-formal</b> environmental <b>education</b> efforts in China; nevertheless, some <b>non-formal</b> environmental <b>education</b> efforts in China were consistent with the international recommendations, suggesting the existence of indirect communication pathways between international conferences and local agents.

Although education leading to this outcome is desirable for all, <b>non-formal</b> vocational <b>education</b> can reach those currently excluded from formal education, thus enhancing their empowerment by equipping them with useful skills and knowledge.
