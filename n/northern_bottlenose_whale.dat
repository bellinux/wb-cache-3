5|$|The {{stranding}} of the <b>Northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E

40|$|Wimmer and Hal Whitehead Abstract: A small, {{apparently}} isolated, {{and endangered}} population of ~ 130 <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> (Hyperoodon ampullatus Forster, 1770) is {{found on the}} Scotian Slope south of Nova Scotia, Canada. Virtually all previous informa-tion on these animals {{had come from the}} Gully, a large submarine canyon where the <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> can be reliably found. A ship survey along the 1000 m depth contour in 2001 showed <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> only in the Gully, Shortland canyon (50 km east of the Gully), and Haldimand canyon (100 km east of the Gully). Studies in 2002 reconfirmed the presence of the whales in these other canyons, although densities were about 50 % lower than in the Gully. Photo-identifications showed that individuals moved between the Gully and Shortland and Haldimand canyons over periods from days to years, with mean stays in any canyon of about 22 days. However, the population was not fully mixed: at least some individuals had preferences for particular canyons. The sex ratios were similar in all can-yons, but males had higher rates of movement between canyons. These results are consistent with the expectations of optimal foraging theory, when the primary resource for females, deep-water squid of the genus Gonatus Gray, 1849, is more temporally stable than the primary resource for males, which is assumed to be receptive females. Haldimand and Shortland canyons are clearly important habitat for this species, and should receive appropriate protection.

40|$|Although <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> {{were the}} most heavily hunted beaked whale, we have little {{information}} about this species in its remote habitat of the North Atlantic Ocean. Underwater anthropogenic noise and disruption of their natural habitat may be major threats, given the sensitivity of other beaked whales to such noise disturbance. We attached dataloggers to 13 <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> and compared their natural sounds and movements to those of one individual exposed to escalating levels of 1 – 2 [*]kHz upsweep naval sonar signals. At a received sound pressure level (SPL) of 98 [*]dB re 1 [*]μPa, the whale turned to approach the sound source, but at a received SPL of 107 [*]dB re 1 [*]μPa, the whale began moving in an unusually straight course and then made a near 180 ° {{turn away from the}} source, and performed the longest and deepest dive (94 [*]min, 2339 [*]m) recorded for this species. Animal movement parameters differed significantly from baseline for more than 7 [*]h until the tag fell off 33 – 36 [*]km away. No clicks were emitted during the response period, indicating cessation of normal echolocation-based foraging. A sharp decline in both acoustic and visual detections of conspecifics after exposure suggests other whales in the area responded similarly.
