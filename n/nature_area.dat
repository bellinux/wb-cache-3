5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom <b>Nature</b> <b>Area</b> in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|M-13/M-84 {{crosses the}} west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz <b>Nature</b> <b>Area</b> to Middle Ground island. The highway {{continues}} over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue {{on the eastern}} bank of the river. At the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing {{to the east of}} an industrial complex on the river. At the intersection with McKinley Street, a one-way street, M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, during Corker's United States Senate {{campaign}} against Democrat Harold Ford Jr., a second lawsuit was filed by Kurtz, again represented by Prochaska, and the Tennessee Environmental Council. The lawsuit accused Wal-Mart of encroaching onto an adjacent protected <b>nature</b> <b>area</b> {{that was also}} held by a company owned by Corker. The suit alleged that Corker did not fully disclose {{his interest in the}} property where the Wal-Mart was built or in the adjacent <b>nature</b> <b>area</b> at the time the deal was made. The Corker campaign countered that an article published on March 5, 2003 in the Chattanooga Times Free Press publicly identified Corker's ownership interest in the land, through Osborne Enterprises, and that as mayor, a blind trust barred Corker from being involved in issues like these that affected his business.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableUrban <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> {{are often}} {{identified}} by local governments with no thought to their ecological characteristics or conservation value. We used a vegetation classification procedure, entitation, to classify vegetation types in nine <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> {{identified by the}} Columbia, MO Parks and Recreation Department. The objective {{of the project was}} to identify the frequency, rarity, and size of the different vegetation types present within these <b>nature</b> <b>areas.</b> Entitation is a procedure used to classify and distinguish vegetation units based on physical characteristics of dominant vegetation. We assessed nine <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> in Columbia in the summer of 2007 and classified distinct parcels larger than 0. 5 ha using an entitation manual developed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. We mapped the classified areas on 2007 imagery of the parks using ArcMap and determined the number of distinct units of each vegetation type and the area of each type. We used PC ORD to determine the Jacard similarity of the nine <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> to each other based on vegetation type and used ordination and cluster analysis procedures to identify groups of <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> with potentially similar management needs. Results/Conclusions We identified 15 vegetation types among 68 vegetation units among the nine <b>nature</b> <b>areas.</b> Medium tall grassland with open stands of trees was the most frequently occurring vegetation type and had the highest percent cover. Rare vegetation types included evergreen woodlands and freshwater wetlands. NSF Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biolog...|$|R

25|$|Jonsvatnet is {{the main}} water {{abstraction}} source for drinking water in Trondheim. As such there have since the 1960s been extensive restrictions on the lake, including bans on any motorized boats and bathing in the lake. However, there were contradictions in restrictions: domesticated cows were allowed to bathe, but not humans, and all motor boat activities were banned, although the lake acted as a water aerodrome. The city asked the club in 1999 to start looking for another site for a water aerodrome. The municipal council therefore withdrew the airport's concession in March 2003, effective {{at the end of}} the year. However, by August the decision had been reverted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). They gave a ten-year concession in 2005, but this was appealed by the municipality to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. During the public hearing, the Ministry of the Environment supported the municipality's stance, stating that the lake, as a recreational and <b>nature</b> <b>area,</b> should be shielded from use by seaplanes.|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{deposition}} of nitrogen {{is one of}} the most important threats to <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> in the Netherlands. At a large scale the critical loads for nitrogen are exceeded to a great extend. Ammonia emissions from agricultural activities contribute over 50 % to the nitrogen deposition in the Netherlands. For <b>nature</b> <b>areas,</b> this contribution can be even higher because agricultural areas are often situated close to <b>nature</b> <b>areas.</b> This offers special opportunities for (sub) national policy makers to reduce the large nitrogen loads at a local scale by relocating ammonia emissions. In this study the ammonia emissions are relocated in such a way that <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> are maximally protected given a national emission ceiling. This is carried out by minimising the exceedances of the critical loads for nitrogen for the <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> and taken into account the atmospheric {{deposition of}} nitrogen from other sources and countries. This optimisation is carried out at a spatial scale of 1 x 1 km 2. For the ammonia emissions for 2010 (93 kton) an optimisation of the distribution of the emissions leads to a reduction in the accumulated exceedances of about 30 - 40 %. The percentages of the <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> that is protected against the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen increases from 30 % to 40 - 50 %. An outlook for 2030 shows that the reductions in the accumulated exceedances are 40 - 60 % but that the percentage of protection is increased by only a few percent. The results are highly dependent on the assumptions made about the development of the agricultural practice. The effect of these relocations is used in the evaluation on whether local measures are effective compared to generic measures in reducing agricultural ammonia emissions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP) {{is trying}} to develop a {{coherent}} set of indicators to monitor <b>nature</b> <b>areas</b> in the Netherlands. One of the proposed indicators is the recreational use of <b>nature</b> <b>areas.</b> Besides indicating the social value of a specific area, recreational use may be also be used as input for modelling habitat quality, another MNP-indicator. Recreational use itself is likely to depend on the attractiveness of the area, such as its scenic beauty. This attractiveness is yet another MNP-indicator. Because the MNP wants a national overview of the recreation use of all <b>nature</b> <b>areas,</b> on-site monitoring is not a feasible option. Therefore we have started to develop a model to predict the number of recreational visits to forests and nature areas: FORVISITS. Although the model is still in its early stages, a first nation-wide application has taken place and will be presented...|$|R
