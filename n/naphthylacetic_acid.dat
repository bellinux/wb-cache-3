40|$|Previously, we {{identified}} a soluble protein from Hyoscyamus muticus that was photolabeled by 5 -azido-indole- 3 -acetic acid. This protein {{was determined to}} be a glutathione S-transferase (GST; J. Bilang, H. Macdonald, P. J. King, and A. Sturm [1993] Plant Physiol 102 : 29 - 34). We have examined the effect of auxin on the activity of this H. muticus GST. Auxins reduced enzyme activity only at high concentrations, with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid being more effective than indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> IAA was a noncompetitive inhibitor, whereas inhibition by 2, 4 -D was competitive with respect to 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitro-benzene. We also present the sequence of a full-length cDNA clone that codes for a GST and contains all partial amino acid sequences of the purified protein. The auxin-binding GST was found in high amounts in roots and stems and low amounts in leaves and flower buds. The steady-state mRNA level was not regulated by IAA or <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> whereas 2, 4 -D and 2, 3 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid increased mRNA levels. We propose a model in which 2, 4 -D is a substrate for GST, whereas IAA binds at a second site, known as a ligandin-binding site for the purpose of intracellular transport...|$|E
40|$|In Arabidopsis, {{seedless}} silique {{development or}} parthenocarpy can be {{induced by the}} application of various plant growth regulators (PGRs) to unfertilized pistils. Ecotype-specific responses were observed in the Arabidopsis ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg relative {{to the type of}} PGR and level applied. The parthenocarpic response was greatest in ecotype Landsberg, and comparisons of fruit growth and morphology were studied primarily in this ecotype. Gibberellic acid application (10 μmol pistil− 1) caused development similar to that in pollinated pistils, while benzyladenine (1 μmol pistil− 1) and <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 μmol pistil− 1) treatment produced shorter siliques. <b>Naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> primarily modified mesocarp cell expansion. Arabidopsis mutants were employed to examine potential dependencies on gibberellin biosynthesis (ga 1 - 3, ga 4 - 1, and ga 5 - 1) and perception (spy- 4 and gai) during parthenocarpic silique development. Emasculated spy- 4 pistils were neither obviously parthenocarpic nor deficient in PGR perception. By contrast, emasculated gai mutants did not produce parthenocarpic siliques following gibberellic acid application, but silique development occurred following pollination or application of auxin and cytokinin. Pollinated gai siliques had decreased cell numbers and morphologically resembled auxin-induced parthenocarpic siliques. This shows that a number of independent and possibly redundant pathways can direct hormone-induced parthenocarpy, and that endogenous gibberellins play a role in regulating cell expansion and promoting cell division in carpels...|$|E

40|$|A cDNA clone {{encoding}} a putative dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase gene {{has been}} isolated from a strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa cv Chandler) DNA subtractive library. Northern {{analysis showed that}} the corresponding gene is predominantly expressed in fruit, where it is first detected during elongation (green stages) and then declines and sharply increases when the initial fruit ripening events occur, {{at the time of}} initiation of anthocyanin accumulation. The transcript can be induced in unripe green fruit by removing the achenes, and this induction can be partially inhibited by treatment of de-achened fruit with <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> indicating that the expression of this gene is under hormonal control. We propose that the putative dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase gene in strawberry plays a main role in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin during color development at the late stages of fruit ripening; during the first stages the expression of this gene could be related to the accumulation of condensed tannins...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{crosslinking}} agent, suberoyl chloride, {{was used}} to crosslink N-phthaloyl acylated chitosan and improves the properties of chitosan membranes. Membranes with different crosslinking degrees were synthesized. The derivatives were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 13 C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which indicated that the crosslinking degrees ranged from 0 to 7. 4 %. The permeabilities of various plant nutrients, including macroelements (N, P, K), microelements (Zn 2 + and Cu 2 +), and a plant growth regulator (<b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid),</b> were varied by moderate changes in crosslinking degree, indicating that the controlled-release properties can be regulated in this way. The film-forming ability of native chitosan was maintained, whilst mechanical properties, hydrophobicity and controlled permeability were improved. These dramatic improvements occurred {{with a small amount}} of added suberoyl chloride; excessive crosslinking led to membranes with unwanted poor permeability. Thus, both the mechanical properties and permeability of the crosslinked membrane can be optimized...|$|E

The effects of several parameters related to the separation and determination were investigated in detail. The ana-lysis was carried out using 10 mM borax, 10 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 90 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate and 5 % acetonitrile as running buffer (pH 9. 0). Under optimum conditions, the method demonstrated good performance concerning linearity (r, 0. 9954 – 0. 9991), precision (0. 77 – 4. 97 %), the method limit of detection (LOD) and the method limit of quantitation (LOQ) (LOD, 0. 011 – 0. 177 mg/kg; LOQ, 0. 035 – 0. 590 mg/kg) and accuracy (83. 62 – 102. 56 %).

40|$|In Dendrobium {{and other}} orchids the ovule becomes mature long after pollination, whereas the ovary starts growing {{within two days}} of pollination. The {{signalling}} pathway that induces rapid ovary growth after pollination has remained elusive. We placed the auxin antagonist ¿-(p-chlorophenoxy) isobutyric acid (PCIB) or the auxin transport inhibitor 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) on the stigma, before pollination. Both treatments nullified pollination-induced ovary growth. The ovaries also did not grow after similar stigma treatment with 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), AgNO 3 (both inhibitors of ethylene action), aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) or CoCl 2 (which both inhibit ethylene synthesis), before pollination. Pollination could be replaced by placement of the auxin <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NAA) on the stigma. All mentioned inhibitors nullified the effect of NAA, indicating that if auxin is the initiator of ovary growth, it acts through ethylene.

30|$|Obtainment and {{characterization}} of the novel endosperm callus of Taxus chinensis Rehd. var. mairei are valuable for haploid breeding, genome, and functional genome in Taxus. Callus was obtained by hydropriming with sterile water for 3  days and suitable medium composition. The highest callus induction (70.89  %) and lower browning ratio (7.95  %) were obtained from Gamborg (B 5) medium supplemented with 30  g l− 1 of sucrose, 2.5  mg l− 1 of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D), 0.5  mg l− 1 of 6 -benzylademine (6 -BA) and 7  g l− 1 of agar under dark conditions. The auxin of 2, 4 -D had a better efficiency of callus induction than <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> and over 1  mg l− 1 of 6 -BA was inhibitory to the callogensis of endosperm. The endosperm callus was haploid which was detectable by the flow cytometry. The genome block of homozygosity of callus was homozygous which was indicated by PCR-based SNP marks. The homozygous haploid of endosperm callus in vitro culture may be useful tools for taxoid-metabolism of gene engineering and bio-fermentation engineering.|$|E

In addition impact of sampled phytohormones (<b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> - NAA, benzylaminopurine - BAP, 2, 4 - dichlorphenoxyacetic acid - 2, 4 - D) and impact of sampled precursors (sodium mevalonate, oxaloacetic acid, phenylalanine) on production of secondary metabolites is duly evaluated. Volume of iridoids and phenylpropanoic acids is measured using HPLC method. Use of phytohormones increases the volume only when applying NAA of caffeic acid. Neither grow ratio nor total volume of biomass are impacted by application of phytohormones. Sodium mevalonate is most affecting the grow ratio when used in concentration c 2. Volume of catalpol has increased by 700 % in 168 hours; volume of caffeic acid has increased in 260 % in the same timeframe. On the contrary, oxaloacetic acid decreases the volume of caffeic acid in comparison to control sample.

40|$|In this report, a {{rapeseed}} (Brassica napus) haem oxygenase- 1 gene BnHO 1 was cloned and sequenced. It shared high homology with Arabidopsis HY 1 proteins, and encodes a 32. 6 kDa protein with a 54 -amino-acid transit peptide, {{predicting the}} mature protein of 25. 1 kDa. The mature BnHO 1 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibits haem oxygenase (HO) activity. Furthermore, {{the application of}} lower doses of NaCl (10 mM) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (2 %) mimicked the inducible effects of <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and the HO- 1 inducer haemin on the up-regulation of BnHO 1 and subsequent lateral root (LR) formation. Contrasting effects were observed when a higher dose of NaCl or PEG was applied. The above inducible and inhibitory responses were blocked significantly when the HO- 1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) or haemin was applied, {{both of which were}} reversed by the application of carbon monoxide or ZnPPIX, respectively. Moreover, the addition of ZnPPIX at different time points during LR formation indicated that BnHO 1 might be involved {{in the early stages of}} LR formation. The auxin response factor transcripts and the auxin content in seedling roots were clearly induced by lower doses of salinity or osmotic stress. However, treatment with the inhibitor of polar auxin transport N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid prevented the above inducible responses conferred by lower doses of NaCl and PEG, which were further rescued when the treatments were combined with haemin. Taken together, these results suggested a novel role of the rapeseed HO- 1 gene in salinity and osmotic stress-induced LR formation, with a possible interaction with auxin signalling...|$|E
40|$|While {{earthworms}} {{are known}} to improve plant growth by improving {{the structure of the}} soil, recent work has suggested that earthworms also produced humic substances endowed with hormone-like activity. Suspensions of Daucus carota (carrot) cells were treated with auxin derivatives (2, 4 -D= 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, IAA=indole- 3 -acetic acid and NAA= 1 - <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid)</b> and a humic substance of low molecular weight (HEf), obtained from the faeces of the earthworms Nicodrilus caliginosus and Allolobophora rosea, which have auxin-like activity. HEf, at a concentration of 200 mg C l ÿl, caused an increase in carrot cell growth, determined by packed cell volumes, similar to that of 2, 4 -D, and morphological changes induced by HEf were similar to those induced by IAA. Humic matter and the tested auxin derivatives stimulated carrot cell glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), glutamine synthetase (GS) and malic dehydrogenase (MDH) to various extents. When carrot cells were treated with HEf or IAA, GDH and MDH isoenzymes separated by isoelectrofocusing showed similar polymorphism. The addition of HEf or auxin derivatives to carrot cells caused an increase in free amino acids belonging to the oxaloacetate and a- ketoglutarate pathways. Our results showed that HEf a 8 ̆ 0 ects nitrate metabolism, has auxin-like activity, was strongly acidic and had elevated peptide, carbohydrate and aliphatic C contents. Our work has con®rmed that the e 8 ̆ 0 ective materials in the HEf were highly acidic and of low molecular weight. We conclude that, in addition to the already well established modes of action, earthworms are important in humogenesis because their faeces contained humic substances that can in¯uence plant growth via physiological effects...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the role}} of the {{recently}} identified class of phytohormones, strigolactones, in shaping root architecture was addressed. Primary root lengths of strigolactone-deficient and -insensitive Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were shorter than those of wild-type plants. This was accompanied by a reduction in meristem cell number, which could be rescued by application of the synthetic strigolactone analog GR 24 in all genotypes except in the strigolactone-insensitive mutant. Upon GR 24 treatment, cells in the transition zone showed a gradual increase in cell length, resulting in a vague transition point and an increase in transition zone size. PIN 1 / 3 / 7 -green fluorescent protein intensities in provascular tissue of the primary root tip were decreased, whereas PIN 3 -green fluorescent protein intensity in the columella was not affected. During phosphatesufficient conditions, GR 24 application to the roots suppressed lateral root primordial development and lateral root forming potential, leading to a reduction in lateral root density. Moreover, auxin levels in leaf tissue were reduced. When auxin levels were increased by exogenous application of <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> GR 24 application had a stimulatory effect on lateral root development instead. Similarly, under phosphate-limiting conditions, endogenous strigolactones present in wild-type plants stimulated a more rapid outgrowth of lateral root primordia when compared with strigolactone-deficient mutants. These results suggest that strigolactones are able to modulate local auxin levels and that the net result of strigolactone action is dependent on the auxin status of the plant. We postulate that the tightly balanced auxin-strigolactone interaction is the basis for the mechanism of the regulation of the plants' root-to-shoot ratio. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.

40|$|Phosphate (P) {{supply is}} one of the major {{determining}} factors to plant productivity, since the element affects the growth and the development of plants. In response to Pdeficiency treatment, plants display alterations in root system architecture caused by changes in primary root (PR) and lateral root (LR) length and LR density. In this thesis, the root growth of the agronomically important legume, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was found to be slightly stimulated in terms of PR length, LR number and total LR length when plants were grown in a P-deficient media (0. 01 mM orthophosphate; Pi) when compared with plants grown in a P-sufficient media (1. 00 mM Pi) when using a hydroponic growth system. When plants are grown in a P-sufficient media, treatment with 100 nM exogenous 1 - aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) and exogenous auxin (5 nM 1 - <b>naphthylacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> NAA) resulted in significant increases in white clover PR length, LR number and LR length. However, when ethylene action or auxin transport were inhibited using 300 ppm 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) and 100 nM 1 -Nnaphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), respectively, root growth was significantly reduced which suggests roles for ethylene and auxin in mediating white clover root growth. To examine the effects of these hormones on plants grown in P-deficient media, 100 nM ACC treatment significantly enhanced the stimulatory effects of growth on Pdeficient media only, while exposure of plants to P-deficiency alone was sufficient to significantly neutralise the inhibitory effects of 1 -MCP on root growth. Hence, exposure to P-deficiency is proposed to increase either ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene sensitivity in white clover roots. In contrast, for plants grown in P-deficient media, treatment with 5 nM NAA significantly abolished the stimulation of white clover root growth observed with P-deficiency so it is proposed that exposure to Pdeficiency increases either auxin biosynthesis or auxin sensitivity, but the 5 nM NAA concentration used was too high to stimulate root growth. Using DR 5 p::GUS transgenic white clover, auxin activity was found in the root tips and root primordia. Using these plants, it is suggested that P-deficient treatment and ACC treatment influenced white clover root growth through an increase in auxin sensitivity. Overall, ethylene and auxin are found to be essential in mediating white clover root growth in P-sufficiency, and also in mediating root responses to P-deficiency through changes in terms of the biosynthesis and the sensitivity of these two hormones...|$|E
