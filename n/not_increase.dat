Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production. With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E

5|$|During a Twitter {{conversation}} with fellow comic writer Joe Hill in 2013, Moore mentioned sales of Rachel Rising had fallen {{and he may}} have to cancel it if they fell any further. Concerned fans responded by using the #SaveRachelRising hashtag in an effort to show support and promote the book. Afterwards the sales stopped falling, but they did <b>not</b> <b>increase.</b> In January 2016, Moore announced the series would end at issue 42.|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, but much of the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening of a stretch near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Milnrow {{during the}} Middle Ages was a hamlet located within the {{township}} of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale. It was named by the Anglo-Saxons, but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, the descendants of these families successfully agitated for a chapel of ease to be constructed in Milnrow by {{the banks of the}} River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Despite this distinction, Milnrow did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> much further in size or population until the dawn of the woollen trade in the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 a {{longitudinal}} study was conducted at the University of Kansas, the first large-scale evaluation of Sesame Street's cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's school readiness. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, {{but they did not}} watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching Sesame Street daily did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 provincial elections, in {{the face}} of {{competition}} from four new ethnocentric competitors, none of which won a seat, the Centre Democrats did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> its three-seat presence in the provincial parliament. In the 1998 local elections the Centre Democrats lost all but one of its seats, having contested the election in just around half of the municipalities it contested in 1994. In the 1998 general election two months later, the party lost all its seats in Parliament. This was {{as a result of the}} Centre Democrats's failure to benefit from increased attention on immigration issues, its years of internal infighting, and new legislation directed mainly against the far-right, which had raised the number of signatures per district required in order to contest elections.|$|E

5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E
5|$|Risk is an {{essential}} element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E

A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success, though it did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.|$|E
5|$|Tet had {{a similar}} effect on Australian public opinion, and caused growing {{uncertainty}} in the government about {{the determination of the}} United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel. The war continued without respite however, and between May and June 1968 1 ATF was again deployed away from Phuoc Tuy in response to intelligence reports of another impending offensive. The Australians subsequently took up positions north-east of Saigon during Operation Toan Thang I to interdict communist lines of communication, fighting a series of significant actions over a 26-day period that became known as the Battle of Coral–Balmoral.|$|E

The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> egg or clutch size.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} meat ants {{depends on what}} {{resource}} they are dealing with. In one study, the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did <b>not</b> <b>increase</b> with mealworm baits, suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants and other species, and factors, such as food preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves.|$|E
