25|$|Superintendent Spence informs Hercule Poirot of {{the case}} of Mrs McGinty, an elderly charwoman, {{apparently}} killed by her lodger, James Bentley, for her savings of £30, which she kept under a floorboard. Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not think he is guilty. Poirot agrees {{to go to the}} town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> talk to Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E
25|$|Season 5 follows two {{timeline}}s. The first timeline {{takes place}} on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with Richard Alpert, one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> return. The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 {{to return to the}} island and in order to go back, they have to take John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, in which they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by Daniel Faraday that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
500|$|Weiner {{was fascinated}} by the presences of the Richard Speck murders in the media, despite the 40 race riots {{occurring}} in America around the same time. [...] "Part of that force is the sex drive. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be a victim of that, {{but when you look at}} Pauline's interest in the murders, it's sexual. It's such a deep touchstone of creepiness," [...] he noted.|$|E
50|$|A {{couple of}} days later he died from {{injuries}} he sustained from the brutal beating. His alleged attackers never went <b>to</b> trial because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> witness. The once high-profile case remains unsolved.|$|R

500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 2009, {{the band}} {{released}} their sixth studio album internationally via Roadrunner Records, titled Wrath {{and one day}} later in America via Epic Records. The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia, PA. In November 2008, Bronsnan {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get to where we are in our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hear another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it." [...] "Wrath" [...] debuted on the Billboard 200 at number two, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week.|$|E
500|$|The team {{began working}} six-day weeks by late 2000. By 2001, {{the team was}} working 12- to 16-hour days and 6- to 7-day weeks. Hall {{described}} weekly bug meetings before release: [...] "you see 100 bugs {{at the start of}} the week, fix the 80 you can replicate, and then meet the next Monday to address the 200 bugs they found, fix the 160 you can replicate, then meet to discuss the 400 they found...the time in-between is scary. Usually, the programmers find the bug, then stumble out of their cube, 'we were SO lucky to find that' or 'how did that EVER work?' It's like some bizarre divination method that no one is quite sure how it finds things, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> 'disturb the mojo'." [...] Several Internet rumors that Ion Storm would soon close spread in May 2001. By June 2001, all dialogue had been recorded and Ion Storm was working on balancing, playtesting, and adjusting gameplay; release was set for the next month. Anachronox went gold and shipped to manufacturers in late June.|$|E

500|$|After {{yet another}} attack at the Krusty Krab by Plankton, SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs why they hate each other. Mr. Krabs tells {{his side of}} the story, in a series of flashbacks. In the flashback, Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth, and did {{everything}} together. One day, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and being located in a landfill, is very popular among the local children due to being the only place in town to get a burger. When Stinky refuses to give them a burger Plankton and Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves, and create their own burger, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> try it. They then find out that the local health department closed Stinky's, so the two open [...] "Plabs Burgers" [...] at the dump, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's. Plankton says that they are now ruling the children. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon they get into an argument, and Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as we were hoping, and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see the next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah with a sense of humor, and I love the idea of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E

5000|$|Keys {{said that}} the idea of the song was {{inspired}} by Aaliyah's death: [...] "The song idea came together right after Aaliyah passed away.

2500|$|The Agent : Tender's {{publicity}} agent. His name is {{also not}} given. The agent is the brains behind Tender's popularity. He comes up with the ideas that Tender is credited for, such as his autobiography, the [...] "Book of Very Common Prayer", and the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill. [...] He is also responsible for Tender's physical transformation, claiming that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> listen to a fat messiah. [...] He also believes {{that the key to}} Tender's success is to get as much publicity as possible. [...] The agent dies from inhaling the same poisonous gas that killed Tender's caseworker, also attributable to Adam.|$|E
2500|$|Imagine {{that during}} the winter couples {{do not want to}} go out, but want to acquire more scrip for the summer. To compensate, the {{administration}} can lower the amount of extra scrip returned when parents want to borrow in the winter, and increase rates in the summer. [...] Depending upon the strength of the seasonality of babysitting, this might work. [...] But suppose the seasonality is so strong that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go out in the winter even when the administration sets its interest rates to zero. That is, suppose no parents want to go out even when they can borrow money for free. In this hypothetical situation, the co-op has fallen into a liquidity trap.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the NBC sketch series Saturday Night Live {{featured}} {{a parody of}} MacGyver called [...] "MacGruber" [...] with Will Forte as the title character. The intros for these skits featured scenes from the MacGyver series. MacGruber and cohorts are always locked in a control room of some type with a bomb set to go off in 15–20 seconds. MacGruber has his co-stars hand him components to defuse the device, but something inevitably {{gets in the way}} (either situational, because MacGruber himself interferes, or because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> touch what he has asked for) and the bomb detonates. In the March 7, 2009 installment of the [...] "MacGruber" [...] sketches, it was revealed that MacGyver is MacGruber's long-lost father. In 2010 the character was featured in its own R-rated spinoff movie, entitled MacGruber; the film was released by Rogue Pictures.|$|E
50|$|The most {{unconventional}} method however, {{was having}} the engineers lay landmines on the back trails, with the trigger points set back about 50 yards, thus ensuring that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would actually get hurt.

50|$|Notably, the Cameron Highlanders {{were the}} last battalions that wore the kilt in battle, due to the {{purposeful}} delaying of orders by commanding officers in the battalions (<b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give up the kilt) and a surprise attack by the Germans (successfully repelled).

During the opening days in Afghanistan, we deployed some SF teams without a CCT, {{and the difference between}} those that had controllers and those that didn’t was dramatic. Quite frankly <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go to war without them. They are admired, capable, and requested at a rate far greater than we could ever provide. Their efforts were critical {{in the early days of}} OEF and still are. Here is another force [...] true impact on the battlefields around the world will never be known or appreciated. They are absolutely phenomenal." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Everybody is {{born to be}} a genius. If a child's talent cannot blossom the way it should, {{that is not the}} child's fault, but {{the school}} system and the {{environment}} he lives in. The responsibility of the parent is tiny, because most parents have never been trained to be teachers. When something is wrong with our car, our watch or our house, we call a professional to fix it. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> repair these himself. In modern society, {{it is not enough to}} love the children. No seed will become a flower just because it gets love. It also needs professional care and nursing to bloom. So if we do not nurse and protect the child's talent, he will become a gloomy adult and the whole world will be poorer. The true values of a nation are in the souls and minds of its people, not in the vaults of the National Bank." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hashizume and Ida begin {{searching for}} a place to live together, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> rent an {{apartment}} to two unrelated men, saying they would be messy and less reliable for payments and renewing. Kobayashi wonders if it's an excuse to avoid renting to a gay couple. Ida suggests one of them adopt the other, which would be the equivalent of gay marriage. This would also allow them to say that they are brothers for the purposes of renting. Hashizume initially rejects the idea, causing Ida to think he does not love him. They have an argument in which Ida accuses Hashizume of having never said [...] "I love you" [...] and Hashizume ends up slapping Ida and running off. Crying alone, Ida remembers how they first became a couple and that Hashizume said the words the first time they kissed. Hashizume returns, bringing the adoption forms as well as an old marriage registry showing he had wanted the same thing for a long time.|$|E
