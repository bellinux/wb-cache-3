Its name was changed in 1988 to SoundView Technology Group, when Gartner was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. Soundview was unique in that it combined accepted Wall Street research and distribution methods, with the intimate (albeit [...] "arms length") relationship with Gartner analysts, and arguably became the leading technology research boutique on Wall Street.

40|$|Abstract—Since the 1980 s, {{banks and}} <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> {{institutions}} {{have been running}} in an endless race of innovation {{to cope with the}} advancing technology, the fierce competition, and the more sophisticated and demanding customers. In order to guide their innovation efforts, several researches were conducted to identify the success and failure factors of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> These mainly included organizational factors, marketplace factors and new service development process factors. They almost all emphasized the importance of customer and market orientation {{as a response to the}} highly perceptual and intangible characteristics of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> However, they deemphasized the critical characteristics of high involvement of risk and close correlation with the economic conditions, a factor that heavily contributed to the Global financial Crisis of 2008.

Thus there is a pressing need to examine the best ways of designing and introducing <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> products into MFIs. This paper is written {{on the basis of the}} experience of BURO, Tangail a Bangladeshi MFI committed to providing flexible and responsive financial services to its clients and operating in what is perhaps the most competitive market in the world of MicroFinance. Having long been a market leader in open access voluntary savings accounts, BURO, Tangail is currently testing a wide variety of savings and loan products. The methods used to develop these broadly followed four key phases of financial service product development: 1. Research to identify needs and opportunities, 2. Design and pilot testing, 3. Monitoring and evaluation of the pilot test, and finally 4. Revision and scaled-up implementation. These are examined with additional material and insights from a recent series of studies of successful innovative and poor-responsive banks financed by GTZ as part of the work of the CGAP’s “Financial Instruments (Savings Mobilization) Working Group”, and Marguerite Robinson’s work on Bank Raykat Indonesia.

40|$|A {{review of}} the various models of New Product Development (NPD) process shows that {{although}} different approaches have been proposed, {{they are in fact}} all variants on a linear theme: some may include feedback loops, but they all essentially advocate that certain steps precede, or are preceded by, others. An inevitable consequence on the Internet/World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is that such models are no longer applicable. Based on the lessons learned from the development of a <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> offered via the Internet, we show how such assumptions of linearity need no longer be a constraint. In addition, innovativeness is not related to firm size. But the fact that the Web allows for the real-time development of new financial services based on on-going feedback from potential and current customers raises a new set of managerial issue that have to be tackled.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the determinants of non-interest income in Tunisian banks and to test the effect of non-interest income on the risk-performance. To this end, we have used annual data related to 20 Tunisian banks during the period 2005 – 2015. The econometric method served in this paper is the dynamic panel data analysis; precisely we performed the GMM in system method. Empirical results indicate that main determinants of non-interest income are bank specifics such as bank size, liquidity risk, capital adequacy ratio and loan specialization. As for technological innovations proxied by ATM and credit cards, the results show that they are positively associated with NII and bank performance as well (ROA/ROE) but their coefficients are small. Here, it is obvious that technology has an important role in promoting banks ‘revenues but we recommend Tunisia’ bankers to integrate more technological innovations in their business activities and to introduce <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> channels and products to their customers. Banks must follow the new business model in which Tunisian people are living (Internet, mobile phone, e-business, etc.) and to promote the widespread use of these financial and technological innovations at an affordable cost.|$|E

Summary Economic integration within and across countries, deregulation, advances in telecommunications, {{and the growth of}} the Internet and wireless communication technologies are dramatically changing the structure and nature of financial services. Internet and related technologies are more than just new distribution channels—they are a different way of providing financial services. Using credit scoring and other data mining techniques, for example, providers can create and tailor products without much human input and at very low cost. They can also better stratify their customer base and allow consumers to build preference profiles online. This not only permits the personalization of information and services, it also allows much more personalized pricing of financial services and much more effective identification of credit risks. At the same time, the Internet allows <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> providers to compet...|$|E

40|$|In {{the much}} of the popular media, the {{discourse}} around Africa has changed. Whereas stories of the “coming anarchy” or the “hopeless continent” abounded {{a little over a}} decade ago, it was, until the recent collapse in commodity prices, increasingly seen as the final global investment frontier, with rapid uptake of cellular technology and economic growth. Although much of this growth has been propelled by natural resources, the current conjuncture offers opportunities as well as challenges for African urban areas and raises questions about the role of cities in the continent’s future development as they continue to become more deeply informalised. The response of many city authorities to the deepening informalisation of their economies has been to try to connect to the global economy in new ways, through the creation of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service,</b> high-tech and elite residential areas. In this paper we explore these developments through the Foucaudian lens of heterotopia. These new developments attempt to erase their associations with the cities from which they originate in favour of new connections outwards. However the creation of these new enclaves is filled with socio-spatial contradictions, which make them unlikely to achieve their ostensible objectives...|$|E
40|$|This article {{theoretically}} and empirically {{examines the}} antecedents {{and consequences of}} project learning during the <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> innovation process. We analyze the impact of project learning on project performance and performance of the financial institution. Next we investigate the antecedent role {{of the nature of}} communication and organizational design on project learning. Following the development of a propositional framework, a survey research has been developed within the Belgian banking industry. Our research findings indicate that the level of project learning contributes to the corporate reputation of the financial institution. Moreover, learning during project innovation enhances the cost and the competitive position of the innovating bank. Our study empirically supports the crucial influence of management support, harmonious cross-functional interfaces, organizational diversity and participative decision-making on the level of project learning. Both innovative and coordinative communication are needed to balance the information needs throughout the innovation process. However, our findings underline the fact that the impact of innovative communication on the level of project learning is contingent upon the quality of the planning stage. The up-front activities of the innovation process seem to have an important leveraging effect on learning, and hence on project and bank performance. ...|$|E
40|$|A general {{belief is}} that Mobile Money (mMoney) has the {{catalytic}} effect of spurring mCommerce growth and driving financial inclusion in developing nations like Nigeria. In Nigeria, mMoney service is certainly a <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> innovation in the country, {{and as a result}} critical issues surrounding its early critical mass adoption, including its perceived usefulness, remain largely opaque. In this paper, our aim was to explore factors influencing perceived usefulness of mMoney by using the extended technology acceptance model (TAM) as the theoretical underpinning of our work. This work is based on a usable sample of 127 respondents from two major cities in Nigeria. Overall, the study’s results indicate that perceived regulator assurance, service affordability, convenience, proximity to the nearest bank branch, and worry over ease of use are significant predictors of mMoney perceived usefulness. The work helps shed new insights about the significant factors that are closely related to the consumer’s perception of the relevance of mMoney services (to his/her financial needs). In sum, the study is an initial step to addressing the issue of perceived usefulness of mMoney service, including its pivotal importance to laying a solid foundation for mCommerce growth in Nigeria and similar sub-Saharan African (SSA) coun-tries...|$|E
40|$|Innovation and {{customer}} relationships have been increasingly regarded as two critical elements to achieve long-term success for companies.

However, few articles discussed the issues by integrated these two notions. This research is aimed {{to understand the nature of}} changes in the relationship between customers and suppliers caused by the introduction of new services, and explore the impacts due to different types of new services. A case study research on a Taiwanese bank was selected to study the changes in customer relationships after the launch of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> According to the results, the effects of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> on customer relationships are presented in three dimensions, which are relationship drivers, relationships constructs and role of employees. Further, trust is related to the supplier itself instead of new services.

Therefore, companies should be aware of different impacts on customer relationships when implementing service innovations...|$|R
