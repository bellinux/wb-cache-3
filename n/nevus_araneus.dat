50|$|A spider angioma (also {{known as}} a <b>nevus</b> <b>araneus,</b> spider nevus, {{vascular}} spider, and spider telangiectasia) {{is a type of}} telangiectasis (swollen blood vessels) found slightly beneath the skin surface, often containing a central red spot and reddish extensions which radiate outwards like a spider's web. They are common and may be benign, presenting in around 10-15% of healthy adults and young children. However, having more than three spider angiomas is likely to be abnormal and may be a sign of liver disease. It also suggests the probability of esophageal varices.|$|E
