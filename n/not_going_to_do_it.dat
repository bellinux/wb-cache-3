500|$|While flirting, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) reveals he {{is ready}} to propose to Pam, even going as far as telling her that he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at work ("because that would be rather lame") and when he does it, it will [...] "kick her ass". Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an {{engagement}} ring that he bought [...] "the week after [...] started dating." [...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand. [...] At the end of the episode, Michael and Dwight are seen singing [...] "American Pie" [...] and dancing in the same cemetery at night, presumably having never left.|$|E

You {{could have}} said, 'I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> This is wrong for Canada, and I {{am not going}} to ask Canadians to pay the price.' You had an option, sir—to say 'no'—and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That, sir, if I may say respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Guardian in July 2013 promoting The World's End with Edgar Wright and Nick Frost, Pegg stated: [...] "Whenever we get asked about... another series of Spaced... {{one of the reasons}} we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is because we couldn't possibly write it with any degree of truth now, because that's not where we are or who we are any more. I always find it's better to write from a perspective of truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Behavioral {{psychology}} {{approaches to}} stock market trading are {{among some of}} the more promising alternatives to EMH (and some investment strategies seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies). But Nobel Laureate co-founder of the programme Daniel Kahneman —announced his skepticism of investors beating the market: [...] "They're [...] just <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> [...] It's just not going to happen." [...] Indeed, defenders of EMH maintain that Behavioral Finance strengthens the case for EMH in that it highlights biases in individuals and committees and not competitive markets. For example, one prominent finding in Behaviorial Finance is that individuals employ hyperbolic discounting. It is demonstrably true that bonds, mortgages, annuities and other similar financial instruments subject to competitive market forces do not. Any manifestation of hyperbolic discounting in the pricing of these obligations would invite arbitrage thereby quickly eliminating any vestige of individual biases. Similarly, diversification, derivative securities and other hedging strategies assuage if not eliminate potential mispricings from the severe risk-intolerance (loss aversion) of individuals underscored by behavioral finance. On the other hand, economists, behaviorial psychologists and mutual fund managers are drawn from the human population and are therefore subject to the biases that behavioralists showcase. By contrast, the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the Behavioral Finance programme. Richard Thaler has started a fund based on his research on cognitive biases. In a 2008 report he identified complexity and herd behavior as central to the global financial crisis of 2008.|$|E

6000|$|... "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything," [...] he said half-coherently. [...] "I'll {{give myself}} up. I can't {{stay here and}} make trouble for the boys." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig {{was asked if}} he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make another Danzig record after Deth Red Sabaoth. His response was, [...] "I don't know, we'll see. With the way record sales are now...I won't do some stupid pro-tool record in someone's living room where all the drum beats are stolen from somebody and just mashed together...and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that if I can't do a record how I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and if it's not financially feasible, I'm just <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one." ...|$|R

6000|$|Whilst {{his friend}} was vaunting his courage, Harry looked, {{to say the}} truth, by no means courageous.
