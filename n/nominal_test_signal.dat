40|$|Abstract. For {{multi-channel}} process, due to {{disadvantages of}} the open-loop single variable step method, multi-channel test method is used. That means {{all of the}} channels are tested at the same time. In order to eliminate cross-effect of the different <b>test</b> <b>signals,</b> it requires that all the <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> are uncorrelated. Several <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> are introduced and analyzed. Based on two familiar identifi-cation methods: correlation analysis method and least-squares method, we put our strength {{on the way to}} get uncorrelated <b>test</b> <b>signals.</b> A novel design for the period length of uncorrelated pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) is pro-posed.

We find the optimal linear estimator and its associated <b>test</b> <b>signal,</b> which together minimises mean-squared error of the channel estimate. Ths optimization is carried out under the assumption that we know the autocovariance (or power spectrum) of the interfering noise and autocovariance of the echo channel. The <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> is also assumed to be constrained by a bound on total energy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â ADC testing {{frequently}} {{confronts the}} problem of spectral purity of harmonic <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> The majority of dynamic ADC test methods require <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> distortion at least 10 dB {{less than that of}} the tested ADC â the condition that cannot be practically fulfilled for testing up-to-date ADCs.

40|$|A {{time-varying}} {{acoustic channel}} may be estimated by an appropriate inference using the output from a periodic <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> In this paper it is shown {{how to do}} this in a way that takes full account of the past history of the background noise and the past history of the channel. An explicit formula is obtained for the optimal linear estimator that may be used for rapid channel estimation for a given <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> when we know the autocovariance or power spectrum of the interfering noise and the autocovariance of the echo channel variation. Given this closed formula for the optimal estimator of the channel impulse response, an efficient method for determining the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal,</b> subject to a constraint on the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> power, given the history of the channel and the noise, is developed. We show that if the second order statistics of the channel or the noise are known, then the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> is not white. The method includes an explicit formula for the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> given a fixed estimator. A model of channel variation which is realistic while having less complexity than a full second-order statistical model, and therefore is more amenable to robust estimation, is used in the experiments which illustrate the performance of the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> and the channel estimation method. Matrix calculus identities required for the derivation of this expression for the optimal estimator are stated and proved in the Appendixes 1 and 2. ...|$|R

40|$|The rotor {{position}} of a salient-pole permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) at standstill or rotating at low speed is often estimated by measuring the responses on high-frequency <b>test</b> <b>signals.</b> In some drives, the rotor position is computed by measuring important current ripples that are generated by supplying the PMSM periodically with high-frequency voltage test pulses. Besides these ripples, undesired distortions in the average-current samples have been measured. Simulation results have revealed that these distortions are caused by a <b>test</b> <b>signal,</b> as it produces a nonzero voltage deviation from the steady-state stator voltage. In this paper, a low-speed sensorless strategy is discussed where a strong reduction of the aforementioned distortions is obtained by adapting the <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> to the steady-state stator voltage. The main assumption is that an accurate estimation of the steady-state voltage is made by using the controller output.

40|$|Although {{the primary}} purpose of the signal {{received}} by amobile handset or smartphone is to enable wireless communication, the information extracted can be reused to provide a number of additional services. Two such services discussed in this thesis are: mobile speed estimation and signal anomaly detection. The proposed algorithms exploit the propagation environment specific information that is already imprinted on the received signal and therefore do not incur any additional signalling overhead. Speed estimation is useful for providing navigation and location based services in areas where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) based devices are unusable while the proposed anomaly detection algorithms can be used to locate signal faults and aid spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems. The speed estimation algorithms described within this thesis require a receiver with at least two antenna elements and a wideband radio frequency (RF) signal source. The channel transfer function observed at the antenna elements are compared to yield an estimate of the device speed. The basic algorithm is a one-dimensional and unidirectional two-antenna solution. The speed of the mobile receiver is estimated from a knowledge of the fixed inter-antenna distance and the time it takes for the trailing antenna to sense similar channel conditions previously observed at the leading antenna. A by-product of the algorithm is an environment specific spatial correlation function which may be combined with theoretical models of spatial correlation to extend and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Results obtained via computer simulations are provided. The anomaly detection algorithms proposed in this thesis highlight unusual signal features while ignoring events that are <b>nominal.</b> When the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> possesses a periodic frame structure, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) analysis is employed to statistically compare successive signal frames. A method of automatically extracting the required frame period information from the signal is also provided. When the <b>signal</b> under <b>test</b> lacks a periodic frame structure, information content analysis of signal events can be used instead. Clean training data is required by this algorithm to initialise the reference event probabilities. In addition to the results obtained from extensive computer simulations, an architecture for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based hardware implementations of the KLD based algorithm is provided. Results showing the performance of the algorithms against real <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> captured over the air are also presented. Both sets of algorithms are simple, effective and have low computational complexity â implying that real-time implementations on platforms with limited processing power and energy are feasible. This is an important quality since location based services are expected to be an integral part of next generation cognitive radio handsets.
