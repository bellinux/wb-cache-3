5|$|From the league's {{founding}} in 1920 until 1932, {{there was no}} scheduled championship game. From 1920–1923, the championship was awarded to a team {{by a vote of}} team owners at the annual owners' meeting. From 1924–1932, the team having the best winning percentage was awarded the championship. As each team played a different number of games, simply counting wins and losses would have been insufficient. Additionally, tie games were <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> in the standings in figuring winning percentage (under modern rules, ties count as ½ win and ½ loss).|$|E

Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E

5|$|At the Republican State Convention on March 22, 2014, Baker {{received}} 2,095 votes (82.708%), Fisher received 374 votes (14.765%) {{and there}} were 64 blank votes (2.527%). The threshold for making the ballot is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Wilfrid Laurier, the Northwest Territories seat of government was moved to Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada. This change was made when Northwest Territories defaulted back to the 1870 constitutional status after Alberta and Saskatchewan were sectioned off from the territory on September 1, 1905. After the populated regions of the territory were made into their own jurisdictions, there were very few settlements left in the territory with any significant population or infrastructure. The non-Inuit population was estimated to total around 1,000. Inuit were <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> at the time because they had no status under Canadian law, and were not yet settled in towns or villages.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, {{the tournament}} was {{played in a}} {{round-robin}} format, consisting of a preliminary round and a medal round. The medals were awarded based on win–loss records during the medal round. This format was used until 1988, {{although the number of}} teams and games played varied slightly. The Toronto Granites, representing Canada, became one of the dominant hockey teams in Olympic history, outscoring opponents 110–3, led by Harry Watson, who scored 36 goals. The United States won silver and Great Britain won bronze. Watson's 36 goals remains the tournament record for career goals. He also set the record for career points with 36 (assists were <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> at the time), which stood until 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, Sleeping Dogs was {{the best-selling}} {{game in the}} week of its release, and had the fifth-highest first-week sales of any game {{released}} in 2012.

Sleeping Dogs sales rose by 8%, despite five weeks in the chart, defeating new release Tekken Tag Tournament 2. Sleeping Dogs was the 20th best selling title of 2012 in the UK, and the best selling original game. According to NPD Group, Sleeping Dogs was the sixth-best selling game in the US in August 2012, at 172,000 copies.

5|$|Since {{there were}} no playoff system in the APFA until 1932, a meeting was held to {{determine}} the 1920 APFA Champions. Each team that showed up had a vote to determine the champions. The All-Americans stated that they should win the award because they had more wins and were not beaten by the Akron Pros. Since the Akron Pros had a 1.000 winning percentage, however, the Pros were awarded the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup on April 30, 1921. Ties were <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> in standings until 1972, which is why Akron is credited with a 1.000 winning percentage. The sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the All-Pro list for the 1920 season. No player from the All-Americans were on the list.|$|E

5|$|After regular {{ballots were}} counted, Pryce led Kilroy by over 3,500 votes with about 19,000 {{provisional}} ballots outstanding. The Franklin county absentee and provisional ballots were <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> until approximately {{two weeks after}} the election. On Monday November 27, nearly three weeks after Election Day, Pryce was declared the winner by a 1,054 vote margin that mandated a recount. After two recounts and all of the votes were counted, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce (R) prevailed over Democratic challenger Mary Jo Kilroy. The Franklin County Board of Elections announced the results Monday morning December 11, 2006. Pryce (R) gained 25 votes and Kilroy (D) gained 18 votes in the recount of votes in Franklin, Union, and Madison Counties in Ohio. Pryce won with 50.20% of the vote by a 110,739–109,677 margin. Kilroy felt her campaign was slowed by the early candidacy of fellow Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks, who eventually withdrew. Immediately after losing in 2006, she announced she would recontest the seat in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite an {{emergency}} appendectomy that delayed his spring training and shortened {{his time to}} get in shape for the season, Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and a participant in the 1988 All-Star Game, getting outs against all three batters. In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3–4 win–loss record with a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06. Following his August 14 start in which he left the game after two innings (his shortest appearance since 1985) with the Dodgers behind the Giants 8–2, he pitched complete games on August 19 (a shutout) and August 24. Prior to the game, Hershiser trailed teammate Tim Leary in shutouts, six to three, and Leary also combined with other pitchers to record a shutout that was <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> in his individual total.|$|E
5|$|Former WWF Champion Randy Savage was {{the last}} wrestler to enter the match. The wrestlers fought and several men were {{eliminated}} in quick succession, leaving Backlund, Martel, Yokozuna, and Savage. Backlund eliminated Martel but was then eliminated by Yokozuna. Backlund was in the ring for one hour, one minute, and ten seconds, which set a new record for time spent in a Royal Rumble match. Savage gained the advantage over Yokozuna; he knocked him down and performed a diving elbow drop from the top rope. He tried to pin Yokozuna, although pinfalls are <b>not</b> <b>counted</b> during a Royal Rumble. Yokozuna pushed Savage off of him so hard that Savage flew over the top rope and onto the arena floor. As a result, Yokozuna was named {{the winner of the}} 1993 Royal Rumble match. During the match, he eliminated seven wrestlers, which broke the previous record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match.|$|E
