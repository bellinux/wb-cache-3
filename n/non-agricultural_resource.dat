40|$|Stochastic {{dominance}} {{analysis was}} used to assess export performance in Papua New Guinea from 1960 to 1999. A country with abundant natural resources, Papua New Guinea was able to experience significant growth in total export values throughout the final four decades of the 20 th century, with each succeeding decade stochastically dominating the previous one. The expansion of mineral and energy exports from the early 1970 s was the major source of this growth. The powerful influence of an expanding minerals and energy sector must nevertheless be of concern in that this sector and other <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> sectors comprise mainly extractive or quasi-extractive industries given the production practices that currently exist. Little {{progress has been made in}} diversifying into secondary and tertiary exports. Furthermore, prospects for the mineral and energy sectors do not look bright, with a collapse of exploration and development in the mining industry (Duncan 2001 : 11). Growth also took place in agricultural export values during the study period. However, it was more modest than the growth in resource based non-agricultural exports and confined mainly to the 1960 s and 1970 s. export performance, Papua New Guinea, stochastic dominance, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{dominance}} {{analysis was}} used to assess export performance in two Melanesian countries of similar size and structure that are comparatively well endowed with natural resources: Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Total export values increased over the study period in Solomon Islands, brought about by {{a significant increase in the}} value of <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> exports. Agricultural exports showed small increases but the average annual rate of growth was only 1. 3 per cent for agricultural export values compared with 10. 7 per cent in non-agricultural export values. The record of commodity export performance in Vanuatu over the study period was less impressive, with a small average annual decline in total export values. This decline was caused by agricultural export values falling by 1. 5 per cent per annum although it showed signs of abating in the final decade of the study period. Results suggest that both countries are capable of achieving sustainable economic development, given their generous natural resource endowments, but many factors may militate against this achievement, as witnessed by the current political unrest and crisis in public finance in Solomon Islands. export performance, stochastic dominance, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|International trade theory {{suggests}} that trade can be advantageous to the industrial {{as well as to}} the underdeveloped countries. For the latter, specialization and exchange brings about an increase in total productions. Thailand, an underdeveloped country, has for the past decade experienced an unfavorable balance of trade. A primary producing country, Thailand principally exports rice, rubber, tin, and teak. Her principal imports are manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, mineral fuels, lubricants and chemicals. The thesis is intended to investigate the causes of this adverse balance of trade. Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s four principal exports accounted for an average of 74. 7 percent of the total export income during the past decade, while the four major import items comprised an average of 77. 1 percent of the total imports. Attempts will be made to examine Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s potential in agricultural and <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>resources</b> as well as in human resources and to examine the possibility of expanding agricultural export commodities in order to correct the unfavorable balance of trade...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe human diet was {{investigated}} using the carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of 93 Mesolithic and Neolithic specimens (not, vert, similar 10, 000 – 2000 BC) from the Meuse Basin (Belgium). During the Ancient Mesolithic period (not, vert, similar 9300 – 8000 BC), the environment was generally {{open and the}} main dietary protein was provided by hunted terrestrial mammals, with the possible addition of freshwater resources. Human remains are not available in the Meuse Basin from around 8000 BC to 4300 BC, thus preventing {{the study of the}} Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary transition in this region. Throughout the Middle Neolithic (not, vert, similar 4300 – 3000 BC), hunting was more difficult and less productive due to a densely forested environment. The contribution of freshwater resources to the diet increased, with the remaining proteins provided by terrestrial wild and/or domestic mammals, indicating that <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>resources</b> were not eliminated in this region during the Middle Neolithic period. The contribution of freshwater resources seems negligible in the Middle/Late and Late Neolithic periods (not, vert, similar 3300 – 1700 BC), with isotopic results revealing a diet composed of agricultural products. The δ 15 N values of infants are compatible with a weaning age at around 2 years. This study documents the dietary changes that occurred in Belgium during {{the first part of the}} Holocene, and reveals the subtle dietary distinction between wild and domestic terrestrial resources and freshwater resources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a first exploration into the potential effects of HIV/AIDS on {{the management and}} use of local <b>non-agricultural</b> natural <b>resources</b> (e. g. forests and grazing land). The main hypothesis is that HIV/AIDS affects the use and management of local natural resources not only via an increased demand for them {{as a source of}} food and income, but also via a disruption of the social control mechanisms that govern their use. A number of links between the direct effects of HIV/AIDS (such as reduced labour force and loss of leadership and traditional knowledge) and the institutions (rules, norms, traditions) that govern the use of local natural resources are examined. The main conclusions are that this is an alarmingly under-researched area, {{and that there is a}} serious risk that HIV/AIDS will become the true Tragedy of the Commons...|$|R
30|$|Finally, it is urgent {{to open up}} {{new areas}} of the economy to {{increase}} the TFP. At this stage of a typical dual economy, simply transferring labor can bring about a huge productivity spike, as there is surplus labor in agriculture and agricultural productivity is significantly lower than in <b>non-agricultural</b> industries. This <b>resource</b> reallocation efficiency gain {{has been an important}} driver of TFP growth over the past 30  years of China’s economic development. As China has now reached the Lewis point and agricultural labor surpluses are dwindling, large-scale labor transfers will inevitably slow down. This will also change the process whereby TFP is improved.|$|R

Based on the research that has been done can be some conclusions as follows: (1) The image landasat 8 are very supportive for the identification of agricultural land as it can record object kenampakkan well making it easier for the identification of agricultural land, this is indicated by the level of accuracy of 79. 8...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen {{major change in}} {{agricultural}} technologies as a consequence to various programs for an agricultural development in rural areas of Sabah. Villagers in Sabah have always been receptive to new agricultural technologies that promises to improve {{their standard of living}} and as a reflection from the promotion of new agricultural technologies, many peoples in rural areas in Sabah now working with a mix of traditional and modern technologies. Along with the adoption of modern technologies, there has been a rapid transformation to cash economy among rural areas in Sabah (Marten, 1990). However, most villagers in Sabah are still produce almost entirely for home consumption, although the other economic activity of rural peoples in Sabah is small-enterprises as well as “kedai kampung” or rural shop that is registered under the local registration authority. This means, meeting basic household food needs is still the priority of most farmers in Sabah. Most also produced as much as surplus as possible to meet cash needs generated by expanding public education, rural electrification, modern communication (e. g. Radio and Television), and modern transport. It confirmed that most rural societies in Sabah still run their subsistence agricultural economy as compared to cash economy, which generally in farm activities, men do the major task and the women do the very minor task. Alongside with the fact that in this post-modern world most rural society in Sabah involved in agricultural economy, rural population especially among youth has declined. This means that human force for agricultural sector is declined as well. Rural population in Sabah was declining due to migration of younger-age groups. Outward migration among them was caused by the economic purposes such as to find <b>non-agricultural</b> financial <b>resources</b> (work in government sector either in the white or blue collar works). As according to Bryden (2000) villagers often migrated because the trend in agricultural income that is reported as lower than income from other economic activities. Some of them were migrated to the urban areas when they employed as the non-government professional executive level and further their education. Some other (female) moved to follow husband. In short, they were migrated because of work-related reason and to get social fulfillment in the form of further education, social amenities and the family reason. This phenomenon in the future, out migration of youth will leave the youngsters and old folks to maintain the village and at the end, population of rural areas in Sabah will be increasingly independent. Village-base economy especially agricultural production will suffer when the active youth have left for the town. In the other hand, rural poverty profile that is currently high will be increased. Hence, commercialization of agricultural sectors in rural areas assumed as the best resolution to improve villager’s standard of living that is bring about transformation of rural agrarian society from the traditional society to modern agrarian society through contract farming system. ...|$|R
