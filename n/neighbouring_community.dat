2500|$|The {{next day}} on August 4 another call was made between Brantford's {{telegraph}} office and Melville House, where a large dinner party exchanged [...] "....speech, recitations, songs and instrumental music". To bring telephone signals to Melville House, Alexander Graham audaciously [...] "bought up" [...] and [...] "cleaned up" [...] the complete supply of stovepipe wire in Brantford. With {{the help of}} two of his parents' neighbours, he tacked the stovepipe wire some 400 metres (a quarter mile) {{along the top of}} fence posts from his parents' home to a junction point on the telegraph line to the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>community</b> of Mount Pleasant, which joined it to the Dominion Telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario.|$|E
2500|$|On a test {{call one}} week earlier on 3 August 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, {{spoke to him}} from the Brantford {{telegraph}} office, reciting lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet ("To be or not to be...."). The young inventor, positioned at the A. Wallis Ellis store in the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>community</b> of Mount Pleasant, listened to his uncle's voice emanating from his receiver housed in a metal box. Initially David Bell's voice couldn't be heard distinctly as [...] "...all kinds and sizes of wire [...] were used in stringing from the house to Mount Pleasant road". However, Walter Griffin, the Dominion Telegraph manager, decided to attach the telegraph line to a battery to see if it would improve the transmission, which it did, and [...] "the voices then came in distinctly." [...] That first Brantford call was followed the next day on 4 August during another call between Brantford's telegraph office and Melville House when a large dinner party, including members of the Cowherd family who would later manufacture phones for Bell in Canada's first telephone factory, provided [...] "....speech, recitations, songs and instrumental music" [...] that were transmitted to the Bell Homestead. [...] To bring telephone signals to Melville House, Alexander Graham audaciously [...] "bought up" [...] and [...] "cleaned up" [...] the complete supply of stovepipe wire within Brantford. With the help of two of Melville's neighbours, E. McIntyre and Thomas Brooks, he tacked the stovepipe wire some 800 metres (a half mile) along the top of fence posts from his parent's home to a junction point on the Mount Pleasant telegraph line, which joined that community to the Dominion Telegraph office in Brantford.|$|E
