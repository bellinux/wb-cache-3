The paper gives a {{definition}} of “news aggregators”, details the most famous of them, and lists some of the major problems which <b>news</b> <b>aggregators</b> are facing today. In addition, the article proves the thesis that <b>news</b> <b>aggregators</b> {{have a negative impact on}} the quality of news online. This is primarily due to the writing of the text for robots, not people, with a focus not on the quality and depth of the study, but the speed. Another major problem - the “theft” of news by websites-competitors and each other, as well as rewriting messages of various news services with a focus on sensationalism. All this leads to a general decline in the quality of journalistic texts on the Internet - in an effort to attract additional traffic news websites often the quality of materials are put into the background.

500|$|The HTC One shipped with Android 4.1.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] and version 5.0 of HTC’s {{proprietary}} Sense software suite. In {{comparison to}} previous {{versions of the}} software, Sense 5 uses a flat, minimalist visual style with refreshed icons and the condensed variant of the Roboto font family. Instead of a traditional home screen display with apps and widgets, Sense 5 defaults to a screen known as BlinkFeed, a <b>news</b> <b>aggregator</b> which displays a scrolling grid of news headlines from selected sources (as syndicated by Mobiles Republic) and social network content {{in a similar fashion}} to Flipboard and Windows Phone’s live tiles. New content is synchronized every two hours when connected to a mobile network, but more frequently while on Wi-Fi. Directly above the BlinkFeed display is a clock which displays the user’s local time and weather forecast; the signature flip clock widget seen on previous HTC devices was replaced by a simpler digital clock for Sense 5. Hundreds of different clock designs by HTC’s designers, narrowed down to 25, were considered before the final design was chosen. As with previous versions of Sense, users can still add or remove pages on the home screen for housing app shortcuts and widgets; one such page is provided by default, and which page to display by default can be set by the user. However, BlinkFeed will always occupy the leftmost page of the home screen. The application drawer uses a 3x4 grid to display application shortcuts by default, but can still be changed back to the denser 4x5 grid used by past versions. Apps can also be sorted into folders within the drawer; a number of preset folders are provided, such as [...] "Google", [...] "Media", [...] "Productivity", [...] "Tools", and pre-loaded apps provided by the user’s wireless carrier, where applicable.|$|E

A poll by Animage magazine of the top 100 anime characters of 2016 ranked Victor first, Yuri K. second and Yuri P. sixth. According to a Charapedia poll, Victor was 2016's fourth-most-attractive anime character; Yuri K. finished 12th and Yuri P. 19th in the poll. In a Anime News Network poll asking people which male anime characters they would most like to give Valentine's Day chocolates to, Victor came top and Yuri K. came second. Another poll reported that women considered the first and fourth episodes of the series {{to be the best}} anime epsidoes set at hot springs, while a different Anime News Network poll said that the first episode was the best anime episode set in a hot spring. In 2017, there are over 20 dedicated Yuri on Ice dōjinshi events planned in Japan. An all-night screening of the series and a talk show with writer Mitsurou Kubo and voice actors Toshiyuki Toyonaga, Junichi Suwabe, and Kouki Uchiyama (the voices of Yuri K., Victor and Yuri P., respectively) was held on February 11 at the TOHO cinema in Roppongi Hills, and was relayed live to 47 cinemas in Japan.

40|$|The {{newspaper}} {{industry has}} recently experienced economic difficulty. Profits have declined because fewer people read printed versions of newspapers, preferring instead {{to get their}} news through so-called “news aggregators” who compile newspaper headlines and provide links to storied posted on newspaper websites. This harms newspaper revenue because <b>news</b> <b>aggregators</b> collect advertising revenue that newspapers used to enjoy. Some have responded to this problem by advocating the use of copyright to give newspapers {{the ability to control}} the use of their stories and headlines by <b>news</b> <b>aggregators.</b> This proposal is controversial, for <b>news</b> <b>aggregators</b> often do not commit copyright infringement. Accordingly, the use of copyright to help the newspaper industry would likely require amendment of the existing statute. This Article analyzes the constitutionality of such potential legislation under the First Amendment. As the Article will show, legislation that treats news aggregation as copyright infringement changes the traditional contours of copyright in ways that expose copyright to serious First Amendment scrutiny. This analysis will show that Congress does not have a completely free hand in choosing how, if at all, to help the newspaper industry. In fact, Congress must be careful not to unduly restrict the practice of news aggregation...|$|R
