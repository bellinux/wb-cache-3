40|$|This study uses NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data {{covering}} the boreal winters of 1958 – 97 {{to examine the}} power spectral, timescale, and <b>climate</b> <b>noise</b> properties of the dominant atmospheric teleconnection patterns. The patterns examined include the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the Pacific–North American (PNA), and west Pacific (WP) teleconnections, and a spatial pattern associated with ENSO. The teleconnection patterns are identified by applying a rotated principal component analysis to the daily unfiltered 300 -mb geopotential height field. The NAO and PNA {{were found to be}} the two dominant patterns on all timescales. The main finding is that the temporal evolution of the NAO, PNA, and WP teleconnections can be interpreted as being a stochastic (Markov) process with an e-folding timescale between 7. 4 and 9. 5 days. The time series corresponding to the ENSO spatial pattern did not match that of a Markov process, and thus a well-defined timescale could not be specified. The shortness of the above timescales indicates that the excitation of these teleconnection patterns is limited to a period of time less than a few days. These findings also suggest that in order to improve our understanding of the growth and decay mechanisms of teleconnection patterns, it is best to use daily, unfiltered data, rather than monthly or seasonally averaged data. The signal (interannual variance due to external forcing) to noise (interannual variance from stochastic processes) ratios were also examined. For the NAO (PNA), the signal-to-noise ratio is 0. 09 (1. 11). This indicates that the interannual variability of the NAO (PNA) arises primarily from <b>climate</b> <b>noise</b> (both from <b>climate</b> <b>noise</b> and external forcing).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{urban areas}} the natural {{ventilation}} of buildings is often compromised by high traffic noise levels outside. Designing buildings to produce comfortable conditions {{without the need}} for air-conditioning is an important element in the effort to restrict energy use in order to combat global warming. Within a recently completed EC funded project 'URBVENT', a study was undertaken of the acoustic environment in the congested urban streets of Athens. A prediction technique was developed to estimate the noise level at various heights above the road in streets of different dimensions. Information gathered within an earlier EC funded project 'SCATS ' arising from extensive office comfort surveys and noise measurements in four EU countries has made it possible to estimate noise level which building occupants will find acceptable. This means that the potential for natural ventilation in terms of the <b>noise</b> <b>climate</b> can be predicted. The paper will also question whether an adaptive approach should be made to acceptable background noise levels with a variable rather than a single value being recommended for tolerable background level depending upon whether the building is in an urban or rural setting. 1.

The model uses sequential equilibrium between distribution and traffic assignment phases; it is national and inter-regional, involving strategic decision-making. The Colombian transport network consists of 27, 469 km of roads, 11, 257 km of navigable rivers, 2, 192 km of railway lines and a set of centroid connectors for establishing a link with the zoning system (consisting of 70 internal areas and 8 external areas). Each link in a network involves internal costs:   time, operation and external costs, congestion, accidents, air pollution and CO 2 emissions. Vehicle ownership costs were excluded from internal cost analysis; costs such as <b>noise,</b> <b>climate</b> change and effects on the landscape were not studied in external costs. Marginal costs regarding the network were estimated by two methods. First, it was assumed that an additional unit of demand did not affect equilibrium in a transport network and then marginal cost was estimated as being the sum of marginal costs regarding links in the shortest path. The other approach assumed that an additional unit of demand changed network equilibrium; marginal costs were then estimated by calculating {{the difference between the two}} equilibrium scenarios. The methods were applied to 7 selected routes covering the most important Colombian freight transport corridors.
