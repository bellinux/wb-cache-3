Field studies {{were conducted to}} assess tritrophic level effects of insecticide treated and untreated Bt and <b>non-Bt</b> sweet <b>corn</b> hybrids on the abundances, species diversity and functional processes of foliage-dwelling, aerial and soil surface arthropods. The diversity and abundance of decomposers, predators and parasitoids were determined by plant inspections, sticky card, and pitfall trap sampling for two years at two Maryland locations. Functional processes including predation, parasitism, reproduction and colonization were evaluated at one location over three years. Predation rates were estimated from sentinel egg masses of a lepidopteran; levels of parasitism were measured from naturally-occurring chrysopid eggs; emergence traps determined the recruitment rates of arthropods emerging from soil-litter; and litterbags measured arthropod colonization and litter degradation rates. Beneficial arthropod communities and functional processes were not significantly affected by exposure to Bt sweet corn. Insecticides significantly reduced arthropod diversity and abundance {{as well as the}} rate of predation, parasitism, colonization and recruitment of organisms. Less disruption occurred in Bt plots treated once than compared with non-Bt plots treated five times.

40|$|Mason,Charles E. The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), {{is a major}} {{lepidopteran}} pest {{of maize}} in the United States and Canada. One {{of the most effective}} control methods for ECB is the use of transgenic crops that encode for insecticidal crystalline (Cry) proteins that are derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The continued effective use of Bt corn relies on compliance with insect resistance management practices; where planting a small percentage of <b>non-Bt</b> refuge <b>corn</b> adjacent to or as seed blends within Bt corn fields provides a population of susceptible insects that can mate with rare resistant individuals. Little is known about how these non-Bt plant blends affect movement behaviors of ECB in the third instar, an intermediary stage where the larva begins to bore into corn stalks. The objective of my study was to assess and characterize the amount of movement off of infested plants in the field using a variety of five plant arrays containing lepidopteran Bt corn plants and non-lepidopteran protein marked refuge corn plants. Additional studies sought to determine the presence and persistence of three different Bt Cry proteins in third instars using monoclonal ELISA test strips. Based on two years of field movement studies I found that the range of third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a Cry 1 Ab corn plant is approximately 30 % to 65 %. The range for third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a Cry 1 F corn plant was approximately 20 % to 60 %, and that the range for third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a non-lepidopteran protein marked refuge corn plant was about 6 % to 18 %. The range of movement off of the infested plant for the protein marked refuge plants was consistent with that for near isoline control plants. The lepidopteran targeted Bt Cry proteins were found to be consistently detected for seven sampling points over a 24 hour feeding period. However, the non-lepidopteran Bt Cry proteins could not be consistently detected over the same 24 hour period. Additionally, the persistence of Bt plant material in third instars varied depending on the Cry protein. Future research using ELISA plate methods could yield more consistent results for the non-lepidopteran Bt Cry proteins. University of Delaware, Department of EntomologyM. S...|$|R

The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubialis (Hübner), is an herbivorous pest of over 200 {{documented}} hosts, especially corn (Zea mays L.), in the United States and Canada, and {{had been}} labeled a “generalist herbivore. ” The feeding behavior of insects, including ECB, depends on perception of multiple physical and chemical features presented by the plant and the insect’s response to these cues. Recently, in the United States {{there has been little}} evidence of ECB presence outside of cornfields. Generalist insect species have the ability to evolve over time into specialists when the focal plant is common, predictable and abundant. All of these criteria are met by corn in the United States. This study investigated the growth and survivorship of ECB on a range of hosts that vary in defensive chemistries and their preferences among these hosts (sweet corn, Cry 1 F Bt corn (maize), non-Bt near isoline maize, cucumber, squash, tomato, and green bean). Experiments were conducted in the growth chamber, greenhouse, and field to determine survival under different conditions.

The effectiveness of transgenic (Bt)-expressing (Cry 2 Ab/ 1 Ac) on C. carnea developmental parameters (larval duration, pupal duration, mortality %, pupation %, adult emergence %, and adult duration time) was investigated in the first experiment. In the second experiment, the effect of Bt Cry 2 Ab and Cry 1 Ac partially purified toxins on the hatchability of C. carnea eggs compared to cypermethrin was examined. Additionally, the toxicity effect of Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella, eggs sprayed with BtCry 2 Ab/ 1 Ac mixture and cypermethrin on C. carnea was tested.

Marked, laboratory-reared O. nubilalis larvae also were placed beneath drying corn ears to evaluate potential contamination of samples by larvae developing on <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn.</b> Both feral and laboratory-reared larvae were {{used to examine the}} causes and levels of mortality of larvae in drying bins. Screening of larvae on diet containing Cry 1 Ab failed to provide evidence of resistance, although insufficient inbred lines survived to make conclusions about the presence of resistance alleles in larvae originally collected beneath Bt corn. Both larvae from previously dried <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> and O. nubilalis moving between adjacent bins are potential sources of contamination of larvae collected beneath drying Bt corn. Exposure to conditions inside seed corn drying bins for 3 d significantly increased O. nubilalis mortality. Larvae collected beneath seed corn also showed infection by the pathogens Nosema pyrausta (Paillot) and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, with significant mortality apparently caused by B. bassiana. While contamination and mortality may limit the application of sampling beneath drying bins, several modifications could improve the potential utility of the technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{western corn rootworm}} (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) {{is serious}} pest of corn, {{particularly}} in the Midwestern United States. One strategy used to manage western corn rootworm is the planting of transgenic corn that produces one or more Cry toxins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Refuges of <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> function to delay the development of resistance to these toxins. The greatest delay in resistance development is expected when the inheritance of resistance is recessive and there are associated fitness costs. We characterized the inheritance of resistance of two strains of western corn rootworm with field-derived resistance to the Bt toxin Cry 3 Bb 1 (Elma and Monona) and tested for fitness costs of resistance. The inheritance of resistance to Cry 3 Bb 1 was investigated by crossing resistant and susceptible western corn rootworm and evaluating the survival of their progeny on Bt using diet-based assays and experiments with whole plants and seedling mats. For both strains, resistance {{was found to be}} non-recessive. In a greenhouse experiment in which larvae were reared on whole corn plants in field soil, no fitness costs of resistance were detected for Monona. In a laboratory experiment with Elma, in which larvae experienced intraspecific and interspecific competition for food, a fitness cost of delayed larval development was identified, however, no other fitness costs were found. These findings underscore the need for rootworm resistance management beyond the refuge strategy. Multiple tactics such as crop rotation, the planting of <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> with soil-applied insecticide, and planting pyramids of multiple Bt toxins that target western corn rootworm must be used to maintain the effectiveness of available Bt toxins...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{of genetically modified}} plants (e. g. Bt-maize) is currently an alternative method of controlling major crops pests. Therefore, {{is important to know}} the influence of Bt-plants on pest and non-pest insects. This study aimed evaluate the impact of Cry 1 F and Cry 1 F+Cry 1 A. 105 +Cry 2 Ab 2 proteins Bt expressed in corncobs on larval development of Spodoptera eridania (Cramer, 1782) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith, 1789) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The immature grains were offered ad libitum to new-hatched larvae (until 24 hs old), to compare the development of the specimens fed to <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> (DOW 2 B 688) and two isogenic Bt, that express one (Cry 1 F) and three insecticides protein (Cry 1 F+Cry 1 A. 105 +Cry 2 Ab 2). The larvae survived less than two days when consumed both Bt immature grains and reach 100 % of mortality. Spodoptera eridania reared on non-Bt corns grains shows a longer longevity (21. 6 days) than S. frugiperda (18. 4 days), but a lower viability (56. 5 % and 80. 2 % to S. eridania and S. frugiperda, respectively). Interesting, S. eridania consume a more amount immature grains (5. 4 g) than S. frugiperda (3. 9 g). In summary, this study confirms that the toxins Cry 1 F, Cry 1 F+Cry 1 A. 105 +Cry 2 Ab 2 expressed in fresh corncobs are an important tool to protect the corn ears against S. frugiperda and the nontarget pest S. eridania, however is important monitored the <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> fields due the possibility of this species caused damage in ears corn. 201...|$|E
40|$|Mason, CharlesEuropean corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), is an {{economically}} important insect pest of corn in the US and Canada. The development {{of genetically modified}} corn expressing genes derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that encodes insecticidal crystalline (Cry) proteins {{has proven to be}} effective in controlling this insect. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess dispersal and feeding behavior of neonate ECB on Bt corn. I examined differences in neonate ECB dispersal behavior for the first four hours following eclosion in the field among stacked pyramid (DAS 59122 - 7 × TC 1507 × MON 810) Bt corn, non-Bt near isoline, and non-Bt sweet corn; and in the laboratory among Bt corn hybrids TC 1507, MON 810, a pyramid combining TC 1507 and MON 810, and non-Bt near isoline corn. I also examined differences in feeding behavior between MON 810 Bt corn and non-Bt near isoline corn for four intervals over a 48 -hour period. In field experiments, I found that dispersal was significantly higher on non-Bt near isoline and Bt corn when compared to sweet corn. In laboratory experiments, dispersal was significantly higher on MON 810 and stacked pyramid Bt corn than on non-Bt near isoline corn. Finally, feeding experiments suggested that there was a significant difference in feeding behavior between MON 810 Bt corn and non-Bt near isoline corn. The findings from the feeding experiment also suggested that more than 50 % of the larvae abandoned the plant before there was evidence of feeding for both Bt and <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn.</b> Results indicated that a mixed refuge method could prove to be an effective solution for managing ECB resistance on Bt corn. However, additional research needs to be conducted on ECB larval movement between Bt and <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> to fully assess the efficacy of the mixed refuge strategy.

40|$|The {{survival}} of KS-SC DiPel-resistant and -susceptible European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), was evaluated on different tissues from corn, Zea mays L., hybrids, including a nontransgenic and two transgenic corn plants (events MON 810 and Bt 11) expressing {{high doses of}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry 1 Ab. The {{survival of}} Bt-resistant and -susceptible third instars was similar after a 5 -d exposure to transgenic plant tissues. Survivors eventually died when returned to Bt corn tissues, but many were able to continue development when transferred to <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> tissues. Survival of resistant and susceptible larvae also was evaluated in bioassays with dilutions of leaf extracts from the three corn hybrids incorporated in an artificial diet. In these assays, survival was significantly higher for resistant O. nubilalis neonates at {{three of the five}} dilutions compared with the susceptible strain, but the resistance ratio was only 2. 2 - and 2. 4 -fold for MON 810 and Bt 11, respectively. The data demonstrate that Bt-resistant and unselected control O. nubilalis larvae were similar in susceptibility to MON 810 and Bt 11 event corn hybrids. Although we were unable to evaluate the Cry 1 Ab protein that larvae were exposed to in the transgenic tissue because of company restrictions, Cry 1 Ab protoxin produced in Escherichia coli was incubated with extracts from <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> leaves to simulate the in planta effect on the transgenic protein. Cry 1 Ab protoxin was hydrolyzed rapidly by enzymes in the corn extract into peptide fragments with molecular masses ranging from 132 to 74 kDa, and eventually 58 kDa. Overall, these data suggest that plant enzymes hydrolyze transgenic toxin to one that is functionally activated. Therefore, resistant insect populations with reduced proteinase activity do not seem to pose a threat to the efficacy of commercial MON 810 and Bt 11 corn hybrids...|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{previous}} laboratory study indicated that six transgenic crops expressing the Cry 1 Ab insecticidal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) decomposed at a slower rate than their respective non-Bt isolines. Consequently, litter decomposition rates, nitrogen cycling, and carbon pools may change in agricultural systems {{as the result of}} the widespread use of Bt crops. In this study, we assessed the decomposition rates and chemical composition of commonly grown hybrids of Bt and non-Bt isolines of corn (Zea mays L.) in the field. Leaves, stalks, and cobs from two Bt corn hybrids (Pioneer 34 N 44 Bt and NC+ 4990 Bt) and their non-Bt isolines (Pioneer 34 N 43 and NC+ 4880) were analyzed for biomass fractions (soluble, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) and total C and N content. Litterbags containing these residues were buried at a depth of 10 cm in a Holdrege silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiustolls) soil and recovered 5, 11, 17, and 23 months after placement in the field. There were no differences in the rates of decomposition and mass of C remaining over time between the Bt and <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> residues. Plant parts differed in decomposition rates where leaves [stalks [cobs. There were differences in total C, total N, biomass fractions, and C:N ratios between initial Bt and <b>non-Bt</b> <b>corn</b> residues, and between companies (NC+ and Pioneer), however, these differences did not result in differences in their rates of decomposition or mass of C remaining over time. For each plant part, there were no differences in lignin content between the Bt and non-Bt residues. These data suggest that the Bt and non- Bt corn hybrids used in this study should not cause differences in carbon sequestration when their residues decompose under similar environmental conditions...|$|E
