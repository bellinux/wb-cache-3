The Tabernacle's {{foundation}} was constructed of nearby sandstone, with walls built of four layers of fired brick from local clay. Constructed using considerable donated labor from the fall of 1899, it was dedicated on August 24, 1907, by LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith.

25|$|On 22 March at 9:38pm Islamabad, (16:38 GMT), Gillani {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the peoples party as its candidate for the premiership of the country. Many analysts {{said that they would}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Zardari succeeded Gillani after a few months. It was reported on 24 March 2008, that Zardari said he was not interested in the job of prime minister and that Gillani would serve until 2013 in the position. Speculation that Zardari might be gunning for the premiership grew stronger when he picked the less popular Gillani over Ameen Faheem, a much powerful member of the central executive committee. Fahmida Mirza, the newly elected Speaker of the Assembly, insisted there was no plan to replace Gillani. She added, however, that if Gillani did not do a good job, all options were open.|$|E

500|$|The {{defending}} champion was seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O'Sullivan 9–6 in last year's final. Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch, explaining, [...] "The way I {{felt at the}} Grand Prix was down {{to the fact that}} I know what I'm still capable of". The total prize fund was £200,000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport. O'Sullivan was considered the favourite, with his mentor Ray Reardon saying [...] "Ronnie {{is in the form of}} his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment". Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix, O'Sullivan said he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> they performed well in this tournament.|$|E

500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If I can have that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E

[...] I would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the Hezbollah made them stay." [...] According to Human Rights Watch, though many civilians in South Lebanon refused to abandon their homes and act on the IDF's warnings, many others were unable to flee due to crumbled infrastructure. Israel singled out much of Lebanese civilian infrastructure for destruction throughout the war {{and at the end}} of the conflict the damage was estimated to top 2.5 billion dollars.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1874 {{there was}} a further complication. [...] Uruguay, the junior partner in the Triple Alliance, also {{negotiated}} a separate treaty of friendship with Paraguay − and did so {{under the auspices of}} Brazil. [...] Argentina abruptly broke off diplomatic relations with Uruguay. [...] The American minister thought that if war did break out between Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay would be on Brazil's side, and that the Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos (who disliked Buenos Aires, and in those days were virtually self-governing) would break away; he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if,</b> under Brazilian influence, there was formed [...] "a new Riverine Republic … [...] would be composed of Uruguay, Entre Rios, Corrientes and Paraguay" ...|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{there was}} a lack of vision and serious {{interest}} in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in Washington. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding. Between the World Wars, the Guggenheim Foundation was the main source of funding for Goddard's research. Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian Eugene Emme, but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans. Interestingly, Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he [...] "would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the research would become something in the nature of a race" [...] and he wondered how soon the European [...] "theorists" [...] would begin to build rockets.|$|E
