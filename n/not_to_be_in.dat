At the time, it was estimated about 15% of ZX Spectrums sold had been +3 models.

5|$|SR282 was {{initially}} designated in 1967 solely along Fourth Street from SR75 to the Naval Air Station; however, it was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> effect until the San Diego–Coronado Bridge was completed. Nevertheless, before the bridge opened, the designation was {{added in the}} 1968 legislative session, along with the portion of Orange Avenue from the Coronado Ferry landing to Fourth Street, {{which was to be}} removed once the Coronado Bay Bridge opened. The designation came into effect on February 21, 1969. In April, plans were under way to repave Fourth and Third Streets and add signals at the Orange Avenue intersections. The bridge opened on August 3, 1969. In September, the City of Coronado added Third Street as a truck route going westbound to the base, in addition to the already-existing Fourth Street truck route leaving the base.|$|E
5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although {{the sound of a}} Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{males in}} {{competitive}} sports are often advised by their coaches <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> intimate relationships {{based on the}} premises that they become more docile and less aggressive during an athletic event. The circumstances in which males and females experience aggression are also different. A study showed that social anxiety and stress {{was positively correlated with}} aggression in males, meaning as stress and social anxiety increases so does aggression. Furthermore, a male with higher social skills has a lower rate of aggressive behavior than a male with lower social skills. In females, higher rates of aggression were only correlated with higher rates of stress. Other than biological factors that contribute to aggression there are physical factors are well.|$|E

25|$|On {{the back}} of his {{performances}} for Oxford University in which he gained his Blue, Evans was offered a trial for {{the latter half of the}} 1939 season by Glamorgan, making his debut against the touring West Indians at Cardiff Arms Park. Following this match there was talk of him becoming a long-term replacement for Jack Mercer, but with the start of World War II and the subsequent cancellation of county cricket, this was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> his brief time with Glamorgan, Evans scored 164 runs at an average of 12.61, with a high score of 36. With the ball, he took 5 wickets, although these came at a fairly expensive average of 66.20. Following the war he opted not to continue his cricket career, but instead to focus on a career in teaching.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{identification}} is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, {{and may be}} impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that {{takes a long time}} in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.|$|E
25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, {{in the sense that they}} are the ones most likely <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E

25|$|A {{key issue}} {{that remains is}} the lack of female {{representation}} in management. Of all legislators, senior officials and management, females are found in only 9% of the positions. This disparity has contributed to the larger overall gender wage gap of females earning only 66.5% of male earnings in 2002. Prevalent social opinions suggest that this disparity is {{due to the lack of}} commit of Japanese women to their jobs due to their perspectives regarding marriage, family, and children. While the government had imposed the Equal Opportunity Law, companies responded by creating a ‘double-track management system’ (DPM), where a career track allows for promotions but requires transfers, and a non-career track that does not require transfers but has low chances of promotion. Previously, employers often maintained a core workforce mainly consisting of male employees which was expected to work at head office and be transferred around the world, and a peripheral workforce of female employees working at local branches with restricted career advancement. However, uptake by females of the career track is extremely low at less than 4% in all industries. Given the strong internal labour market of Japanese companies which stipulates that senior positions are only given to those in the career track and not from sources external to the company, this has contributed to the low proportion of female managers. This DPM system is also prevalent, especially among larger firms, with 51.2% of firms with more than 5,000 employees using the system. Gendered divisions exist in the workplace and are replicated by both male and female workers. Although both genders may be allocated to the same section, males were often trained and allocated towards management jobs. As a result, female workers often were not in or chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> management jobs due to lack of training, experience, and opportunity. In addition, more than half of surveyed companies indicated that they were attempting to eradicate instances of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices by males towards female workers, indicating an existing environment of a male-dominated workplace.|$|E
