5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering <b>nucleosome</b> structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a <b>nucleosome,</b> which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a <b>nucleosome.</b> DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E

25|$|Eukaryotic DNA must be tightly {{compacted}} {{in order}} to fit within the confined space of the nucleus. Chromosomes are packaged by wrapping 147 nucleotides around an octamer of histone proteins, forming a <b>nucleosome.</b> The <b>nucleosome</b> octamer includes two copies of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Due to the tight association of histone proteins to DNA, eukaryotic cells have proteins {{that are designed to}} remodel histones ahead of the replication fork, {{in order to}} allow smooth progression of the replisome. There are also proteins involved in reassembling histones behind the replication fork to reestablish the <b>nucleosome</b> conformation.|$|E
25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{might also}} be created secondary {{to the production of}} antibodies to other proteins within the <b>nucleosome.</b> Mice that have T cells directed towards the <b>nucleosome</b> can elicit a response to other antigens such as dsDNA and histone via a mechanism known as antigen spreading. This effect can also occur after an infection causes the production of autoantibodies to other structures within the nucleus.|$|E

Digestion of HMG 14 / 17 -nucleosome complexes, under conditions where the DNA in control <b>nucleosomes</b> is digested to 10 to 20 % acid solubility, results in a particular depletion of single-strand DNA fragments greater than 80 nucleotides in length, relative to the DNA fragments produced from control <b>nucleosomes.</b> Additionally, we show that staphylococcal nuclease digests of H 1 /H 5 -depleted chromatin contain an abundant subclass of <b>nucleosomes</b> that are not present in appreciable amounts in digests of native chromatin.

40|$|Assembly of <b>nucleosomes</b> on relaxed, covalently closed DNA {{has been}} studied in a nuclear extract of Xenopus laevis oocytes. <b>Nucleosomes</b> {{containing}} the four histones H 3, H 4, H 2 A and H 2 B but lacking histone H 1 are readily assembled on the DNA. The pattern of micrococcal nuclease digestion shows that the <b>nucleosomes</b> assembled {{in the absence of}} ATP and Mg (II) are closely packed, with a periodicity of 150 base pairs (bp). In contrast, in the presence of ATP and Mg (II) the spacing of the <b>nucleosomes</b> is 180 bp, similar to that observed for <b>nucleosomes</b> assembled on DNA microinjected into oocyte nuclei. The ATP and Mg (II) requirements for the assembly of correctly spaced <b>nucleosomes</b> are unrelated to the activity of the ATP and Mg (II) dependent DNA topoisomerase II in the extract; addition of specific inhibitors of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II has no effect on the spacing of the reconstituted <b>nucleosomes.</b> The ATP requirement in the assembly of correctly spaced <b>nucleosomes</b> can be substituted by adenosine 5 '-O- 3 '-thiotriphosphate (gamma-S-ATP) but not by adenyl- 5 '-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-P-(NH) -P) ...|$|R
40|$|Plasmid DNA {{containing}} adenovirus 2 major {{late and}} peptide IX genes was assembled into <b>nucleosomes</b> in vitro, and the assembled <b>nucleosomes</b> {{were used as}} a template to study the regulatory mechanism of transcription initiation under these conditions. Neither the major late nor peptide IX genes was transcribed on the already-assembled <b>nucleosomes.</b> However, the major late gene, but not the peptide IX gene, was transcribed efficiently when the DNA was incubated with HeLa cell extracts prior to assembly into <b>nucleosomes.</b> These results indicate that prebinding of some component in the cell extracts to DNA is essential to activate transcription of the major late gene on <b>nucleosomes</b> assembled under the conditions used here. Since gene IX on the <b>nucleosomes</b> was not transcriptionally active regardless of preincubation of DNA with the extracts, some other component or another, different template structure which {{is not able to}} be identified in an in vitro system with deproteinized DNA template might be required for activation of peptide IX gene transcription.

25|$|DNA damage {{can also}} cause {{epigenetic}} changes. DNA damage is very frequent, occurring on average about 60,000 times a day per cell {{of the human body}} (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain. In particular, a double strand break in DNA can initiate unprogrammed epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section). In addition, the enzyme Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a repair process. This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause <b>nucleosome</b> remodeling. <b>Nucleosome</b> remodeling has been found to cause, for instance, epigenetic silencing of DNA repair gene MLH1. DNA damaging chemicals, such as benzene, hydroquinone, styrene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene, cause considerable hypomethylation of DNA, some through the activation of oxidative stress pathways.|$|E
