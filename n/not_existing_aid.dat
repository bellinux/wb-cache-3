40|$|This paper designs a new equalization‐aid formula {{based on}} fiscal gaps of local communities. Using {{conceptual}} analysis and simulations with Massachusetts data, the authors illustrate the tradeoffs that policymakers face in deciding {{on the policy}} variables in the formula and lay out several general guidelines for setting up these variables. When states are in transition to a new local aid formula, {{the issue of whether}} and how to hold <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> harmless poses a challenge. The authors show that previous studies and the formulas derived from them give differential weights to <b>existing</b> and new <b>aid</b> in filling the gap and hence effectively treat communities receiving greater amounts of <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> more favorably than communities receiving less or no <b>existing</b> <b>aid.</b> As a fairer alternative, the authors propose a new approach that considers <b>existing</b> and new <b>aid</b> within a consistent framework by taking account of both in filling the gap. In addition, unlike previous research that focuses only on a single year’s new aid distribution, the authors simulate the dynamics of aid distributions over multiple years and examine their evolution over time. The authors further provide and compare several possible solutions to addressing the possible tradeoffs between short‐term and long‐term goals. Although the proposed aid formula is designed for municipal aid and tailored to Massachusetts, the authors note that foundation aid formulas for education implicitly treat <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> in the same way and suggest that the framework, principles, and policy recommendations might also be applicable to other states designing new municipal aid formulas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{discusses}} the poor performance of women candidates in Solomon Islands elections and potential aid policy responses. The article outlines women candidates’ performance, details {{challenges faced by}} women, examines <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> work designed to help women candidates and provides policy suggestions. The article argues that <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> policy focused on candidate training and voter education has achieved little because the main impediments women candidates face are access to finance and local gatekeepers, alongside more subtle normative constraints. These are barriers that are not easily shifted by training or education programs. Meanwhile, for reasons of political economy, another area of aid-supported engagement, a parliamentary gender quota, {{is unlikely to be}} enacted. Reflecting this, {{and the nature of the}} challenges women candidates face, the article recommends donors also undertake work to help prospective women candidates engage with communities over time, building ties and reputations as providers of assistance...|$|R
40|$|Intervertebral disc {{degeneration}} is {{an important}} social and economic problem. Presently available artificial intervertebral discs (AIDs) are insufficient and the main surgical intervention is still spinal fusion. The objective {{of the present study}} is to present a list of requirements for the development of an AID which could replace the human lumbar intervertebral disc and restore its function. The list addresses geometry, stiffness, range of motion, strength, facet joint function, center of rotation, fixation, failsafety and implantation technique. Date are obtained from the literature, quantified where possible and checked for consistency <b>Existing</b> <b>AIDs</b> are evaluated according to the presented list of requirements. Endplate size is a weak point in <b>existing</b> <b>AIDs.</b> These should be large and fit vertebral bodies to prevent migration. Disc height and wedge angle should be restored unless this would overstretch ligaments. Finally, stiffness and range of motion in all directions should equal those of the healthy disc, except for the axial rotation to relieve the facet joints...|$|R

40|$|Many {{states have}} {{implemented}} educational grant systems {{designed to provide}} more aid to school districts that are, by some standard, in greater need. Never-theless, many if not most central city school systems continue to produce poor educational outcomes, as measured, for example, by test scores and dropout rates. Using data from New York State, this article asks why <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> formulas fail to provide the assistance that central city school districts need to bring their educational outcomes up to reasonable standards. Two principal explanations are explored: the failure of <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> programs to recognize {{the high cost of}} providing education in central cities and the possibility that aid simply makes central cities less efficient without raising educational outcomes. The article presents aid programs that account for costs, but shows that these revised programs will do little to help central cities without at least one politi-cally unpopular provision, namely a large state budget or a high required local property tax rate. The article also estimates the extent to which increased ai...|$|R
40|$|The current Federal Radio Navigation Plan {{presents}} {{a plan that}} includes phasing out of <b>existing</b> radio-navigation <b>aids</b> {{as part of the}} transition to sole-means-GPS navigation in the United States. GPS based systems are also being envisioned as becoming the primary means of air traffic control resulting in the retirement of older primary and secondary surveillance radar (SSR) systems. This paper discusses the use of <b>existing</b> radio-navigation <b>aids</b> to provide a redundant navigation system alongside GPS/WAAS during the transition to a sole means GPS national airspace system. Specifically, the paper examines three such systems based on existing equipment such as Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), the Traffic and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and LORAN. The predicted performance of these systems can be used to determine the number of the <b>existing</b> radionavigation <b>aids</b> that should be left in place to provide adequate navigation services during the transition to solemeans -GPS navigation.

For transnational humanitarian NGOs active in multiple cultural contexts, the conditions for gaining and maintaining legitimacy are more complex.

40|$|In {{response}} to the recent fiscal crisis, state governments in the United States have deeply cut aid, often by the same percentage across commu-nities. This across-the-board approach ignores local fiscal disparities and places a larger burden on communities in worse underlying fiscal health. This article introduces a more equitable approach to distributing aid cuts based on both underlying local fiscal health and the <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> distribution. Policy simulations using Massachusetts data show that this approach could be politically feasible, as a majority of communities and state population would receive smaller aid cuts under this gap-based approach than under across-the-board cuts...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses econometric {{estimates}} {{of the link between}} aid and economic growth to ask how much additional aid is required to meet the Millennium Development Goal of halving global poverty by 2015, and how this aid should be allocated across countries. It first shows that a large increase in <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> levels can be justified to halve $ 1 -a-day poverty by 2015, on a country-by-country basis, under the econometric estimates obtained by Hansen & Tarp (2001 Hansen, H. and Tarp, F. 2001. Aid and growth regressions. Journal of Development Economics, 64 : 547 – 570., Journal of Development Economics, 64, pp. 547 – 570) and Lensink & White (2001 Lensink, R. and White, H. 2001. Are there negative returns to aid?. Journal of Development Studies, 37 : 42 – 65., Journal of Development Studies, 37, pp. 42 – 65), but not those of Collier & Dollar (2002 Collier, P. and Dollar, D. 2002. Aid allocation and poverty reduction. European Economic Review, 46 : 1475 – 1500., European Economic Review, 46, pp. 1475 – 1500). The paper then shows that, even where an increase in <b>existing</b> <b>aid</b> levels can be justified, a much larger number of people—up to around 70 million—could be lifted out of poverty by 2015 if aid was instead allocated on a poverty-efficient basis. This cautions against the use of a country-by-country target approach when allocating aid across recipient countries...|$|R
