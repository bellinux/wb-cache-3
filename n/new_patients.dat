40|$|Given {{consistent}} beam {{characteristics and}} prescribed target dosage across patients, the dose distributions of organs at risk (OARs) {{for a specific}} patient are largely determined by the anatomical structures of the patient, specifically the spatial configuration between each OAR and target. We propose a method that predicates the DVHs of OARs of a <b>new</b> <b>patient</b> in IMRT planning by comparing the spatial configurations between OARs and targets of the <b>new</b> <b>patient</b> with those of prior patients, whose plans are maintained in a database. The overlap volume histogram (OVH) is used to quantify the spatial configuration. The best DVHs {{among a group of}} related prior patients identified by OVH analysis are retrieved from the database and applied as the predications for the <b>new</b> <b>patient’s</b> DVHs. By incorporating geometric analysis into planning, the DVHs of the <b>new</b> <b>patient</b> are clearly defined ahead of planning. It heralds the possibility of automated IMRT planning...|$|R

25|$|Multiple {{measures}} {{were used to}} contain the potential outbreak {{in the town of}} Merca. The response was coordinated by Weisfeld and Karl Markvart. Maalin's contacts were all traced by the WHO eradication team. A total of 161 contacts were identified, 41 of whom had not been vaccinated. There were 91 people who had been in face-to-face contact with Maalin, 12 of whom were unvaccinated. Some of his contacts lived up to 120km outside the town. All contacts were kept under surveillance for six weeks. His face-to-face contacts and their families were vaccinated, but none showed any sign of having been infected. Merca Hospital was closed to <b>new</b> <b>patients,</b> all its medical staff were vaccinated and existing patients were quarantined in situ. The residents of the fifty houses neighbouring Maalin's lodgings were vaccinated, and vaccinations were later extended to the ward of the town in which Maalin lived. House-to-house searches throughout the entire town looked for cases. Police checkpoints on all exits to the town, including footpaths, were established to vaccinate anyone passing who had not been recently immunised. A total of 54,777 people were vaccinated in the two weeks following Maalin's isolation. The response later broadened, with monthly house-to-house searches across the region widening to a search throughout Somalia, completed in December 1977.|$|E

It is therefore important to predict whether or not a <b>new</b> <b>patient</b> with HCV genotype 1 will be cured by the recommended treatment. We propose a prediction method for a <b>new</b> <b>patient</b> using a decision tree learning model based on SNPs evaluated in a genome-wide association study. By the decision tree learning for 142 Japanese patients with HCV genotype 1 (78 with null virologic response and 64 with virologic response), we can predict with high probability (93 %) whether or not a <b>new</b> <b>patient</b> with HCV will be helped by the recommended treatment...|$|R

2500|$|Information on the {{frequency}} of conversion disorder in the West is limited, {{in part due to}} the complexities of the diagnostic process. In neurology clinics, the reported prevalence of unexplained symptoms among <b>new</b> <b>patients</b> is very high (between 30 and 60%). However, diagnosis of conversion typically requires an additional psychiatric evaluation, and since few patients will see a psychiatrist it is unclear what proportion of the unexplained symptoms are actually due to conversion. [...] Large scale psychiatric registers in the US and Iceland found incidence rates of 22 and 11 newly diagnosed cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Some estimates claim that in the general population, between 0.011% and 0.5% of the population have conversion disorder.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, a {{backlash}} to the libel suit {{filed by the}} British Chiropractic Association (BCA) against Simon Singh, has inspired the filing of formal complaints of false advertising against more than 500 individual chiropractors within one 24-hour period, prompting the McTimoney Chiropractic Association to write to its members advising them to remove leaflets that make claims about whiplash and colic from their practice, {{to be wary of}} <b>new</b> <b>patients</b> and telephone inquiries, and telling their members: [...] "If you have a website, take it down NOW." [...] and [...] "Finally, we strongly suggest you do NOT discuss this with others, especially patients." [...] An editorial in Nature has suggested that the BCA may be trying to suppress debate and that this use of British libel law is a burden on the right to freedom of expression, which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.

2500|$|At {{an unknown}} {{time in the}} 1960 or '70s the ward {{numbering}} scheme was replaced, the earlier system was a letter defining the sex followed by a number: F23 - the 23rd Female ward for instance or M4 a male ward. The new system consisted of giving each block a letter of the alphabet and then attaching a number to it: D2 or E1, each block containing between one and eight wards depending on location. It is presumed that the naming system attempted to reduce the perceived size of the hospital to visitors and <b>new</b> <b>patients,</b> being admitted to say the 23rd female ward {{gave the impression of}} an awful lot of female patients, compared to being admitted to say K2 ward. Later (perhaps in the 1970s) these designations allowed for names to be used using that first letter 'D2' the middle floor ward of 'D' block, the fourth block from the left became 'Dean Ward' with whilst 'E1' became 'Elgar' with 'E2' 'Eliot', and 'E3' 'Emerson' on the top floor.|$|E

2500|$|<b>New</b> <b>patients</b> {{who arrived}} at the Dwight {{institute}} were introduced into an open, informal environment where they were first offered as much alcohol as they could imbibe. Initially, patients were boarded in nearby hotels, such as the Dwight Livingston Hotel, or the homes of private residents. Later patients stayed in the converted John R. Oughton House. The institute operated out of homes and hotels using a spa like atmosphere of peace and comfort. [...] All patients received injections of bichloride of gold four times daily. There were other tonics given as well.(Tracy) The treatment lasted four weeks.(Larson pp.161-163.) The medical profession continued to criticize the method and many tried to identify the mysterious ingredients. [...] Strychnine, alcohol, apomorphine, willow bark, ammonia, and atropine were {{claimed to have been}} identified in the injections. The injections were dissolved in red, white and blue liquids and the amounts varied. In addition, patients would receive individually prescribed tonics every two hours throughout the day. Treatments lasted for a period of four weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Call hours {{have been}} greatly restricted. In July 2003, strict rules {{went into effect}} for all {{residency}} programs in the US, known to residents as the [...] "work hours rules". Among other things, these rules limited a resident {{to no more than}} 80 hours of work in a week (averaged over 4 weeks), no more than 24 hours of clinical duties at a stretch with an additional 6 hours for transferring patient care and educational requirement (with no <b>new</b> <b>patients</b> in the last six), and call no more often than every third night. In-house call for most residents these days is typically one night in four; surgery and obstetrics residents {{are more likely to have}} one in three call. A few decades ago, in-house call every third night or every other night was the standard. While on paper this has decreased hours, in many programs there has been no decrease in resident work hours, only a decrease in hours recorded. Even though many sources cite that resident work hours have decreased, residents are commonly encouraged or forced to hide their work hours to appear to comply with the 80 hour limits.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{she was now}} a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, as a woman, Garrett {{could not}} take up a medical post in any hospital. So in late 1865, Garrett opened her own {{practice}} at 20 Upper Berkeley Street, London. At first, patients were scarce but the practice gradually grew. After six months in practice, she wished to open an outpatients dispensary, to enable poor women to obtain medical help from a qualified practitioner of their own gender. In 1865, there was an outbreak of cholera in Britain, affecting both rich and poor, and in their panic, some people forgot any prejudices they had {{in relation to a}} female physician. The first death due to cholera occurred in 1866, but by then Garrett had already opened St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children, at 69 Seymour Place. In the first year, she tended to 3,000 <b>new</b> <b>patients,</b> who made 9,300 outpatient visits to the dispensary. [...] On hearing that the Dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Sorbonne, Paris was in favour of admitting women as medical students, Garrett studied French so that she could apply for a medical degree, which she obtained in 1870 after some difficulty.|$|E
