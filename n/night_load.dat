40|$|Thermally {{activated}} buildings systems (TABS) are {{systems that}} integrate heating/cooling devices {{in the building}} structure, so that the building elements act as thermal storage and have {{an active role in}} the energy supply and demand management. Although TABS are well known systems, there are still open questions in their realization, mainly concerning appropriate control strategies which are influenced by the large thermal inertia. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of demand side management control strategies on the performance of a thermally activated building system applied in a commercial building. The goal is to estimate the potential of TABS for load shifting requested by the electricity grid. The analysis is performed by means of a sample case: first the existing TABS control strategy and then the possible implementation of DSM mechanisms are analyzed. In particular three different demand side management mechanisms are evaluated: (i) a peak shaving strategy, (ii) a random request of switching on/off the system and (iii) a <b>night</b> <b>load</b> shifting strategy. The simulation results show high potential of TABS within the DSM framework, since TABS allow load control while scarcely affect thermal comfort...|$|E
40|$|Short term load {{forecasting}} (STLF) {{of electricity}} and power demand plays {{a very important role}} in the economic and secure operation of power systems. Accurate load forecast will lead to appropriate scheduling and planning with much lower costs in the operation of power systems. Various classes of load forecasting models of power systems of different nature have been suggested as reported in the literature. However, at present there is no such technique used in Sri Lanka regarding the daily day and <b>night</b> <b>load</b> forecasting. This paper develops a state space based on structural time (SSST) series model to forecast day and night peak values of electricity demand in Sri Lanka for week-days and week-ends. The model was developed using hourly electricity consumption in Sri Lanka for May 2007. The model adequacy was tested using various statistical indicators and errors were found white noise. The efficiency of the models was further tested for an independent set of data. In order to derive the coefficients of the model parameter a computer program was developed using Matlab. It is shown that the developed approach can produce more accurate results for the STLF than the conventional techniques. The developed model is more beneficial for dispatching centers of a power system...|$|E

A nucleotomy necessary for the implantation of hydrogels, however, disrupts the annulus integrity and destroys natural interfaces in the disc. To clarify whether hydrogels can restore the mechanical competence of the disc an experimental testwas used. Intradiscal pressure(IDP) in an ovine disc was measured in vivo for 24 h and adapted to an axial compressive test consisting of three cycles 15 -min diurnal and 30 -min <b>night</b> <b>load.</b> To study the fluid mechanics, 30 motion segments in different defect conditions were used: (i) INTACT; (ii) DEFANN: isolated annulus defect; (iii) DEF-NUC: re-implanted nucleus; (iv) DDAHA and (v) iGG-MA: two hydrogels. DEF-ANN showed {{no significant difference in}} disc height loss or IDP compared to INTACT, while DEF-NUC reduced the IDP by ~ 30 %(p = 0. 03) and tended to increase the height loss(p = 0. 2). Both DDAHA and iGG-MA better reflected the height loss of INTACT, but caused an even stronger loss in IDP than DEF-NUC(~ 34 %). Neither the hydrogels nor the re-implanted nucleus, assumed to be the ideal implant, could restore the mechanical functionality of the disc. Hydrogels designed to mimic the mechanical behavior of the native nucleus may fail in restoring IDP due to the destruction of natural interfaces and an inappropriate annulus closure. To regain a biomechanical equivalent of the natural nucleus, more attention needs to be paid to the anchoring of the substitute inside the disc...|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to design and simulate the solar based stand-alone electrical energy model using MATLAB/SIMULINK software for smart home. Here in this solar based stand-alone system the home is not grid-tied to any local utility, but a battery energy storage system (BESS) is used as a primary backup source. The area under interest selected here is Rockford [...] -a Northwest Suburb of Chicago. The various solar data for the Rockford Area (Latitude 42. 5, Longitude 89. 5) was collected from the NASA Surface meteorology and solar energy website. And a load profile for a generic home was assumed based on the Official energy Statistics of the U. S government [1]. This stand-alone system involves a solar panel, Boost Converter, Maximum Power Point Tracker, DC/AC Inverter, Bidirectional Converter and Battery as its major Simulink blocks. The objective is to provide 24 / 7 highly efficient and economically feasible green and clean solar powered electricity. During the day time the residential loads are supported by the solar panels, which also charge the battery. During the night time the battery is used as a primary source for distributing power to the various domestic appliances of the home. The charging and discharging current is controlled by the bidirectional converter based on the State of Charge (SOC) of the Nickel Metal-Hydride (NiMH) battery bank. The objective of this thesis is to illustrate that using the proposed MATLAB/SIMULINK solar stand alone model, the average daily load requirement of a generic Rockford home of 45. 6 kWh/day is achieved. It was determined that in order to meet this load requirement an array of 46 solar panels (2 in Series and 23 in parallel) are required. PV system supplies the desired 15. 6 kWh of energy during the day time. In order to meet the <b>night</b> <b>load,</b> a battery storage system of 30 kWh (48 V, 625 Ah) is employed. Therefore the simulation done using MATLAB/SIMULINK software validates the feasibility of this solar stand alone system...|$|E

40|$|Background: Shift work is {{associated}} with negative health effects. Increased prevalence of several cardiovascular risk factors among shift workers/night workers compared with day workers have been shown resulting in increased risk of cardiovascular events among shift workers and night workers. Previous studies have taken a dichotomous approach to the comparison between day and night workers. The present study uses a continuous approach and provides such a new perspective to {{the negative effects of}} <b>night</b> work <b>load</b> as a possible risk factor for undesirable health effects. Methods: This cross sectional study (The SUrvey of Shift work, Sleep and Health (SUSSH)) uses data collected from December 2008 to March 2009. The study population consists of Norwegian nurses. The study collected information about demographic and lifestyle factors: Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption and exercise habits. The lifestyle parameters were evaluated using multiple hierarchical regression and binary logistic regression. Number of night shifts worked last year (NNL) was used as operationalization of <b>night</b> work <b>load.</b> Adjustment for possible confounders were made. Obesity was defined as BMI > 30. Alcohol Consumption was evaluated using the short form of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption (AUDIT-C). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22. Results: We had data from 2059 nurses. NNL was significantly and positively associated with BMI, both when evaluated against BMI as a continuous parameter (Beta =. 055, p <. 05), and against obesity (OR = 1. 01, 95 % CI = 1. 00 - 1. 01). The AUDIT-C score was significantly and positively associated with hours worked per week (OR = 1. 03, 95 % CI = 1. 01 - 1. 05). Conclusions: We found a positive significant association between <b>night</b> work <b>load</b> and BMI. This suggests that workers with a heavy <b>night</b> work <b>load</b> might need special attention and frequent health checks due to higher risk of undesirable health effects. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{a range of}} limb loading activity for healthy adult horses confined to box stalls in an equine veterinary teaching hospital and {{determine the effects of}} hospital environmental factors on load rates and daily limb loading patterns. ANIMALS: 6 mature healthy horses of various ages, breeds, and sexes, and 1 horse with a repaired metatarsal fracture. PROCEDURE: Step monitors were placed on 2 limbs of adult horses confined to box stalls. Relocation steps and weight shifts were recorded, as loading events, for 24 hours. Influence of forelimb versus hind limb and environmental factors on load rate (loading events per hour) were assessed with repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Loading activity was greater for the forelimb than the hind limb and was greater during the day than the <b>night.</b> <b>Loading</b> activity differences were not associated with daytime environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Horses with normal locomotor activity appear to have higher load rates for forelimbs compared with hind limbs and higher load rates during the day compared with night. Knowledge of influence of environmental factors and mechanical restraint on limb loading activity may be useful in management of horses with musculoskeletal disorders. This information may also be used for in vitro simulation of in vivo loading of limbs during cyclic biomechanical investigations...|$|R

After initial flight tests in the Baltimore area, the gun B-57G was flown to Eglin in January 1971.
