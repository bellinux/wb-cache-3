500|$|Irish-American actor Brian Donlevy {{was brought}} in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an {{interest}} for American audiences. Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in [...] "he-men roles – rough, tough and realistic". Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Beau Geste (1939), he was also known for his appearances in The Great McGinty (1940) and The Glass Key (1942). At the time he appeared as Quatermass his career was in decline, however. Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass {{is very different from}} that of Reginald Tate in the television version and was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, [...] "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind”. Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, [...] "Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality". By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy. Guest found, however, that [...] "Brian was all right, <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> all once you kept him sober". He reprised the role of Quatermass in Quatermass 2 (1957) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film, Quatermass and the Pit (1967).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{computer}} programming was {{in state of}} crisis. Software crisis is a term used {{in the early days}} of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term [...] "software crisis" [...] was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. His 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: [...] "The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem." ...|$|E

This mere belief in bodily humanitarianism is not sentimental; it is simply snobbish. For if comfort gives men virtue, the comfortable classes ought to be virtuous--which is absurd. Then, again, we do {{hear of the}} yet weaker and more watery type of sentimentalists: I mean the sentimentalist who says, with a sort of splutter, [...] "Flog the brutes!" [...] or who tells you with innocent obscenity [...] "what he would do" [...] with a certain man--always supposing the man's hands were tied.|$|E

For example, a long contemplation over a double of opponents' contract indicates uncertainty whether the contract would be beaten, and [...] "invites" [...] the partner to bid on ("pull the double") without defensive values; a hesitation which card to play when the declarer plays towards dummy's king suggests possession of an ace, etc.|$|E
