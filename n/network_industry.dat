The study is a comparative analysis of liberalization and regulatory reforms of <b>network</b> <b>industries</b> within the same country context. In Italy, various reforms of <b>network</b> <b>industries</b> have been made and implemented during the 1990 s and 2000 s, especially in water, gas, electricity, telecommunications, railways, highways, local public transports, and urban solid waste.

This analysis suggests that the difficulty to implement liberalization and regulatory reforms of <b>network</b> <b>industries</b> in Italy {{may be explained by}} various concurrent mechanisms, which {{have to do with the}} rent-seeking behavior of the actors of the industry's community, the rise of barriers to entry against competitors, and the risk of collusive practices between regulators and regulated.
