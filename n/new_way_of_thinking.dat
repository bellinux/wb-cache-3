This conceptualization, which has been labeled the biopsychosocial model, views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, social support).|$|E

Dissection was first introduced in the educational setting {{at the university of}} Bologna, to study and teach anatomy. The fourteenth century saw a significant spread of dissection and autopsy in Italy, and was not only taken up by medical faculties, but by colleges for physicians and surgeons.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, {{scholarly}} {{research has}} focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; John Lubbock and Oliver Lodge admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole <b>new</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> leading to digital and so-called parametric design.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Stazione Zoologica, and the <b>new</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and funding {{research}} are the main legacies of Dohrn. The model was copied {{a number of times}} throughout the world. In 1878 Johns Hopkins University founded the Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory, under the direction of W.K. Brooks. Then, in 1888, the Marine Biological Laboratory was founded at Woods Hole and in 1892 the first laboratory on the west coast, the Hopkins Marine Station, opened in California. In Britain, current marine laboratories that originate from this time include the Dunstaffnage Marine Station (today Scottish Association for Marine Science, 1884), the Gatty Marine Laboratory (University of St Andrews, 1884), the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (Plymouth, 1888), the Dove Marine Laboratory (Newcastle University, 1897), the Fisheries Research Services Marine Laboratory (Aberdeen, 1899), and the Bangor Marine Station (Queen's University of Belfast, 1903).|$|E

He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism. Thus, it can be said that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values.|$|E

500|$|A {{prevalent}} {{idea in the}} 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries was that illness {{was a result of}} the condition of the whole body. [...] The environment and the activity of the patient thus played a large part in any treatment. [...] The epitome of this kind of thinking was the concept of the vital force, which was supposed to govern the chemical processes within the body. [...] This theory held that organic compounds could only be formed within living organisms, where the vital force could come into play. [...] This belief had been known to be false ever since Friedrich Wöhler succeeded in synthesising urea from inorganic precursors in 1828. [...] Nevertheless, the vital force continued to be invoked to explain organic chemistry in Bird's time. [...] Sometime {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, a <b>new</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> started to take shape, especially among younger physicians, fuelled by rapid advances in the understanding of chemistry. [...] For the first time, it became possible to identify specific chemical reactions with specific organs of the body, and to trace their effects through the various functional relations of the organs and the exchanges between them.Vinten-Johansen, pp. 85–86 ...|$|E

Ben Child for The Guardian likened the lyrics [...] "I offer {{my life as a}} sacrifice and live through your love" [...] to those performed by Dion in [...] "My Heart Will Go On". The lyrics are about encouraging a person to open their eyes and envisage a new and different world, and develop a <b>new</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> According to Lewis, the inspiration behind the song was all of the emotion, love and strength that is displayed by the characters in the film.
