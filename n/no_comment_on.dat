5|$|The British people {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July. Attlee and his Secretary of State for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered {{a review of}} the Indian situation. Jinnah had <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{focused on}} three role-playing games created for Nintendo's Wii home video game console {{during the last}} years of its life: Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story and Pandora's Tower. Xenoblade Chronicles, developed by Monolith Soft, was an entry in the Xeno series, initially announced as an original project dubbed Monado: Beginning of the World. It was announced under this title at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), but its title was changed to honor earlier Xeno titles created by the game's writer Tetsuya Takahashi. The Last Story was developed by Mistwalker, a company created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and intended to be a game that ran contrary to typical elements of the genre based on feedback from the company's previous titles Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey. Pandora's Tower was developed by Ganbarion, who had previously worked primarily on licensed titles and pitched the concept to Nintendo after favorably impressing them with their work on Jump Ultimate Stars. Despite hopes from fans and journalists that the titles would be released overseas, Nintendo gave <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the matter. The only explanation for the lack of localization was related to The Last Story: Nintendo stated that due to their work on Kirby's Epic Yarn and titles for the new Nintendo 3DS, The Last Story was too much effort. Nintendo of Europe did want to feature Xenoblade Chronicles at E3 2011, but Nintendo's American branch prevented it without explanation. In response to this and continued silence on both The Last Story and Pandora's Tower, Operation Rainfall was born.|$|E

There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company Pfizer (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing celecoxib in the United States).

Rich Levin, commissioner Bud Selig's office spokesman, {{declined to comment on the}} situation, claiming that MLB did not have a copy of the test results. Michael Weiner, the union general counsel, also declined comment. The union, while fighting to get the list back from the government, has mostly refused to discuss reports. Likewise, Sosa never admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs nor did he ever fail an MLB drug test throughout his professional career.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{was handed}} a {{reprimand}} from the stewards over his late race contact with Magnussen while they elected {{not to take}} any action over the first lap incident between Button and Pérez. Magnussen was adamant that Räikkönen was {{to blame for the}} incident, saying that he drove defensively but that the driver made an overtaking attempt, while Räikkönen admitted following his contact with Chilton earlier in the race, he was willing to attempt aggressive manoeuvres. Pérez blamed Button for his retirement, saying that he was battling his teammate Hülkenberg and did not expect Button to be in the position he placed himself in {{because of the lack of}} space for another car. Button made <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the incident. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reckoned that despite Vettel's turbocharger failing, the driver would not allow his frustrations to get the better of him, and stated Ricciardo's challenge on Hamilton in the event's closing period was an indication that the approach the team used was correct but noted a realistic overtake was not possible unless the challenged driver made an error.|$|E

25|$|In March 2000 Altmann filed a {{civil claim}} against the Austrian {{government}} {{for the return of}} the paintings. She was informed that the cost of filing (consisting of 1.2% of the amount in question, plus a filing fee), would have meant a fee of €1.75 million. To avoid the prohibitively high costs, Altmann and Schoenberg sued the Austrian government and the Galerie Belvedere in the US courts. The Austrian government filed for dismissal, based on arguments around the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). The Act granted immunity to sovereign nations except under certain conditions. Schoenberg showed that three of the conditions pertinent to the case were that Altmann's property had been taken in violation of international law; the property was owned by the state in question, or one of its agencies; and that the property had been used on a commercial basis in the US. Over four years of litigation followed as to whether the case could be brought against a sovereign state before it was brought before the Supreme Court in Republic of Austria v. Altmann. In June 2004 the Supreme Court determined that the paintings had been stolen and that Austria was not immune from a claim from Altmann; the court made <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the current ownership of the paintings.|$|E
25|$|In November 2000 {{during the}} election, the Grand-Mere Affair, {{also known as}} the Shawinigate scandal broke. After initial denials, Chrétien {{acknowledged}} having lobbied the Business Development Bank of Canada, owned by the Government of Canada, to grant a $2million loan to Yvon Duhaime. Duhaime was a friend and constituent to whom the Prime Minister stated that he had sold his interest in the Grand-Mère Inn, a local Shawinigan-area hotel and golf resort, eventually providing evidence of the sale—a contract written on a cocktail napkin. Duhaime was a local businessman with an unsavoury reputation and a criminal record, who received a loan from the Business Development Bank that he was ineligible to collect on the account of his criminal record (Duhaime did not mention his record when applying for the loan). The Business Development Bank had turned down the initial loan application, but later approved a $615,000 loan following further lobbying by Chrétien. When the Business Development Bank refused to extend the loan in August 1999 under the grounds that Duhaime was a businessman with a bad reputation with a history for losing money on past business ventures and that he was already behind on his current payments, the president of the bank François Beaudoin was fired by Chrétien in September 1999, which led to a wrongful dismissal suit that Beaudoin was to win in 2004. It was revealed that Chrétien had never been paid for his share in the sale of the adjoining golf course, and criminal charges were laid against Duhaime. The Prime Minister's ethics counsellor Howard Wilson, who was appointed by and reported to the Prime Minister, determined that Prime Minister Chrétien had not violated any conflict-of-interest rules, noting that there were no clear rules on lobbying Crown corporations for making loans to business ventures that the Prime Minister may or may not had a stake in. There was <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> ethics of Chrétien's lobbying by the ethics counsellor Wilson. The revelation of the Grand-Mere affair did not affect the outcome of the 2000 election. Chrétien and his circle believed that the breaking of the Grand-Mere story during the election was the work of the Martin fraction.|$|E

Labour was also criticised because it had delayed vital spending decisions until after the general election. Darling said on Radio 4's Today programme the following day {{that he had not}} carried out a full spending review because of continued economic uncertainty. He said that he had announced he was over-riding the normal requirement to link the rise in benefits to the previous September's rate of inflation; the benefits would have effectively been frozen because inflation was negative at that point.

500|$|The {{success of}} StarCraft has spurred the {{creation}} of two authorized add-on titles to StarCraft, {{as well as a}} deviation into genres other than real-time strategy. [...] was the first add-on pack released for StarCraft. Although developed and published by Aztech New Media, it is authorized by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released for the PC on July 31, 1998. The expansion's story focuses on a Confederate colony {{during the course of the}} first campaign of StarCraft. As in StarCraft, the player takes control of each race in three separate campaigns. In the first campaign, Terran colonists attempt to defend themselves from the Zerg invasion of the sector as well as from a rising insurgency. The second campaign has the player directing a Protoss task force sent to clear the Zerg infestation of the colony by any means necessary. In the final campaign the player assumes the role of a Zerg cerebrate, whose goal is to crush all opposition on the surface. The expansion contains 30 new campaign missions and over 100 new multiplayer maps, although it does not include new content such as units and graphical terrain tilesets. Insurrection was criticized by reviewers for lacking the quality of the original game and is not widely available. Although the add-on is authorized by Blizzard Entertainment, they offer <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> support or availability of the game.|$|E
500|$|A North American {{release for}} Pandora's Tower was unconfirmed, with Nintendo giving <b>no</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the matter. In {{response}} to this, and similar responses to both The Last Story and Xenoblade Chronicles, a fan campaign dubbed Operation Rainfall was launched {{with the aim}} of pushing for a North American release for all three titles. While Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story were chosen due to their developer pedigree, Pandora's Tower was chosen due to its unique mechanics and the fact it was also published by Nintendo, in addition to its positive Japanese reception {{and the fact that it}} had a planned English release in Europe. When Operation Rainfall focused their attention fully on Pandora's Tower, their campaign included both their standard messaging to Nintendo, and the decision to pitch the game to third-party publishers themselves: the companies they chose to pitch to included Atlus, Xseed Games, Aksys Games and NIS America. This part of the campaign was funded by for donations in exchange for special items related to the campaign. The game was eventually picked up by Xseed Games for publication in North America, with their stated reasons including the game's [...] "vocal" [...] Western fan base, and the positive sales and fan support for The Last Story, the second title featured in the Operation Rainfall campaign. The game released on April 16, 2013. Unlike in Europe and the North American release of The Last Story, the North American version of Pandora's Tower did not receive a special edition.|$|E
