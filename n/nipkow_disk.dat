5|$|On 25 March 1925, John Logie Baird {{was able}} to {{demonstrate}} the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store Selfridges. Baird's device relied upon the <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> and thus {{became known as the}} mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning 30 September 1929. However, for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the cathode ray tube invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.|$|E
25|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Japan {{started in}} August 28, 1953, making the country {{one of the}} first in the world with an experimental television service. The first television tests were conducted as early as 1926 using a combined mechanical <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> and electronic Braun tube system, later switching to an all-electronic system in the 1935 using a domestically developed iconoscope system. In spite of that, because of the beginning of World War II in the Pacific region, this first full-fledged TV broadcast experimentation lasted only a few months. Regular television broadcasts would eventually start in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Baird's {{numerous}} other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary {{and began to}} dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, {{but some of the}} original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.|$|E
50|$|The {{resolution}} along a <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk's</b> scanline {{is potentially}} very high, being an analogue scan. However {{the maximum number}} of scanlines is much more limited, being equal to the number of holes on the disk, which in practice ranged from 30 to 100, with rare 200-hole disks tested.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, Tihanyi went to Berlin, {{where the}} {{development}} of mechanical television involving <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disks</b> had already been begun by the German Post Office and the larger manufacturers. The invention was received with enthusiasm by Telefunken and Siemens, {{but in the end}} they opted to continue with {{the development of}} mechanical television.|$|R
50|$|Further {{disadvantages}} {{include the}} non-linear {{geometry of the}} scanned images, and the impractical size of the disk, {{at least in the}} past. The <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disks</b> used in early TV receivers were roughly 30 cm to 50 cm in diameter, with 30 to 50 holes. The devices using them were also noisy and heavy with very low picture quality {{and a great deal of}} flickering. The acquisition part of the system was not much better, requiring very powerful lighting of the subject.|$|R
25|$|Baird {{performed}} one of {{the earliest}} public demonstrations of color television system on 3 July 1928 using an all-mechanical system with three <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> scanners synchronized with a single disk on the receiving end and three colored lights that were turned on and off in synchronicity with the broadcaster. The same basic system was used on 4 February 1938 to create the first color broadcast transmissions from The Crystal Palace to the Dominion Theatre in London. Baird {{was not the only one}} to experiment with mechanical color television, and a number of similar devices were demonstrated throughout this period, but Baird is recorded as the first to show a real over-the-air transmission in a public demonstration.|$|E
25|$|On December 25, 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi {{demonstrated}} a television {{system with a}} 40-line resolution that employed a <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still {{on display at the}} Takayanagi Memorial Museum at Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus. By 1927, Takayanagi improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was unrivaled until 1931. By 1928, {{he was the first to}} transmit human faces in halftones. His work had an influence on the later work of Vladimir K. Zworykin. By 1935, Takayanagi had invented the first all-electronic television. His research toward creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{broadcasts}} {{began in}} Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on 180 lines using telecine transmission of film, intermediate film system, or cameras using the <b>Nipkow</b> <b>Disk.</b> Transmissions using cameras {{based on the}} iconoscope began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin Summer Olympic Games were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and Hamburg in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system {{on the air in}} February 1937, and during World War II brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis methods of optical 2 D microprofilometry and 3 D microtopometry have been analysed. In order to {{increase}} the measuring accuracy of optical methods of microtopometry and roughness measurements a formalism of microtriangulation is presented by which the scanner beam is followed after reflection at a given local surface element. Errors caused by local surface gradients are substantially eliminated by measuring two beam coordinates in the image space. Highest accuracies were achieved by confocal microscopy. Using rotating <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disks,</b> confocal microscopy is especially suited for topometric characterization of complex and sensitive surfaces, e. g. for paper characterization.

25|$|In 1885, Henry Sutton {{developed}} a Telephane for closed circuit transmission of pictures via telegraph wires, {{based on the}} <b>Nipkow</b> spinning <b>disk</b> system, so that the Melbourne Cup {{could be seen in}} Ballarat. Reports differ on whether the Telephane was successfully implemented.|$|R
40|$|Interstitial {{cells of}} Cajal (ICC) in the urethra have been {{proposed}} as specialized pacemakers {{that are involved in}} the generation of urethral tone and therefore the maintenance of urinary continence. Recent studies on freshly dispersed ICC from the urethra of rabbits have demonstrated that pacemaker activity in urethra ICC is characterized by spontaneous transient depolarizations (STDs) under current clamp and spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) under voltage clamp. When these events were simultaneously recorded with changes in intracellular Ca 2 + (using a <b>Nipkow</b> spinning <b>disk</b> confocal microscope) they were found to be associated with global Ca 2 + oscillations. In this short review we will consider some of these recent findings regarding the contribution of intracellular Ca 2 + stores and Ca 2 + influx to the generation of pacemaker activity in urethral ICC with particular emphasis on the contribution of reverse Na + /Ca 2 + exchange (NCX). ...|$|R
2500|$|By the 1920s, when {{amplification}} made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird {{employed the}} <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype {{in a little}} village called Santa Cruz {{on the island of}} Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named [...] "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} working television system, Baird experimented with the <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk.</b> Paul Gottlieb Nipkow had invented this scanning disc system in 1884. Television historian Albert Abramson calls Nipkow's patent [...] "the master television patent". Nipkow's work is important because Baird and many others chose to develop it into a broadcast medium.|$|E
2500|$|An American inventor, Charles Francis Jenkins, also {{pioneered the}} television. He {{published}} an article on [...] "Motion Pictures by Wireless" [...] in 1913, {{but it was not}} until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses. On June 13, 1925, Jenkins publicly demonstrated the synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used a <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles (from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C.), using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution. He was granted U.S. patent 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922).|$|E
40|$|Interstitial {{cells of}} Cajal (ICC) act as {{putative}} pacemaker {{cells in the}} rabbit urethra. Pacemaker activity in ICC results from spontaneous global Ca(2 +) waves that can be increased in frequency by raising external [K(+) ]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to elucidate the mechanism of this response. Intracellular [Ca(2 +) ] was measured in fluo- 4 -loaded smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and ICC using a <b>Nipkow</b> spinning <b>disk</b> confocal microscope. Increasing [K(+) ]o to 60 mmol/L caused an increase in [Ca(2 +) ]i accompanied by contraction in SMCs. Raising [K(+) ]o did not cause contraction in ICC, but the frequency of firing of spontaneous calcium waves increased. Reducing [Ca(2 +) ]o to 0 mmol/L abolished the response in both cell types. Nifedipine of 1 μmol/L blocked the response of SMC to high [K(+) ]o, but did not affect the increase in firing in ICC. This latter effect was blocked by 30 μmol/L NiCl 2 but not by the T-type Ca(2 +) channel blocker mibefradil (300 nmol/L). However, inhibition of Ca(2 +) influx via reverse-mode sodium/calcium exchange (NCX) using either 1 μmol/L SEA 0400 or 5 μmol/L KB-R 7943 did block the effect of high [K(+) ]o on ICC. These data suggest that high K(+) solution increases the frequency of calcium waves in ICC by increasing Ca(2 +) influx through reverse-mode NCX...|$|R
40|$|Interstitial {{cells of}} Cajal (ICC) {{isolated}} from the rabbit urethra exhibit pacemaker activity that results from spontaneous Ca 2 + waves. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate if this activity was influenced by Ca 2 + uptake into mitochondria. Spontaneous Ca 2 + waves were recorded using a <b>Nipkow</b> spinning <b>disk</b> confocal microscope and spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential with the electron transport chain inhibitors rotenone (10 μm) and antimycin A (5 μm) abolished Ca 2 + waves and increased basal Ca 2 + levels. Similar results were achieved when mitochondria membrane potential was collapsed using the protonophores FCCP (0. 2 μm) and CCCP (1 μm). Spontaneous Ca 2 + waves were not inhibited by the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (1 μm), suggesting that these effects were not attributable to an effect on ATP levels. STICs recorded under voltage clamp at − 60 mV were also inhibited by CCCP and antimycin A. Dialysis of cells with the mitochondrial uniporter inhibitor RU 360 (10 μm) also inhibited STICS. Stimulation of Ca 2 + uptake into mitochondria using the plant flavonoid kaempferol (10 μm) induced a series of propagating Ca 2 + waves. The kaempferol-induced activity was inhibited by application of caffeine (10 mm) or removal of extracellular Ca 2 +, but was not significantly affected by the IP 3 receptor blocker 2 -APB (100 μm). These data suggest that spontaneous Ca 2 + waves in urethral ICC are regulated by buffering of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + by mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{membrane}} extensions {{between two}} successive time points (15 s apart; Figures 2 and 5) were quantified by first creating {{a series of}} segmented images that identified and tracked each migrating cell (using a threshold value set at 1. 5 background in each confocal CAAX-CFP image; Orca- 2 camera; <b>Nipkow</b> spinning <b>disk</b> confocal; Metamorph software, Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). These binary sequential images were then subtracted to identify the areas where membranes were extended. A contour analysis (Metamorph) was then {{used to measure the}} thickness of the extension {{as a function of the}} location along the cell perimeter, F(x). In order to measure the extensions at the left and right front of the cell, we tracked the center of the binarized cell as a function of time to generate a migration path. The current direction of migration was assumed to be the direction of the movement of this center (the minimal distance for direction measurements was a 3 µm displacement). The coordinates were then read into a Matlab program and the cells perimeter was segmented into a left and right front by choosing the points on the perimeter that were within − 15 ° to − 60 ° of this axis to the left (left front) and within 15 ° to 60 ° to the right (right front) (the angle measured from the center of the cell). The mean forward extension (in µm) were measured in the left and the right front segment. These two parameters are shown in Figure 2 F. Th...|$|R
2500|$|As a 23-year-old German {{university}} student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow {{proposed and}} patented the <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> in 1884.

Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk [...] "image rasterizer" [...] became exceedingly common. Constantin Perskyi had coined the word television in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on August 25, 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others. However, {{it was not until}} 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology, by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn among others, made the design practical.|$|E

5000|$|While still {{a student}} he {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} using a spiral-perforated disk (<b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk),</b> to divide a picture into a mosaic of points and lines. Accounts of its invention state that the idea came to him while sitting alone at home with an oil lamp on Christmas Eve, 1883. Alexander Bain had transmitted images telegraphically in the 1840s but the <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> improved the encoding process.|$|E
50|$|Another {{drawback}} of the <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> as {{an image}} scanning device: the scanlines are not straight lines, but rather curves.So the ideal <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> should have either a very large diameter, which means smaller curvature, or a very narrow angular opening of its viewport. Another way to produce acceptable images would be to drill smaller holes (millimeter or even micrometer scale) closer to the outer sectors of the disk, but technological evolution favoured electronic means of image acquisition.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{aforementioned}} mechanical television, which never became popular for the practical reasons mentioned above, a <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> {{is used in}} one type of confocal microscope, a powerful optical microscope.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of using a <b>Nipkow</b> <b>disk</b> is that the image sensor (that is, the device converting light to electric signals) {{can be as simple as}} a single photocell or photodiode, since at each instant only a very small area (a pixel) is visible through the disk (and viewport), and so decomposing an image into lines is done almost by itself with little need for scanline timing, and very high scanline resolution.
