5|$|A strong {{proponent of}} the day fighter force and the defence of Germany, Galland used his {{position}} to improve {{the position of the}} Jagdwaffe. The <b>need</b> <b>was</b> now pressing, as Germany had declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, and Galland was keen to build up a force that could withstand the resurgence of the Western Allied Air Forces in preparation for what would become known as the Defence of the Reich campaign. Galland was outspoken, something that was not often tolerated by Göring. Yet, by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe, like Erhard Milch and Günther Korten, and personalities in the industrial sector such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler, Galland was able to survive in his position for three years.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a {{one-time}} assistant of former Giants' coach Bill Parcells, {{to be the}} Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the AFC championship game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by the departed Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary <b>need</b> <b>was</b> a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted Manning, and Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning.|$|E
5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} to stay financially afloat. National income was desperately needed and most came from tariffs on imported goods. Because of rampant smuggling, the <b>need</b> <b>was</b> immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service for the United States.|$|E

5|$|Casey's initial <b>need</b> <b>was</b> for {{engineer}} {{units to}} accomplish the daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The mutiny refocused {{attention}} on the long term tension {{over the use of}} Indochinese soldiers, and on the ways in which it could be resolved. The tension could {{be traced back to the}} creation of French Indochina. Cochinchina, the European term for southern Vietnam, had been colonised in 1867 and the remaining parts of Vietnam, Tonkin and Annam, the northern and central regions were conquered in 1883. Nominally, only Cochinchina was a colony, while Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia and Laos were protectorates which together comprised French Indochina. The problem centred around the French reliance on native soldiers to maintain colonial control. This <b>need</b> <b>was</b> problematic because Indo-Chinese soldiers were both enforcers of colonial order and colonial subjects. This created constant French concerns about their loyalty. Despite several attempts to deal with the issue, the basic tension between the need for and suspicion of native troops could never be entirely resolved. The need for forces to pacify the countryside was too pressing to do without them. As a result, the tension resurfaced at regular intervals, either due to proposals to improve the position of Indochinese soldiers in the army, or after a mutiny had raised question marks about the loyalty of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even more pressing <b>need</b> <b>was</b> obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E
50|$|Nicolaisen {{described}} four distinct {{types of}} information seeking behavior: visceral, conscious, formalized and compromised. The visceral <b>need</b> <b>is</b> expressed as the actual information need before it has been expressed. The conscious <b>need</b> <b>is</b> the <b>need</b> once it has been recognized by the seeker. The formalized <b>need</b> <b>is</b> the statement of the need and the compromised <b>need</b> <b>is</b> the query when related to the information system.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{characters}} {{described as}} having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> most frequently chosen last, indicating that special <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> an ineffective euphemism. Characters {{described as having}} special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> chosen last even more frequently than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability, suggesting that the euphemism special needs conveys more negativity than the non-euphemized term disability or the names of specific disabilities (e.g., blind). If special <b>needs</b> <b>was</b> an effective euphemism, then we would have observed that characters described as having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> chosen last less often than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability. But, as predicted, we observed just the opposite.|$|R

40|$|Human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> {{not part}} of the {{traditional}} themes of systematic theology or even of theological anthropology. � This article argues that human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> a core concept in systematic theology even though it has not been an explicit theme of systematic theology. The concept of human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> essentially related to the content of systematic theology. Any articulation of the doctrine of creation, covenant or salvation is underpinned by a view of what human <b>needs</b> <b>are.</b> This article shows that the question of human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> normally related to systematic theology by referring to the task of systematic theology and the different modes of discourse found in which systematic theology gives expression to this task. This article also suggest a method by which an implicit concept of human <b>needs</b> may <b>be</b> discovered and engaged critically. This is demonstrated by analysis of two designs of theological anthropology: Karl Barth� s second part of the third volume of his Church Dogmatics and the fundamental-theological anthropology of Wolfhart Pannenberg. ...|$|R

25|$|The Russian-American Company {{established}} Fort Ross in 1812 as its southernmost {{colony in}} North America, {{intended to provide}} Russian posts farther north with agricultural goods. When this <b>need</b> <b>was</b> filled by a deal between the RAC and the Hudson's Bay Company for produce from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River and other installations, the fort's intent was derailed, although it remained in Russian hands until 1841, and for the duration had a small population of Russians and other nationalities from the Russian Empire.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} {{lights in the}} Inner Passage inside the Great Barrier Reef arose with the {{development}} of ports in the north of Queensland such as Mackay in 1860 and Bowen in 1864. Access to these ports from the north necessitates the negotiation of the Inner Passage which was completely unlit. The <b>need</b> <b>was</b> officially noted by a Legislative Council committee in 1864, especially noting shipping from India, China and other countries to the north which would avoid the northern ports due to the dangerous navigation required, but no official recommendation was made.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{teachers}} {{are regarded as}} {{key players in the}} process of identifying and catering to students’ additional support needs within mainstream primary classrooms. However, teachers’ professional judgements regarding students with special <b>needs</b> have <b>been</b> found to be contextually influenced (e. g. by school context, student population, level of achievement). It is unclear whether teachers’ perceptions of their students’ actual support <b>needs</b> <b>are</b> also influenced by their personal and professional characteristics. Hence, {{a better understanding of the}} value of teachers’ perceptions regarding students’ <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> Therefore, this study explored perceptions of 109 Dutch mainstream primary teachers regarding four dimensions of students’ additional support. It addressed whether these teacher-perceived students’ <b>needs</b> <b>are</b> affected by teachers’ years of experience, level of training, personality traits and self-efficacy beliefs. It was found that teachers’ perceptions of students’ <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> relatively unbiased by their personal and professional characteristics...|$|R

25|$|The use of elision has {{continued}} to the present day, but significant changes {{have been made to}} the possessive and plural uses. By the 18th century, apostrophe + s was regularly used for all possessive singular forms, even when the letter e was not omitted (as in the gate’s height). This was regarded as representing the Old English genitive singular inflection -es. The plural use was greatly reduced, but a <b>need</b> <b>was</b> felt to mark possessive plural. The solution was to use an apostrophe after the plural s (as in girls’ dresses). However, this was not universally accepted until the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|Anger {{management}} is also beneficial in law enforcement. The role {{of police officers}} is to protect civilians, however conflicts between {{the police and the}} general public can develop. The goal of anger management would be to reduce such occurrences like police brutality from negatively impacting the relation between law enforcement and citizens. Anger management programs tailored towards this goal could orient themselves towards these means by focusing on conflict resolution and including specific law enforcement scenarios in the training. This <b>need</b> <b>was</b> noticed by Novaco, who originally designed an intervention for anger management based on cognitive behavioral therapy, resulting in a specialized skills training program for law enforcement.|$|E
25|$|IMF {{policies}} have been repeatedly criticised for {{making it difficult for}} indebted countries to say no to environmentally harmful projects that nevertheless generate revenues such as oil, coal, and forest-destroying lumber and agriculture projects.
