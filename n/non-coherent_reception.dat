Since the labeling plays a central role for BICM we propose a suitable definition of Gray labeling for differentially encoded transmission.

40|$|Abstract – In {{this paper}} we present an {{algorithm}} for joint carrier phase estimation and turbo decoding {{for the case}} of rapidly varying carrier phase during the transmitted block. The proposed algorithm shows improved performance over previously proposed communication schemes, both coherent and non-coherent, for channels with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and high carrier phase noise. The novel algorithm utilizes a modified “two dimensional ” Bit-Carrierphase A Posteriori Probability (BCAPP) decoder containing additional states representing the received carrier phase. The BCAPP decoder calculates two extrinsic metrics; one representing the bit soft value and the other representing the received carrier phase Probability Density Function (PDF) approximation. A modified structure of the turbo code iterations is suggested, implementing separate propagation of the two metrics between the BCAPP decoders. Most known methods to combat very high phase noise in the channel at {{low signal to noise}} ratio are based on <b>non-coherent</b> demodulation. Such <b>reception</b> schemes are designed for the worst-case phase noise and suffer high degradation for any level of phase noise. In our scheme, together with improved performance in high phase noise, the degradation decreases with the actual channel phase noise level. We show the robustness against phase noise model mismatch.

40|$|Future {{wireless}} network may {{consist of a}} cluster of low-complexity battery-powered nodes or mobile stations (MS). Information is propagated from one location in the network to another by cooperation and relaying. Due to the channel fading or node failure, one or more relaying links could become unreliable during multiple-hop relaying. Inspired by conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques exploiting multiple co-located transmit antennas to introduce temporal and spatial diversity, the error performance and robustness against channel fading of a multiple-hop cooperative network could be significantly improved by creating a virtual antenna array (VAA) with various distributed MIMO techniques. In this thesis, we concentrate on the low-complexity distributed MIMO designed for both coherent and <b>non-coherent</b> diversity signal <b>reception</b> at the destination node. Further improvement on the network throughput as well as spectral efficiency could be achieved by extending the concept of unidirectional relaying to bidirectional cooperative communication. Physical-layer network coding (PLNC) assisted distributed space-time block coding (STBC) scheme as well as non-coherent PLNC aided distributed differential STBC system are proposed. It is confirmed by the theoretical analysis that both approaches {{have the potential for}} offering full spatial diversity gain. Furthermore, differential encoding and non-coherent detection techniques are generally associated with performance degradation due to the doubled noise variance. More importantly, conventional differential schemes suffer from the incapability of recovering the source information in time-varying channels owing to the assumption of static channel model used in the derivation of non-coherent detection algorithm. Several low-complexity solutions are proposed and studied in this thesis, which are able to compensate the performance loss caused by non-coherent detection and guarantee the reliable recovery of information in applications with high mobility. A substantial amount of iteration gain is achieved by combining the differential encoding with error-correction code and sufficient interleaving, which allows iterative possessing at the receiver...|$|R

We derive theoretical {{limits on}} the performance and show how to design multilevel coding schemes and bit-interleaved coded modulation. Since Gray labeling is not possible for multiple symbol differential detection and PSK constellations, bit-interleaved coded modulation exhibits severe degradation compared to the multilevel coding approach. By means of simulations, where turbo codes are used as component codes, the theoretical considerations are conrmed and we show how close theoretical limits of differentially encoded PSK transmission over at fading channels can be approached by applying properly designed coded modulation schemes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{multilevel}} encoded transmis-sion over Rician fading channels is regarded. Espe-cially, {{we focus}} on differentially encoded APSK constel-lations, and <b>non–coherent</b> <b>reception</b> without any chan-nel state information at the receiver. Additional gains can be achieved if interleaving and detection are based on blocks of N consecutive symbols. This multiple– symbol differential detection {{can be applied to}} slowly time–varying channels. Regarding channel capacity as an appropriate performance measure when power-ful component codes are applied in the multilevel cod-ing scheme, we discuss several aspects, such as the dif-ferential encoding strategy, the mapping rule, and the optimization of the constellation. We show, that the competing coding scheme bit–interleaved coded mod-ulation is not well suited for multiple–symbol differen-tial detection, because no Gray labeling is possible for multiple–symbol differential detection and APSK con-stellations. In contrast to this, power and bandwidth efficient digital transmission close to capacity limit over fading channels using differential encoding is possi-ble if properly designed MLC schemes are employed. The theoretic considerations are confirmed by means of simulations, where turbo codes are applied as com-ponent codes. ...|$|E
40|$|Unipolar {{communications}} systems can transmit information using only real and positive signals. This includes {{a variety of}} physical channels ranging from optical (fiber or free-space), to RF wireless using amplitude modulation with <b>non-coherent</b> <b>reception,</b> to baseband single wire communications. Unipolar OFDM techniques enable to efficiently compensate frequency selective distortion in the unipolar communication systems. One of the leading examples of unipolar OFDM is asymmetric clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) originally proposed for optical communications. Flip-OFDM is an alternative approach that was proposed in a patent, but its performance and full potentials have never been investigated in the literature. In this paper, we first compare Flip-OFDM and ACO-OFDM, and show that both techniques have the same performance but different complexities (Flip-OFDM offers 50 % saving). We then propose a new detection scheme, which enables to reduce the noise at the Flip-OFDM receiver by almost 3 dB. The analytical performance of the noise filtering schemes {{is supported by the}} simulation results. Comment: 19 pages, 8 pages (re-uploaded with corrected Fig 2 a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, the {{performance}} of frequency-hopping spread-spectrum wireless sensor network sys-tems based on the generalized approach to signal processing {{in the presence of}} noise [1 – 5], which employ <b>non-coherent</b> <b>reception</b> and transmission diversity, is analyzed for frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Two different types of transmission diversity systems, a fast frequency-hopping (FFH) [6, 7] and a multicarrier frequency-hopping (MCFH) [8] wireless sensor network systems, are investigated. In order to combine received signals from transmit diversity channels, the diversity combining rule based on the generalized approach to sig-nal processing is developed. Probability of error equations are derived and utilized to evaluate {{the performance}} of two kinds of wireless sensor network systems. The effect of frequency-selective fading is also investigated in determining optimum frequency deviations of binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) signals. The systems con-sidered in this paper are frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS) ones with BFSK modulation, noncoherent detection, and definite diversity order. Diversity order refers to the number of hops per symbol for FFH and the number of subbands for MCFH wireless sensor network systems. Each transmit diversity channel is modeled as a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading process and is assumed to be independently faded. The maximum delay spread of each diversity reception is assumed smaller than one hop duration for FFH wireless sensor network systems, which is smaller than the symbol duration. It is also assumed that one symbol is transmitted durin...|$|E
