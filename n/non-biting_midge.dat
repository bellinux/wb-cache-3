50|$|Tanypodinae is a {{subfamily}} of midges in the <b>non-biting</b> <b>midge</b> family (Chironomidae).

50|$|A {{series of}} 3 {{ornamental}} ponds {{exists in the}} oriental garden and feed into the River Garw. The ponds {{are thought to be}} predominantly free from wildfowl and fish but do sport healthy populations of common toads, common frogs and palmate newts. The ponds also support a diverse aquatic invertebrate assemblage including, water boatman, pond skater, great diving beetle, water beetle, stonefly larvae, mayfly larvae, damselfly larvae dragonfly larvae, caddisfly larvae, <b>non-biting</b> <b>midge</b> larvae, blackfly larvae, cranefly larvae, midge larvae, water louse, freshwater shrimp and freshwater snail.|$|E
50|$|G. lacustris is a predatory insect. The species hunts on {{or below}} water surface for insects {{and other small}} {{invertebrates}} using their strong forelegs which end with claws. They also have piercing and sucking mouthparts in order to consume other small insects that fall into the water surface and to feed on live and dead insects such as culiseta annulata, <b>non-biting</b> <b>midge,</b> and other water invertebrates. With their front pair of legs theyâ€™re able to detect ripples and sense vibrations in the surface film from struggling insects and handle or grasp their prey. G. lacustris eat other small invertebrates and digest them internally.|$|E
50|$|Chironomus riparius, {{also known}} as Chironomus thummi and {{commonly}} known as the harlequin fly, is a species of <b>non-biting</b> <b>midge.</b> Their larvae are known by the common name of blood worm due to their red colouration. It is common in both North America and Europe. The species was described in 1804 by Johann Wilhelm Meigen.C. riparius has been used extensively as a model for genome structure analysis in insects and is also used in toxicology tests and functional developmental genetic studies. Both their adult and larval forms have been implicated as disease vectors but are also an important part of freshwater food chains.|$|E

50|$|Another {{indicator}} species is Chironomus riparius, {{a species of}} <b>non-biting</b> <b>midge,</b> which {{has been used to}} test the effects of TBT on development and reproduction at sublethal concentrations found in marine environments. It was found that only 0.05 ng/ml range is enough to have developmental effects on their larvae, and 10-100 ng/l was enough to seriously offset the female to male ratio in the population. At 10 ng/l females were at 55.6% of the population and 85.7% at 100 ng/l. These results are interesting because unlike the masculinization of the stengoglassan gastropods, this experiment shows feminization.|$|E
50|$|The golden topminnow's diet {{ranges from}} aquatic plants to {{terrestrial}} invertebrates but consists mostly of aquatic invertebrates. Food habits were studied among many {{different species of}} fish throughout Lake Seminole, Florida-Georgia, including the food habits of the golden topminnow. The golden topminnow was observed feeding on small proportions of Macrophytes (aquatic vegetation) and a much wider array of aquatic invertebrates, including Gastropoda (snails/slugs), large quantities of Ostracoda (seed shrimp), Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Coleoptera (water-beetles), and Chironomidae (<b>non-biting</b> <b>midge</b> flies). Although the golden topminnow's diet does not include vertebrate prey, the most common food sources are seed shrimp and midge larvae with water beetles and mayflies as minor contributors to its diet. Because of its trophic level position, the golden topminow also has {{a wide array of}} predators that feed on smaller, surface feeding vertebrates. These include, {{but are not limited to}} the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, the redear sunfish, Lepomis microlophus, the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, and the Bluespotted sunfish, Enneacanthus gloriosus.|$|E
