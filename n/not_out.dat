5|$|Alistair Campbell of Zimbabwe was {{the first}} to score a century in the tournament when he made 100 against New Zealand during the inaugural edition. Four players—Sourav Ganguly (India), Herschelle Gibbs (South Africa), Chris Gayle (West Indies) and Shikhar Dhawan (India)—hold the record for the most number of centuries with three each. A further four players—Saeed Anwar (Pakistan), Marcus Trescothick (England), Upul Tharanga (Sri Lanka) and Shane Watson (Australia)—have scored two centuries. Gayle's three centuries in 2006 is a record for any player in a single edition. New Zealand's Nathan Astle's 145 against the United States remains the highest {{individual}} score as of 2017. Jacques Kallis' (South Africa) 113 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against Sri Lanka in 1998, Ganguly's 141 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against South Africa in 2000, and Chris Cairns' (New Zealand) 102 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against India in the same tournament feature in the top 100 ODI innings of all-time by a list released by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Brian Lara and Chris Gayle of the West Indies, Donald Bradman of Australia and Virender Sehwag of India are {{the only}} batsmen to reach 300 more than once. Lara's 400 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against England in 2004, his second Test triple-century, is {{the highest score in}} Test cricket and the only {{instance}} of a Test quadruple century; Lara is also the only player to have surpassed 350 twice. Bradman also scored 299 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against South Africa in 1932. Sehwag also scored 293 off 254 balls in the third Test between Sri Lanka and India in December 2009.|$|E

He scored 13 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> and 2, and took 3/40 and 2/68 in a 222-run win. However, {{he was unable to}} repeat this form in the three remaining matches, taking only two more wickets in total, but Baroda nevertheless managed to win the Ranji Trophy.

5|$|In 1927–28 Australian season, Woodfull {{played in}} five matches and was highly {{productive}} {{in the last}} three. He scored 99 and 191 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> in a victory over New South Wales, before adding 106 in an innings triumph over South Australia. He rounded off the season with 94 and 81 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> in a draw in the return match against New South Wales. He ended the Australian campaign with 645 runs at 129.00. With Ponsford amassing 1217 runs at 152.12, Victoria usually {{got off to a}} strong start with the bat, and won the Shield easily.|$|E
5|$|In ODI cricket, Chappell {{made his}} debut in January 1971, {{but did not}} score his first century in the format until 1977, when his 125 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> helped Australia to chase down victory against England. His highest score in ODIs came in 1980, when he scored 138 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against New Zealand, and he scored his third and final ODI century against the same opponents in 1982. Though he only scored three ODI centuries, {{he was the first}} player to score more than 2,000 runs in the format, and {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the leading run-scorer in ODIs.|$|E
5|$|In One Day International cricket, Richards {{made his}} debut during the 1975 Cricket World Cup in England. He scored his first century the {{following}} year in the same country, during the first ODI match of the tour, remaining 119 <b>not</b> <b>out.</b> He holds the two highest scores by a West Indian batsman in ODI cricket, 181 against Sri Lanka in 1987 and 189 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against England in 1984. His score of 189 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> was also the highest score by any ODI batsman for just under 13 years, until it was surpassed by Saeed Anwar's 194. This innings was also named by Wisden as the best ODI innings of all-time in a 2002 list. In total, seven of Richards' eleven centuries were in the top 100, and his 1979 unbeaten 138 against England at Lord's ranked second.|$|E
25|$|In 2000–01, Andrews {{played in}} three Second XI {{fixtures}} for New South Wales. She scored {{a total of}} 19 runs in three brief innings that all ended in <b>not</b> <b>outs,</b> and took two wickets at 38.50 and an economy rate of 3.34.|$|R

5|$|In the First Test, England {{amassed a}} big first innings score and looked likely to win, but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia, a {{performance}} Bradman rated {{as the best}} he had ever seen. With Australia forced to follow-on, Bradman fought hard to ensure McCabe's effort was not in vain, and he secured the draw with 144 <b>not</b> <b>out.</b> It was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> in the next Test as Australia struggled to another draw. Rain completely washed out the Third Test at Old Trafford.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire {{again at}} the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star {{performer}} as he took 7–77 and 5–32, {{but this time he}} did well with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.|$|E

5|$|Tallon {{retired in}} {{dramatic}} circumstances {{after the first}} match of the 195354 Sheffield Shield season. During the match, he suddenly took off his gloves and handed the keeping duties to Peter Burge. He scored 21 and 54 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> in a drawn match against New South Wales. Two months later, he played for Arthur Morris's XI against Hassett's XI, a testimonial match for the latter. Tallon made 17 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> and nine in a 121-run win. Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for another decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{first century}} in the {{championship}} was scored by Dennis Amiss of England when he made 137 against India in the 1975 World Cup. The same day New Zealand's Glenn Turner scored 171 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against East Africa. It remained the highest individual total {{over the next two}} editions until Indian cricketer Kapil Dev scored 175 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> against Zimbabwe in 1983. Following that, the record was broken successively by Viv Richards (181) in 1987, Gary Kirsten (188 <b>not</b> <b>out)</b> in 1996, Chris Gayle (215) and Martin Guptill (237 <b>not</b> <b>out)</b> both in 2015. India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of centuries with six, followed by Australia's Ricky Ponting and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara with five each. Mark Waugh, Sourav Ganguly, Mahela Jayawardene, AB de Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan are joint-third with four centuries. Three players have scored three centuries in a single tournament– Waugh, Ganguly, and Matthew Hayden– in 1996, 2003, 2007 respectively, while Sangakkara made four consecutive centuries in the 2015 World Cup. Ireland's Kevin O'Brien recorded the fastest century when he reached the figure in 50 balls, against England in the 2011 World Cup. In 1992, Andy Flower of Zimbabwe– making his ODI debut in a World Cup– scored a century. In the 2015 tournament, 38 centuries were scored, making it the highest number in a single tournament, while the 1979 competition had the least with two.|$|E

5|$|Within two years, 31-year-old Australian Test cricketer Charles Eady {{came close}} to {{breaking}} the record, when he made 566 for Break-o'-Day against Wellington in Hobart in less than eight hours spread over three weeks in March 1902. This remained, for over a century, the closest challenge to Collins's record: his score was finally beaten in January 2016 by Pranav Dhanawade, a 15-year-old Indian boy who scored 1,009 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> from 327 balls for KC Gandhi School against Arya Gurukul School in Mumbai. Only five other players, Prithvi Shaw (546), Dadabhoy Havewala (515), JC Sharp (505 <b>not</b> <b>out),</b> Malhotra Chamanlal (502 <b>not</b> <b>out),</b> and Brian Lara (501 <b>not</b> <b>out)</b> have ever scored more than 500 runs in one innings in any form of cricket.

5|$|A {{string of}} big scores and {{a record number}} of catches during the 1968–69 season earned Chappell the Australian Cricketer of the Year award. Against the touring West Indies, Chappell hit 188 <b>not</b> <b>out,</b> 123, 117, 180 and 165 before the New Year. Two of these centuries came in the Test series, when Chappell's average for 548 runs was 68.50. Chappell was {{elevated}} to number three in the batting order and became a less-frequent bowler; he was also appointed vice-captain of the team.|$|E
5|$|After Hayden's departure, Ponting {{was joined}} by Martyn, who {{completed}} his half-century in 46 balls. Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50 off 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two sixes off Harbhajan and one off Ashish Nehra. The pair added 100 runs off 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came off 29 balls. At {{the end of the}} innings, Australia had scored 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting had scored 140 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> (off 121 balls; four fours and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> (off 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the 2015 competition, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 extras. Srinath conceded 87 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what was his last international game.|$|E
