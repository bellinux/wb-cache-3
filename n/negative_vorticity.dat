40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{solutions}} to the quadratic gradient wind equation are examined using 200 -mb data for two selected cases. Under conditions of anticyclonic flow, both solutions are shown to have relevance. The normal solution is valid for wind speeds less than twice geostrophic, whereas the "anomalous " solution applies for wind speeds greater than twice the geostrophic value. For both cases, wind speeds of {{more than three times}} the geostrophic value were detected synoptically over large areas of the United States. Areas of <b>negative</b> absolute <b>vorticity</b> were generally found within the anomalous flow regions. The absolute value of the absolute vorticity approached zhe local value of the Coriolis parameter. Although cause-effect relationships are difficult to ascertain, the coexistence of <b>negative</b> absolute <b>vorticity</b> and anomalous flow implies stability. Instability would be expected in regions where the anomalous flow alone was observed. Manifestation of this instability in the form of clear-air turbulence (CAT) is suggested.

The northwest–southeast-oriented bands lasted for over 6 h, comprising both a single major band (more than 30 km wide) and multiple minor bands (about 10 km wide). The convective bands initiated within the ascending branch of a secondary circulation associated with both near-surface and elevated frontogenesis, but the bands remained nearly stationary while the near-surface frontogenesis moved quickly equatorward. The bands occurred downstream of complex terrain on the anticyclonic-shear side of a midlevel jet streak, where conditional, dry symmetric (<b>negative</b> potential <b>vorticity),</b> and inertial (<b>negative</b> absolute <b>vorticity)</b> instabilities were present. To determine the mechanisms responsible for the development and organization of these bands, simula-tions using a convection-permitting numerical model are conducted. In contrast to the operational models, these simulations are able to produce convective bands {{in the same area}} and {{at about the same time}} as that observed.

5000|$|Vorticity in the {{atmosphere}} is created in three different ways, which are named in their resultant vorticity. These are; Coriolis vorticity, curvature vorticity, and shear vorticity. For example, {{at the base of}} a trough, there is curvature and shear vorticity. Curvature vorticity is due to the increasing cyclonic turning as an air parcel enters the trough base. The maximum counter-clockwise spin (positive vorticity in the N.H.) is at the trough base. Shear vorticity is caused by the difference in wind speed between air moving through the trough base (typically a jet or jet finger) and slower moving air on either poleward and equatorward side of the faster flow. Consider that slower air to the poleward side will be imparted counter-clockwise spin (picture faster moving air (jet) south and slower air to the north, spin is created). Thus, to the north (poleward) of the trough base an air parcel will experience positive vorticity. Likewise, to the south of the faster flow the air is spun in a clockwise direction (faster air (jet)to the north with slower air to the south, spin is created). Thus, to the south of the faster winds will be an area of <b>negative</b> <b>vorticity.</b>|$|E

Subme-soscale processes become stronger as the resolution is increased from 4 km to 0. 5 km. There is a seasonal cycle in the magnitude of horizontal buoyancy gradients and horizontal wavenumber spectra consistent with stronger mixed layer insta-bilities developing as the mixed layer deepens and energising the submesoscale. Up to 30 % of the mixed layer volume in winter has <b>negative</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> and this <b>negative</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> is found in both mesoscale vortices and filaments. Further investigation of the filaments that arise in anticyclonic eddies show that they are generated in regions of <b>negative</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> and lead to the upwelling of fluid from the thermocline. Symmetric instability is found to be the most likely mechanism. The role of flow curvature is considered and it is shown that the angular velocity of mesoscale eddies, as well as relative vorticity, contributes to their stability. A numerical tracer release experiment shows that the filament generation process leads to downwelling of surface layer flows and a simplified biogeochemical experiment shows that the instability gives rise to much higher primary productivity in mesoscale anticyclones. Observations of a mixed layer front observed in the North Atlantic are presented which has a more diffuse cross-front buoyancy gradient at the surface than lower in the mixed layer and a strong ageostrophic cross-front velocity. The observations are used to motivate two dimensional simulations of Rossby adjustment. These simulations show that as the frontal strength increases the Rossby adjustment phase accounts for an increasing proportion of the restratification. The simulations become much more turbulent over the parameter range for frontal strength.

We show that nonlinear processes as inverse cascade of the energy and vorticity concentration are essentially determined by trajectory trapping or eddying. The statistics of the trajectories of the vorticity elements is studied using a semianalytic method. The separation of the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>vorticity</b> is due to the attraction produced by a large scale vortex on the small scale vortices of the same sign. More precisely, a large scale velocity is shown to determine average transverse drifts, which have opposite orientations for positive and <b>negative</b> <b>vorticity.</b> They appear in the presence of trapping and lead to energy flow to large scales due to the increase of the circulation of the large vortex. Recent results on drift turbulence evolution in magnetically confined plasmas are discussed in order to underline the idea that there is a link between the inverse cascade and trajectory trapping. The physical mechanisms are different in fluids and plasmas due to the different types of nonlinearities of the two systems, but trajectory trapping has the main role in both cases.

Vorticity effect on the modulational instability of weakly nonlinear gravity-capillary wave packets is investigated. It is shown that the vorticity modifies significantly the modulational instability of gravity-capillary wave trains, namely the growth rate and instability bandwidth.

A similar result has been obtaîned by Kunze (1985) using a ray-tracing approach and bas been confirmed by observations (Kunze and Stanford 1984). Another result of RR 86 concems the mixed layer depth variations. Their Figs. 3 and 8 show a systematic downwelling in the <b>negative</b> <b>vorticity</b> region of the jet and systematic upwelling in the positive vorticity region. Although large upwellings and downwellings occur {{in the presence of a}} wind stress perpendicular to the front (Niiler 1969), it is not clear how such systematic effects can result from unforced inertial oscillations. RR 86 find this behavior of the mixed layer depth in a shallow-water model where horizontal dispersion is neglected (their Fig. 3) and therefore suggest it is due to the nonlinearity of the mass equation. Our failure to reproduce the results of RR 86 with a fully nonlinear shallow-water mode 1 led us to investigate more carefully the role of nonlinear terms, using both direct numerical simulation and asymptotic analysis.

The downstream {{development of the}} flow shows that {{the interaction of the}} vortex with the blade wake is the primary cause of the changes in the core parameters. The blade sheds <b>negative</b> <b>vorticity</b> into its wake {{as a result of the}} induced angle of attack generated by the passing vortex.

The extended wing flap of the swept constant chord half-model was equipped with either a blowing facility as an active flow control device or with other flap side-edge modifications such as wing tip fences, microtabs and winglets. The flap side edge noise is reduced with the blowing configuration between 2 kHz and 5 kHz. The maximum noise reduction of 15 : 9 dB is achieved at 2 : 9 kHz. Varying {{the diameter of the}} blowing orifices shows that the noise reduction is governed by the momentum rather than the flow rate of the blowing.
