5|$|Literature {{academic}} Jayne Ashleigh Glover {{says that}} while Zone Three on the surface {{appears to be a}} feminist utopia, Lessing shows that it is far from idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and warn of the dangers of stagnation. Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back <b>new</b> <b>perspectives,</b> followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E
5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have put <b>new</b> <b>perspectives</b> and priorities into its conservation biology. Conservation priorities focus at the population level of diversity, which is declining at rates ten times that of species extinction. Population level diversity is what provides ecosystem services, such as the keystone role that salamanders play in the soil ecosystems, including the nutrient cycling that supports wetland and forested ecosystems.|$|E
40|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> on Paul is a {{new theory}} of how to {{interpret}} the Pauline epistles {{through the lens of}} first century Judaism. Three of the leading scholars that hold to the <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> are E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, and N. T. Wright. These men have done their best to defend the <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> of Paul, but have not adequately used, or explained the arguments set forth in the book of James, specifically found in James 2 : 14 - 26. The <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> fails to either give an analysis of James through the proposed lens of the <b>New</b> <b>Perspective,</b> or show how the book of James affects the <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> on Paul overall...|$|R

40|$|Debates {{over the}} <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> on Paul show {{a great deal}} of {{similarity}} to Reformation-era debates over synergism. In fact, synergism {{has become one of the}} more common charges made against the <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> by its critics. After documenting the charge in these modern debates, this article explores the details of synergistic controversy surrounding the Reformation. Among other things, various wings of the Reformation appear to have understood, and reacted to, synergism in quite-different ways. The article then highlights some aspects of <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> debates that are reminiscent of earlier theological debates over synergism and suggests ways in which greater attention to some aspects of theological interpretation might help move this part of the <b>New</b> <b>Perspective</b> debate forward...|$|R
5|$|By the 1990s, new {{historical}} research (especially by Air Force historians Earl Tilford, Bernard Nalty, and Jacob Van Staaveren) and the publications of the Military Institute of Vietnam finally opened <b>new</b> <b>perspectives</b> on aerial interdiction during the Vietnam War. During Commando Hunt for example, the Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks {{had been destroyed}} or damaged by air strikes in Laos. These figures were hard to reconcile with the 6,000 trucks imported annually into North Vietnam between 1965 and 1970 – {{for all of its}} operations. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started down the trail was destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to be altered in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remarkable}} historiographical {{school of}} {{interpretation of the}} history of Argentina was founded by members of the 1837 generation, including Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the charismatic authority of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical {{until the end of the}} 19thcentury, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek <b>new</b> <b>perspectives.</b> The newer authors would differ about the relative weight of the causes of the May Revolution and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective; Ricardo Levene and the Academia Nacional de la Historia were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti-imperialism; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.|$|E
