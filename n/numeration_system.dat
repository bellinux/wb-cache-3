40|$|Abstract. Using self similar tilings we {{represent}} {{the elements of}} R n as digit expansions with digits in R n being operated on by powers of an expansive linear map. We construct Markov partitions for hyperbolic toral automorphisms by considering a special class of self similar tilings modulo the integer lattice. We use the digit expansions inherited from these tilings to give a symbolic representation for the toral automorphisms. Fractals and fractal tilings have captured the imaginations of {{a wide spectrum of}} disciplines. Computer generated images of fractal sets are displayed in public science centers, museums, and on the covers of scientific journals. Fractal tilings which have interesting properties are finding applications in many areas of mathematics. For example, number theorists have linked fractal tilings of R 2 with <b>numeration</b> <b>systems</b> for R 2 in complex bases [16], [8]. We will see that fractal self similar tilings of R n provide natural building blocks for <b>numeration</b> <b>systems</b> of R n.

They have also been studied from a combinatorial and topological point of view. From a dynamical point of view, it is natural to consider an odometer as a map acting on infinite words over a finite alphabet of digits. By putting an infinite sequence of zeroes in front of any finite word, the set of representations of all the integers is embedded into the set of infinite words onto which the odometer acts.

The Rhind papyrus was written by Ahmes and dates from the Second Intermediate Period; it includes a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for rational numbers 2/n, as well as 84 word problems. Solutions to each problem were written out in scribal shorthand, with the final answers of all 84 problems being expressed in Egyptian fraction notation. 2/n tables similar to the one on the Rhind papyrus also appear on some of the other texts. However, as the Kahun Papyrus shows, vulgar fractions were also used by scribes within their calculations.|$|E
