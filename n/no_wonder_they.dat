500|$|By {{the time}} Arsenal next played Manchester United, the club had {{extended}} its unbeaten league run to 49 games. United stood in sixth {{place in the}} table, 11 points behind Arsenal and were intent on ending their rivals' undefeated streak. Ferguson in his press conference described Arsenal's conduct in the equivalent fixture a year ago as [...] "...the worst thing I've seen in this sport. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> were so delighted at the verdicts." ...|$|E
500|$|Of de Grasse's {{negotiations}} with the Spanish that secured {{the use of his}} fleet and his order to the economic fleet to remain in the West Indies, Royal Navy Captain Thomas White, in his 1830 analysis of the 1781 campaign, wrote that [...] "f the British government had sanctioned, or a British admiral had adopted such a measure, [...] the one would have been turned out, and the other would have been hung: <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> succeeded and we failed." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>they</b> said (and I doubt {{not that}} they spoke {{honestly}} and simply what they felt) that while that thought was before them, this world was utterly nothing to them; that they were as men in a dream, or dead, not caring to eat or to move, for fear of losing that glorious thought; but {{felt as if they}} were (as they were most really and truly) caught up into heaven, and taken utterly out of themselves by the beauty and glory of God's perfect goodness. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>they</b> cried out with David, 'Whom have I in heaven, O Lord, but Thee? and there is none on earth whom I desire in comparison of Thee.' <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>they</b> said with St. Peter when he saw our Lord's glory, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here,' and felt like men gazing upon some glorious picture or magnificent show, off which they cannot take their eyes; and which makes them forget for the time all beside in heaven and earth.|$|R

500|$|Many {{men come}} to church to save or gain a reputation; {{or because they}} will not be singular, but comply with an {{established}} custom; yet, all the while, they are loaded with the guilt of old rooted sins.

500|$|In the lead-up to the match, Ferguson criticised Arsenal's {{previous}} conduct at Old Trafford and likened their behaviour {{to that of}} a mob: [...] "What Arsenal players {{did that}} day was the worst thing I've seen in this sport. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> were so delighted at the verdicts." [...] He described the game as must win given Arsenal's points advantage, but highlighted it was still all to play for given the league leaders needed to play several top teams twice. Although Ferguson praised Arsenal's unbeaten run, he disputed whether this heralded a shift of power in English football: [...] " [...] are still the team every club wants to beat most of all – regardless of who is champions or unbeaten records. In that respect, our profile as the major club in the country is untouchable. That is obvious and will never change." ...|$|E

[...] Gruffudd has also said that [...] "There's a physicality and confidence to Americans; they're very present. That's something I enjoy being around because it rubs off on you.

60|$|To be just, the {{men were}} not greatly to blame for this painful and demoralizing {{termination}} to the evening's entertainment. Sergeant Troy had so strenuously insisted, glass in hand, that drinking should be the bond of their union, that those who wished to refuse hardly liked to be so unmannerly under the circumstances.
