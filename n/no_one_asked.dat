In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> Ross whether he wanted to run for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.|$|E

However, {{he was now}} misled by an Admiralty intelligence report advising that the German main battle fleet was still in port. The Director of Operations Division, Rear Admiral Thomas Jackson, had asked the intelligence division, Room 40, for the current location of German call sign DK, used by Admiral Scheer. They had replied that it was currently transmitting from Wilhelmshaven. It was known to the intelligence staff that Scheer deliberately used a different call sign when at sea, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> for this information or explained the reason behind the query – to locate the German fleet.|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were critical}} {{of the decision to}} base a video game on The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. A writer for GamesRadar considered it to be an example of [...] "sheer exploitation", and felt it was [...] "a game <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> for, based on a sequel fans hated, representing a genre its intended demographic was too young to remember". Game Informers Jay Fitzloff argued that the game was unsuitable for a male gamer, expressing concern that [...] "owning this title will brand them a pansy {{for the rest of their}} elementary school careers". Although Fitzloff called the game a [...] "worthwhile pastime", he argued that it was not worth the possibility of being bullied at school.|$|E
500|$|After the event, it was {{claimed by}} Nixon and Kissinger that Sihanouk {{had given his}} tacit {{approval}} for the raids, but this is dubious. Sihanouk told U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles on January 10, 1968, {{that he would not}} oppose American [...] "hot pursuit" [...] of retreating North Vietnamese troops [...] "in remote areas ," [...] provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement [...] "cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids... In any event, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> him.... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval." [...] During the course of the Menu bombings, Sihanouk's government formally protested [...] "American violation of Cambodian territory and airspace" [...] at the United Nations on over 100 occasions, although it [...] "specifically protested the use of B-52s" [...] only once, following an attack on Bu Chric in November 1969.|$|E

500|$|The {{music critic}} Harold Schonberg surmises that had Bizet lived, {{he might have}} revolutionised French opera; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably Puccini who, {{according}} to Dean, developed the idea [...] "till it became threadbare". Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names Chabrier and Ravel as composers influenced by him. Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet's tragic heroes—Frédéri in L'Arlésienne, José in Carmen—is reflected in Tchaikovsky's late symphonies, particularly the B minor [...] "Pathetique". Macdonald writes that Bizet's legacy {{is limited by the}} shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years. [...] "The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable. It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{relations}} with China worsened, Sihanouk pursued rapprochement with the US. He learned that Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, had {{expressed a desire}} to see Angkor Wat. Seeing {{this as an opportunity to}} restore {{relations with}} the US, Sihanouk invited her to visit Cambodia and personally hosted her visit in October 1967. Jacqueline Kennedy's visit paved the way for Sihanouk to meet with Chester Bowles, the US ambassador to India. To Bowles, Sihanouk expressed his willingness to restore bilateral relations with the US, hinted at the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia, and suggested he would turn a blind eye should US forces enter Cambodia to attack Viet Cong troops retreating into Cambodia from South Vietnam—a practice known as [...] "hot pursuit"—provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement [...] "cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids" [...] the US launched in eastern Cambodia beginning in March 1969 as part of Operation Menu, adding: [...] "In any event, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> him.... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval." [...] The bombing forced the Viet Cong to flee from their jungle sanctuaries and seek refuge in populated towns and villages. As a result, Sihanouk became concerned that Cambodia might get drawn into fighting in the Vietnam War. In June 1969 he extended diplomatic recognition to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRGSV), hoping that he could get the Viet Cong troops under its charge to leave Cambodia should they win the war. At the same time, he also openly admitted the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia for the first time, prompting the US to restore formal diplomatic relations with Cambodia three months later.|$|E

Reign said, [...] "Want to know a dirty secret that Measure B proponents, who say {{what they did was}} in the interest of us supposedly helpless performers, never brought up? After hours of sex with no breaks, attempting to endure the friction of the condom in your vagina or anus is...impossible. And to do this daily amounts to an occupational work hazard.
