40|$|Geographical {{distribution}} {{records of}} pathogens and pests {{are the basis}} for phytosanitary decision-making. Monilinia fructicola, {{one of the three}} Monilinia species responsible for brown rot of stone fruit, is listed as a regulated pest for South Africa. Many disputes about the justification of this classification have arisen during the past years as records have been published regarding the presence of this pathogen in South Africa. Results of several surveys conducted from 1985 in stone fruit orchards, revealed that M. laxa is the only causal agent of brown rot in South Africa. However, another <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> non-compliance (<b>interception</b> <b>of</b> regulated pests) was received by the National Plant Protection Organisation of South Africa in 2003 stating that M. fructicola was detected on consignments of South African Prunus fruits (P. domestica) in the United Kingdom. A detection survey according to inspections and sampling relevant to the biology of Monilinia species were conducted in the identified orchards at various stages throughout the year. Molecular techniques with species-specific primers for M. fructicola, M. laxa and M. fructigena based on the EPPO Diagnostic Protocol for M. fructicola were used for the identification of presumptive positive Monilinia isolates. The absence of M. fructicola from South African stone fruit orchards was again confirmed by this survey and its status in South Africa can be reported as: absent, not known to occur, confirmed by a detection survey. The regulated status of M. fructicola in South Africa is therefore scientifically justified by the results from this survey. Articl...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R

Akin to the integrated disease surveillance project where more than 90 % of the districts report weekly data through E-mail/portal, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be implemented if it is incorporated into the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke scheme.
