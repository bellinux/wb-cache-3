40|$|Observational {{appearance}} of a neutron star in the subsonic <b>propeller</b> <b>state</b> which is a companion of a wind-fed mass-exchange close binary system is discussed. During the subsonic <b>propeller</b> <b>state</b> the neutron star magnetosphere {{is surrounded by a}} spherical quasi-static plasma envelope, which is extended from the magnetospheric boundary up to the star accretion radius. The energy input to the envelope due to the propeller action by the neutron star exceeds the radiative losses and the plasma temperature in the envelope is of the order of the free-fall temperature. Under this condition the magnetospheric boundary is interchange stable. Nevertheless, I find that the rate of plasma penetration from the envelope into the magnetic field of the neutron star due to diffusion and magnetic field line reconnection processes is large enough for the accretion power to dominate the spindown power. I show that the accretion luminosity of the neutron star in the subsonic <b>propeller</b> <b>state</b> is 5 * 10 **{ 30 } - 10 **{ 33 } (dM/dt) _{ 15 } erg/s, where dM/dt is the strength of the normal companion stellar wind which is parametrized in terms of the maximum possible mass accretion rate onto the neutron star magnetosphere. On this basis I suggest that neutron stars in the subsonic <b>propeller</b> <b>state</b> are expected to be observed as low luminous accretion-powered pulsars. The magnetospheric radius of the neutron star in this state is determined by the strength of the stellar wind, (dM/dt) _c, while the accretion luminosity is determined by the rate of plasma penetration into the star magnetosphere, (dM/dt) _a, which is (dM/dt) _a << (dM/dt) _c. That is why the classification of the neutron star state in these objects using the steady accretion model (i. e. setting (dM/dt) _a = (dM/dt) _c) can lead to a mistaken conclusion.

40|$|Current {{treatments}} of accretion flows in magnetic cataclysmic variables (CV s) {{imply that the}} criterion for disc formation depends only on the accretion rate and the magnetic field strength, and is independent of the spin rate of the accreting star.

The nylon also has excellent inertia and they inherent chemical resistance. They reduce the weight and the cost of the propellers and they can be installed easily in the aircrafts. There are several nylon 6 -clay hybrids which are molecular composites of nylon 6 and also silicate layers of saponite and montmorillonite, Nylon clay hybrids and NCHP's. The mechanical strength of the molecular composite is increased with increase in the clay minerals. The propellers are designed on the analysis made on the momentum theory from the thrust equation and the Bernoulli's equation for upstream and downstream of the propellers. The designing could be done on any 3 D CAD software's. The designed propeller can be manufactured by Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) which is filament based rapid prototyping system process. It allows to build the component by selective layer on extruding a semi-molten polymer composite. The FDM process is assisted by a computer which posses the 3 D CAD design. The change in the tensile strength of the propellers during manufacturing can occur based on the x, y, z directions material addition.

40|$|We {{explore a}} {{possibility}} {{to explain the}} phenomenon of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXP) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGR) within the scenario of fall-back magnetic accretion onto a young isolated neutron star. The X-ray emission of the pulsar in this case is originated due to accretion of matter onto the surface of the neutron star from the magnetic slab surrounding its magnetosphere. The expected spin-down rate of the neutron star within this approach is close to the observed value. We show that these neutron stars are relatively young and are going through a transition from the <b>propeller</b> <b>state</b> to the accretor state. The pulsars activity in the gamma-rays is connected with their relative youth and is provided by the energy stored in the non-equilibrium layer located in the crust of low-mass neutron stars. This energy can be released due to mixing of matter in the neutron star crust with super heavy nuclei approaching its surface and getting unstable. The nuclei fission in the low-density region initiates chain reactions leading to the nuclear explosion. The outbursts are likely to be triggered by an instability developing in the region where the matter accreted by the neutron star is accumulated at the magnetic pole regions.

40|$|The recent {{discoveries of}} pulsed X-ray {{emission}} from three ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources have finally {{enabled us to}} recognize a subclass within the ULX class: the great pretenders, neutron stars (NSs) that appear to emit X-ray radiation at isotropic luminosities L_X = 7 × 10 ^ 39 erg s^- 1 - 1 × 10 ^ 41 erg s^- 1 only because their emissions are strongly beamed toward our direction and our sight lines are offset by only a few degrees from their magnetic-dipole axes. The three known pretenders appear to be stronger emitters than the presumed black holes of the ULX class, such as Holmberg II & IX X- 1, IC 10 X- 1, and NGC 300 X- 1.

50|$|Helicopter rotors {{operate in}} a much more {{challenging}} environment than a <b>normal</b> aircraft <b>propeller.</b> To start with, helicopters normally use the main rotor both for lift and manoeuvrability, whereas fixed-wing aircraft normally use separate surfaces for these tasks. Pitch and yaw are operated by changing the lift on different sides of the rotor, using a system of bell cranks to adjust the blades to different angles of attack as they rotate. To roll to the left, the blades are adjusted so there is slightly more angle of attack on the front and slightly less on the back, resulting in a net upward lift on the right side that rolls the aircraft. The reason the blades are adjusted in the front and back instead of right and left is due to phase lag caused by precession.|$|R

Here, we present {{the results of the}} analysis of recent INTEGRAL observations, aimed at assessing the long-term variability of the hard X-ray emission, and thus the stability of the accretion state. We confirm that the source behaves as a persistent hard X-ray emitter between 2003 and 2012. We propose that XSS J 12270 - 4859 hosts a neutron star in a <b>propeller</b> <b>state,</b> a state we investigate in detail, developing a theoretical model to reproduce the associated X-ray and gamma-ray properties. This model can be understood as being of a more general nature, representing a viable alternative by which LMXBs can appear as gamma-ray sources. In particular, this may apply to the case of millisecond pulsars performing a transition from a state powered by the rotation of their magnetic field, to a state powered by matter in-fall, such as that recently observed from the transitional pulsar PSR J 1023 + 0038. While the surface magnetic field of a typical NS in a LMXB is lower by more than four orders of magnitude than the much more intense fields of neutron stars accompanying high-mass binaries, the radius at which the matter in-flow is truncated in a NS-LMXB system is much lower. The magnetic field at the magnetospheric interface is then orders of magnitude larger at this interface, and as consequence, so is the power to accelerate electrons. We demonstrate that the cooling of the accelerated electron population takes place mainly through synchrotron interaction with the magnetic field permeating the interface, and through inverse Compton losses due to the interaction between the electrons and the synchrotron photons they emit. We found that self-synchrotron Compton processes can explain the high energy phenomenology of XSS J 12270 - 4859. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS.

40|$|Accreting {{neutron stars}} can power {{a wide range}} of astrophysical {{phenomena}} including short- and long-duration gamma-ray bursts, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, and X-ray binaries. Numerical simulations are a valuable tool for studying the accretion-disk [...] magnetosphere interaction that is central to these problems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond pulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating accretion, have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while force-free methods, suitable for such regions, cannot include the accreting gas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free, highly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic simulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric general-relativistic MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the interaction of a turbulent accretion flow with a pulsar's electromagnetic wind can lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state. This transition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose power can greatly exceed the power of the isolated pulsar's wind. If the accretion rate is below a critical value, the pulsar instead expels the accretion stream. More generally, our simulations produce {{for the first time the}} four possible accretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion rate: (a) crushed magnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled accretion onto the stellar poles; (c) the <b>propeller</b> <b>state,</b> where material enters through the light cylinder but is prevented from accreting by the centrifugal barrier; (d) almost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the light cylinder by the pulsar wind.

These are the 10 keV feature and the X-ray spectral states and their association with accretion regimes, including the transit to the <b>propeller</b> <b>state</b> {{at the end of the}} outburst. We find that 4 U 1901 + 03 went through three accretion regimes over the course of the X-ray outburst. At the peak of the outburst and for a very short time, the X-ray flux may have overcome the critical limit that marks the formation of a radiative shock at a certain distance above the neutron star surface. Most of the time, however, the source is in the subcritical regime. Only at the end of the outburst, when the luminosity decreased below ~ 10 ^{ 36 } (d/ 10 kpc) ^ 2 erg/s, did the source enter the propeller regime. Evidence for the existence of these regimes comes from the pulse profiles, the shape of the hardness-intensity diagram, and the correlation of various spectral parameters with the flux. The 10 keV feature appears to strongly depend on the X-ray flux and on the pulse phase, which opens the possibility to interpret this feature as a cyclotron line.

Hardness ratios of the source correlate with the X-ray luminosity up to 8. 4 × 10 ^ 36 erg s^- 1 in 3 - 10 keV band, whereas for higher luminosities hardness ratios remain constant.

The stability characteristics for the counter-rotation pusher configuration are strongly influenced by <b>propeller</b> <b>normal</b> forces. The longitudinal and directional control effectiveness, engine-out characteristics, and ground effects are also presented. In addition, a tabulated presentation of all aerodynamic data presented in this report is included as an appendix...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIncorporating an azimuth/podded propulsion into an ice-capable ship brings {{concern in the}} propellers durability and lifecycle. An ice impact model was constructed {{to have a better}} understanding of collisions occurring between ice and azimuth/podded propeller for ice operation ships. A typical propeller profile was created using MATLAB and modeled in SolidWorks using realistic material properties. The ANSYS Explicit Dynamics solver was used to simulate the ice-propeller impact. By conducting a parametric study, the ice impact model displayed situations and instances to avoid shortening the use of propellers in ice operation. Therefore, using the ice impact model will allow further study to provide better understanding of the collision a piece of ice has on a <b>propeller.</b> Lieutenant, United <b>States</b> Coast Guar...|$|R
