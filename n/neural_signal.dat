40|$|Abstract — The neural-based {{control of}} a robotic hand has many {{clinical}} and engineering applications. Current approaches to this problem have been limited {{due to a lack}} of understanding of the relationship between <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> and dynamic finger movements. Here, we present a technique to predict index finger joint angles from <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> recorded from the associated muscles. The <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> are converted to a torque estimate (EBTE) and then input to artificial neural networks. The networks predict the finger position more closely when the input to the networks are torque estimates rather than <b>neural</b> <b>signals.</b> Furthermore, the networks trained with the EBTE signals could predict the joint angles for different phases of finger movements (i. e. dynamic reaching and positioning task) while networks trained with the <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> could not. Our results indicate that (1) similar finger movements are executed with different synergistic strategies and (2) different phases of finger movements employ different neural strategies. Through these results, we have demonstrated the first concrete technique to control a hand prosthetic device or dexterous tele-manipulator using natural <b>neural</b> control <b>signals.</b> Keywords-motor control, electromyography, joint angles I...|$|R

40|$|Transport of <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> in {{the brain}} is challenging, owing to neural {{interference}} and neural noise. There is experimental evidence of multiplexing of sensory information across population of neurons, particularly in the vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Recently, it has been discovered that in lateral intraparietal cortex of the brain, decision signals are multiplexed with decision-irrelevant visual signals. Furthermore, {{it is well known}} that several cortical neurons exhibit chaotic spiking patterns. Multiplexing of chaotic <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> and their successful demultiplexing in the neurons amidst interference and noise, is difficult to explain. In this work, a novel compressed sensing model for efficient multiplexing of chaotic <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> constructed using the Hindmarsh-Rose spiking model is proposed.

50|$|Rather than a {{deficiency}} of our visual processing, MIB {{may be a}} functional side effect of the visual system’s attempt to facilitate a better perception of movement. Wallis and Arnold (2009) propose a plausible explanation of target disappearance in MIB by linking it to the processes responsible for motion streak suppression. In their view, target disappearance is {{a side effect of}} our vision's attempt to provide an apparent perception of moving form. MIB shows to be hindered at equiluminance and augmented at the trailing edges of movement, all reminiscent of motion streak suppression. It appears that what drives MIB is a competition between a <b>neural</b> <b>signal</b> sensitive to spatiotemporal luminance and one responding to proximate stationary targets; where the stronger signal eventuates with what we actually perceive at any given moment (Donner et al., 2008).|$|E
40|$|Many {{statistical}} models of coupling between time {{changes of the}} band-limited power of <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal time changes rely on linear convolution. The effect of nonlinear behaviors in single-trial relationships between <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> and BOLD responses is rarely tested and included in models. Here we investigate whether using a static nonlinearity improves the prediction of single-trial BOLD responses from <b>neural</b> <b>signals.</b> A static nonlinearity is a nonlinear transformation of the convolution of neural responses which is implemented by the same nonlinear function for all time points. We evaluated this approach by applying it to simultaneous recordings of functional magnetic resonance imaging BOLD and band-limited <b>neural</b> <b>signals</b> (Local Field Potentials and Multi Unit Activity) from primary visual cortex of anaesthetized macaques. We found that using a simple polynomial static nonlinearity was sufficient to obtain highly significant improvements of the accuracy of single-trial BOLD prediction over the accuracy obtained with linear convolution.

50|$|Poliomyelitis and {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis arise out {{of complications}} in the lateral corticospinal tract. Both of these diseases result in muscle atrophy. In poliomyelitis, the poliovirus destroys motor neurons found in the brainstem and anterior horn of the spinal cord. This inhibits the lower motor neurons of the lateral corticospinal tract from travelling to the target muscle or organ and delivering the signal from the brain. In {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}}, the lateral side of the spinal cord undergoes scarring. The astrocytes found in the spinal cord, which are vital to the healthy functioning of the central nervous system, fail to reabsorb a specific neurotransmitter. This causes the neurotransmitter to reach toxic levels and leads to scarring in the lateral regions of the spinal cord. This also disrupts <b>neural</b> <b>signal</b> transmission.|$|E
50|$|Not {{only does}} {{progesterone}} help prevent further damage, {{it has also}} been shown to aid in neuroregeneration. One of the serious effects of traumatic brain injury includes edema. Animal studies show that progesterone treatment leads to a decrease in edema levels by increasing the concentration of macrophages and microglia sent to the injured tissue. This was observed in the form of reduced leakage from the blood brain barrier in secondary recovery in progesterone treated rats. In addition, progesterone was observed to have antioxidant properties, reducing the concentration of oxygen free radicals faster than without. There is also evidence that the addition of progesterone can also help remyelinate damaged axons due to trauma, restoring some lost <b>neural</b> <b>signal</b> conduction. Another way progesterone aids in regeneration includes increasing the circulation of endothelial progenitor cells in the brain.

This was not in and of itself evidence for a relationship between S-R compatibility and reaction time; an alternate hypothesis posited that the delay was simply the result of the sensory information taking longer to reach neural processing centers when hemispheres are crossed. This alternate hypothesis was disproven by a follow-up trial in which Fitts and Seeger had subjects cross their arms, so that the left hand would press the right button and vice versa; the difference between reaction times of subjects in the standard and crossed-arms trials was statistically insignificant, even though the <b>neural</b> <b>signal</b> traveled a greater distance.|$|E
