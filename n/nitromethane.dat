During the NHRA Chief Auto Parts Nationals National Hot Rod Association Drag Racing Championship Series event at the Texas Motorplex, McVeigh posed as a motorcycle racer, purchasing three [...] drums of <b>nitromethane</b> on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing, despite the lack of nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and not having an NHRA competitors' license.|$|E
500|$|McVeigh {{rented a}} storage {{space in which}} he stockpiled seven crates of [...] Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500electric {{blasting}} caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the [...] of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as {{he did not believe}} it to be powerful enough (although he did obtain seventeenbags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate prills, liquid <b>nitromethane,</b> a piece of Tovex sausage, and a blasting cap. The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.|$|E
500|$|At 9:02a.m. (14:02 UTC), the Ryder truck, {{containing}} {{in excess}} of [...] of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, <b>nitromethane,</b> and diesel fuel mixture, detonated {{in front of the}} north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Hundreds of people were killed or injured. One third of the building was destroyed by the explosion, which created a , [...] crater on NW 5th Street next to the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324buildings within a 4-block radius, and shattered glass in 258nearby buildings. The broken glass alone accounted for 5% of the death total and 69% of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building. The blast destroyed or burned 86cars around the site. The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down a number of offices in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $652million worth of damage.|$|E

500|$|McVeigh {{then added}} a dual-fuse {{ignition}} system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled twoholes {{in the cab}} of the truck under the seat, while twoholes were also drilled {{in the body of}} the truck. Onegreen cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around [...] of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the [...] of Tovex Blastrite Gel [...] "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and <b>nitromethane,</b> and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about [...] of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the twomen separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.|$|E
2500|$|Working at a lakeside {{campground}} near McVeigh's old Army post, he and Nichols constructed an ANNM {{explosive device}} {{mounted in the}} back of a rented Ryder truck. The bomb consisted of about [...] of ammonium nitrate and <b>nitromethane.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A major {{claim to}} fame for Edelbrock was beating all the Offenhauser-powered midget cars that had {{dominated}} midget car racing for several years; this feat was remarkable because Offenhausers had a significant power advantage over all the other motors. Using his Kurtis Kraft V8-60 [...] "shaker" [...] midget car powered by a secret blend of 20% <b>nitromethane</b> (disguised {{with the scent of}} orange oil), Rodger Ward made history on August 10, 1950, when his Edelbrock-powered #27 car broke the winning streak of the [...] "Offy"-equipped midget cars at Gilmore Stadium, the track that originated midget car racing. This was the only V8-60 to ever beat the Offys in the Gilmore 386-Race history. The same car raced at the Orange Show Stadium in San Bernardino the following night, again beating the Offenhauser cars. This feat was never duplicated in the history of midget racing. Edelbrock was not the only racer in the period to experiment with nitromethane; fellow racers Joaquin Arnett and Tony Capanna had tried it in their hot rods, as well. Edelbrock, however, is generally considered {{to be the one who}} pulled it all together and made it work.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} air {{required}} to burn 1 kg of gasoline is 14.7 kg, but only 1.7 kg of air {{is required for}} 1 kg of <b>nitromethane.</b> Since an engine's cylinder can only contain {{a limited amount of}} air on each stroke, 8.7 times more <b>nitromethane</b> than gasoline can be burned in one stroke. <b>Nitromethane,</b> however, has a lower specific energy: gasoline provides about 42-44 MJ/kg, whereas <b>nitromethane</b> provides only 11.3 MJ/kg. This analysis indicates that <b>nitromethane</b> generates about 2.3 times the power of gasoline when combined with a given amount of oxygen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitromethane</b> {{is added}} to the {{methanol}} to increase power and to make the engine easier to tune. Typically glow fuel is about 0-30% <b>nitromethane.</b> While higher concentrations can result in better engine performance, use of highly concentrated <b>nitromethane</b> is rare because of its cost. Although a given amount of <b>nitromethane</b> contains less energy than the same amount of methanol, it increases the amount of available oxygen in the combustion chamber, which allows the engine to draw in less air and more fuel. The increased amount of fuel increases power output and also helps cool the engine. For racing use, the <b>nitromethane</b> content can be increased to the range of 30%-65%.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nitromethane</b> {{is used by}} hobbyists as a fuel {{in motor}} racing, {{particularly}} drag racing, {{as well as for}} radio-controlled models (such as cars, planes and helicopters). In this context, <b>nitromethane</b> is commonly referred to as [...] "nitro". The oxygen content of <b>nitromethane</b> enables it to burn with much less atmospheric oxygen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitromethane</b> {{is often}} {{difficult}} to obtain in many countries, so in these countries glow fuel typically has no <b>nitromethane</b> at all, which is generally not detrimental to engine longevity.|$|E
50|$|NHRA {{regulations}} {{limit the}} composition of the fuel to a maximum of 90% <b>nitromethane</b> (Since 2015); the remainder is largely methanol. However, this mixture is not mandatory, and less <b>nitromethane</b> may be used if desired.|$|E
50|$|While <b>nitromethane</b> has a {{much lower}} energy density (11.2 MJ/kg) than either {{gasoline}} (44 MJ/kg) or methanol (22.7 MJ/kg), an engine burning <b>nitromethane</b> can produce up to 2.3 times more power than an engine burning gasoline. This is {{made possible by the}} fact that, in addition to fuel, an engine must burn oxygen in order to generate force: 14.7 kg of air (21% oxygen) is required to burn one kilogram of gasoline, compared to only 1.7 kg of air for one kilogram of <b>nitromethane,</b> which, unlike gasoline, already has oxygen in its molecular composition. This means that an engine can burn 8.7 times more <b>nitromethane</b> than gasoline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitromethane</b> {{can also}} be mixed with {{ammonium}} nitrate, which is used as an oxidizer, to form an explosive mixture known as ANNM. One graphic example of this {{was the use of}} <b>nitromethane</b> and ammonium nitrate in the Oklahoma City bombing.|$|E

5000|$|In organic {{synthesis}} <b>nitromethane</b> is {{employed as a}} one carbon building block. [...] Its acidity allows it to undergo deprotonation, enabling condensation reactions analogous to those of carbonyl compounds. Thus, under base catalysis, <b>nitromethane</b> adds to aldehydes in 1,2-addition in the nitroaldol reaction. Some important derivatives include the pesticides chloropicrin (Cl3CNO2), beta-nitrostyrene, and tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, ((HOCH2)3CNO2). Reduction of the latter gives tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, (HOCH2)3CNH2, better known as tris, a widely used buffer. In more specialized {{organic synthesis}}, <b>nitromethane</b> serves as a Michael donor, adding to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds via 1,4-addition in the Michael reaction.|$|E
