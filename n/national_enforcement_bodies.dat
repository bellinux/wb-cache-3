40|$|Problem: Transforming {{accounting}} standards into effective and sensible reporting practices has shown {{to increase the}} pressure on enforcement, as it {{has the power to}} promote consistent application across countries. Prior literature has acknowledged the increased importance of enforcement, as a result, the field of study has received greater attention in recent years. Findings of recent research point towards considerable differences in how IFRS is implemented, ascribing a lot of explanatory value to differences in enforcement. Even though these studies provide evidence that enforcement systems are different, the majority of research is limited {{in the sense that it}} does not focus on actual practices. Thus, it is interesting to investigate how well coordinated the member states are and how national enforcers differ in actual practices. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify differences in how enforcement of IFRS is carried out on national level within Europe. Research Question: How does enforcement of IFRS differ on national level within Europe? Research Design: The study is based upon a qualitative descriptive study, with a primary research approach based on semi-structured interviews, with representatives from nine enforcement bodies. Empirical findings were then analysed through a comparison with prior literature. Findings: Throughout the research process we have identified that <b>national</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>bodies</b> differ in several areas, why we use the term significant differences for areas we want to highlight in the analysis. These have been categorized into seven areas: structures, resources legal authority, examination approach, results of examination, sanctions and the European corporation of enforcement overseen by ESMA, where amongst structures and legal authority has shown to be the root to the majority of other differences. Future Research: A primary suggestion would be to expand the sample and include more influential countries. To conduct a quantitative study examining the availability of information among enforcers would also contribute to the research area. Lastly, a study with similar purpose conducted after the implementation of the consultation paper from ESMA would be of interest...|$|E

40|$|Since 1995 heroin sample {{comparisons}} {{have been}} carried out in Viet Nam to establish links between wholesalers and retailers. To that end, the physical and chemical characteristics of samples are analysed: their colour, the packaging material, including fingerprints, diacetylmorphine (heroin) content and the composition of some main alkaloids. At the beginning of 2002, having acquired expertise on impurity profiling and with the support of new instruments, the Institute of Forensic Sciences of Viet Nam introduced the routine impurity profiling of seized heroin and methamphetamine and later undertook to explain that process to <b>national</b> law <b>enforcement</b> <b>bodies.</b> Since then, 375 heroin and 29 methamphetamine samples have been analysed for major and minor impurities. Substances detected in the analysis of illicit heroin include diacetylmorphine, morphine, codeine, O 6 -monoacetylmorphine and acetylcodeine as well as adulterants such as paracetamol and caffeine. Since methamphetamine impurity profiling began, 29 samples have so far been analysed, and some samples have been grouped through the application of cluster analysis. In the case of heroin, impurity profiling has established a link between two major trafficking groups suspected of obtaining heroin from the same source of production. Analysis has also revealed a link between one wholesaler and several retailers in one region. In addition, impurity profiling provides new information on the preparation and production of some methamphetamine and fake Ecstasy tablets...|$|R

The law <b>enforcement</b> <b>bodies</b> have recently established multiple units in their framework, in order to counter religious extremism and prevent spreading of religious extremist ideas.

A potential for conflict exists, however, when a dominant firm 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to license IP rights affects the dynamics of competition. Antitrust intervention in IP rights can reduce incentives to invest, whereas a failure to allow anticompetitive behavior can harm consumers and competitors while reducing {{the efficiency of the}} economic system. The author reviews the European and United States approaches to monopolization claims involving IP rights. The European approach is limited by the mismatch between <b>national</b> <b>enforcement</b> of IP rights and community enforcement of antitrust law. The U. S. approach shows a trend toward shielding IP rights against antitrust enforcement. In the author 2 ̆ 7 s view, European antitrust <b>enforcement</b> <b>bodies</b> are more concerned than U. S. antitrust bodies about the anticompetitive risks associated with IP rights. Neither approach provides a definitive answer as to when, and under what conditions, a refusal to share IP rights would trigger antitrust liability. The author provides a checklist of the remaining open issues and proposes an additional analysis through which a better balance could be achieved: exploring the relationship between abuse of IP rights under Article 8. 2 of the TRIPs Agreement and the abuse of market power...|$|R
