2500|$|Although the antiquarians like John Collinson {{considered}} West Wansdyke {{to stretch}} from Bathampton Down south east of Bath, {{to the west}} of Maes Knoll, a review in 1960 considered that {{there was no evidence of}} its existence {{to the west of}} Maes Knoll. Keith Gardner refuted this with <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> documentary <b>evidence.</b> In 2007 a series of sections were dug across the earthwork which showed that it had existed where there are no longer visible surface remains. It was shown that the earthwork had a consistent design, with stone or timber revetment. There was little dating evidence but it was consistent with either a late Roman or post-Roman date. A paper in [...] "The Last of the Britons" [...] conference in 2007 suggests that the West Wansdyke continues from Maes Knoll to the hill forts above the Avon Gorge and controls the crossings of the river at Saltford and Bristol as well as at Bath.|$|R

2500|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist’s {{majority}} opinion {{held that a}} claim of actual innocence based on <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>evidence</b> did not state a ground for federal habeas relief.

2500|$|After {{the bombing}} of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt’s {{administration}} concluded that Japanese Americans were a security threat and thus authorized the military to secure areas from which “any or all persons may be excluded.” As a result, Japanese Americans were subject to curfew and other restrictions before being removed to internment camps. Hirabayashi, Korematsu, and Yasui, who were not acquainted with {{each other at the}} time, each defied the internment and were convicted for their resistance. [...] Their convictions would be affirmed by the US Supreme Court between 1943 and 1944. [...] Over forty years after the Court’s rulings, lawyers, including civil rights attorney, Peter Irons, re-opened their wartime convictions on the basis of <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>evidence</b> of governmental misconduct. The new evidence indicated the government intentionally withheld The Ringle Report, a report drafted by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which would have undermined the administration's position of the military actions, as it concluded that most Japanese Americans were not a national security threat.|$|E
40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to pinpoint the}} occasion for which Nahum Tate and Henry Purcell created Dido and Aeneas. To do this it makes further use of iconographic evidence first presented in an earlier paper (Andrew Pinnock, ‘Deus ex machina: a royal witness to the court origin of Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas’, Early Music, xl/ 2 (2012), pp. 265 – 78); considers fresh textual evidence (the anonymous libretto for John Blow’s 1681 royal birthday ode Up, shepherds, up, anticipating Tate’s Dido prologue in some striking ways); brings <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> documentary <b>evidence</b> into play (a newsletter report confirming that Dryden’s Albion and Albanius was rehearsed at Windsor on 29 May 1684, Charles II’s birthday); and tentatively reconstructs a chain of cultural-historical events consistent with all available research data. Very obvious allegorical meaning can now be discerned in both scenes of the Dido prologue (‘Deus ex machina’ only looked at scene 1). The nature of the allegory strongly suggests that Dido was performed or meant for performance as a birthday tribute to Charles II—most likely in 1684, soon after the formal completion of his ten-year castle refurbishment project, the Windsor Castle ‘Great Works’. ‘Which Genial Day?’ should be {{read in conjunction with}} ‘Deus ex machina...|$|R

They presented evidence, including witnesses {{from the restaurant}} where {{the two men had}} dined the evening prior to the murder, that Carpenter and Crane were still the best of friends. [...] They noted that the murder weapon had never been identified or found; the prosecution's camera tripod theory was sheer speculation, they said, based solely on Carpenter's occupation. They disputed the claim that the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>evidence</b> photo showed brain tissue, and presented many examples of [...] "sloppy work" [...] by police, such as the mishandling and misplacing of evidence—including the crucial tissue sample itself. [...] They pointed out that Crane had been videotaped and photographed in compromising sexual positions with numerous women, implying that any one of them, fearing blackmail, might have been the killer. Other potential suspects proposed by defense attorneys included angry husbands and boyfriends of the seduced women, and an actor who had sworn vengeance after a violent argument with Crane in Texas several months earlier.|$|E
2500|$|District Attorney Morgenthau {{withdrew the}} charges. Based on Reyes' confession, the DNA evidence, and the {{unreliable}} {{nature of the}} confessions, Morgenthau recommended that the convictions be vacated. In light of the [...] "extraordinary circumstances" [...] of the case, the prosecutor recommended that the court vacate not only the convictions related to the assault and rape of Meili, but also the convictions for the other crimes that night to which the defendants had confessed. His rationale was that the defendants' confessions to the other crimes were made {{at the same time}} and in the same statements as those related to the attack on Meili. Had the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>evidence</b> been available at the original trials, it might have made the juries question whether any part of the defendants' confessions were trustworthy. Morgenthau's recommendation to vacate the convictions was strongly opposed by Linda Fairstein, who had overseen the original prosecution but had since left the District Attorney's Office. The five defendants' convictions were vacated by New York Supreme Court Justice Charles J. Tejada on December 19, 2002. As Morgenthau recommended, Tejada's order vacated the convictions for all the crimes of which the defendants had been convicted.|$|E
