5000|$|The 1932 Democratic {{campaign}} platform {{pledged to}} lower tariffs. After winning the election, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the now-Democratic Congress passed Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. This act allowed the President to negotiate tariff reductions on a bilateral basis, and also treated such a tariff agreement as regular legislation, requiring a majority, {{rather than as}} a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote. This was one of the core components of the trade <b>negotiating</b> <b>framework</b> that developed after World War II. The tit-for-tat responses of other countries were understood to have contributed to a sharp reduction of trade in the 1930s. After World War II this understanding supported a push towards multi-lateral trading agreements that would prevent similar situations in the future. While the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 focused on foreign exchange and did not directly address tariffs, those involved wanted a similar framework for international trade. President Harry S. Truman launched this process in December 1945 with negotiations {{for the creation of a}} proposed International Trade Organization (ITO). As it happened, separate negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) moved more quickly, with an agreement signed in October 1947; in the end, the US never signed the ITO agreement. Adding a multilateral [...] "most-favored-nation" [...] component to that of reciprocity, the GATT served as a framework for the gradual reduction of tariffs over the subsequent half century.|$|E

40|$|The current <b>negotiating</b> <b>framework</b> for WTO {{negotiations}} on agriculture includes flexibilities for "sensitive" products {{to be chosen}} by the importer. Without knowing which products their partners are likely to select, WTO members cannot assess the implications of an agreement for their market access opportunities. In this paper, we begin by specifying a Grossman-Helpman type political-economy welfare function, and use this to determine which products {{are likely to be}} selected as sensitive products. Assuming these products are subjected to smaller reduction in protection, we find that allowing even 2 percent of tariff lines to be treated as sensitive can greatly reduce the impact of an agreement on market access. This problem is, in part, a consequence of using a percentage of tariff lines as the constraint on the use of sensitive products. If the constraint on the products to be classified as sensitive takes more directly into account the interests of the exporter - being specified, for example, as a share of imports - then the adverse impacts on market access opportunities can be greatly reduced.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present an {{overview}} of international trade in financial services. Though often intangible and "invisible", trade in services is important, accounting for almost a fifth of total world trade in 2000; and trade in services has been growing in both absolute and relative terms, though growth was more rapid in the 1980 s than in the 1990 s. The international <b>negotiating</b> <b>framework</b> for reducing barriers to trade in services the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) came into existence in 1995, {{as part of the}} World Trade Organization (WTO). The GATS has thus far had only limited success in achieving reductions in barriers to trade in services, though a negotiating round among member countries is currently under way. This slow progress is largely due to the extensive national regulation that frequently surrounds services and the entry (and trade) barriers that are often part of that regulation. The structure of the GATS document itself, as well as the WTO's post-Seattle defensiveness, reflects the political sensitivity of these national regulatory issues; but this sensitivity, unfortunately, has impeded progress in reducing trade barriers. ...|$|E

While quality assurance of research mostly is done through competitive bidding for funding and peer review of applications and proposals, this contribution will focus on the more complex quality assurance practices in teaching and learning and the mechanisms of accreditation of degree programmes. Germany is a federalist country consisting of altogether 16 States which are sovereign in educational and cultural affairs. Joint decisions are taken by Standing Conference of the German Ministers for Education and Culture (KMK). In the field of higher education the Federal Ministry for Education and Research is mainly responsible for scholarships, funding research and determining research priorities, <b>negotiating</b> <b>framework</b> agreements, and organising and supporting international exchange in education and research.

40|$|Do Member States of the EU have a {{free hand}} in {{drafting}} Accession Treaties, or are there legal constraints on their primary law making function in this context? That is the central question this thesis addresses. It argues that such constraints do exist, and tries to identify them, thereby hoping to provide {{some insight into the}} nature of the EU legal order. The point of departure as well as the main focus of the study is the proposed permanent safeguard clause (PSC) on free movement of persons in the <b>Negotiating</b> <b>Framework</b> for Turkey. It is with reference to the PSC that legal provisions, rules, principles and norms that might constrain Member States as primary law makers in the context of accession are identified. The thesis examines constraints on Member States flowing from three levels: the pre-accession level, that is the existing legal framework around the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement (Part I); the accession process level, which is comprised of past practice and existing EU rules on enlargement (Part II); last but not least, the constitutional foundations of the Union (Part III), which constrain Member States whenever they act within the scope of Union law both as primary and secondary law makers.

For example, neutralization will happen if a TV news report conveying a message about an oppositional political party in Russia may be interpreted by a conservative viewer as an evidence of the US sponsorship of anti-government organizations underlying Russian independency. Let's now look at the lower right corner of the same version at the cell when a radical text is decoded by viewers within an oppositional position. In this case ‘oppositional reading of oppositional text' needs explanation that it equals to the [...] "agreement with oppositional text" [...] as readers text evaluation might cause misunderstanding.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the two tracks {{used by the}} United States to negotiate and approve international treaties - (1) the traditional treaty process requiring Senate consent by a two-thirds vote and (2) the newer fast track process used for trade agreements, requiring Congressional passage of a law to approve and implement the agreement. Several historical and current examples are used such as the Treaty of Versailles and the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. The paper explains why the latter process is superior in many ways, and asks {{whether it should be}} applied more broadly beyond the topic of trade. Three challenges to doing so are discussed. First, the paper considers whether the Congressional-Executive Agreement format used for trade agreements is constitutional. Second, the paper considers the democratic acceptability of approving treaties by law rather than by a supermajority in the Senate. Third, the paper points to the key ingredient for the trade approach which is a framework statute that sets an agenda for the trade negotiations in advance and sets the terms for implementation. The paper recommends the adoption of similar international <b>negotiating</b> <b>framework</b> legislation in other areas of international law such as environment, labor, intellectual property, and possibly human rights...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of environmental policy {{in terms of}} the pattern of relationship between government and industry reveals that although there are other influential groups in environmental politics (for example ecologists, parties, citizens' associations), government and industry play the leading role in a complex process that usually unfolds in somewhat secret meetings. The type of relationship between these two actors - the institutional design - differs from country to country: in Germany, the prevailing pattern is one of formal co-operation, whereas in Spain, the government enjoys a prominent role to the detriment of industrial groups. Institutional designs are increasingly subject to dynamics of change - the EC, for instance, is facilitating the rapprochement of government and industry in Spain in view of the need to implement Community law. Despite the influence of the EC, institutional designs have proven to be quite resilient. Therefore, the relevance of the EC has to be sought somewhere else, namely, in its functioning as a <b>negotiating</b> <b>framework.</b> The EC offers a scenario for debate among member states with opposing interests, and transmits environmental demands and practices from some countries to others. Also, this scenario clearly reflects the North-South dilemma, or the conflict between countries with a self-contained environmental policy and high ecological awareness (such as Germany), and countries with a backward policy and low ecological consciousness (such as Spain) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{it is argued}} that (1) the Accession Treaties have been used in {{accordance}} with their nature and proclaimed objective: they only brought about limited changes to primary law, proper to the needs of accession and have not introduced any fundamental changes. The numerous and still growing arrangements that depart from the principle of the application of the acquis in toto on accession do not alter this conclusion. (2) The evolution, especially from the 2004 Accession Treaty onwards and predictable for the future Accession Treaties (e. g. with Turkey), shows a tendency of diversification of that legal instrument by (a) adding new and/or reinforced elements of conditionality, protracted from the pre-accession phase to the membership phase, devising new mechanisms of conditionality and control (general and specific safeguard clauses, monitoring and verification mechanisms, membership postponement clause) and thus (b) contributing to a further differentiation in two respects - as among the Member States and with regard to the core acquis. Such differentiation exists already {{on the basis of the}} constitutive treaties (“in-built constitutive treaties induced differentiation”) and is accentuated by the Accession Treaties and their transitional arrangements (“Accession Treaties induced differentiation”). Questions of differentiation acquired another dimension with the introduction of the citizenship of the EU. (3) Finally, negotiations with certain candidate countries will show whether additional innovations are to be expected: a) whether future instruments of accession would be used in order to increase the existing level of differentiation (and protract the pre-accession phase logic well into the membership phase) with the conditionality becoming the most important element of the relations within an enlarged EU and thus paradoxically negating the nature of the integration itself, b) whether they will perhaps be used to bring about more important modifications to the treaties, or c) whether they will go as far as to provide a legal basis for permanent derogations with regard to certain new Member States (as explicitly envisaged, for instance, in the <b>negotiating</b> <b>framework</b> for Turkey) ...|$|E

Moreover the debate on the question as to whether the intellectual property rights of TK holders are property rights as such, leads to the author’s suggestion that TK rights are a sui generis form of property rights, and that the legal principles contained in the law of equity provide useful and accessible guidance towards resolution of potentially competing claims of TK rights by indigenous peoples...|$|R
