Electron density gradient causes diffusion current, electron temperature gradient - thermocurrent, gradient of magnetic field module - gradient current, curvature of magnetic field lines - centrifugal current. Being independent of electric field, the currents of <b>non-uniformities</b> may act as extraneous to cause charge separation and electric field in plasma. In cosmos, the currents of <b>non-uniformities</b> were observed; in particular, gradient and centrifugal currents - in magnetosphere, diffusion one - in a comet coma and in artificial plasma cloud. On present work, the gradient current was investigated more fully than earlier. Two unknown components, parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field were found. The equation for gradient current density was obtained. We compared the theoretical densities of currents of <b>non-uniformities</b> (with usage of electron pressure and corresponding gradients) with measured current densities (calculated as rotor of magnetic field) for sun photosphere.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>non-uniformities</b> in {{the distribution}} of instructionlevel and machine parallelism. <b>Non-uniformities</b> in instruction-level parallelism include variations between benchmarks, variations within benchmarks, and variations by instruction class. <b>Non-uniformities</b> in machine-level parallelism include variations in latency between different operations, and variations in parallel execution capability depending on the instruction opcode. The results presented in this paper were obtained with a parameterizable code reorganization and simulation system. The discussion of machine parallelism is based on the concepts of superscalar and superpipelined machines. Superscalar machines can issue several instructions per cycle. Superpipelined machines can issue only one instruction per cycle, but they have cycle times shorter than the latencies of their functional units. These two techniques are shown to be roughly equivalent ways of exploiting instruction-level parallelism. The average [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The role of {{re-entry}} or circus {{motion was}} demonstrated separately by Mines and Garrey. Mines created {{a ring of}} excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the ray fish. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the turtle ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of depolarisation would pass around the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, {{it is necessary that}} there be some form of <b>non-uniformity.</b> In practice, this may be an area of ischemic or infarcted myocardium, or underlying scar tissue.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the theory}} of general relativity, the only gravity which remains for the {{observer}} following a falling path or [...] "inertial" [...] path near a gravitating body, is that {{which is due to}} non-uniformities which remain in the gravitational field, even for the falling observer. This <b>non-uniformity,</b> which is a simple tidal effect in Newtonian dynamics, constitutes the [...] "microgravity" [...] which is felt by all spacially-extended objects falling in any natural gravitational field that originates from a compact mass. The reason for these tidal effects is that such a field will have its origin in a centralized place (the compact mass), and thus will diverge, and vary slightly in strength, according to distance from the mass. It will thus vary across the width of the falling or orbiting object.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{considers}} {{heat transfer}} and temperature fields in a free-packed fuel pin bundle cooled by a heavy liquid metal with {{different types of}} spacing. Data is analyzed for three fuel assemblies with a pitch of s/d =  1. 33 : a smooth fuel pin bundle, a bundle of fuel pins spaced by a bilifar-helix wire wrapper of the “wire-to-wire” type, and a bundle with transverse spacer grids. In the free-packed smooth fuel pin bundle, there are no temperature <b>non-uniformities</b> around the fuel pin periphery in contrast to major general temperature <b>non-uniformities</b> in the bundle with wire wrapping which provides for a major decrease in the heat transfer. In the bundle with transverse spacer grids, the heat transfer only increases {{in the region of}} the grids, and, between them, is approximately equal to the heat transfer in the smooth pin bundle.

2500|$|There are {{typically}} {{two different ways}} of mathematically describing how an electromagnetic wave interacts with the elements within an ellipsometer (including the sample): the Jones matrix and the Mueller matrix formalisms. In the Jones matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by a Jones vector with two orthogonal complex-valued entries for the electric field (typically [...] and [...] ), and the effect that an optical element (or sample) has on it is described by the complex-valued 2x2 Jones matrix. [...] In the Mueller matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by Stokes vectors with four real-valued entries, and their transformation is described by the real-valued 4x4 Mueller matrix. When no depolarization occurs both formalisms are fully consistent. Therefore, for non-depolarizing samples, the simpler Jones matrix formalism is sufficient. If the sample is depolarizing the Mueller matrix formalism should be used, because it also give the amount of depolarization. Reasons for depolarization are, for instance, thickness <b>non-uniformity</b> or backside-reflections from a transparent substrate.|$|E

[...] Referring to the [...] "point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years", Carathéodory wrote: [...] "There exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities (mass, force, pressure, etc.) and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements." [...] James Serrin introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus: [...] "In the following section, we shall use the classical notions of heat, work, and hotness as primitive elements, ... That heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by Carnot. Its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept, as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories." [...] This traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial <b>non-uniformity</b> of temperature, and is by conduction and radiation, from hotter to colder bodies. It is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on [...] "circular reasoning"; against this proposal, there stands {{the rigorous}}ly logical mathematical development of the theory presented by Truesdell and Bharatha (1977).|$|E
