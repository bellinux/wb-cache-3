5|$|The codex {{is poorly}} preserved; the {{surviving}} page fragments display {{a number of}} figures in central Mexican style, combined with Maya numbering and day glyphs. The document is currently held by the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico city and is not on public display. The physics institute of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México subjected the codex to <b>non-destructive</b> <b>testing</b> {{in an effort to}} determine its authenticity. The results were published in 2007 and were mixed; the document apparently contains genuine pre-Columbian materials but certain aspects, such as seemingly artificially induced wear and tear, are suspect. The researchers concluded that they were unable to prove or disprove the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.|$|E

40|$|The {{very nature}} of the fire {{fighting}} environment makes thermal degradation of turnout gear inevitable. Standards that are currently in place to ensure that new gear performs adequately {{for the protection of the}} fire fighter do not provide a quantitative measure for assessing this gear once it is in service. When the performance of the gear is compromised due to degradation, it could put the fire fighter wearing the gear at unnecessary risk. A <b>non-destructive</b> <b>test</b> that indicates the end of the useable service of the garment would be a benefit to the fire service. Full scale fire tests were conducted to suggest a range of heat fluxes that turnout gear specimens should be subjected to in order to simulate degradation caused by in-field use of the gear. A series of destructive tests were conducted on exposed specimens. A number of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on the same specimens. The results of destructive and <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> were compared. This research explored some options for <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> of turnout gear.

25|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} for use as a diamond simulant, a material must possess certain diamond-like properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for those familiar with diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a gemologist, the most important of differential properties are those that foster non-destructive testing; most of these are visual in nature. <b>Non-destructive</b> <b>testing</b> is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in jewelry, and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and softness of non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{assessment}} of support {{systems such as}} rockbolts and rock anchors are {{very important for the}} maintenance of existing rock-engineering structures. The utilization of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> is preferable to destructive tests such as pullout tests. The dynamic responses of rock anchors and rockbolts could be used for <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests.</b> These tests should generally provide some information on the constructional conditions, corrosion and axial force conditions. In {{the first part of this}} study, some theoretical models are developed for the axial and trasverse dynamic tests and then results of numerical simulations are presented by considering possible conditions in-situ. These conditions are the bonding quality, the existence of corroded parts or couplers and pre-stress. The results of the numerical simulations could be very valuable for interpretation of the wave responses to be measured in <b>non-destructive</b> dynamic <b>tests</b> in-situ. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne-step module {{encapsulation}} and interconnection using conductive back sheet foils and conductive adhesives has advantages including i) fast module assembly, ii) limiting cell handling to a {{one time}} pick-and-place, and iii) low temperature (< 160 C) processing. Drawback of the integrated module production, however, is that interconnected cells {{can only be}} inspected after the module has been laminated. Furthermore, because all electrical interconnections are located between the cells and the conductive foil, <b>non-destructive</b> <b>test</b> methods are required for the inspection of photovoltaic (PV) modules produced with this method. In this contribution complimentary <b>non-destructive</b> <b>test</b> methods, including lock-in thermography using a forward bias in the dark (power is dissipated) are compared as methods for testing back-contact modules allowing i) the accurate discrimination of failed and functioning interconnections between cells and the conductive foils, and ii) the detection of delamination of the back side foil. Included in the comparison are electroluminescence, infrared thermography, X-ray scanning, and ultrasonic inspection. Drawbacks and benefits of each test method are summarized and this shows that lock-in thermography is a fast, accurate, and economical <b>non-destructive</b> <b>test</b> method {{that can be applied}} for back-contact modules...|$|R
40|$|The {{compressive}} strength of concrete has {{a crucial role}} in the assessment of the seismic resistance of existing reinforced concrete buildings and is usually difficult to estimate, thus specific procedures are strongly needed. It can be estimated through destructive and <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests.</b> In the paper, the most widespread <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> (hammer rebound, ultrasonic pulse, combined Sonreb method) are shortly described and examined. With regard to destructive methods, the in-situ mechanical properties of concrete can be estimated using core drilled from the structure. Even though testing core specimens is the most direct and reliable method to estimate concrete strength, it has to be taken into account that there are many differences between the strength measured on core specimens and the concrete strength in the structure. Further, due to practical and economic reasons, only a limited number of specimens can be extracted, thus non destructive tests can be used together with core tests, thus reducing the amount of coring required to gain a sufficiently complete and reliable understanding of the concrete strength in the structure. In the paper, a purposely set up expression to take into account the main factors influencing the core strength and a procedure to estimate the in-situ concrete strength through destructive and <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> are proposed...|$|R
