5|$|In {{addition}} to dihalides, the reduction also produces numerous <b>non-stoichiometric</b> samarium halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as Sm3F7, Sm14F33, Sm27F64, Sm11Br24, Sm5Br11 and Sm6Br13.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling. This color change {{is caused by}} a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the <b>non-stoichiometric</b> Zn1+xO, where at 800°C, x = 0.00007.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum reacts exothermically with {{hydrogen}} {{to produce}} the dihydride LaH2, a black, pyrophoric, brittle, conducting compound with the calcium fluoride structure. This is a <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compound, and further absorption of hydrogen is possible, with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity, until the more salt-like LaH3 is reached. Like LaI2 and LaI, LaH2 is probably an electride compound.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{crystalline}} binary compounds {{are known}} for samarium {{and one of the}} group-14, 15 or 16 element X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group. They are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements. Many of the resulting compounds are <b>non-stoichiometric</b> and have nominal compositions SmaXb, where the b/a ratio varies between 0.5 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Silver(I) sulfide, Ag2S, is very readily {{formed from}} its {{constituent}} elements {{and is the}} cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It may also be formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous Ag+ ions. Many <b>non-stoichiometric</b> selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various <b>non-stoichiometric</b> hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{that feature}} {{scandium}} in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 {{is one of}} the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are <b>non-stoichiometric,</b> as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E
5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 {{is heated}} in air, it becomes Pb12O19 at 293°C, Pb12O17 at 351°C, Pb3O4 at 374°C, and finally PbO at 605°C. A further {{sesquioxide}} Pb2O3 {{can be obtained}} at high pressure, along with several <b>non-stoichiometric</b> phases. Many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies: PbO {{can be considered as}} having such a structure, with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{neptunium}} carbides NpC, Np2C3, and NpC2 (tentative) {{have been}} reported, {{but have not}} characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel. NpC is a <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compound, and could be better labelled as NpCx (0.82 ≤ x ≤ 0.96). It may {{be obtained from the}} reaction of neptunium hydride with graphite at 1400°C or by heating the constituent elements together in an electric arc furnace using a tungsten electrode. It reacts with excess carbon to form pure Np2C3. NpC2 is formed from heating NpO2 in a graphite crucible at 2660–2800°C.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides {{are known}} for the metal {{oxidation}} states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide Pa2O5, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500°C. Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often <b>non-stoichiometric,</b> described as PaO2.25. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO2 is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550°C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, but easily dissolves in hydrofluoric acid. The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100°C. The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a thin coating on protactinium metal, but not in an isolated bulk form.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) {{hydroxides}} {{are both}} stable in 1 M sodium hydroxide solutions. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under argon laser (514.5nm line) excitation. Berkelium hydrides {{are produced by}} reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are <b>non-stoichiometric</b> with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1). Whereas the trihydride has a hexagonal symmetry, the dihydride crystallizes in an fcc structure with the lattice constant a = 523 pm. Several other salts of berkelium are known, including Bk2O2S, (BkNO3)3·4H2O, BkCl3·6H2O, Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O and Bk2(C2O4)3·4H2O. Thermal decomposition at about 600 °C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to Bk2O) of Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O yields the body-centered orthorhombic crystals of berkelium(IV) oxysulfate (Bk2O2SO4). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce <b>non-stoichiometric</b> carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. Schottky defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compound. Another <b>non-stoichiometric</b> possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|E
25|$|Both FeO and γ-Fe2O3 have {{a similar}} cubic close packed array of oxide ions and this {{accounts}} for the ready interchangeability between the three compounds on oxidation and reduction as these reactions entail a relatively small change to the overall structure. Fe3O4 samples can be <b>non-stoichiometric.</b>|$|E
25|$|The higher boride LnB66 {{is known}} for all {{lanthanide}} metals. The composition is approximate as the compounds are <b>non-stoichiometric.</b> They all have similar complex structure with over 1600 atoms in the unit cell. The boron cubic sub lattice contains super icosahedra {{made up of a}} central B12 icosahedra surrounded by 12 others, B12(B12)12. Other complex higher borides LnB50 (Tb, Dy, Ho Er Tm Lu) and LnB25 are known (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) and these contain boron icosahedra in the boron framework.|$|E
25|$|Lanthanide metals react exothermically with {{hydrogen}} to form LnH2, dihydrides. With {{the exception}} of Eu and Yb which resemble the Ba and Ca hydrides (non conducting, transparent salt like compounds) they form black pyrophoric, conducting compounds where the metal sub-lattice is face centred cubic and the H atoms occupy tetrahedral sites. Further hydrogenation produces a trihydride which is <b>non-stoichiometric,</b> non-conducting, more salt like. The formation of trihydride is associated with and increase in 8–10% volume and this is linked to greater localisation of charge on the hydrogen atoms which become more anionic (H− hydride anion) in character.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{that were}} {{historically}} given the formulae REAlB14 and REB25 have the MgAlB14 structure with an orthorhombic symmetry and space group Imma (No. 74). In this structure, rare-earth atoms enter the Mg site. Aluminium sites are empty for REB25. Both metal sites of REAlB14 structure have partial occupancies of about 60–70%, {{which shows that}} the compounds are actually <b>non-stoichiometric.</b> The REB25 formula merely reflects the average atomic ratio / = 25. Yttrium borides form both YAlB14 and YB25 structures. Experiments have confirmed that the borides based on rare-earth elements from Tb to Lu can have the REAlB14 structure. A subset of these borides, which contains rare-earth elements from Gd to Er, can also crystallize in the REB25 structure.|$|E
25|$|Hexaborides, LnB6 {{have been}} {{reported}} {{for all of the}} lanthanides. They all have the CaB6 structure, containing B6 clusters. They are <b>non-stoichiometric</b> due to cation defects. The hexaborides of the lighter lanthanides (La – Sm) melt without decomposition, EuB6 decomposes to boron and metal and the heavier lanthanides decompose to LnB4 with exception of YbB6 which decomposes forming YbB12. The stability has in part been correlated to differences in volatility between the lanthanide metals. In EuB6 and YbB6 the metals have an oxidation state of +2 whereas {{in the rest of the}} lanthanide hexaborides it is +3. This rationalises the differences in conductivity, the extra electrons in the LnIII hexaborides entering conduction bands. EuB6 is a semiconductor and the rest are good conductors. LaB6 and CeB6 are thermionic emitters, used, for example, in scanning electron microscopes.|$|E
25|$|Although YBa2Cu3O7 is a {{well-defined}} chemical compound {{with a specific}} structure and stoichiometry, materials with fewer than seven oxygen atoms per formula unit are <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compounds. The structure of these materials depends on the oxygen content. This non-stoichiometry is denoted by the x in the chemical formula YBa2Cu3O7−x. When x = 1, the O(1) sites in the Cu(1) layer are vacant and the structure is tetragonal. The tetragonal form of YBCO is insulating and does not superconduct. Increasing the oxygen content slightly causes more of the O(1) sites to become occupied. For x < 0.65, Cu-O chains along the b axis of the crystal are formed. Elongation of the b axis changes the structure to orthorhombic, with lattice parameters of a = 3.82, b = 3.89, and c = 11.68 Å. Optimum superconducting properties occur when x ~ 0.07, i.e., {{almost all of the}} O(1) sites are occupied, with few vacancies.|$|E
500|$|Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) {{hydroxides}} {{are both}} stable in 1 molar solutions of sodium hydroxide. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under excitation {{with a green}} light. Berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250°C. They are <b>non-stoichiometric</b> with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1).

500|$|Iron {{reacts with}} {{oxygen in the}} air to form various oxide and {{hydroxide}} compounds; the most common are iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4), and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compounds whose compositions may vary. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of ferrites, useful magnetic storage media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is iron pyrite (FeS2), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster. It is not an iron(IV) compound, but is actually an iron(II) polysulfide containing Fe2+ and [...] ions in a distorted sodium chloride structure.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the common}} name of cerium(IV) compounds, the Japanese spectroscopist Akio Kotani wrote [...] "there is no genuine example of cerium(IV)". The {{reason for this}} {{can be seen in the}} {{structure}} of ceria itself, which always contains some octahedral vacancies where oxygen atoms would be expected to go and could be better considered a <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compound with chemical formula CeO2−x. Furthermore, each cerium atom in ceria does not lose all four of its valence electrons, but retains a partial hold on the last one, resulting in an oxidation state between +3 and +4. Even supposedly purely tetravalent compounds such as CeRh3, CeCo5, or ceria itself have X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectra more characteristic of intermediate-valence compounds. The 4f electron in cerocene, Ce(C8H8)2, is poised ambiguously between being localized and delocalized and this compound is also considered intermediate-valent.|$|E
500|$|Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6, {{the last}} being most stable. In the {{hexavalent}} state, uranium {{is very similar}} to the group 6 elements. Many compounds of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are <b>non-stoichiometric,</b> i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO2+x, where x varies between −0.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak oxidants. Most of them contain the linear [...] "uranyl" [...] group, [...] Between 4 and 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group. The uranyl group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. [...] and [...] are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very strong reducing agent. Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms organometallic compounds, such as UIII(C5H5)3 and UIV(C5H5)4.|$|E
2500|$|Cerium forms a {{stoichiometric}} dioxide, CeO2, where cerium has an {{oxidation state}} of +4. [...] CeO2 is basic and dissolves with difficulty in acid to form Ce4+ solutions, from which CeIV salts can be isolated, {{for example the}} hydrated nitrate Ce(NO3)4.5H2O. [...] CeO2 is used as an oxidation catalyst in catalytic converters. [...] Praseodymium and terbium form <b>non-stoichiometric</b> oxides containing LnIV, although more extreme reaction conditions can produce stoichiometric (or near stoichiometric) PrO2 and TbO2.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{graphite}} {{intercalation compound}} not every layer is necessarily occupied by guests. In so-called stage 1 compounds, graphite layers and intercalated layers alternate and in stage 2 compounds, two graphite layers with no guest material in between alternate with an intercalated layer. The actual composition may vary and therefore these compounds are {{an example of}} <b>non-stoichiometric</b> compounds. It is customary to specify the composition together with the stage. [...] The layers are pushed apart upon incorporation of the guest ions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{chemical}} substance {{may well be}} defined as [...] "any material with a definite chemical composition" [...] in an introductory general chemistry textbook. According to this definition a {{chemical substance}} can either be a pure chemical element or a pure chemical compound. But, there are exceptions to this definition; a pure substance can also {{be defined as a}} form of matter that has both definite composition and distinct properties. The chemical substance index published by CAS also includes several alloys of uncertain composition. <b>Non-stoichiometric</b> compounds are a special case (in inorganic chemistry) that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, {{as in the case of}} palladium hydride. Broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found, for example: [...] "the term 'chemical substance' means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including – (i) any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature".|$|E
