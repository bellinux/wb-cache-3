40|$|Purpose In 2013 the University of Wollongong (UOW) Library {{completed}} {{a review of}} its Resource Sharing services {{in order to provide}} a financially viable service relevant to the research support needs of University clients. This paper provides an update of the service two years on. Design/methodology/approach UOW Library has been attentive to global changes in the resource sharing industry and document supply services. Unmediated resource sharing options are growing and assuming an increasing portion of requests received from clients. UOW’s involvement in new services has focused attention on the value of its collection, particularly the last <b>national</b> <b>copy</b> of a publication. By ensuring these unique titles remain in the collection indefinitely, they can be shared with other libraries through resource sharing arrangements. Ensuring staff workplace health and safety during the ongoing transformation in the delivery of services is an important element in the continued viability of resource sharing at UOW. Findings The 2011 - 2013 review of UOW Library Resource Sharing services has resulted in a viable and relevant service that is adaptable to the changing needs of UOW clients and institutional directions into the near future. Unmediated requesting continues to assume a greater share of the requesting workload, though staff expertise is equally important in supporting this service. A future challenge for UOW Library is the rising cost of postage for the sharing of loans across institutions. Originality/value This case study demonstrates how an academic library can transform its resource sharing service for ongoing relevance and cost-effectiveness. Taking a holistic view of the service, in terms of people, costs and services is important to ensure the overall viability of the service...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{cleaning}} of primary platinum-iridium mass standards is traditionally achieved using the nettoyage-lavage process {{developed at the}} BIPM. This manual cleaning method is notoriously difficult to reproduce, particularly at laboratories other than the BIPM. An alternative, operator independent, method for the {{cleaning of}} primary mass standards, using UV activated ozone, has been investigated {{and the results are}} reported. An artefact-based definition thus presents a unique set of problems both to do with the stability of the International Prototype and the <b>national</b> <b>copies,</b> and with the dissemination of the unit of mass worldwide. The only way in which national standard kilograms can be checked is by returning them to the BIPM for calibration. This, combined {{with the fact that the}} national prototypes are known to gain between 1 and 5 micrograms every year, makes maintaining the stability of national mass scales a major concern for all national measurement institutes (NMIs) [1]. Figure 2 shows the relative temporal stability of seven of the copies of the International prototype...|$|R
