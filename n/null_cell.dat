40|$|The {{long-term}} {{effect of}} exposure to DNA alkylating agents is entwined with the cell's genetic capacity for DNA repair and appropriate DNA damage responses. A unique combination of environmental exposure and deficiency in these responses can lead to genomic instability; this “gene–environment interaction” paradigm is a theme for research on chronic disease etiology. In the present study, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a gene deletion in the base excision repair (BER) enzymes DNA β-polymerase (β-pol) and alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG), along with exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) to study mutagenesis {{as a function of}} a particular gene–environment interaction. The β-pol <b>null</b> <b>cells,</b> defective in BER, exhibit a modest increase in spontaneous mutagenesis compared with wild-type cells. MMS exposure increases mutant frequency in β-pol <b>null</b> <b>cells,</b> but not in isogenic wild-type cells; UV light exposure or N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine exposure increases mutant frequency similarly in both cell lines. The MMS-induced increase in mutant frequency in β-pol <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> appears to be caused by DNA lesions that are AAG substrates, because overexpression of AAG in β-pol <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> eliminates the effect. In contrast, β-pol/AAG double <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> are slightly more mutable than the β-pol <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> after MMS exposure. These results illustrate that BER plays a role in protecting mouse embryonic fibroblast cells against methylation-induced mutations and characterize the effect of a particular combination of BER gene defect and environmental exposure...|$|R

Most tumors were also analyzed for chromogranin A mRNA. To identify the cell type constituting the tumors and to assess hormone content, all tumors were investigated by histology, transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Most <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> adenomas (6 / 11) and gonadotroph adenomas (9 / 10) expressed the mRNAs for alpha-subunit of glycoprotein hormones whereas only 2 / 11 oncocytomas expressed alpha-subunit mRNA. FSH beta and/or LH beta mRNA were present in most <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> and gonadotroph adenomas but only in a few oncocytomas. Prolactin (PRL) mRNA was detected in two <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> tumors and in one gonadotroph adenoma, whereas GH and POMC mRNA were present in one <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> adenoma. Chromogranin A mRNA, which codes for the major secretory granule protein, was present in 25 / 26 tumors including all tumors that were negative for pituitary hormone mRNAs, indicating adequate preservation of specific mRNA transcripts in the paraffin-embedded sections of tumor cells. These results indicate that <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> adenomas and gonadotroph adenomas are closely related neoplasms and that oncocytomas may represent a functionally defective form of <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> adenoma characterized by mitochondrial abundance, which has retained the capacity to synthesize the major secretory granule protein chromogranin A. Although the cytogenesis of <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> adenomas and oncocytomas is not clear, it can be suggested that these two tumor types are derived from a pluripotential precursor cell that is capable of undergoing multidirectional differentiation and synthesizing various hormones, mainly glycoproteins...|$|E

40|$|In the {{accompanying}} communication, it was {{demonstrated that the}} <b>null</b> <b>cells,</b> the TM cells, monocytes and PWM are all obligatory participants in the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulins by human B cells in culture. Here we demonstrate that the <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> secrete a factor, referred to as human immunoglobulin synthesis/secretion-facilitating factor (HISFF) that can replace the <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> in the cultures. HISFF is distinct from the known T cell-derived interleukins. HISFF functions in an HLA-unrestricted fashion since it can facilitate the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulins by allogeneic B <b>cells.</b> The <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> cultured with TM helper cells and PWM required monocytes in the culture in order to secrete HISFF. Furthermore, B cells cultured with TM cells in medium containing HISFF, monocyte-derived factors and PWM nevertheless required monocytes in order {{to respond to the}} HISFF signal. Thus, the monocyte plays a pivotal role in the secretion of and response to HISFF. Normal levels of immunoglobulin were synthesized even when HISFF was added to the cultures of B cells, TM cells and monocytes, in the presence of PWM, as late as day 6 of the 7 day culture. We conclude that the <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> participate in immunoglobulin synthesis by the B cells by secreting a soluble mediator, HISFF, capable of replacing the <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> in the culture; and that the HISFF signal is the last signal received by the B cell before it begins to synthesize and secrete immunoglobulins...|$|R

Therefore, it was presumed that there were some MNC in the peripheral blood from SLE patients which were already triggered to proliferate in vivo.

Homozygous Gpi 1 −/− null mouse embryos die but {{a previous}} study showed that some homozygous Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> survived when combined with wild-type cells in fetal chimaeras. One adult female Gpi 1 −/−↔Gpi 1 c/c chimaera with functional Gpi 1 −/− null oocytes was also identified in a preliminary study. The aims were to characterise the survival of Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> in adult Gpi 1 −/−↔Gpi 1 c/c chimaeras and determine if Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> germ <b>cells</b> are functional. Analysis of adult Gpi 1 −/−↔Gpi 1 c/c chimaeras with pigment and a reiterated transgenic lineage marker showed that low numbers of homozygous Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> could survive in many tissues of adult chimaeras, including oocytes. Breeding experiments confirmed that Gpi 1 −/− null oocytes in one female Gpi 1 −/−↔Gpi 1 c/c chimaera were functional and provided preliminary evidence that one male putative Gpi 1 −/−↔Gpi 1 c/c chimaera produced functional spermatozoa from homozygous Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> germ <b>cells.</b> Although the male chimaera was almost certainly Gpi 1 −/−↔Gpi 1 c/c, {{this part of the}} study is considered preliminary because only blood was typed for GPI. Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> germ <b>cells</b> should survive in a chimaeric testis if they are supported by wild-type Sertoli cells. It is also feasible that spermatozoa could bypass a block at GPI, but not blocks at some later steps in glycolysis, by using fructose, rather than glucose, as the substrate for glycolysis. Although chimaera analysis proved inefficient for studying the fate of Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> germ <b>cells,</b> it successfully identified functional Gpi 1 −/− null oocytes and revealed that some Gpi 1 −/− <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> could survive in many adult tissues...|$|R
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a worldwide burden {{and a major}} cause of death. Pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease are still largely unknown. However, a continuous toxic injury due to tobacco smoking leading to a self-maintaining inflammatory process is considered a key factor in the pathophysiology of the disease. Evidence that autoimmunity might be involved in the maintenance of COPD has been recently noticed with great interest. During the chronic phase of an autoimmune response, lymphocytes lose their costimulatory signals. Previously, CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> were reported to be systemically heightened in COPD patients. However, a direct role of CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> in the pathogenesis of COPD is still under discussion, since {{there is no evidence that}} CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> originate from the lungs of diseased patients. Therefore, we evaluated lungs from end-stage COPD patients and compared the levels of tissue infiltrating CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> to systemic levels. We could show that CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> are present in high amounts in lung tissue obtained from COPD GOLD IV patients suggesting a direct involvement of those cells in the pathophysiology of COPD. Furthermore, purified lung-resident CD 4 + cells showed a stable proliferative response to lung specific elastin and collagen.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a novel Ras-interacting protein from Dictyostelium, RIP 3, whose function is required for both chemotaxis and the synthesis and relay of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) chemoattractant signal. rip 3 null cells are unable to aggregate and lack receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase but are able, in response to cAMP, to induce aggregation-stage, postaggregative, and cell-type-specific gene expression in suspension culture. In addition, rip 3 null cells are unable to properly polarize in a cAMP gradient and chemotaxis is highly impaired. We demonstrate that cAMP stimulation of guanylyl cyclase, which is required for chemotaxis, is reduced � 60 % in rip 3 null cells. This reduced activation of guanylyl cyclase may account, in part, for the defect in chemotaxis. When cells are pulsed with cAMP for 5 htomimic the endogenous cAMP oscillations that occur in wild-type strains, the cells will form aggregates, most of which, however, arrest at the mound stage. Unlike the response seen in wild-type strains, the rip 3 <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates that form under these experimental conditions are very small, which is {{probably due to the}} rip 3 <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> chemotaxis defect.

Although structural and/or numerical aberrations were found in all six cell lines, chromosome 8 was the one most consistently involved.

40|$|Dictyostelium DdINCENP is a {{chromosomal}} passenger protein {{associated with}} centromeres, the spindle midzone, and poles during mitosis and the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. Disruption {{of the single}} DdINCENP gene revealed important roles for this protein in mitosis and cytokinesis. DdINCENP <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> lack a robust spindle midzone and are hypersensitive to microtubule-depolymerizing drugs, suggesting that their spindles may not be stable.

Using mouse fibroblasts deficient in either Jnk 1 or Jnk 2, we found that JNK 1 was activated by TNF-α, whereas JNK 2 activation was negligible. In addition, JNK 2 interfered with JNK 1 activation via its “futile” phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Consequently, expression and activation of c-Jun, which depends on JNK activity, were impaired in Jnk 1 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> but enhanced in Jnk 2 <b>null</b> <b>cells.</b> TNF-α-induced apoptosis was also suppressed in Jnk 1 null fibroblasts but increased in Jnk 2 <b>null</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, our results provide a molecular mechanism underlying the different biological functions of JNK isoforms...|$|R

Using a cell line in which deletion of the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT; the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc) can be induced by 4 -hydroxytamoxifen, we screened the expression of 84 HSPs using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. In OGT <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> the stress-induced expression of 18 molecular chaperones, including HSP 72, were reduced. GSK- 3 β promotes apoptosis through numerous pathways, including phosphorylation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF 1) at Ser 303 (Ser(P) 303 HSF 1), which inactivates HSF 1 and inhibits HSP expression. In OGT <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> we observed increased Ser(P) 303 HSF 1; conversely, in cells in which O-GlcNAc levels had been elevated, reduced Ser(P) 303 HSF 1 was detected. These data, combined with those showing that inhibition of GSK- 3 β in OGT <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> recovers HSP 72 expression, suggests that O-GlcNAc regulates the activity of GSK- 3 β.

Both mutational changes impact upon Artemis function and a fibroblast cell line derived from the patient (F 96 - 224) has greatly reduced Artemis protein. In contrast to Artemis <b>null</b> <b>cell</b> lines, which fail to repair a subset of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ioniz-ing radiation, F 96 - 224 cells show slow but residual DSB rejoining.

40|$|AP 180, {{one of many}} {{assembly}} {{proteins and}} adaptors for clathrin, stimulates the assembly of clathrin lattices on membranes, but its unique contribution to clathrin function remains elusive. In this study we identified the Dictyostelium discoideum ortholog of the adaptor protein AP 180 and characterized a mutant strain carrying a deletion in this gene. Imaging GFP-labeled AP 180 showed that it localized to punctae at the plasma membrane, the contractile vacuole, and the cytoplasm and associated with clathrin. AP 180 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> did not display defects characteristic of clathrin mutants and continued to localize clathrin punctae on their plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm. However, like clathrin mutants, AP 180 mutants, were osmosensitive. When immersed in water, AP 180 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> formed abnormally large contractile vacuoles. Furthermore, the cycle of expansion and contraction for contractile vacuoles in AP 80 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> was {{twice as long as}} that of wild-type cells. Taken together, our results suggest that AP 180 plays a unique role as a regulator of contractile vacuole morphology and activity in Dictyostelium...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} the {{characterization}} of Dock/Elmo proteins, a novel family of RacGEF's in Dictyostelium discoideum and describe their role in phagocytosis, macropinocytosis and CAMP mediated chemotactic cell movement. Aggregation competent Dictyostelium cells can detect and move up cAMP gradients. cAMP stimulation causes a transient localized increase in phosphatidyl inositol (3, 4, 5) tris phosphate (PIP 3) concentration in the plasma membrane at the cell's leading edge. PIP 3 binding domain containing RacGEF's are thought to mediate the cAMP signal through the activation of Racs to localised actin polymerization, which results in further extension of the leading edge {{in the direction of}} the CAMP gradient. However inhibition of PIP 3 formation, through inhibition of P 13 K activity,results only in a partial defect of chemotaxis, implying that there may exist other signalling pathways that mediate the CAMP signal to the cytoskeleton. Members of the Dock family form a novel class of Rac activators and deletion of dock in Drosophila and C. elegans results in chemotaxis and phagocytosis defects. We have identified the 8 dock genes and 4 elmo genes in the Dictyostelium genome, which we named dockA-H and elmo 1 - 4. To investigate the role of Dock/Elmo, we generated null mutant strains (dockA null, dockB null, dockA/B null, dockC null, dockD null, dockG null, dockH null, elmo 1 null and elmo 1 /dockB null) by gene disruption using homologous recombination. In our study, knockout dock genes in Dictyostelium results in numerous defects. dockA <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> show a slow chemotactic response to CAMP and reduced rate in macropinocytosis. dockA null slugs show poor phototaxis. dockB <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> grow slowly in the axenic medium and are defective in chemotaxis, macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. dockA/B double mutant cells show stronger defects in chemotaxis than either mutant by itself. In the dockA/B null double mutant chemotaxis is almost completely inhibited in presence of the P 13 K inhibitor LY 294002. dockA null, dockB <b>null,</b> dockA/B <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> all show reduced actin polymerization upon cAMP stimulation. dockC <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> also show poor chemotaxis to cAMP. However there is no obvious defect in chemotaxis, macropinocytosis and phagocytosis for dockD null, dockG null, and dockH <b>null</b> <b>cells.</b> Although Dictyostelium Docks do not contain the conventional DH domain for Rac activation, we show that the DockerB domain (Docker domain of DockB protein) interacts with RaclA in the nucleotide free state in vitro. The DockerA domain (Docker domain of DockA protein) preferentially interacts with RacH and RacL. Expression of Rac 1 A in dockB null background can effectively rescue the defect of phagocytosis. These findings show that Dictyostelium Docks most likely act as RacGEF's involved in a P 13 K independent chemotaxis signalling pathway and also play important roles in the regulation of endocytosis in Dictyostelium. In this study we also investigated the role of Elmo 1 in the regulation of cell behavior. The elmo 1 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> grow slowly in the axenic medium and are defective in chemotaxis, macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. The phenotype of elmo 1 <b>null</b> <b>cells</b> is extremely similar to that of dockB <b>null</b> <b>cells.</b> Cells of the elmo 1 /dockB null double mutant did not show a much more severe phenotype than either parent stain (elmo 1 null or dockB null) by itself. These data strongly support the idea that in Dictyostelium Elmo 1 and DockB are involved in same signalling pathways. Our data thus strongly suggest that Dock/Elmo complexes function as RacGEF's during chemotaxis and endocytosis in Dictyostelium. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are rheumatic disorders typically displaying infiltrating T {{cells in the}} affected organs. Yet, despite much effort, the contribution and antigen specificity of these T cells in association to disease manifestations has not been clearly delineated. In peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, {{as well as in}} other chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by infiltrates of CD 4 + T cells, oligoclonally expanded CD 4 + T cells lacking the costimulatory molecule CD 28 are found with increased frequencies. These cells are often referred to as CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> and display a proinflammatory profile with secretion of IFN-γ and TNF, as well as cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Expanded populations of the corresponding subset of CD 8 + T cells are found in most individuals and are described as effector memory cells associated with latent virus infections. The aims of this thesis were to perform functional characterization of CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> in the two rheumatic diseases, rheumatoid {{arthritis and}} idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, as well as to investigate their presence in the inflamed tissue and correlation to clinical manifestations. In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies also CD 8 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> were investigated. In rheumatoid arthritis, we found circulating CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> in 30 % of patients. Screening for natural killer (NK) cell receptors on these cells revealed that CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> express a wide variety of both inhibiting and activating NK receptors. Functionally, a selection of these receptors could synergistically costimulate CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> after suboptimal T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Thus, costimulation of CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> via NK receptors might permit activation via less specific or lower avidity TCR-MHC interactions. Despite the increased frequencies of CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> in peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> were only scarcely found in the synovial membrane and fluid of the inflamed joints. Interestingly in approximately half of the patients that displayed an increased frequency of CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> in peripheral blood, the dominant TCR-Vβ subsets from peripheral blood were not present in synovial fluid. This indicates a selected migration of CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> to the joint. Still, ex vivo synovial CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> were functional and displayed a similar response to stimulation as the corresponding cells from peripheral blood. The frequencies of CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> in the circulation or synovial fluid did not correlate with erosive arthritis, neither to seropositivity for anti-citrullinated proteins/peptides antibodies. This is not surprising given the low frequency of these cells in the joint. Instead, there was a strong correlation to seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV). These data indicate that CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> are not associated with erosive disease in rheumatoid arthritis, but are potentially involved in CMV-related manifestations elsewhere than the joint. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, CD 4 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> and CD 8 +CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> dominated the muscles infiltrates of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. The frequency of CD 8 + T cells was strongly correlated with disease activity in a subset of patients. Circulating CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> of both the CD 4 + and CD 8 + lineages were more common in patients compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, the frequency decreased with increased disease duration. Like in rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> was associated to CMV infection. These results imply that CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> are important effector T cells in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and that CMV could be involved in the pathogenesis in a subset of patients. As CD 28 <b>null</b> T <b>cells</b> are regulated partly by other mechanisms than conventional T cells, display an instant inflammatory response, and might be involved in defense to CMV infection as well as in pathogenic mechanisms of rheumatic diseases a better understanding for these cells are important for future therapeutic approaches...|$|R
