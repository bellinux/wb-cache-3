40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{protection}} of users' biometric templates {{is an important part}} of the biometric system's security. A hash-based scheme for the protection of users' information is investigated from the point of view of one-way function. By involving an adaptive <b>non-uniform</b> <b>quantizing</b> template, the contradiction between the fuzziness of the biometric information and the sensitive of the hash function has been eliminated. Then a protecting scheme base on hash function is implemented which avoids the storage of users' biometric images or templates. The analysis of the quantizing template and the hash function demonstrates the security of the scheme, and the simulation shows the feasibility of the scheme...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of distributed consensus under digital communication, in the paper, assuming the initial states of nodes following uniform distribution, a non-uniform quantization scheme based on probabilistic quantization is proposed, and the entire data range is divided based on Âµ-law non-uniform quantization scheme. The quantization step-size near the average of initial states is smaller, and the corresponding quantization errors are smaller. Base on the proposed quantization scheme, a <b>non-uniform</b> probabilistically <b>quantized</b> distributed consensus algorithm is proposed. The performance and the mean square errors of the <b>non-uniform</b> probabilistically <b>quantized</b> distributed consensus algorithm is analyzed, by analyses and simulations, the results show the <b>non-uniform</b> probabilistically <b>quantized</b> distributed consensus can reach a consensus, and the mean square error is far smaller than that of probabilistically quantized distributed consensus...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{detectors}} for {{spectrum sensing}} in cognitive radio networks always become disabled when noise uncertainty is severe. Shannon entropy-based detection methods have aroused widespread attention {{in recent years}} due to the characteristics of effective anti-noise uncertainty. However, in existing entropy-based sensing schemes, the uniform quantization method cannot guarantee the maximum entropy distribution when primary users do not exist, and cannot effectively distinguish between two hypotheses, which severely limits the promotion of detection performance. Moreover, the Shannon entropy-based sensing schemes are prone to misconvergence occurring when estimating entropy values, thus causing failure detection, which leads to system detection inefficiency and resource waste. These are the two major serious defects in Shannon entropy-based detectors, which restrict the performance improvement. In this paper, a novel <b>non-uniform</b> <b>quantized</b> exponential entropy-based (NQEE) detector is proposed for local sensing {{to deal with the}} problems of maximum entropy distribution and detection failure. To further improve the reliability of the detection, a collaborative spectrum sensing algorithm based on an NQEE detector with multiple fusion rules is presented. Simulation results verify that the detection performance of the improved local entropy-based detector is superior to the existing Shannon entropy-based detectors and is proved to be robust to noise power uncertainty. In addition, the novel collaborative detection algorithm outperforms the traditional collaborative spectrum detection method to a great degree...|$|R
