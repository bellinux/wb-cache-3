After exploring the place for a while, he finds Albert, his cousin, who reveals himself as the unidentified man he had been seeing.|$|E

60|$|He {{nodded his}} head at me with the most {{complete}} bright confidence, quite sure <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> settled his case perfectly.|$|R
60|$|The {{cabin boy}} willingly complied. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a {{companion}} <b>he</b> {{did not appear}} so frightened, and he worked with a will.|$|R

25|$|Fay-Ann Lyons is {{a three-time}} Trinidad and Tobago Carnival Road March {{champion}} (2003, 2008, 2009) and the 2009 International Soca Monarch and International Groovy Soca Monarch champion. She created history (again) {{when she won}} the International Soca Monarch {{for the first time}} in 2009, as the first female to win the Power category, and the first individual (male or female) to win the Power, Groovy and People's Choice awards on Fantastic Friday (aka Carnival Friday) during the finals of the competition which is held annually in Trinidad. She also went on to win the Carnival Road March that year, becoming the first soca artist to win that soca 'triplet' of titles. She is the first (and only) woman to accomplish that feat while pregnant. Fay-Ann is the youngest solo artist (male or female), still actively recording, with multiple wins of the Carnival Road March crown. (Machel Montano is the youngest male with multiple wins, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> four solo wins and a joint win with Patrice Roberts). Fay-Ann remains the only female artist who has won the Carnival Road March three times, and is the second to attain back-to-back wins in two consecutive years. Fay-Ann and husband Bunji also became parents in 2009 to a daughter, Syri, born on February 28, 2009, just a few weeks after Carnival.|$|E
500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. But <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been exposed for what he is {{it is time to}} move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the way I was treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E
6000|$|... "And he's a {{very good}} man," [...] said Cynthia, who {{understood}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> spoken a little lightly of Jethro, and resented it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> regretted <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{given the}} birds of the island such strange names {{that they are very}} wild and {{difficult}} of approach.|$|R

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, De Vero {{said that}} he had {{received}} threats from black metal fans, both at his door and by phone and email. It was also alleged that a fight had erupted backstage at the 2008 Wacken Open Air, triggered by homophobic remarks. Allegedly, the person who made the remarks had to be hospitalized. However, Gaahl denied that anyone had ever [...] "said anything derogatory" [...] to him in person. When asked by the webzine FaceCulture if he thinks people will see him and his music differently <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, Gaahl answered: ...|$|E
2500|$|Sun Quan deeply mourned Zhou Yu's death. He shed {{tears and}} said, [...] "Gongjin possessed the calibre of a talented advisor to a ruler. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> died {{at such a}} young age, who can I still rely on?" [...] He even wore plain {{garments}} to express his sorrow, which touched many people. After a funeral was held for Zhou Yu at Baqiu, his body was transported back to Wu Commandery (吳郡; in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu). Sun Quan received the procession at Wuhu and personally paid for all the expenses. He also issued an order allowing Zhou Yu's family to keep retainers.|$|E
2500|$|Muralitharan {{believed}} {{the emergence of}} Mendis would help prolong his own career. Muralitharan, 36, and 23-year-old Mendis formed a formidable partnership in the first Test thrashing of India, taking 19 of the 20 wickets between them. [...] "If he keeps performing this way, he will definitely {{take a lot of}} wickets in international cricket. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> come, I think I can play Test cricket a few more years. Bowling 50 overs in a Test innings is very hard. Now if I bowl only 30–35 and he bowls more than me, the job will get easier for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, we {{can ride}} on together,' said the king's son, {{and the road}} seemed much shorter <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> some one to talk to.|$|R
60|$|After this {{we walked}} along {{in silence for}} a few feet. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> me <b>he</b> was evidently at a loss what to do next.|$|R
2500|$|The Bonds {{controversy}} continues, especially <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{surpassed the}} All-Time Home Run record with 762 career home runs; the media continues to pressure Bonds with questions over the issue. In 2006, the book Game of Shadows was published offering researched claims that Bonds' trainer was providing illegal performance enhancers to Bonds and other athletes. [...] Bonds had {{admitted that he}} did use a clear substance and lotion {{given to him by}} his trainer but had no idea that they were any sort of performance enhancers. Bonds claimed that to his knowledge, the substances given to him were legal to treat his arthritis.|$|E
2500|$|As a critic, Ford {{is known}} for {{remarking}} [...] "Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, {{and the quality of}} the whole will be revealed to you." [...] George Seldes, in his book Witness to a Century, describes Ford ("probably in 1932") recalling his writing collaboration with Joseph Conrad, and the lack of acknowledgment by publishers of his status as co-author. Seldes recounts Ford's disappointment with Hemingway: [...] "'and he disowns me <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> become better known than I am.' Tears now came to Ford's eyes." [...] Ford says, [...] "I helped Joseph Conrad, I helped Hemingway. I helped a dozen, a score of writers, and many of them have beaten me. I'm now an old man and I'll die without making a name like Hemingway." [...] Seldes observes, [...] "At this climax Ford began to sob. Then he began to cry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, four {{siblings}} – Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie – {{are among}} many children evacuated from London during World War II {{to escape the}} Blitz. They are sent to the countryside to live with professor Digory Kirke. Exploring the professor's house, Lucy finds a wardrobe which doubles as a magic portal to a forest in a land called Narnia. [...] At a lamppost oddly located in the forest, she meets Tumnus, a faun, who invites her to tea in his home. [...] There the faun confesses that he invited her not out of hospitality, but {{with the intention of}} betraying her to the White Witch. [...] The witch has ruled Narnia for years, using magic to keep it frozen in a perpetual winter. [...] She has ordered all Narnians to turn in any humans ("Sons of Adam" [...] or [...] "Daughters of Eve") they come across. [...] But <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> come to know and like a human, Tumnus repents his original intention and escorts Lucy back to the lamppost.|$|E

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{begun to}} be frank and lucid, Bernard found a charm in it, and the impulse under which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> spoken urged him almost violently forward.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced up}} at her furtively. <b>He</b> was certain <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> played his cards ill. She had read through him easily. He cursed himself for a lout.|$|R
2500|$|In , Snake Eyes is {{a member}} of G.I. Joe. He was given the name [...] "Hebi no me" [...] ("Snake Eyes") by his Arashikage clan sensei, Hard Master, because he {{possesses}} the [...] "steely gaze of a serpent". He cannot speak after having his throat punctured, and just shows up for special missions when called by Scarlett, who can [...] "translate" [...] what he is thinking. He is not used to teamwork, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> joined G.I. Joe, his sense of honor and morality would not let him walk away. In the episode [...] "Dreadnoks Rising", Zartan takes off his visor but puts it back on and says, [...] "You need it more than I do". Snake Eyes' wolf Timber made an appearance in the episode [...] "White Out", where he was rescued by Snake Eyes from a bear trap, before they were assaulted by Storm Shadow and Shadow-Vipers; at the end, Snake Eyes asks Snow Job to watch Timber until he returns. In the episode [...] "Revelations, Part 1", Scarlett learns that Snake Eyes briefly met her father, and promised him to look after his daughter, and he shows signs of having feelings for her. During the time when Snake Eyes still spoke, before his throat injury in the episodes [...] "Return of the Arashikage, Parts 1-2", Snake Eyes was voiced by Danny Cooksey.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am much {{obliged to}} you for telling me," [...] Mannering muttered. <b>He</b> remembered <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{scarcely}} spoken a dozen words to his wife since his return.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--er--I {{was sure}} {{you wanted me}} to bring out that beast fer him," [...] murmured Yates, uneasily. <b>He</b> was sorry <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> played the trick on Dave.|$|R
6000|$|PROSERPINE (highly incensed). He'll be {{all right}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the {{advantage}} of YOUR polished conversation: that's one comfort, anyhow. (She begins to typewrite with clattering asperity.) ...|$|E
