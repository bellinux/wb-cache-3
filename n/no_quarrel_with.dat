500|$|In his concert {{review for}} The Village Voice, Don Heckman {{described}} [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a song which expresses {{far better than}} words {{what kind of man}} Harrison is". Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>quarrel</b> <b>with</b> John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, but at the moment I have to have stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts {{to do something about the}} misery in the world around him. How surprising that the most introspective of the Beatles should be the one who, in the long run, takes the most effective actions." ...|$|E

Kendall found the incident amusing and was not ill-disposed towards either author. Speaking about the copying, she said, [...] "I've got <b>no</b> <b>quarrel</b> <b>with</b> them...There's only so many ideas and if you have one then someone else out there probably has the same one, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides, {{one of the}} {{foremost}} 12th century rabbinical arbiters and philosophers, sees the relation of Islam to Judaism as primarily theoretical. Maimonides has <b>no</b> <b>quarrel</b> <b>with</b> the strict monotheism of Islam, but finds fault with the practical politics of Muslim regimes. He also considered Islamic ethics and politics to be inferior to their Jewish counterparts. Maimonides criticised what he perceived as the lack of virtue in the way Muslims rule their societies and relate to one another. In his Epistle to Yemenite Jewry, he refers to Mohammad, as [...] "hameshuga" [...] â€“ [...] "that madman".|$|E

Ali stated: [...] "War is against the teachings of the Qur'an. I'm not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by Allah or The Messenger. We don't take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers." [...] He stated: [...] "Man, I ain't got <b>no</b> <b>quarrel</b> <b>with</b> them Viet Cong." [...] Ali elaborated: [...] "Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Every for Ever. [...] "Every now and then." [...] This is nonsense: {{there can}} be {{no such thing as a}} now and then, nor, of course, a number of now and thens. Now and then is itself bad enough, {{reversing}} as it does the sequence of things, but it is idiomatic and there is <b>no</b> <b>quarreling</b> <b>with</b> it.

2500|$|While Pershing {{was working}} {{to the south}} of Lake Lanao, Major Robert Lee Bullard was working to the north, {{building}} a road from Iligan to Marawi. Although never officially declared one, like Pershing, he was regarded as a Datu by the Moros. Because of the Lake Lanao Moros' very personalistic style of leadership, they had troubles seeing them as two officers in the same army. Instead, they saw them as two powerful chieftains who might become rivals. During Pershing's March Around Lake Lanao, one Moro ran to Bullard, exclaiming that Pershing had gone Juramentado, meaning berserk and that Bullard had better run up the white flag (signaling that they had <b>no</b> <b>quarrel</b> <b>with</b> Pershing's troops). Bullard was unable to explain to the Moro why he was not worried about Pershing's approach. On another occasion, a powerful datu proposed an alliance with Bullard, for the purposes of defeating Pershing and establishing overlordship over the entire Lake Lanao region. On June 1, 1903, the Moro Province was created, which included [...] "all of the territory of the Philippines lying south of the eight parallel of latitude, excepting the island of Palawan and the eastern portion of the northwest peninsula of Mindanao." [...] The province had a civil government, but many civil service positions, including the district governors and their deputies, were held by members of the American military. The governor of the province served as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. This system of combined civil and military administration had several motivations behind it. One was the continued Moro hostilities. Another was the Army's experience during the Indian Wars, when it came into conflict with the civilian Bureau of Indian Affairs. A third was that the Moros, with their feudal, personalistic style of government, would have no respect for a military leader who submitted to the authority of a non-combatant.|$|E
