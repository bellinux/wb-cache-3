5|$|Due to {{the closure}} of Dunston power station, along with the later {{closures}} of the power stations at Stella and Blyth, {{the northern part of}} North East England has become heavily dependent upon the National Grid for electrical supply.

Rut in males and estrus in females does <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male {{and the female}} begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward.

5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E

No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.|$|E

5|$|The {{prediction}} that the CMB temperature was {{higher in the}} past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E

5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe {{to be with}} a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized {{in order to ensure that}} she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; woody plants are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India. Studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{work began}} on the Central Valley Project (CVP), a federal water project that would develop the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems for {{irrigation}} of the highly fertile Central Valley. However, {{after the end of}} World War II in 1945, the state experienced an economic boom that led to rapid urban and commercial growth in the central and southern portions of the state, and it became clear that California's economy could <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> solely on a state water system geared primarily towards agriculture. A new study of California's water supplies by the Division of Water Resources (now California Department of Water Resources, DWR) was carried out under an act of the California State Legislature in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active {{for a few hours}} in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may <b>not</b> <b>depend</b> on this.|$|E

It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E
