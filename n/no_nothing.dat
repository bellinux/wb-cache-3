Peckinpaugh once said that Heath [...] "could {{have been one of}} the greatest players. He had the ability to do about anything. He could run, he could throw, and he could hit. But he just had no hustle, <b>no</b> <b>nothing.</b> If a ball went by him, he just might walk after it." [...] In December 1945 the Indians traded Heath to the Washington Senators where he started in right field.|$|E

In the video, Gaga walks from New York City to Nebraska to get her boyfriend back. According to Gaga: [...] "I'm walking with no luggage and <b>no</b> <b>nothing</b> and it's just me and my ankles are bleeding {{a little bit and}} there's grass stuck in my shoes and I've got this outfit on and it's real sort of New York clothing and I'm sprinting... And the [...] idea that when you're away from someone you love, it's torture," [...] she continued. [...] "I knew I wanted the video to be about me sprinting back and walking hundreds of thousands of miles to get him back." ...|$|E

Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had [...] "a bomb go off in my face." [...] He told Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer, that [...] "both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed." [...] According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he [...] "had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again". Hubbard was said to have been [...] "twice been pronounced dead" [...] and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he [...] "utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein". The techniques that he developed [...] "made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health". On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because [...] "I was utterly exhausted. I'd just been in combat theater after combat theater, you see, with no rest, <b>no</b> <b>nothing</b> between." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1994, Levine, {{along with}} Mickey Madden, Jesse Carmichael, and Ryan Dusick, another Brentwood High student, formed garage band Kara's Flowers. The group played their first gig at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, with Levine on vocals and guitar. In 1997, {{the band was}} {{discovered}} while they were performing at a beach party in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen. Allen, along with his partner John DeNicola, had the band record an 11-track album. Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob Cavallo. In 1997, Kara's Flowers released their first album, titled The Fourth World. That same year, the band appeared on an episode of the drama series Beverly Hills, 90210. After their graduation, the band toured in support of their debut. Despite high expectations, the album had little success, selling about 5,000 copies, and its only single, [...] "Soap Disco", failed commercially. Finally, on Cavallo's exit from the label, Reprise decided to drop the band. [...] Disappointed {{with the results of}} their album, the band broke up. Later, Levine would say of the experience: [...] "Kara’s Flowers was just floating up the wall beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly, put it out. No touring base, <b>no</b> <b>nothing.</b> Just try to make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesn’t work".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1970s American cars [...] "are remembered {{far more often}} for their power than their style, and ... {{throughout}} the decade, the character of cars became blurred. Only a handful of cars had real personalities...." [...] the AMC Gremlin was one of them, [...] "a pioneering hatchback". According to Tom and Ray Magliozzi, [...] "it's easy to criticize this car now, because just about any car from the early '70s would look bad next to today's cars. They had no fuel injection, no independent suspension, no air bags, no anti-lock brakes, <b>no</b> <b>nothing!</b> But compared with the other cars of its era, the Gremlin wasn't bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{practice}} (excessive compression, {{dynamic range}} reduction, loudness level enhancement, etc.) has been condemned by several recording industry professionals including Alan Parsons, Geoff Emerick (noted {{for his work}} with the Beatles from Revolver to Abbey Road), and mastering engineers Doug Sax, Steve Hoffman, and many others, including music audiophiles, hi-fi enthusiasts, and fans. Musician Bob Dylan has also condemned the practice, saying: [...] "You listen to these modern records, they're atrocious, they have sound all over them. There's no definition of nothing, no vocal, <b>no</b> <b>nothing,</b> just like—static." [...] The compact disc editions of Dylan's more recent albums Modern Times and Together Through Life are examples of heavy dynamic range compression, although Dylan himself {{might not have been}} responsible for it.|$|E

2500|$|On April 13, 2011, Kiss began {{recording}} {{a new album}} due for release later in the year. Simmons stated, the album [...] "is gonna be the next step to Sonic Boom. Very similar– straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, <b>no</b> <b>nothing,</b> just rock." [...] The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: [...] "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible. You need tubes, electricity and thick wood to make that thick sound." ...|$|E

[...] It was a one-take job, with him singing and {{playing at the}} same time. [...] He just had such mastery of the {{instrument}} and {{he knew what he}} was and knew his abilities". [...] Engineer Eddie Kramer saw it differently: [...] "The idea that these jam sessions were informal is something that I completely disagree with. [...] They may have seemed casual to the outside observer, but Jimi plotted and planned out nearly all of them. [...] He'd reason that if he had his songs together, if he really wanted to pull out what he heard in his head, he needed the right people... and that's what he did". [...] During the recording session, Hendrix is heard advising Winwood on his organ part.|$|E
2500|$|The first prototype, {{serial number}} N515 first flew at Castle Bromwich in late 1917, but {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} problems. The Puma engine, despite being ordered in large numbers, was unreliable and suffered from severe vibration, which considerably delayed service testing. The aircraft's layout, with the pilot sitting so far aft, gave him a poor view, and sitting [...] away from the Vickers gun, could <b>no</b> <b>nothing</b> to resolve any gun stoppage. When eventually formally tested, in August 1918, {{it proved to be}} heavier and carry fewer bombs than the private venture Sopwith B.1 of similar concept. The second prototype was abandoned before it was completed, and no orders were placed either for the Sunbeam or the Sopwith, which were incapable of defending themselves against attacking enemy fighters Existing two-seat aircraft such as the Airco DH.4 better met the RNAS's (and later the Royal Air Force's) requirements.|$|E
