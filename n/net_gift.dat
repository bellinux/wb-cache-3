40|$|Heavy” file sharers’ and “heavy” activists’ {{values and}} attitudes toward file sharing and {{intellectual}} property rights are analyzed in this thesis, {{with a focus on}} the conflict between property owners and non-owners. The purpose of this MA thesis is to investigate the perception of file sharing and intellectual property rights on the Internet. The main research questions is: How do “heavy” file sharers and “heavy” activists perceive file sharing and intellectual property rights on the Internet?. For answering it, critical political economy and both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. Therefore, the paper consists of two major parts. In the first part, the theoretical framework is introduced. In the second part, empirical research is presented and the theoretical framework is applied to the analysis of the gathered data. Data were collected {{with the help of a}} survey. The main results of the study suggest that “heavy” file sharers and “heavy” activists tend to have left-wing values and a left-wing political agenda behind file sharing, and perceive culture, and information and knowledge as “public goods”. Furthermore, “heavy” file sharers and “heavy” activists tend to contribute to the <b>Net</b> <b>gift</b> economy and share their created content in a way that constitutes an alternative to intellectual property rights, which they see as out-of-date...|$|E
40|$|Do {{remittances}} sent by overseas migrants {{serve as}} insurance for recipient households? This paper examines how remittances sent by overseas migrants respond to income shocks experienced by Philippine households. Because household income and remittances are jointly determined, we exploit rainfall shocks as instrumental variables for income changes. In households with overseas migrants, {{we find that}} exogenous changes in income lead to changes in remittances of the opposite sign, consistent with an insurance motivation for remittances. In such households, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of full insurance: on average, essentially all of exogenous declines in income are replaced by remittance inflows from overseas. By contrast, changes in household income {{have no effect on}} remittance receipts in households without overseas migrants. Remittance receipts may also be partly shared with others: in migrant households, <b>net</b> <b>gifts</b> to other households move {{in the same direction as}} remittance receipts in response to income shocks. remittances, migration, insurance, risk, instrumental variables, rainfall, Philippines...|$|R
50|$|A {{highlight}} of the season was the 3-0 victory over local rivals Aston Villa. A first-half goal from Clinton Morrison saw Birmingham in control at half time, before a comedy of errors saw a throw-in by Olof Mellberg roll under the foot of Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman and into the <b>net</b> to <b>gift</b> the side a 2-0 lead. Geoff Horsfield added a third later in the game thanks to bad defending from defender Alpay.|$|R
50|$|Tottenham {{ended the}} month in Premiership action {{with a home}} game against Liverpool, 4 days after the match against Werder Bremen. Spurs once again fell behind on 42 minutes, with Martin Škrtel poking home after a goal-mouth {{scramble}} in the Tottenham box. Spurs pushed for the equaliser, and had a big chance to level after they were awarded a penalty when David N'Gog handled Gareth Bale's free-kick, but Defoe smashed the kick wide of the post. Spurs eventually equalised on 65 minutes, with Škrtel, having opened the scoring, diverted Modrić's low cross, which {{was on its way}} to Peter Crouch, into his own <b>net</b> to <b>gift</b> Spurs the equaliser. Spurs eventually won the game through Aaron Lennon, who beat Liverpool's Paul Konchesky to Peter Crouch's knock-down to fire past Pepe Reina to give Spurs a 2-1 victory.|$|R
5000|$|Lainton {{remained}} {{as a second}} choice goalkeeper at Bury until 8 February 2014, when he joined divisional rivals Burton Albion on a one-month loan to fill in for injured custodian Dean Lyness; he kept a clean sheet on his debut in a 1-0 victory at Morecambe later that same day. However ten days later he punched a high ball into his own <b>net</b> to <b>gift</b> Rochdale the equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Spotland; manager Gary Rowett backed Lainton, saying [...] "we write it off and move on". On 11 March, Lainton extended his loan stay with the [...] "Brewers" [...] {{until the end of}} the 2013-14 season. Lainton remained the first choice goalkeeper at the Pirelli Stadium, making fourteen appearance until he came off as a substitute at half-time after dislocating his thumb during a 1-0 defeat to Northampton Town on 12 April. The injury caused him to miss the last seven matches of the campaign, including the play-off final defeat to Fleetwood Town.|$|R
40|$|We generalise the {{standard}} joy-of-giving bequest motive by including inter-vivos gifts. Within a life-cycle framework, we analyse {{the implications of}} the choice of different discount factors for the utility of gifts and bequests. For a linear utility of giving, we characterise the gift and bequest pattern of a liquidity constrained individual over the life-cycle. We find that discounting at the interest rate is very convenient as the linear utility parameter can be interpreted as a summary measure for the strength of the motive of giving, <b>net</b> of all <b>gift</b> and bequest timing issues over the life-cycle.

60|$|One of {{his first}} acts was to give my father the boat {{in which he had}} come, reserving only the right to have it back in case he should have need of it. The herring were down on the coast that autumn, and my uncle before he died had given us a fine set of <b>nets,</b> so the <b>gift</b> was worth many a pound to us. Sometimes de Lapp would go out in the boat alone, and I have seen him for a whole summer day rowing slowly along and {{stopping}} every half-dozen strokes to throw over a stone {{at the end of a}} string. I could not think what he was doing until he told me of his own freewill.|$|R
5000|$|King's 14th goal of {{the season}} came when he sliced a {{clearance}} into his own <b>net</b> to <b>gift</b> Wolverhampton Wanderers a win. Crystal Palace took a two-goal lead, and Løvenkrands was booked for diving in the penalty area, before substitute Žigić scored a well-placed header with his first touch before Papa Bouba Diop, on his first start, equalised with a powerful header from a corner. Teenage midfielder Callum Reilly made his league debut. Seven teenagers started the match, and Žigić played as a lone striker after Løvenkrands was injured during the pre-match warm-up, at home to Burnley. Davies opened the scoring with a header before Charlie Austin's headed equaliser was disallowed when the referee called play back for a foul on the player who had crossed the ball. Burnley {{took the lead in}} a two-minute spell in the second half before Žigić shot under the goalkeeper to equalise in the 89th minute. Two headed goals by Davies gave Birmingham a win at Barnsley to take them seven points clear of the relegation zone, though they were fortunate that Craig Davies, who scored four of Barnsley's five in the reverse fixture, missed a penalty. In what Clark thought [...] "was our most inept performance for many, many weeks", at Bolton Wanderers, Žigić scored early but after Bolton secured a two-goal lead, his frustration got the better of him and he was booked twice in quick succession.|$|R
