5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the <b>natural</b> <b>cause</b> for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

25|$|A {{conspiracy}} theory emerged in Russia {{in the early}} 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the KGB. Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that Viktor Chebrikov gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as anti-Soviet propaganda by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a <b>natural</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to Wild Bears of the Worlds, by Paul Ward and Suzanne Kynaston, {{human contact}} with bears has existed {{since the time}} of the Neanderthals and the European cave bear around 200,000 to 75,000 years ago. There is some {{evidence}} of cave bear worship during these early years: between the years 1917 and 1922, Emil Bachler discovered a large stone chest filled with cave bear skulls in the Drachenloch Cave, one of the Wildkirchli; between 1916 and 1922, Konrad Hormann found narrow niches filled with five cave bear skulls. However, at these sites, there have been little evidence of any human presence, and so some scientists have come to regard such discoveries as the result of some <b>natural</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 642, the {{powerful}} general Yeon Gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over Goguryeo.

After the death of Tang Taizong, his son Emperor Tang Gaozong allied with the Korean kingdom of Silla and invaded Goguryeo again, {{but was unable to}} overcome Goguryeo's stalwart defenses and was defeated in 662. However, Yeon Gaesomun died of a <b>natural</b> <b>cause</b> in 666 and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 666, Yeon Gaesomun died of a <b>natural</b> <b>cause</b> and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and {{weakened}} by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother. He was initially succeeded as Dae Mangniji, the highest position newly made under the ruling period of Yeon Gaesomun, by his oldest son Yeon Namsaeng. As Yeon Namsaeng subsequently carried out a tour of Goguryeo territory, however, rumors began to spread both that Yeon Namsaeng {{was going to kill}} his younger brothers Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan, whom he had left in charge at Pyongyang, and that Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan were planning to rebel against Yeon Namsaeng. When Yeon Namsaeng subsequently sent officials close to him back to Pyongyang to try to spy on the situation, Yeon Namgeon arrested them and declared himself Dae Mangniji, attacking his brother. Yeon Namsaeng sent his son Cheon Heonseong (泉獻誠), as Yeon Namsaeng changed his family name from Yeon (淵) to Cheon (泉) observe naming taboo for Emperor Gaozu, to Tang to seek aid. Emperor Gaozong saw this as an opportunity and sent an army to attack and destroy Goguryeo. In the middle of Goguryeo's power struggles between Yeon Gaesomun's successors, his younger brother, Yeon Jeongto, defected to the Silla side.|$|E
500|$|Early in March, Darwin {{moved to}} London {{to be near}} this work, joining Lyell's social circle of {{scientists}} and experts such as Charles Babbage,Darwin's Journal (...) backdated from August 1838 gives a date of 6 March 1837 who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and {{a close friend of}} the writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted Malthusianism underlying the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons influenced by Geoffroy. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in John Herschel's letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a <b>natural</b> <b>cause</b> of the origin of new species.|$|E

Over {{the next twenty}} years, Sultan Ali's claims {{to the office of}} Sultan of Johor were only {{recognised}} by some merchants and a few Malays. Like his father, Sultan Ali's was much of a puppet monarch and played a minimal role in the administrative affairs of the state, which came under the charge of the Temenggong and the British. In 1855, Sultan Ali ceded the sovereignty rights of Johor (except Kesang in Muar) to Temenggong Daing Ibrahim, in exchange for a formal recognition as the [...] "Sultan of Johor" [...] by the British and a monthly allowance. Following the secession of Johor, Sultan Ali was granted administrative charge over Muar until his death in 1877, and in most administrative matters, was often styled as the [...] "Sultan of Muar".|$|E

2500|$|The {{move towards}} a {{rational}} understanding of nature began {{at least since}} the Archaic period in Greece (650–480 BCE) with the Pre-Socratic philosophers. [...] The philosopher Thales of Miletus (7th and 6th centuries BCE), dubbed [...] "the Father of Science" [...] for refusing to accept various supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural phenomena, proclaimed that every event had a <b>natural</b> <b>cause.</b> Thales also made advancements in 580 BCE by suggesting that water is the basic element, experimenting with the attraction between magnets and rubbed amber and formulating the first recorded cosmologies. Anaximander, famous for his proto-evolutionary theory, disputed the Thales' ideas and proposed that rather than water, a substance called apeiron was the building block of all matter. Around 500 BCE, Heraclitus proposed that the only basic law governing the Universe was the principle of change and that nothing remains in the same state indefinitely. This observation {{made him one of the}} first scholars in ancient physics to address the role of time in the universe, a key and sometimes contentious concept in modern and present-day physics. The early physicist Leucippus (fl. first half of the 5th century BCE) adamantly opposed the idea of direct divine intervention in the universe, proposing instead that natural phenomena had a <b>natural</b> <b>cause.</b> Leucippus and his student Democritus were the first to develop the theory of atomism, the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday, March 6, 2014 it was {{announced}} that a Vatican panel of medical experts could not determine a <b>natural</b> <b>cause</b> to a miracle attributed to Sheen; this is a major step on the road to beatification. [...] The miracle: the reviving of the stillborn baby mentioned above who survived intact, so far, without having a detectable pulse at his birth for a lengthy period without explanation. For 61 minutes, while his mother prayed for Fulton Sheen's intercession, the child did not breathe and only took his first breaths as doctors were calling his time of death. Doctors predicted the child to grow up with terrifying effects like organ failure and cerebral palsy. After the child's first 5 months, he was considered to be a normally healthy child. The case will now go on to the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, for further review. [...] If the Congregation approves the miracle, then the cause will be passed on to Pope Francis, who will ultimately decide and sign and publish documentation on whether or not to beatify Archbishop Sheen, granting him the title of [...] "Blessed".|$|E
2500|$|Medicine {{provides}} {{another example}} of practically oriented investigation of nature among the Ancient Greeks. [...] It has been pointed out that Greek medicine was not the province of a single trained profession {{and there was no}} accepted method of qualification of licensing. [...] Physicians in the Hippocratic tradition, temple healers associated with the cult of Asclepius, herb collectors, drug sellers, midwives, and gymnastic trainers all claimed to be qualified as healers in specific contexts and competed actively for patients. [...] This rivalry among these competing traditions contributed to an active public debate about the causes and proper treatment of disease, and about the general methodological approaches of their rivals. [...] In the Hippocratic text, On the Sacred Disease, which deals with the nature of epilepsy, the author attacks his rivals (temple healers) for their ignorance and for their love of gain. [...] The author of this text seems modern and progressive when he insists that epilepsy has a <b>natural</b> <b>cause,</b> yet when he comes to explain what that cause is and what the proper treatment would be, his explanation is as short on specific evidence and his treatment as vague as that of his rivals.|$|E

2500|$|Radio {{technology}} {{and the ability to}} construct a radio telescope are presumed to be a natural advance for technological species, theoretically creating effects that might be detected over interstellar distances. The careful searching for non-natural radio emissions from space may lead to the detection of alien civilizations. Sensitive alien observers of the Solar System, for example, would note unusually intense radio waves for a G2 star due to Earth's television and telecommunication broadcasts. In the absence of an apparent <b>natural</b> <b>cause,</b> alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. It should be noted however that the most sensitive radio telescopes currently available on Earth {{would not be able to}} detect non-directional radio signals even at a fraction of a light-year, so it is questionable whether any such signals could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization. [...] Such signals could be either [...] "accidental" [...] by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the Arecibo message. A number of astronomers and observatories have attempted and are attempting to detect such evidence, mostly through the SETI organization. Several decades of SETI analysis have not revealed any unusually bright or meaningfully repetitive radio emissions.|$|E
