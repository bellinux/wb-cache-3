40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new, {{hierarchical}} metadata {{model for the}} description of digital images. It suggests developing an SGML-encoded bibliographic record that encapsulates both summary bibliographic information along with detailed hierarchical and version-related data. The record would also include links to the actual digital items, to other related bibliographic records or, in fact, to diverse, related digital objects (such as external electronic publications, databases, <b>numeric</b> <b>files,</b> etc.) The working designation SGML Catalog Record (SCR) is proposed for this new type of record...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{libraries}} {{have been}} the depositories and public access points to both domestic and international government information. A change in the information seeking behavior of the public is driving a change in government information publishing and dissemination. Patrons who traditionally used libraries for access to printed government information have become familiar and comfortable with the electronic environment. These data users are showing an increased interest in certain types of government information in electronic format, including indexes, <b>numeric</b> <b>files,</b> statistics, and hypertext documents. Government response to increased demand for electronic information {{has led to a}} flurry of special initiatives, with the production of information products on diskette, CD-ROM, and dissemination via the Internet. Libraries, and acquisitions units in particular, are being challenged to provide consistent and timely management of the information. The rapidly developing communications infrastructure, which frequently redesigns access to the information environment, poses significant obstacles to, and the tremendous opportunities for, making large bodies of government information available to a broad base of users...|$|R
50|$|Koerner Library, {{designed}} by Arthur Erickson, {{was built in}} 1997, replacing Sedgewick Library. Koerner houses humanities and social sciences, government publications, journals and microforms, and <b>numeric</b> data <b>files,</b> the Map & Atlas Collection, and the UBC Research Commons. It is home to nearly 1.3 million items. Its postmodern architecture contrasts with the Gothic revival design of the original Main Library (now the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre) {{on the other side}} of Main Mall. Koerner is also home to the University's Interlibrary loan program.|$|R

5000|$|Human-friendly forum URLs do {{not have}} a query string and instead contain only the path of the topic. A user-unfriendly URL may contain cryptic parameters, <b>numeric</b> IDs, or <b>file</b> type {{extensions}} (e.g[...]php) that do not matter to the user and could change if the forum is reimplemented using a different programming language. User-friendly URLs are easy to remember and to type, and may enhance search engine optimization (SEO).|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} ESA (for Emacs-Style Application), {{a library}} for writing applications with an Emacs look-and-feel within the Common Lisp Interface Manager. The ESA library {{takes advantage of}} the layered design of CLIM to provide a command loop that uses Emacs-style multi-keystroke command invocation. ESA supplies other functionality for writing such applications such as a minibuffer for invoking extended commands and for supplying command arguments, Emacs-style keyboard macros and <b>numeric</b> arguments, <b>file</b> and buffer management, and more. ESA is currently used in two major CLIM applications: the Climacs text editor (and the Drei text gadget integrated with the McCLIM implementation), and the Gsharp score editor. This paper describes the features provided by ESA, gives some detail about their implementation, and suggests avenues for further work...|$|R
40|$|As more {{files are}} stored on today's computers, {{understanding}} file activity patterns becomes crucial for developing systems to either compress rarely used data, or store it on tertiary storage {{devices such as}} tapes and optical disks. In this paper we compare and contrast long-term file system activity between different types of computing environments. We examine three different Unix file system environments [...] - administrative, general-purpose, and that of two computer science departments [...] - for periods of 150 to 280 days. This paper focuses on basic and long-term file system activity, on finding common long-term file inter-reference patterns for both file accesses and file modifications, and on comparing the hierarchical name space view (using path and filenames to determine a file's uniqueness) and the numeric index view (using the operating system's unique index numbers). For example, we find that <b>numeric</b> index <b>files</b> have more deletions than their hierarchical counterparts; [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) {{contains}} the evaluated nuclear properties of all known nuclides. These properties are derived both from nuclear reaction and radioactive decay measurements. All experimental data are evaluated {{to create the}} adopted properties for each nuclide. ENSDF, together with other <b>numeric</b> and biographic <b>files,</b> can be accessed on-line through the INTERNET or modem. Some of the databases are also available on the World Wide Web. The structure and the scope of ENSDF are presented along with the on-line access system of the National Nuclear Data Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory...|$|R
40|$|SAS ® programmers {{work with}} many files of {{different}} file types (e. g. SAS data sets, Excel®, SAS programs, log and lst, Html, PDF). Many popular search tools {{used to help}} manage all these files will be discussed, along with a comparison of their features. Some of the features include scanning multiple files and multiple directories, and displaying {{a preview of the}} matching text within each file. The strengths and weaknesses of each search tool will be reviewed. The best way to conduct some common searches for text phrases and <b>numeric</b> data in <b>files</b> of different file types will be presented. Which search tool is best suited to handle each file type? Is there a search tool that can do it all...|$|R
