They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> spectra dominated by water absorption bands.

Pan-Sharpening techniques concur to go beyond this limit and obtain coloured images that have the same pixel dimensions which characterize panchromatic data. In this paper Pan-Sharpening techniques based on HIS (Intensity, Hue, Saturation) model are considered in relation to their application to IKONOS images.

40|$|We {{review the}} concept of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and present new results on the <b>near</b> [...] <b>infrared</b> FP. We show that the K [...] band FP differs both from the optical form and the virial {{expectation}} under the assumption of constant (M=L) and homology. Systematic variations of only the stellar populations parameters (age, metallicity, IMF) cannot reproduce the slopes of the FP simultaneously at both the optical and <b>near</b> [...] <b>infrared</b> wavelengths. There appears to be an additional effect which could be due to a systematic departure of the velocity distributions of elliptical galaxies from a homologous family. In order to distinguish between the different possible stellar populations parameters, the FP and its projections can be observed at a range of redshifts.

The potential of such a simultaneous optical analysis for determining the localization of the nanoparticles in glasses of any nature is underlined.
