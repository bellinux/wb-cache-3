5|$|Tute {{originated}} in Italy. The game {{belongs to the}} same family as Brisca and has similar rules in gameplay and final count of points. The <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> originated from the Italian word Tutti (all), the declaration that a player announces when holding the four kings. The game spread to Spain during the 19th century, brought back by Spanish troops who returned from missions in Italy. As {{the popularity of the}} game increased, its name was modified over time by Spanish speakers, who started calling the game Tute. The game {{became one of the most}} popular in Spain, leading to the later appearance of regional variations of the game.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon was {{originally}} intended to be an expansion pack to Worms 2, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It {{was intended to be}} the last game of the Worms franchise, but Andy Davidson, the creator of Worms, felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of Worms World Party. It was also going to be released under the name Wormageddon, but Team17 changed the name to Worms Armageddon because of close similarities to the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> Carmageddon. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and on 31 May 1999 in North America and has since been ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation on 30 November 1999, Game Boy Color on 19 January 2000, and Nintendo 64 on 30 March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version {{is one of the first}} Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. Worms Armageddon was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game's lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game's lead artist.|$|E

Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game; Riven had a budget of between US$5and $10million, more than ten times the cost of developing Myst.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of Grabbed by the Ghoulies began {{after the release}} of Conker's Bad Fur Day.

Before any details of the game were publicised, it was rumoured that Grabbed by the Ghoulies would be the subtitle to the next Conker the Squirrel game.

The result was more of a joke than a game, and the initial content including classes and even the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> were stream of consciousness. [...] The game was released in early 2003, and Johnson soon invited his childhood friend Josh Nite to contribute content as a writer and designer. [...] Within a year, 300,000 player accounts had been created, far exceeding Johnson and Nite's expectations; Johnson has referred to the game's success as [...] "a never ending series of astonishments".

500|$|The term tafl (Old Norse: [...] "table", [...] "board"; [...] ) is the {{original}} <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> However, Hnefatafl became the preferred term for the game in Scandinavia {{by the end of}} the Viking Age, to distinguish it from other board games, such as Skáktafl (chess), Kvatrutafl (Tables) and Halatafl (Fox games), as these became known. The specific name Hnefatafl possibly arose as meaning [...] "board game of the fist", from hnefi ("fist") + tafl, where [...] "fist" [...] referred to the central king-piece. The precise etymology is disputed, but hnefi certainly referred to the king-piece, and several sources refer to Hnefatafl as [...] "King's table". In Anglo-Saxon England, the term tæfl also referred to many board games. It is not known if the Anglo-Saxons had a specific name for the game or if they generically referred to it as [...] "tæfl" [...] in the way that modern people might refer to [...] "cards".|$|E
500|$|Metroid was {{designed}} to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of Super Mario Bros. with the non-linear exploration of The Legend of Zelda and a distinctly darker aesthetic. The <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is a portmanteau of the words [...] "metro" [...] (as in rapid transit) and android, and was meant to allude to the mainly underground setting of the first game as well as its robot-like protagonist. Halfway through development of the original Metroid, one of the staff said to his fellow developers [...] "Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?", and the idea was accepted. Ridley Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a [...] "huge influence" [...] after the world of the first Metroid had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, and found his creations to be fitting for the Metroid universe. In recognition of this, a character was given the name Ridley, after director Scott.|$|E

500|$|Asteroids was {{conceived}} by Lyle Rains and programmed by Ed Logg with collaborations from other Atari staff. Logg {{was impressed with}} the Atari 2600 (then known as [...] "Atari Video Computer System") and joined Atari's coin-op division and worked on Dirt Bike, which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test. He developed Super Breakout after hearing that Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, wanted Breakout updated. Paul Mancuso joined the development team as Asteroids technician and engineer Howard Delman contributed to the hardware. During a meeting in April 1979, Rains discussed Planet Grab, a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to Cosmos. Logg did not know the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> thinking Computer Space as [...] "the inspiration for the two-dimensional approach". Rains conceived of Asteroids as a mixture of Computer Space and Space Invaders, combining the two-dimensional approach of Computer Space with Space Invaders addictive gameplay of [...] "completion" [...] and [...] "eliminate all threats". The unfinished game featured a giant, indestructible asteroid, so Rains asked Logg: [...] "Well, why don’t we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up?" [...] In response, Logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces. Both agreed on the concept.|$|E
500|$|Raised {{to acting}} group captain on 24July 1945, Rawlinson {{remained}} {{in command of}} No.78 Wing until his RAAF commission was terminated on 19December 1946.

On 21March 1947, Rawlinson was granted a commission in the RAF as a substantive squadron leader (seniority from 1June 1944) and temporary wing commander (seniority from 1August 1943 until 1November 1947). His initial posting in Britain was at Headquarters Fighter Command (HQFC). [...] Between June and October 1949 he was commanding officer of No.54 Squadron, which operated deHavilland Vampire jet fighters at RAF Odiham in Hampshire. He then served as wing commander (flying) for the Odiham Wing, comprising three Vampire squadrons including No.54, until May 1952. Recalling training for Cold War operations, he said: [...] "The introduction of jet fighters meant, roughly, that speeds were doubled and endurances halved. Precision was the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> ... The aim was to achieve, as close as possible, the maximum effort with day operations in all-weather conditions against the nuclear threat..." [...] Reduced flying hours owing to [...] "budgetary limitations" [...] meant that [...] "as much as possible of the HQFC syllabus was crammed into each sortie".|$|E
500|$|Around 1971, DEC {{employee}} David H. Ahl {{had written}} a version of The Sumer Game in the BASIC programming language. Unlike FOCAL, BASIC was run not just on mainframe computers and minicomputers, but also on personal computers, then termed microcomputers, making it a much more popular language. In 1973, Ahl published BASIC Computer Games, a best-selling book of games written in BASIC, which included his version of The Sumer Game. The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi and added an end-of-game performance appraisal. The popularity of both {{the book and the}} programming language itself meant that Ahl's version of the game became the more widely known version over the relatively obscure original, as evidenced by the 1973 French FOCAL version considering [...] "Hamurabi" [...] to be the more prominent name. BASIC Computer Games noted that the game was a modification of a game [...] "written in FOCAL at DEC", but listed the author as [...] "unknown." [...] The 1978 edition of the book, which was the first million-selling computer book, noted that the game's name was intended to be [...] "Hammurabi", the correct spelling of the Babylonian king, but not only was one [...] "m" [...] dropped in the file name to fit in an eight-character limit, but Ahl consistently misspelled the name inside of the game, leading to the generally accepted <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> to be Hamurabi.|$|E
