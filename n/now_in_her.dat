25|$|<b>Now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> forties, Crosman was {{starting}} {{to move away from}} the strenuous sword-carrying, heavy costume adventures that she was popular in. Much of the remainder of her theatrical career would consist of drawing room comedies and farces, a type of playing that was less hectic for an ageing actress. However, she would return to revivals of Shakespeare, i.e. The Merry Wives of Windsor, and in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Rivals.|$|E

25|$|During {{the attack}} on Themyscira, the witch Circe showed her true colors and teleported the island into a {{dimension}} of demons in order for both tribes to be destroyed. The two tribes put aside their rivalry temporarily and fought the demons {{in order to ensure}} the Amazon survival. Though only a few months passed in the real world, the time the Amazons spent in the demon dimension lasted ten years. Discovering that Circe had made her island home disappear, Wonder Woman forced her to return it to its rightful place. Once this was done Wonder Woman learned about the invasion, the demon war, and the Amazon truce. She eventually met Artemis who was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mid-20s. The two got off to a rocky start but Diana could see that Artemis' heart was true.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of her {{experiences}} in Jamaica, Russia, Iran, China, Burma and India, and her family's friendship with people such as the Nehrus, Peggy, who was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mid-twenties, knew many people from many countries and also knew much more about life outside England, indeed outside Europe, than most of her contemporaries. This experience, along with her deep Christian commitments, led her to work for co-operation among peoples; and in the late 1940s she started to work for an organisation called Racial Unity, which had been started by Miss Attlee, sister of the Prime Minister, as well as becoming active in the Youth Department of the World Council of Churches (WCC). It was through her work for Racial Unity, of which she was secretary in 1952, that she first met Joseph Emmanuel Appiah, who was President of the West African Students' Union. Their friendship grew fast and in January 1952, he proposed and she accepted.|$|E

500|$|Margaret Luttrell's {{father died}} in 1737, when she was eleven, and she {{inherited}} the position. Her father left debts due to his lifestyle and also provisions in his parents' wills that forced him to support his niece, Anne Luttrell, a daughter of Francis, his brother. [...] This situation caused the family seat at Dunster Castle, to be closed and valued, {{while much of the}} family silver <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> possession was sold off, in some cases to relatives. Margaret Luttrell went to live with her mother's new husband, Edward Dyke of Tetton, a wealthy landowner. While there, she married Fownes, who was then a resident of Nethway, Devon.|$|E

Lutz (John Lutz)that Liz is looking for someone to get her pregnant. Later that day, Liz sees Cerie in the makeup department getting herself made up. Anna (Bridget Moloney), the makeup artist has her baby at work with her. She asks Liz to hold the baby for a while, so Liz takes the baby for a stroll around the 30 Rock building. Suddenly she realizes that she is no longer in the building, but is <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> apartment. She hurries back to the office with the baby, and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) fixes the situation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Mazo and Caroline {{moved with}} Mazo's parents to Acton, Ontario {{to operate a}} hotel. [...] A few years later in 1911, by <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> early thirties, Mazo moved with Caroline and the Roches to Sovereign House in Bronte, Ontario, to try life as farm owners.

2500|$|Eventually, Compassion's implant, {{linked to}} the Doctor's TARDIS to prevent her being {{influenced}} by random local signals, triggered her unexpected mutation into a sentient Type 102 TARDIS, specifically the [...] "mother" [...] of the TARDISes {{that would be used}} in the pending War. With this knowledge, The Time Lords – led by Romana, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> third incarnation – attempted to capture Compassion, for use as breeding stock in preparation for the War. In response, and in light of the apparent destruction of his old TARDIS in a dimensional rift, the Doctor and Fitz retreated into Compassion (The Shadows of Avalon).|$|E
2500|$|The {{successor}} of Theuderic II was his bastard son Sigebert, a child. [...] The {{mayor of}} the palace of Austrasia, Warnachar, fearing that at his young age he would fall {{under the influence of}} his great-grandmother, brought him before a national assembly, where he was proclaimed king by the nobles, who then did homage to him ruling over both his father's kingdoms. Nonetheless, he could not be kept out of the influence of Brunhilda. Thus, for the last time in a long life (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> seventies), she was regent of the Franks, this time for her own great-grandson.|$|E
2500|$|Fairy Rebecca awakens Foggerty, and {{he finds}} himself in a {{different}} drawing room. As {{a consequence of the}} obliteration of Spiff, Rebecca has never met Foggerty before.

2500|$|The Choctaw, who for 150 {{years had}} been neither white nor black, were [...] "left where they had always been"—in poverty. Donna Ladd wrote that a Choctaw, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 40s, remembers [...] "as a little girl, she thought that a 'white only' sign in a local store meant she could only order white, or vanilla, ice cream. It was a small story, but one that shows how a third race can easily get {{left out of the}} {{attempts}} for understanding." [...] The end of legalized racial segregation permitted the Choctaw to participate in public institutions and facilities that had been reserved exclusively for white patrons.|$|E
2500|$|The Choctaws {{witnessed}} the social forces that brought Freedom Summer and its after effects to their ancient homeland. The Civil Rights Movement produced significant social {{change for the}} Choctaw in Mississippi, as their civil rights were enhanced. Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most jobs were given to whites, then blacks. Donna Ladd wrote that a Choctaw, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 40s, remembers [...] "as a little girl, she thought that a 'white only' sign in a local store meant she could only order white, or vanilla, ice cream.

2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review, [...] "The moral of tonight’s Once Upon A Time might be, “Don’t play with fire.” Or perhaps it’s, “Don’t trust {{the man behind the}} curtain.” In any case, Excalibur lives! And unfortunately, so does Dark One Emma — now even more powerful and ruthless than before. For {{the first time since the}} beginning of the season, we barely spent any time in present-day Storybrooke, save for the first and last few moments of the episode. With two halves of the sword <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> possession, Emma can only see power. But Dark One Rumple claims it represents more than that — like any fairytale, it represents history. And it’s time for Excalibur’s promise, given years ago, to be fulfilled." ...|$|E
60|$|And Mary, on her side, {{varied between}} assurances that Charles {{did not mean}} it, {{and that he was}} quite right--the sister <b>now</b> predominating <b>in</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>now</b> the wife.|$|R
