25|$|The term throughput, {{essentially}} {{the same thing as}} digital bandwidth consumption, denotes the achieved average useful bit rate in a computer network over a logical or physical communication link or through a network node, typically measured at a reference point above the datalink layer. This implies that the throughput often excludes data link layer protocol overhead. The throughput is affected by the traffic load from the data source in question, as well as from other sources sharing the same network resources.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of multicast/broadcast {{throughput}} in multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks that suffer from the resource constraints. We provide a formulation to capture the utilization of the network resources and derive analytical relationships for the <b>network’s</b> <b>throughput</b> in terms of the node utilization, the channel utilization, and the number of transmissions. Our model relies on the on-demand quality of service multicast/broadcast sessions, where each admitted session creates a unique tree with a specific bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} <b>networks,</b> <b>throughput</b> optimization is {{an essential}} performance objective that cannot be adequately characterized by a single criterion (such as the minimum transmitted or sum-delivered throughput) and should be specified over all source–destination pairs as a rate region. For a simple and yet fundamental model of tandem networks, a cross-layer optimization framework is formulated to derive the maximum throughput region for saturated multicast traffic. The contents of network flows are specified through network coding (or plain routing) in network layer and the throughput rates are jointly optimized in medium access control layer over fixed set of conflict-free transmission schedules (or optimized over transmission probabilities in random access). If the network model incorporates bursty sources and allows packet queues to empty, {{the objective is to}} specify the stability region as the set of maximum throughput rates that can be sustained with finite packet delay. Dynamic queue management strategies are used to expand the stability region toward the maximum <b>throughput</b> region. <b>Network</b> coding improves <b>throughput</b> rates over plain routing and achieves the largest gains for broadcast communication and intermediate <b>network</b> sizes. <b>Throughput</b> optimization imposes fundamental tradeoffs with transmission and processing energy costs such that the throughput-optimal operation is not necessarily energy efficient.

30|$|Traffic in {{a single}} {{intersection}} is usually modeled as a microscopic level. It considers the dynamic of vehicles rather than an intersection, which means the traffic flow of a single intersection, will have no influence to the others. On the other hand, a normal traffic in the real-world environment is generally represented by the network of multiple intersections, which traffic characteristic can be expressed by the macroscopic traffic. To manage traffics, the flow of each connected intersection will {{be taken into account}} to maximize the <b>networks</b> <b>throughput.</b>|$|R
