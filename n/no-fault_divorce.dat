In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform.

He states that <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> has left fathers with no protection against what he describes as the confiscation of their children.|$|E
5000|$|Fault divorces are {{becoming}} less common today because almost every state now recognizes <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorces.</b> [...] <b>No-fault</b> <b>divorces</b> {{are more common}} since no proof of fault is required. They are not as costly, can be completed faster, and can be less stressful on the family members. However, fault divorces are advantageous if a quick divorce is desirable. This type of divorce is granted quickly without the waiting period of <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorces</b> where parties are ordered to live apart for a specific amount {{of time before the}} divorce is finalized. Another benefit of a fault divorce is the monetary gain. Proof of the accused partyâ€™s wrongdoing may result in the court granting the filing spouse a larger portion of the marital property or increased support and alimony. However, fault divorces are considerably more expensive to obtain than <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorces.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The United States {{allows a}} person to end a {{marriage}} by filing for a divorce {{on the grounds of}} either fault or no fault. In the past, most states only granted divorces on fault grounds, but today all states have adopted a form of no fault <b>divorce.</b> Fault and <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorces</b> each require that specific grounds be met. [...] A no fault divorce can be granted on grounds such as irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, irreconcilable differences, incompatibility, or after a period of separation, depending on the state. Neither party is held responsible for the failure of the marriage. On the other hand, in fault divorces one party is asking for a divorce because they claim the other party did something wrong that justifies ending the marriage. Several grounds for fault divorce include adultery, cruelty, abandonment, mental illness, and criminal conviction.There are, however, additional grounds that are acceptable in some states such as drug abuse, impotency, and religious reasons.|$|R

50|$|In more {{established}} countries, a frequent issue of family law relates to what situations occur to create cause for fault-based and non-fault-based grounds for divorce.

Members of the fathers' rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child's protection against unfit or violent parents.|$|R
25|$|Historically, many {{cultures}} have considered adultery to {{be a very}} serious crime. Adultery often incurred severe punishment, usually for the woman and sometimes for the man, with penalties including capital punishment, mutilation, or torture. Such punishments have gradually fallen into disfavor, especially in Western countries from the 19th century. In most Western countries, adultery itself is no longer a criminal offense, but may still have legal consequences, particularly in divorce cases. For example, in fault-based family law jurisdictions, adultery almost always constitutes a ground for divorce and may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. Adultery is not a ground for divorce in jurisdictions which have adopted a <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> model. In some societies and among certain religious adherents, adultery may affect the social status of those involved, and may result in social ostracism.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} laws {{establishing}} <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> {{did not stop}} at removing the requirement that grounds be cited for a divorce, so as to allow for divorce by [...] "mutual consent"; it also allows either spouse to end the marriage without any agreement or fault by the other. Phyllis Schlafly states that <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> should {{be referred to as}} unilateral divorce.|$|E
2500|$|Divorce is the {{province}} of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had {{to prove that the}} other spouse was at fault, for instance for being guilty of adultery, abandonment, or cruelty; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture [...] "uncontested" [...] divorces. The <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> revolution began in 1969 in California and ended with New York. <b>No-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> (on the grounds of [...] "irreconcilable differences", [...] "irretrievable breakdown of marriage", [...] "incompatibility", or after a separation period etc.) is now available in all states.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a model in which agents choose voice, exit, or stay options when their marital {{condition}} becomes bad. The "voice" option {{can be interpreted as}} a spouse's effort or "investment" in the household to resolve his/her dissatisfaction and improve the marital condition. If a spouse hopes to divorce, he/she chooses the "exit" option. If a spouse does not hope to express his/her opinion and divorce, he/she chooses the "stay" option. We focus on the role of "exit" and "voice" in a marriage and investigate the effects of a divorce law that is based on fault or <b>no-fault</b> on <b>divorce</b> rates. Our study shows that divorce rates tend to be too high under a unilateral divorce law in the non-transferable utility case. On the other hand, mutual-consent divorce law generates multiple equilibria, and divorce rates are then inefficient even in the transferable utility case. In this multiple equilibrium case, divorce rates are determined by social factors, such as culture, norm, and religion. Exit; Voice; Divorce law...|$|R

40|$|Application of the Coase Theorem to marital {{bargaining}} {{suggests that}} shifting from a consent <b>divorce</b> regime to <b>no-fault</b> unilateral <b>divorce</b> laws should not affect divorce rates. Each iteration of the empirical literature examining {{the evolution of}} divorce rates across US states has yielded different conclusions {{about the effects of}} divorce law liberalization. I show that these results reflect a failure to jointly consider both the political endogeneity of these divorce laws and the dynamic response of divorce rates to a shock to the political regime. Taking explicit account of the dynamic response of divorce rates to the policy shock, I find that liberalized divorce laws caused a discernible rise in divorce rates for about a decade, but that this increase was substantially reversed over the next decade. That said, this increase explains very little of the rise in the divorce rate over the past half century. Both administrative data on the flow of new divorces, and measures of the stock of divorcees from the census support this conclusion. These results are suggestive of spouses bargaining within marriage, with an eye to their partnerâ€™s divorce threat. Contact...|$|R
2500|$|Baskerville {{states that}} fault has entered {{through the back}} door in the form of child custody hearings, and that the {{forcibly}} divorced spouse ("defendant") is presumed guilty. Similarly, other members of the fathers' rights movement believe that men fail to get appropriate recognition of their innocence as a result of <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce.</b> Baskerville describes a proposed amendment of <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> laws that would create a rebuttable presumption that custody of any minor children be awarded to the respondent [...] regardless of gender. He also notes the predictions of Tim O'Brien, the author of the proposed amendment, who states that the proposed amendment would result in a plummeting divorce rate and reduced negative consequences for children.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of divorce law reform on fertility. By modifying the value of marriage, the {{adoption}} of <b>no-fault</b> and unilateral <b>divorce</b> may impact fertility decisions. To identify the effects of those reforms on fertility, we use a quasi experiment exploiting the legislative history of divorce liberalization across Europe. Results suggest that divorce law reforms have a negative and permanent effect on fertility. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for unobserved country-specific factors, time-varying factors at the country level, the liberalization of abortion, {{and the availability of}} the birth-control pill. Supplemental analysis, developed to understand the mechanisms through which divorce law reforms affect fertility, shows that both marital and out-of-wedlock fertility declines, but that the impact on marital fertility varies depending on whether couples are married prior to or after divorce law reform. ...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{research}} has linked variation in legal regimes to outcomes related to couple formation, dissolution, and fertility. The focus {{of much of}} that U.S.-based {{research has}} been on the effect of <b>no-fault</b> or unilateral <b>divorce</b> on divorce rates (e.g. Peters [1986], Friedberg [1998], and Wolfers [2006]), marriage rates (e.g. Alesina A and Guiliano P 2007, Divorce, Fertility and the Value of Marriage, Harvard Institue of Economics Research Discussion Paper No 2136, April, unpublished manuscript, Rasul [2006]), and couplesâ€™ investments in marriage-specific capital such as spouseâ€™s education and children (Stevenson [2007]). Halla ([2013]) showed that the introduction of joint custody increased marriage rates, overall fertility (including a shift from non-marital to marital fertility), and divorce rates for older couples. Leturcq ([2011]) has studied how the introduction of PACS (civil unions) in France in 1999 has affected marriage, and Guttierez and Becerra ([2012]) studied its effect on fertility. Variations in laws regulating division of property in the case of dissolution have helped explain the likelihood that women are out-of-couple when they give birth (Ekert-Jaffe and Grossbard [2008]). However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, ours is the first study examining the effect of CLM laws on couple formation. Elsewhere (Grossbard S, Vernon V (forthcoming) Common law marriage, labor supply and time use: a partial explanation for gender convergence in labor supply.

40|$|The formal written laws in Samoa {{include a}} number of statues {{relating}} to family law, including the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance 1961 and the Maintenance and Affiliation Act 1967. In 2010, both these Acts were amended. The amendments to the divorce legislation made Samoa {{one of the only}} two small Pacific island nations to have introduced a purely <b>no-fault</b> system of <b>divorce,</b> the other being Fiji. Neighbouring countries have either fault-based systems or 2 Ì† 7 mixed 2 Ì† 7 systems, where divorce may be fault-based or based o a no-fault ground. The amendments also introduce a much needed reform which allows the courts to alter property rights. Formerly, the courts had been faced with a choice of denying a remedy to a party whose name was not on the title, or using elaborate devices to supplement the existing law. The changes to the law on maintenance and affiliation give new powers to the District Court to make custody orders and set out guidelines on the amount and payment of maintenance. The court may also require financial information, the execution of necessary instruments to secure payment, and the provision of security for the obedience of a maintenance order The court may also order parties to undergo mediation.

2500|$|In {{the early}} Soviet Union the Communist Party {{abolished}} all oppressive Czarist laws in 1917 related to sexuality.

[...] It also provided for <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> and legalized abortion. However, outside the Russian SSR and Ukrainian SSR, homosexuality remained a criminal offense in certain Soviet republics in the 1920s (particularly the Muslim dominated Soviet Republics in Central Asia) and Soviet policy was often inconsistent in terms of pursuing homosexual rights and wider legal/social equality for homosexual people. Official Soviet policy on homosexuality in the 1920s also fluctuated: between legal and social tolerance of homosexuals and homosexuality to state attempts to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Nevada's early {{reputation}} as a [...] "divorce haven" [...] arose from the fact that, before the <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> revolution in the 1970s, divorces were difficult to obtain in the United States. Already having legalized gambling and prostitution, Nevada continued the trend of boosting its profile by adopting {{one of the most}} liberal divorce statutes in the nation. This resulted in Williams v. North Carolina (1942), , in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled North Carolina had to give [...] "full faith and credit" [...] to a Nevada divorce.

2500|$|In 1977, {{the divorce}} law in West Germany {{underwent}} major changes, {{moving from a}} fault based divorce system to one that is primarily no fault. These new divorce regulations, which remain in force today throughout Germany, stipulate that a <b>no-fault</b> <b>divorce</b> can be obtained {{on the grounds of}} one year of de facto separation if both spouses consent, and three years of de facto separation if only one spouse consents. There is also provision for a [...] "speedy divorce" [...] which can be obtained on demand by either spouse, without the necessary separation period, if it is proved in court that the continuation of the marriage would constitute an unreasonable hardship for the petitioner for reasons related to the behavior of the other spouse; this exemption requires exceptional circumstances and is considered on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
40|$|Deborah Rhode {{writes that}} while {{adultery}} is admittedly not good, {{it should not}} be criminal. She argues that it should not generate a tort action either, because the original purposes for which the torts of alienation of affections and criminal conversation come from a time with quite different views about marriage and gender, while <b>no-fault</b> and speedy <b>divorce</b> today give adequate remedies to the wronged spouse. Further, adultery should not affect employment (as a politician or in the military) unless it directly impacts job performance. My own reluctance to disengage adultery and law stems from the seriousness of adultery. First, the destruction of trust that adultery both signals and produces does considerable damage. Second, though she certainly notes that the injured spouse has a beef against the adulterous one, and does briefly consider the harms done to children under various adultery scenarios, Rhode underplays the direct (through their own tendencies to trust or to be faithful as adults) and indirect (through the likely divorce to follow and its particular nastiness) damage done to the children of adulterous marriages. The review includes correlation analysis from documents filed in divorces with children from two counties in Arizona and five in Indiana that began in the months of January, April and September, 2008. These allow adultery to be inferred from the pleadings relating to the custody and child support. More commonly, however, the child support worksheet indicated that a child with a birth date during the marriage was not owed support by both parents. Despite any lack of legal consequences in these divorces, the analysis shows that adultery cases are particularly costly in terms of increased litigation, especially custody litigation, and are at least associated with pre-divorce allegations of domestic violence in both states and post-decree allegations of domestic violence in Indiana. The review continues with suggestions that for childless couples, the status quo be maintained, leaving adultery to be the subject either of societal disapproval or criminal law, whatever the state has chosen. However, because of the serious consequences for children, sums payable to them may provide a form of restitution...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{haunting}} claims of each poor, unmarried mother in Edin and Kefalas 2 Ì† 7 Promises I Can Keep {{is that at}} least she can guarantee she will love her child, even though she cannot promise to make a lifelong commitment to a mate. That love, each young mother says, will be a sustaining gift both to her and the child. Similarly, in work done by sociologists McLanahan and Garfinkel to counteract the claim {{that it was not}} single parenting that made children 2 Ì† 7 s prospects dim, but poverty, sociologists have found that many of the bad effects of single parenting go away when wealth is taken into account. So, is love the answer here, or is it wealth? Does a legal marriage (let alone a two-tiered marriage) even matter, at least insofar as children 2 Ì† 7 s welfare is concerned? My recent empirical work with sociologist Steven Nock indicates that in fact love, measured in terms of parental warmth, is important to children 2 Ì† 7 s psychological well-being. We are using the Child Development Survey portion of the PSID (from the University of Michigan), which contains nearly 2700 children in a nationally representative sample. Love continues to remain important both in terms of impact and statistically though other variables are added. Wealth, measured in terms of total family wealth divided by the census needs standard for a family of that size, initially seems important to child wellbeing (on measures of depression, acting out, self-esteem and self-efficacy). However, unlike love, wealth 2 Ì† 7 s significance entirely disappears once family structure and particularly legal status like marriage and adoption comes into play. 2 Ì† 7 Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all., wrote Tennyson, and, we find, better to have married even if the marriage does not work out than never to have married. Children do better if they are in two parent, married homes, but are worse off in homes where their mothers never married even than in cases where the mother married, divorced, remarried and was widowed. Similarly, children do better where their fathers are living in the home, but less well with stepparents unless the stepparents adopt them. Children who live with relatives (let alone foster parents) do less well than those who are adopted by third parties. These rather dramatic findings suggest that law and public policy (as an instrument of law) should encourage and support marriage, particularly marriages that last. (They also suggest supporting adoption rather than foster care, though that is not the subject of this conference.) Law can do this in part merely by leaving well enough alone - by NOT adopting domestic partnership laws that equate unmarried, cohabiting couples with those that are married, and by NOT getting rid of special privileges enjoyed by the married when academics clamor that such benefits are not fair. Law ought also to make pre-marriage counseling and skills building more attractive and affordable, as some states have done through lower license costs, and some sort of real counseling effort requisite to divorces on non-fault grounds, as the covenant marriage movement suggests. Laws can be written to require mutual consent for divorce, or to become two-tier on the birth of children, so that the waiting period for <b>no-fault</b> separation and <b>divorce</b> lengthens.
