40|$|Air-fed {{blasting}} helmets {{are used}} in abrasive blasting operations to provide essential face, eye and respiratory protection. BS EN 271 : 1995 (equivalent to the European Standard EN 271 : 1997), the standard that deals {{with the construction of}} blasting helmets, addresses the above matters and also the problem of noise generated by the breathing air supply. However it has no requirements for manufacturers to measure or report the helmet’s ability to attenuate the very high levels of noise generated by the blasting process. The aim of the project was to develop a test method to measure the <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> of shotblasting <b>helmets.</b> The method developed is an objective measurement, using a head and torso simulator (HATS), which provides a suitable means for helmet manufacturers to report their product’s ability to attenuate blasting noise. The results from this project showed that the HATS currently prescribed by BS EN 271 : 1995 can be used for measuring the <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> of <b>helmets</b> against typical shotblasting noise. Using such a HATS in the proposed test method will give attenuation values that correlate well with those measured using human subjects. Therefore the HATS already used by manufacturers to show compliance of their product with BS EN 271 : 1995 could also be used to provide information on the <b>helmet’s</b> <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation.</b> Results from this project also showed that the same HATS can be used, in place of human subjects, to measure the air supply noise accordin...|$|R

The effect, first observed with small-scale convergent nozzles at UCI, involves <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> on the side away from the wedge. The trend is confirmed with data from a large facility. However, several anomalies are noted. In particular, the wedge {{is found to be}} ineffective with nozzles having parallel flow lines near the exit. In the latter case, the wedge simply causes a lateral spreading of the flow. In the convergent case, the wedge also diverts the flow downward forming the thicker annular layer underneath that is key to the <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> seen on the ground. 1...|$|R
40|$|A sub-structuring approach, {{along with}} a unit cell treatment, is {{proposed}} to model expansion chamber silencers with internal partitions and micro-perforated panels (MPPs) {{in the absence of}} internal flow. The side-branch of the silencer is treated as a combination of unit cells connected in series. It is shown that, by connecting multiple unit cells with varying parameters, the <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> bandwidth can be enlarged. With MPPs, the hybrid <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> mechanism of the silencer is revealed. Depending {{on the size of the}} perforation hole, <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> can be dominated by dissipative, reactive, or combined effects together. For a broadband sound absorption, the hole size, together with the perforation ratio and other parameters, can be optimized to strike a balance between the dissipative and reactive effect, for ultimately achieving the desired <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> performance within a prescribed frequency region. The modular nature of the proposed formulation allows doing this in a flexible, accurate, and cost effective manner.

Six urban morphological parameters, including Building Plan Area Fraction, Complete Aspect Ratio, Building Surface Area to Plan Area Ratio, Building Frontal Area Index, Height-to-Width Ratio, and Horizontal Distance of First-row Building to Flight Path, {{have been selected}} and developed. Effects of flight altitude and horizontal flight path distance to site, on spatial aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation,</b> are examined, considering open areas and façades.

40|$|Introduction The {{ability of}} an MEG system to resolve small or deep sources is solely {{determined}} by the achieved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Ideal MEG sensors should exhibit a large gain relative to the brain signals and should also effectively attenuate the environmental and brain noise. Designing the system for large signal strength without regard for <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation,</b> or designing for excellent <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> without {{paying attention to the}} signal strength does not produce the best results. The simultaneous satisfaction of large signal strength and good <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> is not feasible in practice and the best sensor system represents a compromise that maximizes the SNR. The paper will examine optimal and sub-optimal sensor designs and will illustrate their behavior using a synthetic signal embedded in the measured environmental and white noise.

40|$|Imaging faint companions (exoplanets {{and brown}} dwarfs) around nearby stars is {{currently}} limited by speckle noise. To efficiently attenuate this noise, {{a technique called}} simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) can be used. This technique consists of acquiring simultaneously images {{of the field of}} view in several adjacent narrow bands and in combining these images to suppress speckles. Simulations predict that SSDI can achieve, with the acquisition of three wavelengths, speckle <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> of several thousands. These simulations are usually performed using the Fraunhofer approximation, i. e. considering that all aberrations are located in the pupil plane. We have performed wavefront propagation simulations to evaluate how out-of-pupil-plane aberrations affect SSDI speckle <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> performance. The Talbot formalism is used to give a physical insight of the problem; results are confirmed using a proper wavefront propagation algorithm. We will show that near-focal-plane aberrations can significantly reduce SSDI speckle <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation</b> performance at several {lambda}/D separation. It is also shown that the Talbot effect correctly predicts the PSF chromaticity. Both differential atmospheric refraction effects and the use of a coronagraph will be discussed...|$|R
30|$|It {{can easily}} be seen that the {{proposed}} method outperforms the conventional one, as it provides lower speech distortions and higher <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation.</b> Surprisingly, the speech distortion for the system with N= 2 microphones was lower than for the eight-microphone system, especially at high SNRs. A possible explanation of this phenomena is that for more microphones, the correlation matrix is larger, which makes the estimation less accurate. In practice, {{it makes sense to}} use more microphones only in the conventional time-domain method (in order to improve the <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation).</b> Figure 5 a shows that the speech distortion can be also decreased but only at low SNRs.|$|R
