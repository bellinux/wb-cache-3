5|$|A {{computer}} {{can act as}} one or {{all three of these}} components at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time consuming computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{computer}} scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> its design; it was (effectively) designed {{from the ground}} up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the first MediEvil, Sony Computer Entertainment {{commissioned}} SCE Cambridge to develop a sequel that would be released {{before the end of the}} PlayStation's lifespan. Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> development so the project was handed over to James Shepherd instead.|$|E

5|$|As a {{young lawyer}} Chelvanayakam was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{politics}} but when the ACTC was established in 1944 {{he became one of}} its principal organisers. Ponnambalam was the ACTC's president and Chelvanayakam was effectively his deputy. Chelvanayakam was part of the delegation, led by Ponnambalam, to the Soulbury Commission which argued unsuccessfully for balanced representation. Chelvanayakam stood as the ACTC candidate for Kankesanthurai in the 1947 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament.|$|E
5|$|At 9a.m. on July4, Berger {{left her}} {{apartment}} for the Mother Earth offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb had exploded prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger's tenement building, wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men's funerals.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they were <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the writing process. Saturday Night Live cast members did not enjoy working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E

The family was described as being of mixed race in records of the day. His mother died in 1837, when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 1839; the five children he had with María del Carmen Torres Pagán included Ramón's half-brother Felipe Adolfo, who was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> politics (according to Ramón) but was nevertheless arrested following the Grito de Lares years later.|$|E

5|$|For {{the film}} score, Mizoguchi relied on {{composer}} Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, and was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> their creative process. Fumio Hayasaka {{was a strong}} proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films. For Ugetsu, he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichiro Saito and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and could provide accurate music reflective of the period.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{the events of the}} English Civil War in the 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, probably because the collapse of the outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E

5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came {{to call it the}} Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
