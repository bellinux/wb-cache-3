Logistic regression analyses show that self-blame, catastrophizing, and positive reappraisal were, relative to the other strategies, the most important variables for distinguishing between the two samples. While the first two strategies were reported significantly more often by the clinical than by the non-clinical sample, positive reappraisal was reported significantly more often by the non-clinical sample.

An additional aim was to provide a preliminary investigation into whether there is an interaction effect with AN severity, measured by body mass index (BMI). Method: A cross-sectional multi-site pilot study using standardised questionnaires was conducted and 30 young people diagnosed with AN participated. Results: Children and adolescents with AN reported significantly higher levels of IR and perfectionism, compared to published normative <b>non-clinical</b> <b>data.</b> Self-orientated perfectionism (SOP) was associated with frequency of IR thoughts. There was also a significant interaction effect: young people who had a higher frequency of IR thoughts and SOP had lower BMIs. Discussion: Further independent replication of these results is needed.

However, biosimilar monoclonal antibodies provide many challenges compared with first-generation biosimilars, growth factors, and hormones, because they have shown only a modest clinical effect, and are often used in combination with other more toxic therapies, making it difficult to design studies that allow appropriate efficacy and safety assessments compared with the original products.

There are no currently approved therapies that can rapidly reduce the burden of unstable, inflamed plaque in the overall coronary vascular bed.

Second/third and sixth/seventh grade school children of several communities {{as well as their}} parents (N= 376 couples) completed self-rating scales on personality (EPQ), temperament (DOTS-R) and psychiatric symptomatology (SCL- 90 R). Significant positive but rather low spouse associations were found for psychiatric symptomatology and the personality trait Psychoticism, while positive statistical trends were observed for several temperament dimensions. Spouse similarity for psychiatric symptomatology was independent of similarity for personality traits and that for personality traits was independent of underlying temperament traits. Spouse similarity was symmetric between husbands and wives and did not significantly depend on psychiatric symptomatology or demographic variables. In conclusion, our <b>non-clinical</b> <b>data</b> support the existence of significant spouse similarity for psychiatric symptomatology and personality as suggested by clinical studies.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) of drugs that have pharmacological targets in the brain are not often un-derstood during drug development, and this gap in knowledge is a limitation in providing a quantitative framework for translating <b>non-clinical</b> pharmacologic <b>data</b> to the clinical patient population. A focus of translational sciences {{is to improve the}} efficiency of clin-ical trial design via a more judicious selection of clinical doses on the basis of nonclinical data. We hypothesize that this can be achieved for CNS-acting drugs based on knowledge of CNS PK and brain target engagement obtained in nonclinical studies. Translating CNS PK models from rat to human can allow for the prediction of human brain PK and the human dose-brain exposure relationship, which can provide insight on the clinical dose(s) hav-ing potential brain activity and target engagement. In this study, we explored the potential utility of this translational approach using rat brain microdialysis and PK modeling techniques to predict human brain extracellular fluid PK of atomoxetine and duloxetine. The results show that this translational approach merits consideration as a means to support the clinical development of CNS-mediated drug candidates by enhancing the ability to predict pharmacolog-ically relevant doses in humans in the absence of or in association with other biomarker approaches...|$|R

40|$|Renal {{clearance}} {{is responsible}} for the elimination {{of a large number of}} water-soluble drugs and metabolites and is therefore of large importance when characterizing the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Renal clearance includes glomerular filtration, tubular secretion and reabsorption and each of these processes is subject to different developmental changes. To estimate the renal clearance of drugs in children, a thorough understanding of these developmental changes in the different subprocesses contributing to renal function is needed. Therefore the aim of the research described in this thesis was to characterize the developmental changes in renal function over the entire pediatric age range. To this end, a system-based pharmacology approach was applied implicating that within the models for the different subprocesses contributing to renal function a distinction was made between system-specific and drug-specific properties. The transition to a more system-based pharmacology approach and the combination of different strategies (extrapolation to other drugs, adult data or <b>non-clinical</b> <b>data)</b> will result in an approach focusing on the underlying system instead of focusing on the drugs and may facilitate development of pharmacokinetic models and evidence-based dosing regimens in the pediatric population.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To develop {{content for}} an {{educational}} system for dental professionals {{to be used}} for patient-tailored evidence-based decisions regarding routine oral examinations (ROEs) and to test the model as a tool in dental education. METHODS: Initially, an electronic database was developed comprising conclusive data of a structured literature search and 27 ROE clinical cases which were selected on predefined criteria. A RAND-modified Delphi procedure was successfully conducted with 31 multidisciplinary dental experts. Twenty-one selected risk factors for oral disease were assessed for feasibility and subsequently modelled into 19 risk based clinical vignettes, each representing a specific group of ROE-patients. Each vignette comprised all relevant clinical and <b>non-clinical</b> <b>data.</b> Expert judgements were collected including ROE-content, risk level, bitewing frequency and recall interval. Feedback regarding evidence was provided for each of the topics. A pilot with 35 experienced General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) was conducted to assess the reliability of the model for continuing professional development (CPD). Decisions made on content screening items, bitewing frequencies and recall interval were compared with expert opinions. RESULTS: A comprehensive set of clinical vignettes was developed. Expert consensus was reached with regard to risk factors to be applied, content of ROE-items, bitewing frequency and recall interval. Differences between GDPs and experts were found especially concerning recall length in low-risk patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical vignettes provide a promising educational instrument for CPD to improve clinical performance.

40|$|Owing to its {{association}} with Torsades de Pointes, drug-induced QT interval prolongation has been and remains a significant hurdle {{to the development of}} safe, effective medicines. Genetic and pharmacological evidence highlighting the pivotal role the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel was a critical step in understanding how to start addressing this issue. It {{led to the development of}} hERG assays with the rapid throughput needed for the short timescales required in early drug discovery. The resulting volume of hERG data has fostered in silico models to help chemists design compounds with reduced hERG potency. In early drug discovery, a pragmatic approach based on exceeding a given potency value has been required to decide when a compound is likely to carry a low QT risk, to support its progression to late-stage discovery. At this point, the in vivo efficacy and metabolism characteristics of the potential drug are generally defined, as well its safety profile, which includes usually a dog study to assess QT interval prolongation risk. The hERG and in vivo QT data, combined with the likely indication and the estimated free drug level for efficacy, are put together to assess the risk that the potential drug will prolong QT in man. Further data may be required to refine the risk assessment before making the major investment decisions for full development. The <b>non-clinical</b> <b>data</b> are essential to inform decisions about compound progression and to optimize the design of clinical QT studies...|$|E

However, since the American Psychiatric Association proposed the research criteria for PMDD in 1994, {{there has been no}} agreement about the symptomatic constellation that constitutes this syndrome. The objective {{of the present study was}} to establish the core latent structure of PMDD symptoms in a <b>non-clinical</b> sample. <b>Data</b> concerning PMDD symptoms were obtained from 632 regularly menstruating college students (mean age 24. 4 years, SD 5. 9, range 17 to 49). For the first random half (N = 316), we performed principal component analysis (PCA) and for the remaining half (N = 316), we tested three theory-derived competing models of PMDD by confirmatory factor analysis. PCA allowed us to extract two correlated factors, i. e., dysphoric-somatic and behavioral-impairment factors. The two-dimensional latent model derived from PCA showed the best overall fit among three models tested by confirmatory factor analysis (c² 53 = 64. 39, P = 0. 13; goodness-of-fit indices = 0. 96; adjusted goodness-of-fit indices = 0. 95; root mean square residual = 0. 05; root mean square error of approximation = 0. 03; 90 %CI = 0. 00 to 0. 05; Akaike's information criterion = - 41. 61). The items "out of control" and "physical symptoms" loaded conspicuously on the first factor and "interpersonal impairment" loaded higher on the second factor. The construct validity for PMDD was accounted for by two highly correlated dimensions.

40|$|Background: Counseling and anticipatory {{guidance}} of the expected course of treatment for women newly diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are difficult due to multiple factors influencing survival following metastatic breast cancer therapy. In order to better tailor counseling at the onset and through the duration of metastatic breast cancer we used <b>non-clinical</b> trial <b>data</b> to better characterize real life experience of sequential metastatic breast cancer treatment. We examined the following aims: 1. What demographic and tumor characteristics are predictive of survival in metastatic breast cancer? 2. What is the median duration of each sequential chemotherapy regimen and subsequent survival of women following each sequence of chemotherapy regimen in metastatic breast cancer?Methods: Retrospective study included 792 women diagnosed from January 1999 through December 2009 at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Program. Results: Median duration of sequential chemotherapy regimen and median survival from completion of sequence of chemotherapy regimens were relatively short {{with a wide range}} of treatment duration and survival. Characteristics for poor survival included hormone status, human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER 2 /neu) status, and increased number and type of metastatic sites. Women who took more than the second sequential chemotherapy regimens had no more than median 3 months of treatment duration and 6 months survival from treatment termination. Discussion: Median clinical response and survival shorten with sequential chemotherapy regimen but with wide ranges. The rare clinical response of the minority should not set the standard for treatment expectations.

While such data are available from many countries, less is known about the epidemiology of CSA in Japan. Methods: For this systematic review, we searched English databases: Embase, Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, and Japanese databases: Cinii, J-Stage, Children's Rainbow Center Japan, Japan Child and Family Research Institute, Japanese Journal of Child Abuse and Neglect to identify articles published before July 2015 examining the lifetime prevalence of CSA in Japan using <b>non-clinical</b> samples. <b>Data</b> were extracted from published reports. Results: We initially identified 606 citations and after abstract review, retrieved 120 publications. Six studies that met the selection criteria and additional two relevant studies were reviewed. The range of contact CSA for females was 10. 4 %- 60. 7 %, and the prevalence of this type of CSA for males was 4. 1 %. The range of penetrative CSA for females was 1. 3 %- 8. 3 % and that for males was 0. 5 %- 1. 3 %. A number of methodological issues were identified, including a lack of validated measures of CSA, and low response rates. Conclusion: In contrast to a lower prevalence of penetrative CSA, the prevalence of contact CSA among Japanese females may be comparable or higher in relation to international estimates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{discover}} the grounded experiences of Chinese families living in the U. S. A. In order to get a better picture of Chinese families, a new point of view (postmodernism) and a different methodology (ethnography) is needed. Rarely, however, has postmodernism been applied to ethnic family therapy. Since family therapy is a relatively new field, there has not been much research on ethnicity and the needs of diverse families. However, recent work suggests a growing interest in identifying approaches to family therapy that meet the needs of specific ethnic groups. Specifically, postmodern research focuses on dialogue, multiple perspectives, self-disclosure, and process rather than goals. By using a postmodern approach, the nature of human knowledge about Chinese-American families can be better understood;Ethnomethodology shares a similar concern with postmodernism in that both focus on an interpretive account of human meaning systems. Ethnography is the systematic process of describing and analyzing the particular patterns of culture in order to understand people in their familiar environment. The texts of all interviews were subjected to domain analysis specified by the Developmental Research Sequence (DRS) of Spradley (1979). In total, the ethnographer interviewed twelve Chinese couples from a midwest town. Purposive sampling was used. Three themes that evolved from 13 second level domains are described in this research.

40|$|Drug-induced {{prolongation}} of the QT interval {{is having}} {{a significant impact on}} the ability of the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs. The development implications for a compound causing a significant effect in the ‘Thorough QT/QTc Study'—as defined in the clinical regulatory guidance (ICH E 14) —are substantial. In view of this, and the fact that QT interval prolongation is linked to direct inhibition of the hERG channel, in the early stages of drug discovery the focus is on testing for and screening out hERG activity. This has led to understanding of how to produce low potency hERG blockers whilst retaining desirable properties. Despite this, a number of factors mean that when an integrated risk assessment is generated towards the end of the discovery phase (by conducting at least an in vivo QT assessment) a QT interval prolongation risk is still often apparent; inhibition of hERG channel trafficking and partitioning into cardiac tissue are just two confounding factors. However, emerging information suggests that hERG safety margins have high predictive value and that when hERG and in vivo <b>non-clinical</b> <b>data</b> are combined, their predictive value to man, whilst not perfect, is > 80 %. Although understanding the anomalies is important and is being addressed, of greater importance is developing a better understanding of TdP, with the aim of being able to predict TdP rather than using an imperfect surrogate marker (QT interval prolongation). Without an understanding of how to predict TdP risk, high-benefit drugs for serious indications may never be marketed...|$|E

No biosimilar products are licensed yet, however, 4 IND products have been approved for phase I or III clinical trials. The addressed issues during review were as follows: acceptability of reference products manufactured in different sites, determination of acceptable criteria for differences and selection of analytical tests for the comparability exercise to detect potential differences in quality attributes, relevant species for non-clinical study, and duration of toxicity study, etc. These and other future issues will be dealt with scientific advancement, experiences of collaborating work with WHO or other NRAs, which will be reflected in the guidelines on regulations of biosimilar products in Korea...|$|R
40|$|Infliximab was {{the first}} {{monoclonal}} antibody to human necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) developed for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This chimeric antibody binds with high affinity to both soluble and trans-membrane TNF {{and is able to}} reduce synovial inflammation, bone resorption and cartilage degradation. The efficacy of infliximab has been observed in active RA despite treatment with multiple disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and in early disease with no prior treatment by methotrexate (MTX). Infliximab has been shown to reduce joint inflammation and to slow radiographic progression, in both clinical and <b>non-clinical</b> responders. Recent <b>data</b> suggest that using infliximab early in RA treatment increases the percentage of clinical remission and allows infliximab discontinuation. The recommended dosage of 3 mg/kg could be increased up to 10 mg/kg with partial efficacy of the dose escalation. Antibodies to infliximab have been observed in 7 % to 61 % of patients and are associated with a low trough level of infliximab and secondary response failure. Their occurrence could be prevented by co-medication with MTX. The combination of DMARDs other than MTX with infliximab was found to be safe and efficacious. Infections, principally tuberculosis, are increased in treated patients, and the risk is greater at higher dose. Even if the treatment is generally safe and well tolerated, patients treated with infliximab should be closely monitored...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although reperfusion injury {{has been}} shown to be {{responsible}} for cardiomyocytes death after an acute myocardial infarction, there is currently no drug on the market that reduces this type of injury. TRO 40303 is a new cardioprotective compound that was shown to inhibit the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and reduce infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion in a rat model of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: In the rat model, the therapeutic window and the dose effect relationship were investigated in order to select the proper dose and design for clinical investigations. To evaluate post-ischemic functional recovery, TRO 40303 was tested in a model of isolated rat heart. Additionally, TRO 40303 was investigated in a Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous ascending doses of the compound (0. 5 to 13 mg/kg) in 72 healthy male, post-menopausal and hysterectomized female subjects at flow rates from 0. 04 to 35 mL/min (EudraCT number: 2010 - 021453 - 39). This work was supported in part by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche. RESULTS: In the vivo model, TRO 40303 reduced infarct size by 40 % at 1 mg/kg and by 50 % at 3 and 10 mg/kg given by intravenous bolus and was only active when administered before reperfusion. Additionally, TRO 40303 provided functional recovery and reduced oxidative stress in the isolated rat heart model. These results, together with pharmacokinetic based allometry to human and <b>non-clinical</b> toxicology <b>data,</b> were used to design the Phase I trial. All the tested doses and flow rates were well tolerated clinically. There were no serious adverse events reported. No relevant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters, laboratory tests or physical examinations were observed at any time in any dose group. Pharmacokinetics was linear up to 6 mg/kg and slightly ~ 1. 5 -fold, hyper-proportional from 6 to 13 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that TRO 40303 can be safely administered by the intravenous route in humans at doses expected to be pharmacologically active. These results allowed evaluating the expected active dose in human at 6 mg/kg, used in a Phase II proof-of-concept study currently ongoing...|$|R
