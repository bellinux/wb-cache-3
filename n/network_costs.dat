40|$|When {{a content}} {{provider}} (CP) provides peer-topeer live streaming service, routing decisions {{with the knowledge}} of underlay traffic can often lead to much better performance (such as user delay). On the other hand, if the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide underlay traffic information to the CP, their overall <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> due to routing inefficiencies can be reduced. There is hence incentive for ISP-CP collaboration. In this paper, we study protocol design to reduce <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> for such collaboration. We consider two ways of collaboration: one on complete information sharing (i. e., the case of ISPs playing the role of CP), and the other one on limited information sharing by means of peer ranking (i. e., the case of P 4 P framework through Oracle/iTracker). We first formulate the problem of minimizing <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> with a certain delay target, and show that it is NP-hard.

40|$|Abstract. Overlay routing {{has been}} {{successful}} as an incremental method to improve Internet routing by allowing its own users to select their logical routing.

Previous studies [1, 2] have shown that the interaction of the two network components can cause huge <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> increases and oscillations. In this paper, we improve the interaction between overlay routing and TE by modifying the objectives of both parties. For the overlay part, we propose TE-awareness which limits the selfishness by some bounds so that the action of overlay does not offensively affect TE’s optimization process. Then, we suggest COPE [3] as a strong candidate that achieves close-to-optimal performance for predicted traffic matrices and that handles unpredictable overlay traffic efficiently. With extensive simulation results, we show the proposed methods can significantly improve the interaction with lower <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> and smaller oscillation problems. ...|$|R

In a European context, {{one of the main}} drivers for this growth is the support of electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES) and combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Hence, these DG units mostly consist of non-controllable generation. Distribution is a regulated activity which is, at least, legally and functionally unbundled from the generation activity. These issues, together with the fact that distribution networks were not originally designed to accommodate generation, pose significant challenges on distribution network planning and operation. One of the major concerns of distribution system operators (DSOs) is the impact that large penetration levels of DG may have on distribution <b>network</b> <b>costs.</b> This paper presents a quantification of the impact of DG on distribution <b>network</b> <b>costs</b> in three real distribution areas.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} a generic <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> {{minimization}} problem, {{in which every}} node has a local decision vector to determine. Each node incurs a cost depending on its decision vector and each link also incurs a cost depending on the decision vectors of its two end nodes. All nodes cooperate to minimize the overall <b>network</b> <b>cost.</b> The formulated <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> minimization problem has broad applications in distributed signal processing and control over multi-agent systems. To obtain a decentralized algorithm for the formulated problem, we resort to the distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (DADMM). However, each iteration of the DADMM involves solving a local optimization problem at each node, leading to intractable computational burden in many circumstances. As such, we propose a distributed linearized ADMM (DLADMM) algorithm for <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> minimization. In the DLADMM, each iteration only involves closed-form computations and avoids local optimization problems, which greatly reduces the computational complexity compared to the DADMM. We prove that the DLADMM converges to an optimal point when the local cost functions are convex and have Lipschitz continuous gradients. Linear convergence rate of the DLADMM is also established if the local cost functions are further strongly convex. Numerical experiments are conducted to corroborate {{the effectiveness of the}} DLADMM and we observe that the DLADMM has similar convergence performance as DADMM does while the former enjoys much lower computational overhead.
