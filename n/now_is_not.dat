Doctors speak of {{the natural history of}} diseases as a way to understand how therapy alters the usual progression of a disease. For example, the natural history of breast cancer may be measured in months but treated with surgery or chemotherapy the disease can be measured in years or even cured. Sudden cardiac arrest is a disease with an extremely rapid natural history, measured in minutes, with an inexorable outcome. But when treated with CPR the course of death can be extended (CPR will delay the dying process) and if treated with timely defibrillation death can be aborted.|$|E

I think it's perception. [...] It's something that happens in your subconscious". At the time of American Idiots release, the album was not sold in Wal-Mart due to its explicit content.|$|E
500|$|Bernard Perusse of The Gazette {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than the 2006 biography [...] by Johnny Rogan.

[...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E
500|$|The Romans' {{part in the}} {{clearances}} of {{the once}} extensive Caledonian forest remains a matter of debate. That these forests were once considerably more extensive than they are <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in dispute, but the timing and causes of the reduction are. The 16th-century writer Hector Boece believed that the woods in Roman times stretched north from Stirling into Atholl and Lochaber and was inhabited by white bulls with [...] "crisp and curland mane, like feirs lionis". Later historians such as P. F. Tytler and W. F. Skene followed suit as did the 20th-century naturalist Frank Fraser Darling. Modern techniques, including palynology and dendrochronology suggest a more complex picture. Changing post-glacial climates may have allowed for a maximum forest cover between 4000 and 3000 and deforestation of the Southern uplands, caused both climatically and anthropogenically, was well underway {{by the time the}} legions arrived. Extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife suggest that arable land spread at the expense of forest from about 2000 until the 1st-century Roman advance. Thereafter, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for a period of five centuries, suggesting the invasions had a very negative impact on the native population. The situation outside the Roman-held areas is harder to assess, but the long-term influence of Rome may not have been substantial.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{expected}} that al-Bashir will not face trial in The Hague until he is apprehended in a nation which accepts ICC jurisdiction, as Sudan is not {{a party to the}} Rome Statute, which it signed but did not ratify.

[...] The Prosecutor warned that authorities could arrest the President if he enters international airspace. The Sudanese government has announced that the Presidential plane would be accompanied by jet fighters. However, the Arab League announced solidarity with al-Bashir. Since the warrant, he has visited Qatar and Egypt. The African Union also condemned the charges.|$|E

2500|$|Following Coleridge's {{response}} was an anonymous {{review in the}} May 1820 Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, possible by either John Lockhart and John Wilson together or just Lockhart on his own. Of Wordsworth's abilities as a poet in general, the review claimed: [...] "Mr Wordsworth ... is entitled to be classed with the very highest names among his predecessors, as a pure and reverent worshipper of the true majest of the English Muse" [...] and that [...] "Of the genius of Mr Wordsworth, in short, it {{is now in the}} hands of every man to judge freely and fully, and for himself. Our own opinion, ever since this Journal commenced, has been clearly and entirely before them; and if there be any one person, on whose mind what we have quoted <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough to make an impression similar to that which our own judgment had long before received– we have nothing more to say to that person in regard to the subject of poetry." [...] In discussing the ode in particular, the review characterised the poem as [...] "one of the grandest of his early pieces". In December 1820 came an article in the New Monthly Magazine titled [...] "On the Genius and Writings of Wordsworth" [...] written by Thomas Noon Talfourd. When discussing the poem, Talfourd declared that the ode [...] "is, to our feelings, the noblest piece of lyric poetry in the world. It was the first poem of its author which we read, and never shall we forget the sensations which it excited within us. We had heard the cold sneers attached to his name... and here – in the works of this derided poet – we found a new vein of imaginative sentiment open to us – sacred recollections brought back to our hearts with all the freshness of novelty, and all the venerableness of far-off time". When analysing the relationship between infants and the divine within the poem, the article continued: [...] "What a gift did we then inherit! To have the best and most imperishable of intellectual treasures – the mighty world of reminiscences of the days of infancy – set before us in a new and holier light".|$|E
2500|$|Opinions {{differed}} about Fancourt's melodramatic {{style in}} his roles, especially {{his interpretation of}} his best-known role, that of the Mikado of Japan, and his famous Mikado laugh. Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could {{be taken as a}} Fagin-like caricature. [...] According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, [...] "I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J. M. Gordon his new business for the song, they were delighted. Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 première, was unimpressed: [...] "Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [...] at the Savoy." [...] The Times thought that he [...] "undoubtedly loses {{a good deal of the}} Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'." [...] A later Times review commented more favourably: [...] "Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs." [...] The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, [...] "He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette said, [...] "Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with a voice like a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated." [...] Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as [...] "a dragon getting up steam". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, [...] "The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it".|$|E
