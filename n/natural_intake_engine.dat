50|$|Revised air <b>intakes,</b> <b>engines</b> {{moved forward}} to correct {{longitudinal}} imbalance. Its nearly completed airframe {{was captured in}} production, with two Junkers Jumo 004B jet engines installed in the airframe.|$|R
25|$|By 1950, several design {{proposals}} for a supersonic interceptor were explored which included versions with swept wings, a tail-less delta wing (similar to the Dassault Mirage IV), side-body <b>engine</b> <b>intakes,</b> in-nose <b>engine</b> <b>intakes</b> (similar to the Mig-21), turbine engines and rocket engines, and combinations of several.|$|R
50|$|The {{specification}} for {{the aircraft}} required engine installations which permitted the fitting of different air <b>intakes,</b> <b>engines</b> and propelling nozzles. The 188 was {{originally intended to}} have Avon engines but the Gyron Junior was substituted in June 1957.|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} for the increased air resistance in the <b>intake,</b> <b>engines</b> fitted with Heat Plates have a slightly adjusted charge pressure, Approximately: +0.2 bar, this means that LPT models with heat plates have a solenoid valve to raise the charging pressure above basic charging pressure.|$|R
25|$|The JLTV will be {{equipped}} with a diagnostic monitoring system that will electronically alert the operator of equipment failures {{so that they can}} be fixed. The electronic monitoring will observe the fuel, air <b>intake,</b> <b>engine,</b> cooling, transmission, energy storage, power generation and vehicle speed as well as other systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{consisted of the}} <b>intake,</b> <b>engine,</b> nacelle or secondary airflow and ejector nozzle (propelling nozzle). The propulsive thrust distribution between these components changed with flight speed: at Mach 2.2 inlet 13% - engine 73% - ejector 14%; at Mach 3.0+ inlet 54% - engine 17.6% - ejector 28.4%.|$|R
25|$|At speeds {{below the}} intake {{starting}} speed, or on aircraft with external compression <b>intakes,</b> <b>engine</b> surge {{can cause a}} hammershock. Hammershocks have caused damage to intakes. For example, the North American F-107 during flight at high speed experienced an engine surge which bent the intake ramps. Concorde, during development flight testing, experienced significant damage to one nacelle after both engines surged.|$|R
50|$|The {{designation}} Mi-17 is for export; Russian {{armed forces}} call it Mi-8MT. The Mi-17 can be recognized {{because it has}} the tail rotor {{on the port side}} instead of the starboard side, and dust shields in front of the <b>engine</b> <b>intakes.</b> <b>Engine</b> cowls are shorter than on the TV2-powered Mi-8, not extending as far over the cockpit, and an opening for a bleed air valve outlet is present forward of the exhaust.|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to a contract {{for the development of}} a single-seat V/STOL fighter in 1961, Yakovlev proposed a twin-engined aircraft with a large nose air <b>intake,</b> <b>engines</b> in the forward fuselage and swivelling exhaust nozzles, one for each engine on either side of the lower fuselage near the centre of gravity of the aircraft. The fighter version was not proceeded with but four technology demonstrators, (initially designated Izeliye V) based on the fighter studies were ordered.|$|R
5000|$|Not to be {{confused}} with an unstart, with its large loss in duct pressure, is the duct over-pressure resulting from a hammershock.At speeds below the intake starting speed, or on aircraft with external compression <b>intakes,</b> <b>engine</b> surge can cause a hammershock. Hammershocks have caused damage to intakes. For example, the North American F-107 during flight at high speed experienced an engine surge which bent the intake ramps. Concorde, during development flight testing, experienced significant damage to one nacelle after both engines surged.|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke <b>engine's</b> <b>intake</b> timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type <b>engine's</b> <b>intake</b> timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R
5000|$|For safety reasons, run-ups {{on large}} transport-category {{aircraft}} require the utmost coordination between the cockpit crew {{and the ground}} crew. On January 6, 2006 an experienced mechanic was inspecting the #2 engine of a Boeing 737-500 during a run-up when he accidentally positioned himself {{too close to the}} <b>engine's</b> <b>intake.</b> With the <b>engine</b> running near takeoff thrust, he was ingested into the engine, and lost his life.|$|R
50|$|Several key {{upgrades}} found {{available for}} the Cheyenne IA also became standard for the III. These included the SAS, redesigned exhaust stubs, which, according to Piper, allowed an extra 6 kn IAS; and a redesigned <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> air scoop, which allowed for a larger volume of air to enter the engine. In addition, an external air scoop for oil cooling was available instead of using <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> air.|$|R

50|$|A GAU-12/U 25 mm rotary barreled cannon {{was mounted}} in the {{aircraft}} {{to the right of}} the nose in a concave recess under the cockpit. The concave recess meant that when the gun was fired, exhaust gases would create pressure on the recess and push the aircraft's nose to the left. This innovative feature cancelled out the recoil of the large cannon, which tended to push the nose to the right. To prevent exhaust gases from the gun entering the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> and reducing <b>engine</b> performance, Rutan designed what is perhaps ARES' most recognizable feature, the asymmetric placing of the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> on the left side of the nose, directly opposite the cannon. Thrust was redirected to the centerline via a series of ducts, which also reduced the infrared signature.|$|R
