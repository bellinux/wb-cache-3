50|$|Another type of {{contamination}} in UPW is dissolved inorganic material, primarily silica. Silica {{is one of}} the most abundant mineral on the planet and is found in all water supplies. Any dissolved inorganic material has the potential to remain on the wafer as the UPW dries. Once again this can lead to a significant loss in yield. To detect trace amounts of dissolved inorganic material a measurement of <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> is commonly used. This technique involves using a nebulizer to create droplets of UPW suspended in a stream of air. These droplets are dried at a high temperature to produce an aerosol of <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> particles. A measurement device called a condensation particle counter then counts the residue particles to give a reading in parts per trillion (ppt) by weight.|$|E
50|$|Sublimation is a {{technique}} used by chemists to purify compounds. A solid is typically placed in a sublimation apparatus and heated under vacuum. Under this reduced pressure, the solid volatilizes and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface (cold finger), leaving a <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> of impurities behind. Once heating ceases and the vacuum is removed, the purified compound may be collected from the cooling surface.For even higher purification efficiencies a temperature gradient is applied, which also allows for the separation of different fractions. Typical setups use an evacuated glass tube that is gradually heated in a controlled manner. The material flow is from the hot end, where the initial material is placed, to the cold end that is connected to a pump stand. By controlling temperatures {{along the length of}} the tube the operator can control the zones of recondensation, with very volatile compounds being pumped out of the system completely (or caught by a separate cold trap), moderately volatile compounds recondensating along the tube according to their different volatilities, and non-volatile compounds remaining in the hot end.Vacuum sublimation of this type is also the method of choice for purification of organic compounds for the use in the organic electronics industry, where very high purities (often > 99.99%) are needed to satisfy the standards for consumer electronics and other applications.|$|E

The type of glove chosen for use should be the glove that produces {{the least amount of}} <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> (NVR). This paper covers the analysis of polyethylene, nitrile, latex, vinyl, and polyurethane gloves using the contact transfer and gravimetric determination methods covered in the NASA GSFC work instruction Gravimetric Determination and Contact Transfer of <b>Non-volatile</b> <b>Residue</b> (NVR) in Cleanroom Glove Samples, 541 -WI- 5330. 1. 21 and in the ASTM Standard E- 1731 M- 95, Standard Test Method for Gravimetric Determination of <b>Non-Volatile</b> <b>Residue</b> from Cleanroom Gloves. The tests performed focus on contamination of critical surfaces at the molecular level. The study found that for the most part, all of the gloves performed equally well in the contact transfer testing. However, the polyethylene gloves performed the best in the gravimetric determination testing, and therefore should be used whenever solvent contact is a possibility. The nitrile gloves may be used as a substitute for latex gloves when latex sensitivity is an issue. The use of vinyl gloves should be avoided, especially if solvent contact is a possibility. A glove database will be established by Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Code 541 to compile the results from future testing of new gloves and different glove lots...|$|E

Cooked powder residue is the name for the waste material generated by cooking down or distilling muck.

By using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) with Raman Spectroscopy, an unlikely contaminant was identified on space flight hardware.

In this study, together with a full characterisation of the waste, the removal and recovery of the residual perchloroethylene by means of different heat treatments was investigated.

Similar testing has occurred at the HSWL (Hamilton Sundstrand Windsor Locks) facility. A NASA Executive Order bans the procurement of all ODS (ozone depleting substances), including Freon- 113 by the end of 2009. In order to comply with NASA direction, HSWL began evaluating viable solvents to replace Freon- 113. The study and testing effort to find Freon- 113 replacements used for Cold Trap sampling is the subject of this paper. Test results have shown HFE- 7100 (a 3 M fluorinated ether) to be an adequate replacement for Freon- 113 as a solvent to remove and measure the <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> collected in a Cold Trap during oxygen testing.

Bare, uncoated resonator exposed to atmosphere and directly in contact with airborne volatile and nonvolatile materials leaving residues on surface.

Radioactively-labelled phosphine is a useful and sensitive tool to study residues of phosphine in grains and their fractions. This research will assist industry to improve phosphine fumigation practice. Five representative grains (wheat, barley, oats, canola and lupins) were fumigated with 32 P labelled phosphine at 700 ppm and 25 ± 2 °C for two weeks exposure. Two types of residues were formed in grains from phosphine fumigation – phosphine residue and phosphine converted <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residues.</b> After one week exposure to atmosphere, the levels of 32 P radioactive residue in the grains and their fractions were analysed. The results show that more than 85 % of absorbed phosphine which was converted to non-volatile compounds cannot be removed by ventilation. Furthermore, 80 - 90 % of <b>non-volatile</b> 32 P <b>residues</b> were present in water and acid soluble extractions. Radiation imagery shows that more than 80 % of 32 P residues were located or distributed in the embryo, testa, pericarp and husk of wheat, barley, canola, lupins and oats. However, 90 % of absorbed phosphine will be desorbed after one week exposure to the atmosphere...|$|R

The Volatilisation and Humidification Tandem Differential Mobility Analyser (VH-TDMA) system can measure changes in the hygroscopic behaviour of heterogeneously nucleated aerosol as one or more semi-volatile species are removed through thermal evaporation or decomposition. The VH-TDMA system {{has the potential to}} distinguish between submicrometer particles containing residues of differing volatility and hygroscopic growth and can do so for residue diameters as small as 5 nm. The technique has the potential to distinguish between components such as sea salt and combustion derived particles within submicrometer sulphate aerosols and will find application in marine and combustion aerosol research investigating nucleation, coagulation and secondary aerosol formation processes. Hygroscopic growth and volatility data measured with the system are presented for Di- 2 ethylhexyl-sebacate (DEHS), sodium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, sulphuric acid, ammonium bisulphate and methane sulphonic acid, as single aerosol species for comparison with values reported by other authors.

40|$|Dry {{cleaning}} facilities using tetrachloroethene, {{also known}} as perchloroethylene (PCE) produce a solid waste consisting of spent filtering powder, mainly calcined diatomaceous earth, benthonites or other absorbent materials. These powders are normally used during dry washing for the organic solvent filtration and discoloration prior to its recovery by distillation and condensation with refrigerating fluid. Therefore spent filtering powder contains high concentrations of PCE, together with dyes and <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residues.</b> PCE is a compound belonging to the class of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons suspected of being carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans. For this reason spent filtering powders from dry cleaning are considered as hazardous waste, whose disposal in landfill is not allowed and for whom incineration represents the only viable alternative. Owing to the great concern that has been raised about potential emission of dioxins in the combustion of organic material {{in the presence of}} chlorine, alternative treatments should be considered. The objectives of this research were the characterization of a solid waste from dry cleaning activities, the evaluation of the organic solvent removal and recovery by means of different heat treatments with the aim of a reduction of the harmfulness of this waste for a possible landfill disposal as an alternative to combustion. The results obtained show that the spent filtering powders from dry cleaning contain about 25...|$|R
30|$|Two {{forms of}} gaseous {{products}} {{are produced by}} wood pyrolysis: those that escape readily from the solid residue and those that don’t. For those that do, {{nearly all of the}} compounds that split off from cellulose and lignin in the earlier stages of pyrolysis are richer in hydrogen, in oxygen, or in both, than the original polymeric chains. The <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue,</b> therefore, becomes enriched in carbon. The carbon-to-carbon bonds in the graphitic carbon structures formed are unbreakable by pyrolysis alone to temperatures beyond 3000 °C (Browne 1958). For those complex gaseous products that do not readily escape from the solid residue, exothermic pyrolysis continues to leave a more highly carbonaceous residue, and form a secondary char.|$|E

40|$|Ion {{irradiation}} of {{the outer}} meters of a cometary surface produces new molecular species in the solid state. Because of the vacuum interfaces these segregate in an irreversible way into a <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> and new very volatile species, which are lost directly or lost when the comet enters the inner solar system. It is, therefore, likely that a comet exposed to background radiations in the Oort cloud would obtain an outer web of nonvolatile material which {{will lead to the}} formation of a substantial 'crust' (~ 10 ^ 2 gm/cm^ 2). Except for fizzures and break-off of pieces due to warming of subsurface gases, this mantel should be continuously hardened for a periodic comet due, primarily, to thermal processing.

50|$|Oxidation of {{the sample}} is {{complete}} after injection into the furnace, turning oxidizable material in the sample into gaseous form. A carbon-free carrier gas transports the CO2, through a moisture trap and halide scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector. These substances can interfere with the detection of the CO2 gas. The HTCO method {{may be useful in}} those applications where difficult to oxidize compounds, or high molecular weight organics, are present as it provides almost complete oxidation of organics including solids and particulates small enough to be injected into the furnace. The major drawback of HTCO analysis is its unstable baseline resulting from the gradual accumulation of <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residues</b> within the combustion tube. These residues continuously change TOC background levels requiring continuous background correction. Because aqueous samples are injected directly into a very hot, usually quartz, furnace only small aliquots (less than 2 milliliters and usually less than 400 micro-liters) of sample can be handled making the methods less sensitive than chemical oxidation methods capable of digesting as much as 10 times more sample. Also, the salt content {{of the sample}}s do not combust, and so therefore, gradually build a residue inside the combustion tube eventually clogging the catalyst resulting in poor peak shapes, and degraded accuracy or precision, unless appropriate maintenance procedures are followed. The catalyst should be regenerated or replaced as needed. To avoid this problem the manufacturing industry has developed several concepts, such as matrix separation, ceramic reactors, better process control or methods without catalysts.|$|R
40|$|There are two {{principal}} concerns {{that govern the}} use of lubricants in NIF: (1) Airborne molecular contaminants (AMCs) [...] AMCs are known to seriously degrade the performance of sol-gel coated optics. AMCs are produced by the slow outgassing of <b>residues</b> (<b>non-volatile</b> <b>residues</b> or ''NVRs'') of high molecular weight compounds left on surfaces. Lubricants, particularly hydrocarbon lubricants, are a primary source of such NVRs. (2) Particulates [...] Particulates that accumulate on optical surfaces can cause permanent physical damage when exposed to high energy density laser light. Lubricant residues exposed to high energy density light will pyrolyze or decompose and produce carbon particulates. The NIF Approved Materials Database lists several lubricants that have been tested for use in NIF environments. Many of these lubricants were tested according to MELs 99 - 006 (oven outgassing test) or 99 - 007 (vacuum outgassing test). In these tests, the change in percent transmission of light through a sol-gel coated optic placed next to the sample under evaluation is used as the diagnostic. Samples that cause less than 0. 1 % change in optical transmission are deemed suitable for use inside beam enclosures. This testing, however, addresses only the concern associated with AMCs. To assess the issue of particle generation, a flashlamp or ''aerosol'' test is used. In this test a sample with residues is subjected to intense light from the main amplifier flashlamps. The number density of particles per unit volume is measure after each flash. A measurement of an average of fewer than 1000 particles > 0. 5 {micro}m in diameter produced per square foot of exposed surface per flash {{for each of the}} last ten flashes in a series of 60 flashes of light is deemed to be acceptable for polymers.

(2) Determine the mechanisms of CHC oxidation in plants. (3) Isolate the genes responsible for CHC oxidation in plants. We have made significant progress toward {{an understanding of the}} biochemical mechanism of CHC transformation native to wild-type poplar. We have identified chloral, trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, and dichloroacetic acid as products of TCE metabolism in poplar plants and in tissue cultures of poplar cells. (Newman et al. 1997; Newman et al. 1999) Use of radioactively labeled TCE showed that once taken up and transformed, most of the TCE was incorporated into plant tissue as a <b>non-volatile,</b> unextractable <b>residue.</b> (Shang et al. 2001; Shang and Gordon 2002) An assay for this transformation was developed and validated using TCE transformation by poplar suspension cells.

40|$|Number {{concentrations}} of total and non-volatile aerosol particles with size diameters > 0. 01 μm {{as well as}} particle size distributions (0. 4 – 23 μm diameter) were measured in situ in the Arctic lower stratosphere (10 – 20. 5 km altitude). The measurements were obtained during the campaigns European Polar Stratospheric Cloud and Lee Wave Experiment (EUPLEX) and Envisat-Arctic-Validation (EAV). The campaigns were based in Kiruna, Sweden, and took place from January to March 2003. Measurements were conducted onboard the Russian high-altitude research aircraft Geophysica using the low-pressure Condensation Nucleus Counter COPAS (COndensation PArticle Counter System) and a modified FSSP 300 (Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe). Around 18 – 20 km altitude typical total particle number concentrations n t range at 10 – 20 cm − 3 (ambient conditions). Correlations with the trace gases nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and trichlorofluoromethane (CFC- 11) are discussed. Inside the polar vortex {{the total number of}} particles > 0. 01 μm increases with potential temperature while N 2 O is decreasing which indicates a source of particles in the above polar stratosphere or mesosphere. A separate channel of the COPAS instrument measures the fraction of aerosol particles non-volatile at 250 °C. Inside the polar vortex a much higher fraction of particles contained <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residues</b> than outside the vortex (~ 67 % inside vortex, ~ 24 % outside vortex). This is most likely due to a strongly increased fraction of meteoric material in the particles which is transported downward from the mesosphere inside the polar vortex. The high fraction of non-volatile residual particles gives therefore experimental evidence for downward transport of mesospheric air inside the polar vortex. It is also shown that the fraction of non-volatile residual particles serves directly as a suitable experimental vortex tracer. Nanometer-sized meteoric smoke particles may also serve as nuclei for the condensation of gaseous sulfuric acid and water in the polar vortex and these additional particles may be responsible for the increase in the observed particle concentration at low N 2 O. The number {{concentrations of}} particles > 0. 4 μm measured with the FSSP decrease markedly inside the polar vortex with increasing potential temperature, also a consequence of subsidence of air from higher altitudes inside the vortex. Another focus of the analysis was put on the particle measurements in the lowermost stratosphere. For the total particle density relatively high number concentrations of several hundred particles per cm 3 at altitudes below ~ 14 km were observed in several flights. To investigate the origin of these high number concentrations we conducted air mass trajectory calculations and compared the particle measurements with other trace gas observations. The high number concentrations of total particles in the lowermost stratosphere are probably caused by transport of originally tropospheric air from lower latitudes and are potentially influenced by recent particle nucleation...|$|R
40|$|Processes {{occurring}} in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS) are of importance for the global climate, for the stratospheric dynamics and air chemistry, and they influence the global distribution of water vapour, trace gases and aerosols. The mechanisms underlying cloud formation and variability in the UT/LS are of scientific concern as these still are not adequately described and quantified by numerical models. Part {{of the reasons for}} this is the scarcity of detailed in-situ measurements in particular from the Tropical Transition Layer (TTL) within the UT/LS. In this contribution we provide measurements of particle number densities and the amounts of non-volatile particles in the submicron size range present in the UT/LS over Southern Brazil, West Africa, and Northern Australia. The data were collected in-situ on board of the Russian high altitude research aircraft M- 55 "Geophysica" using the specialised COPAS (COndensation PArticle counting System) instrument during the TROCCINOX (Araçatuba, Brazil, February 2005), the SCOUT-O 3 (Darwin, Australia, December 2005), and SCOUT-AMMA (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, August 2006) campaigns. The vertical profiles obtained are compared to those from previous measurements from the NASA DC- 8 and NASA WB- 57 F over Costa Rica and other tropical locations between 1999 and 2007. The number density of the submicron particles as function of altitude was found to be remarkably constant (even back to 1987) over the tropical UT/LS altitude band such that a parameterisation suitable for models can be extracted from the measurements. At altitudes corresponding to potential temperatures above 430 K a slight increase of the number densities from 2005 / 2006 results from the data in comparison to the 1987 to 2007 measurements. The origins of this increase are unknown. By contrast the data from Northern hemispheric mid latitudes do not exhibit such an increase between 1999 and 2006. Vertical profiles of the non-volatile fraction of the submicron particles were also measured by a COPAS channel and are presented here. The resulting profiles of the non-volatile number density fraction show a pronounced maximum of 50 % in the tropical TTL over Australia and West Africa. Below and above this fraction is much lower attaining values of 10 % and smaller. In the lower stratosphere the fine particles mostly consist of sulphuric acid which is reflected in the low numbers of <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residues</b> measured by COPAS. Without detailed chemical composition measurements the reason for the increase of non-volatile particle fractions cannot yet be given. The long distance transfer flights to Brazil, Australia and West-Africa were executed during a time window of 17 months within a period of relative volcanic quiescence. Thus the data measured during these transfers represent a "snapshot picture" documenting the status of {{a significant part of the}} global UT/LS aerosol (with sizes below 1 μm) at low concentration levels 15 years after the last major (i. e., the 1991 Mount Pinatubo) eruption.

These greases, typically a perfluoroalkylether, with suspended polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micro-powder, have attractive lubricating properties toward threaded components and are relatively chemically inert toward NTO oxidizers. A major drawback, however, is that perfluoroalkylether greases are soluble or dispersible in NTO oxidizers and can contaminate the propellant.

However, {{the details of}} the electrode emersion process must be understood if definitive results are to be obtained. The works of Hansen, Kolb, et al. (2, 3, 4) indicate that, at least in some cases, electrodes can be emersed with the double layer intact. Of equal importance to the application of ex situ techniques is the question of how much bulk electrolyte adheres to the electrode upon emersion. Gordon (5), using a total attenuated reflec-tance method, h~s measured an electrolyte thickness of 38 A on a Ag electrode emersed from 0. I M NaF into wate ~ vapor-saturated Ar, with smaller, potential-dependent thick-nesses measured after emersion into unsaturat-ed argon. The extent to which such behavior is typical of electrode-electrolyte systems in general remains to be determined. The present work was carried out using a cell designed to allow the clean transfer of the electrode to an ultra-high vacuum surface analytical chamber. The order of magnitude of the thickness of electrolyte remaining on the surface after emersion was determined by quantitative Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) applied to the <b>non-volatile</b> sodium <b>residue</b> from a HF-NaF aqueous electrolyte.

The PECVD low-k deposition of ultra low-k films uses a porogen-based approach. The matrix material is deposited by oxidation of alkylsilanes in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. The porogen molecules, usually cyclic hydrocarbons, are introduced into a SiOCH film by co-deposition with the matrix material. To create porosity, the porogen {{is removed from the}} films using UV-assisted-thermal curing. The porogen molecules are photo-dissociated by UV-light with the formation of volatile hydrocarbons and <b>non-volatile</b> carbon-rich <b>residues</b> (porogen residue) [1]. We showed recently that SiOCH glasses with improved mechanical properties and ultra-low-k value could be obtained by controlled decomposition of the porogen molecules prior to the UV-hardening step [2]. The controlled removal of porogen can be performed by H 2 -based afterglow plasma treatment of PECVD film [1, 2]. In this work we study the effect of narrow band 172 nm and broadband > 200 nm UV-sources in the new curing scheme of the PECVD dielectrics. The data are compared with the PECVD films fabricated in the conventional UV-curing scheme. The effect of both 172 nm and > 200 nm UV-sources is comparable for porogen-containing conventional PECVD films. However, the porogen-free films cured with 172 nm UV-source shows approximately twice as higher Young’s modulus of 6. 64 GPa (k 100 kHz ~ 2. 2, 44 % open porosity) than those cured with > 200 nm UV with YM of 3. 38 GPa (k 100 kHz ~ 2. 0, 48 % open porosity). The mechanical properties, optical properties 150 nm - 800 nm, dielectric constants at 100 kHz and 4 GHz, porosities and pore size distributions, bonding structure are presented. The impact of porogen on optical characteristic and therefore on photochemical UV-hardening mechanism is discussed. The achieved mechanical properties are explained on a basis of the percolation of rigidity theory and random network concepts. References [1] A. M. Urbanowicz, K. Vanstreels, D. Shamiryan, S.

This work attempts to study the catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapours in a pilot scale FCC riser in terms of hydrodynamics, Residence Time Distribution (RTD) and chemical reactions by CFD simulation. NREL’s Davison Circulating Riser (DCR) reactor was used for this investigation. CFD simulation was performed using 2 -D Eulerian–Eulerian method which is computationally less demanding than the alternative Euler-Lagrangian method. First, the hydrodynamic model of the riser reactor was validated with the experimental results. A single study of time-averaged solid volume fraction and pressure drop datas was used for the validation. The validated hydrodynamic model was extended to simulate hydrodynamic behaviors and catalyst RTD in the Davison Circulating Riser (DCR) reactor. Furthermore, the effects on catalyst RTD were investigated for optimising catalyst performance by varying gas and catalyst flow rates. Finally, the catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapours in the DCR riser was attempted for the first time by coupling CFD model with kinetics. A kinetic model for pyrolysis vapours upgrading using a lumping kinetic approach was implemented to quantify the yields of products. Five lumping components, including aromatic hydrocarbons, coke, non–condensable gas, aqueous fraction, and <b>non–volatile</b> heavy compounds (<b>residue)</b> were considered. It was found that the yield of lumping components obtained from the present kinetic model is very low. Thus, the further research needs to be carried out {{in the area of the}} kinetic model development to improve the yield prediction...|$|R

This technique can yield very high flow rates [> 1000 l/m] and high purity [< 50 ppb of contaminants {{such as water}} vapor, non-volatile residues, and trace metals. ]. The process uses microwaves to quiescently evaporate the liquid enabling dramatic improvement in product purity.

The SAW resonators operate at a resonant frequency of approximately 200 MHz- 2, 000 MHz which enables the NVR monitor to detect molecular contamination {{on the order of}} 10. sup. - 11 g-cm. sup. - 2 to 10. sup. - 13 g-cm. sup. 2. The NVR monitor utilizes active temperature control of (SAW) resonators to achieve a stable resonant frequency. The temperature control system of the NVR monitor is able to directly heat and cool the SAW resonators utilizing a thermoelectric element to maintain the resonators at a present temperature independent of the environmental conditions. In order to enable the direct heating and cooling of the SAW resonators, the SAW resonators are operatively mounted to a heat sink. In one embodiment, the heat sink is located in between the SAW resonators and an electronic circuit board which contains at least a portion of the SAW control electronics. The electrical leads of the SAW resonators are connected through the heat sink to the circuit board via an electronic path which prevents inaccurate frequency measurement...|$|E

40|$|In focused {{electron}} beam induced deposition (FEBID) acetylacetone {{plays a role}} as a ligand in metal acetylacetonate complexes. As {{part of a larger}} effort to understand the chemical processes in FEBID, the electron-induced reactions of acetylacetone were studied both in condensed layers and in the gas phase and compared to those of acetone. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the electron-induced decomposition of condensed acetone layers yields a non-volatile hydrocarbon residue while electron irradiation of acetylacetone films produces a <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> that contains not only much larger amounts of carbon but also significant amounts of oxygen. Electron-stimulated desorption (ESD) and thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) measurements reveal striking differences in the decay kinetics of the layers. In particular, intact acetylacetone suppresses the desorption of volatile products. Gas-phase studies of dissociative electron attachment and electron impact ionization suggest that this effect cannot be traced back to differences in the initial fragmentation reactions of the isolated molecules but is due to subsequent dissociation processes and to an efficient reaction of released methyl radicals with adjacent acetylacetone molecules. These results could explain the incorporation of large amounts of ligand material in deposits fabricated by FEBID processes using acetylacetonate complexes...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 28 th International Symposium on Chromatography celebrado en Valencia (España) del 12 al 16 de septiembre de 2010. Volatile {{compounds}} of {{wines are}} responsible for the aroma quality of wines. The physico-chemical interactions of these volatile compounds with the compounds that form part of the wine matrix could produce variations in their volatility and solubility, varying their levels in the headspace phase and therefore affecting their sensorial impact. The effects of single compounds from the wine matrix (polyphenols, mannoproteins, ethanol, etc) in the volatility of several aroma compounds have been previously studied. However, the effect of the whole non volatile macromolecules from real wine matrices on representative wine volatile compounds has not been study so far. Therefore, the aim of this study has been to evaluate the effect of five different types of wine matrices, obtained from a white, sparkling, young-red, aged-red and sweet wine, in the effective volatility of several wine aroma compounds (alcohols, esters, volatile phenols, terpenes, lactones, etc) by comparing the calibration lines obtained by HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis. The calibration lines were built with the 5 previously deodorized-lyophilized wines and reconstituted at the same level of ethanol (12 %). The behaviour of each aroma compound in the reconstituted wine matrices was compared to that of the same compound in a simple wine matrix with no-matrix effect (formed by tartaric acid and 12 % ethanol). The results of the comparison of the slopes (expressed as % respect to the simple matrix) showed differences that depended on the type of aroma compound and the composition of the wine matrix. In general, a retention effect of most of the volatile compounds by the matrix producing lower slopes than those in the simple matrices was observed. Esters showed, in general, lower slopes in wines with low <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> (white and sparkling-white wines) compared to the simple matrix. However, wines with high <b>non-volatile</b> <b>residue</b> (aged-red and sweet wines) presented both effects, higher and lower slopes, depending on the ester type. In addition, most of the alcohols were affected by the matrix {{in the case of the}} sparkling and white wines, while the sweet wine was the less affected. However, white wines did not show a retention effect for most of the studied terpenes and C 13 nor-isoprenoids. In general, volatile phenols, furanic compounds and lactones showed a matrix effect varying the calculated slopes between 83 % lower than the slope in the simple matrix for the 4 -vinylphenol in the young-red wine and 138 % higher for the cis-whiskey lactone in the sweet wine.
