5|$|Favourable {{macroeconomic}} {{performance has}} been a necessary but <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> {{to do so by}} simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are stored in a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.|$|E

Thus, where there is <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> land for construction, a new plane created in the air at medium altitude should be preferred to an American-style tower. These buildings, according to Lissitzky, also provided superior insulation and ventilation for their inhabitants.|$|E

If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E
5|$|Most of Jennings {{second term}} was spent {{grappling}} with the state's continuing financial difficulties. When tax revenues and land sales remained low, the state's revenue was <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to repay the bonds it used to finance internal improvements. The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly depreciate {{the value of its}} bonds, harming the state's credit and making it difficult to secure new loans.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking a}} single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is {{considered}} one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net. The victory was <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to secure a place in the second round, and Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o {{with a long}} throw-in {{down the}} right wing. The Cameroonian then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved {{the top of the}} crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, {{culminating}} with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, taking out the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day.

5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E

5|$|His early {{major works}} for the voice {{included}} The Masque at Kenilworth (1864); an oratorio, The Prodigal Son (1869); and a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea (1871).

Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were <b>not</b> <b>sufficient</b> to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E
