5|$|As a freshman, Amadi was {{designated}} a redshirt {{and did not}} play. As a backup cornerback in 2002, Amadi received substantial playing time due to personnel changes resulting in him being the sole backup to both starting cornerbacks. He continued in a reserve role through 2004. After backing up cornerback Theo Baines as a junior, Amadi started much of his senior season in place of Baines due to <b>nagging</b> injuries. In a November game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Amadi blocked a punt which was returned for a touchdown by teammate Darren Rus, marking the second time the two had combined to return a blocked punt for a touchdown. By early November, Amadi had recorded 22 tackles and two fumble recoveries in his final and most successful college season. Amadi also played on the college indoor track and field team while at Kansas when not involved in football activities.|$|E

Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts the lecture, and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E
5|$|The manga was {{not popular}} initially. Although he {{suspected}} the fighting genre would appeal more to its shōnen audience, Toriyama tried {{to stick to}} the Journey to the West adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed. Such as having the setting change each chapter, different enemies popping up, and different locations. It was only after he became tired of Torishima <b>nagging</b> about its popularity that Toriyama gave in and developed more battles with the first shown Tenkaichi Budōkai. Despite his reluctance, the author said it felt good when the series picked up in popularity at that point. However, he said he still tried to resist by returning to the adventure aspect with the Red Ribbon Army arc, and visiting Penguin Village from Dr. Slump to add comedy. When that did not work out, fighting became the main theme for the manga.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a <b>nagging</b> mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E
40|$|Nanosilver (<b>nAg)</b> is a {{considerably}} important nanomaterial {{due to its}} unique physical and chemical features and its intrinsic antimicrobial properties. Thus far, <b>nAg</b> has been widely applied {{in a variety of}} fields including biomedicine. Considering the safety and adverse influence, investigations into the biological fate and potential toxicity of <b>nAg</b> are essential for its safe and appropriate applications. In the current study, we exposed <b>nAg</b> to BALB/c mice at various concentrations via intraperitoneal (IP) and intravenous (IV) routes. The results showed that <b>nAg</b> was predominantly localized in liver and spleen in mice for both administration methods. Compared to IP administration, <b>nAg</b> was quickly removed and excreted from body with IV administration. The accumulation of <b>nAg</b> in livers caused remarkable hepatic toxicity. For the first time, we demonstrated that <b>nAg</b> had the ability to cross the placental barrier and accumulate in fetuses. Furthermore, the results of <b>nAg</b> tissue distribution in male mice revealed that <b>nAg</b> could pass through the blood-testis barrier, resulting in localization in testis. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic process of <b>nAg</b> in mice was also assessed in this study. Our findings indicated that <b>nAg</b> retention in mouse body could last for more than 4 months, and the silver content in the major recipient organs decreased in a time-dependent manner. Taken together, these results would be of great assistance in clarifying the safety issue of <b>nAg</b> as drug delivery and therapeutic agent, and in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying nAg-meditated toxicity...|$|R

5|$|Henderson had 468 more {{stolen bases}} {{in his career}} than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most {{prolific}} basestealer. In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League. In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he {{led the league in}} steals every season except 1987, when he missed part of the season due to a <b>nagging</b> hamstring injury, allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader. However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. (Tim Raines ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at 84%.) On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.|$|E
