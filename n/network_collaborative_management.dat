While many studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in an isolated source-destination system, applying cooperative relays to large-scale wireless networks remains challenging. We show that a system with cooperative relays can be penalized by the extra level of interference it produces. By examining the inter-dependency between interference management and cooperative relay strategies, we model the penalty {{by an increase in}} spectrum resource usage and translate it into a penalty in single-link throughput. This penalty serves as a reference for cooperative relay design in isolated scenarios. We then present two practical spectrum allocation mechanisms for collaborative relay systems with different fairness and utilization tradeoffs. Simulation results confirm our analytically findings.

40|$|Abstract: Internet {{security}} problems remain {{a major challenge}} with many security concerns such as Internet worms, spam, and phishing attacks. Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist {{of a large number}} of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical <b>collaborative</b> <b>network</b> security <b>management</b> system is proposed with an effective <b>collaborative</b> Unified Threat <b>Management</b> (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloudbased security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the <b>collaborative</b> <b>network</b> security <b>management</b> system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.

40|$|Organizational {{learning}} {{is a set of}} processes by which organizations improve their performance. Performance processes consist of one or more goals, outcome measures, constituent steps, and relevant people, artifacts, and knowledge. Learning processes furthermore require that the organization anticipates and attends to feedback, creates knowledge from that feedback, and takes action based on that knowledge. Relationships among people can be modeled as social networks in which network nodes represent people and network arcs represent relationships (e. g., friendship, advice, supervisor-subordinate relations) that change over time. Social networks also form a resource for collaborative knowledge management: the creation, exchange, and transformation of knowledge.

40|$|It is now {{argued that}} the network {{approach}} with its horizontal orientation operates differently to conventional management, which is internally focused and directed at arranging an organisation’s resources {{with the aim of}} achieving goals in an efficient manner. To manage is to bring about and/or accomplish goals. In contrast, to lead is to influence, guide, build commitment, and convince others of a vision. The tasks of management and leadership overlap. However, whereas leadership is identified as an important aspect of conventional <b>management,</b> within <b>collaborative</b> <b>network</b> <b>management,</b> leadership becomes a much more critical and interlinked component. There are a variety of leadership theories identified in conventional management, including transformational and charismatic leaders and distributive leadership.

Although many studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in an isolated single source-destination system, applying cooperative relays to a large-scale wireless network remains challenging.

[...] Furthermore, the jury [...] "applauded the evolution of the project's development process to an inclusive model involving multiple constituencies." [...] However, in his history of the development of San Francisco from the 1950s to the 1990s Chester Hartman recounts that the entire Yerba Buena project was long drawn out over 3 decades, born of a local struggle that included evictions and harassment of the previous tenants in the area, most of them old and poor, but who had joined together to fight for their rights. Even during the final design stages there were struggles regarding the building program. On hearing that the bowling alley was to be removed from the program, John Elberling, of the Tenants and Owners Development Corporation (TODCO), testifying at a San Francisco Development Agency (SFRA) hearing stated: [...] "That's your fun, to go to gala openings at the Museum of Modern Art and the galleries, dress up in black tie and evening gowns, enjoy the boutique wines and rub shoulders with the City's social elite. But what about the kids of the central city?...

A multi-case study approach was utilized to assess {{the degree to which the}} initiative helped catalyze adaptive co-management of public-lands riparian areas in seven cases in the western U. S. We found that the initiative influenced improvements in knowledge, trust among participants, and shared understanding. In most cases the initiative also helped work towards improvements in the management of specific community-level riparian issues. However, the initiative had a limited influence on the self-organization of new or modified governance arrangements capable of supporting cross-scale networks and ongoing cycles of learning from actions; key features of adaptive co-management. We found that employing adaptive co-management processes did not necessarily result in ongoing adaptive co-management arrangements. The presence of exogenous factors such as existing group capacity and facilitative leadership played an important role in determining whether the riparian initiative resulted in lasting outcomes, regardless of the approach used. We also identified constraints affecting the initiative's ability to facilitate authentic dialogue and develop high-quality agreements. Our results suggest that government-led interventions aimed at catalyzing the transformation of governance arrangements toward adaptive co-management may face significant barriers. Suggestions for future research include further investigation of the barriers and opportunities for government to help catalyze adaptive co-management, and the role of scale in the emergence of ongoing cross-scale networks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIndustrial Sustainability in most {{companies}} face several problems when a firm tries {{to promote a}} greener image while focusing on maintaining profitability in a long-term approach. This is a necessary strategic approach, as customers are becoming more committed to buying products that consider environmental concerns and additional regulations need to be followed. However, traditional marketing and distribution methods, management tools and the homogenization of requirements fail to fully integrate the implication of environmental regulations into their processes. In this scenario, a system for supporting the integration of environmental concerns, endogenous and exogenous regulations, and market trends would be very well received. This is a complex task to be realized by just one system, even when a firm’s various departments have an efficient networked communication system. A Distributed Decision Making System (DDMS) could be a useful approach.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Intestinal failure (IF) is a {{condition}} whose treatment requires advanced knowledge and techniques and a multidisciplinary approach. Intestinal failure is the endpoint of many intestinal diseases and may result in full recovery, in life-long parenteral nutrition, or {{in the death of}} the child. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the natural history of IF in children using a national network of resources. METHODS: Italian centers of pediatric gastroenterology merged in a national <b>network,</b> developing a <b>collaborative</b> <b>management</b> approach for children with IF. A consensus definition of IF was achieved. A database was set up to investigate the cause, epidemiologic factors, and natural history of IF. RESULTS: One hundred nine children were enrolled in 5 years. The cause of IF was: short bowel syndrome (n = 48), disorders of motility (n = 16), structural enterocyte defects (n = 14), multiple food intolerance (n = 10), autoimmune enteropathy (n = 7), and others or unknown (n = 14). The eventual outcome was closely related to the primary cause, ranging from full and permanent intestinal sufficiency in children with multiple food intolerance to high death rate or total dependance upon parenteral nutrition in those with structural enterocyte defects. Intermediate outcomes were observed for the other causes. Four children received intestinal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The network approach for IF provides an effective model to optimize resources and to investigate prospectively the natural history of IF.

However, several challenges exist in en- abling/implementing virtualization over the current static cellu- lar infrastructure. In the meantime, virtualization necessitates spectrum sharing and a <b>collaborative</b> <b>network</b> <b>management</b> entity that needs to provide efficient isolation strategies that protects multiple operators from suffering interference in shared frequency bands. Toward enabling virtualization, we develop a framework based on 3 GPP LTE, in which spectrum is reused temporally and spatially {{by more than one}} operator. The usage of spectrum is adjusted by network parameters and network parameters are configured based on power and radio propagation characteristics. In the framework, we minimally modify the radio resource manager (RRM) of LTE into a virtual resource manager. Further, the popular LTE enhanced inter- cell interference cancellation (eICIC) - time domain muting is adopted/modified as an isolation technique in a virtual setting. Extensive simulations are conducted that show the possibility of virtualization to enable every operator to obtain a higher throughput in an LTE network compared to operators working separately. However, the network configuration driven by trade- offs will have to be carefully considered to ensure isolation. In summary, a collaborative approach by multiple operators to share spectrum can be of mutual benefit...|$|R
