Introduction: The word "condiment" {{is usually}} defined in etymological works {{as that which}} is used along with something else to preserve or pickle. It comes from the Latin noun condimentum which {{is derived from the}} Latin verb condio meaning I preserve or pickle. No doubt the word condiment originally included only aromatic substances capable of preserving or helping to preserve food from spoiling, but its meaning has extended and we now include under the title "condiments" all the saline, mineral, acid, and sweet vegetable substances, spices and aromatic materials and herbs. It may be helpful further in understanding the substances included and their relation to give a classification of the more common and universally used. Condiment Thudichum arrange them in groups about as follows:- GROUP. I. Saline Condiments. 1. Common salt (Sodium Chloride). 2. Saltpetre or Nitre (<b>Nitrate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Potash).</b> This latter is used with common salt for preserving meat. Its particular function seems to be to maintain and heighten the color of the flesh. GROUP. II. Peppery Substances. 1. Black and White Pepper..

50|$|Belarus has a {{large number}} <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> {{deposits}} - all formed during the Famennian stage of the Late Devonian epoch - with commercial reserves of 10 billion metric tonnes. Three main potash deposits have been explored - Starobin (Старобінскае, Старобинское), Petrikov (Петрыкаўскае, Петриковское) and Oktyabrsky (Акцябрскае, Октябрьское). Sylvinite (potash ore) from these three deposits contains up to 28%, 40% and 39% KCl respectively. Amounts of MgCl2 vary from 0.15-0.3% in Starobin to 1.5-4% in Petrikov and more than 5% in Oktyabrsky. The Starobin deposit has 2.6 billion tonnes of proven reserves (A, B, C1 categories) and 600 million tonnes of prognosed reserves (C2 category) <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> Reserves at the Petrikov deposit are estimated at 2.12 billion tonnes (C1 and C2 categories) <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> The Oktyabrsky deposit has 637 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> (C1 and C2) and 1.1 billion tonnes of carnallite. Only the Starobin deposit is used, but in 2014 construction of the first factory in the Petrikov deposit began.
