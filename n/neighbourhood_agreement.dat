40|$|The {{contribution}} {{shows the}} methodology and investigation carried {{out for an}} intervention of regeneration/valorisation in one minor historical centre within inner Campania Region in Benevento province. These processes occurred during complex programmes and, in particular, during {{the development of the}} so-called “Contratto di Quartiere II” (= <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>Agreement</b> II) (MIT announcement 27 / 01 / 2004) in synergy with a PRUSST named as “Calidone” and Benevento Municipality as the lead. The aim of <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>Agreement</b> II was the revitalisation of a relevant part of the neglected historical centre of San Lorenzo Maggiore Municipality; this was financed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport in 2004 by means of 5. 5 million Euros committed for interventions of experimental regeneration of the historical urban fabric and in conjunction with the acquisition of several buildings by the Council, intending to provide 28 ERP houses and relevant services...|$|E
40|$|Housing {{policies}} in Italy are promoting {{a number of}} local projects including different people’s needs and installation of new home technologies, in order to adjust home routines and functionality to new lifestyles {{and needs of the}} changing community and family pattern. We illustrate advancement of housing in some case-studies as regards to smart home applications and tools for running or improving daily activities and home routines in a fast and effective way. In particular, we focus on recent issues and outcomes as follows:- City Councils promoted additional measures (<b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>Agreements)</b> for urban redevelopment plans in the perspective of the Design for All, and include for the first time compulsory and appropriately supportive technologies, from those regarding house to those related to the person’s safety and comfort. - Local Housing Agencies developed urban plans of new/remodelled housing areas, where designing a new house layout adjusted to the changing family pattern (single elderly or young married couples) is a major concern. - Mixed initiatives. We show some relevant case-studies as representatives of above initiatives. 1...|$|R

40|$|We study three high {{resolution}} cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-sized halos including a {{comparison with the}} corresponding DM-only counterparts performed with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. We analyse the stellar and the gas distribution and find one of our simulated galaxies with interesting Milky Way-like features with regard to several observational tests. Thanks to consistently tuned star formation rate and supernovae feedback, we manage to obtain an extended disk and a flat rotation curve with a circular ve-locity and a dark matter density in the solar <b>neighbourhood</b> in <b>agreement</b> with observations. With a careful look at the derivation of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, we also obtain compet-itive values for this criterion. Concerning the dark matter distribution, we explicitly show the interaction with the baryons and show how the dark matter is first contracted by star forma-tion and then cored by feedback processes. Analysing the clump spectrum, we find a shift in mass with regard to corresponding DM-only simulations and obtain a distribution of luminous satellites comparable with the Milky Way spheroidal dwarf galaxies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFindings from {{research}} on the association between the built environment and obesity remain equivocal but may be partly explained by differences in approaches used to characterize the built environment. Findings obtained using subjective measures may differ substantially from those measured objectively. We investigated the agreement between perceived and objectively measured obesogenic environmental features to assess (1) the extent of agreement between individual perceptions and observable characteristics {{of the environment and}} (2) the agreement between aggregated perceptions and observable characteristics, and whether this varied by type of characteristic, region or neighbourhood. Cross-sectional data from the SPOTLIGHT project (n[*]=[*] 6037 participants from 60 neighbourhoods in five European urban regions) were used. Residents' perceptions were self-reported, and objectively measured environmental features were obtained by a virtual audit using Google Street View. Percent agreement and Kappa statistics were calculated. The mismatch was quantified at neighbourhood level by a distance metric derived from a factor map. The extent to which the mismatch metric varied by region and neighbourhood was examined using linear regression models. Overall, agreement was moderate (agreement[*]<[*] 82 %, kappa[*]<[*] 0. 3) and varied by obesogenic environmental feature, region and <b>neighbourhood.</b> Highest <b>agreement</b> was found for food outlets and outdoor recreational facilities, and lowest agreement was obtained for aesthetics. In general, a better match was observed in high-residential density neighbourhoods characterized by a high density of food outlets and recreational facilities. Future studies should combine perceived and objectively measured built environment qualities to better understand the potential impact of the built environment on health, particularly in low residential density neighbourhoods...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the TP-AGB phase of low and intermediate-mass stars (0. 7 <=M/Msun_<= 5). To this aim, a semi-analytical model is constructed. A {{representative}} set of TP-AGB evolutionary models is calculated for two classes of initial metallicity (Z= 0. 02 and Z= 0. 008). A detailed analysis is performed to estimate {{the changes in the}} surface chemical composition caused by (1) the inter-shell nucleosynthesis and convective dredge-up; (2) nuclear burning in the deepest layers of the convective envelope; and (3) mass loss by stellar wind. The evolution of the abundances of 13 chemical elements (H, ^ 3 ^He, ^ 4 ^He, ^ 12 ^C, ^ 13 ^C, ^ 14 ^N, ^ 15 ^N, ^ 16 ^O, ^ 17 ^O,^ 18 ^O, ^ 20 ^Ne, ^ 22 ^Ne, ^ 25 ^Mg) is followed. In particular, the formation of carbon stars is investigated. We use the observed luminosity function of carbon stars in the LMC as the constraint whose fulfillment determines the values of the parameters adopted in the model, namely: the minimum core mass for dredge-up M_c_^min^ and the efficiency of the third dredge-up λ. In this way, we derive a proper calibration which the reliability of the chemical analysis stands on. We calculate the stellar yields for both metallicities to provide new data for these key-ingredients in the process of chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. The chemical composition of PNe is derived and compared to the latest experimental data both in the Galaxy and in the LMC, which leads to a partial agreement. Observed information on the correlation between luminosity and pulsational period of Mira and OH/IR variables is used to test further our results. Finally, we predict the initial-final mass relation and we compare it to the semi-empirically determined one for the solar <b>neighbourhood.</b> The <b>agreement</b> turns out to be satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that earlier acquired and frequently occurring words and concepts are processed significantly faster and more accurately than their later acquired and infrequently occurring counterparts. These effects have been observed across samples, languages, stimuli sets and experimental paradigms; suggesting that the phenomena are valid and reliable. However, a number of methodological limitations are evident in the literature and these issues have hindered attempts to identify the nature and loci of these effects. These limitations were subsequently addressed in this thesis. This enabled the researcher to investigate the effects of age-of-acquisition (AoA) and word frequency during perceptual processing, semantic processing, indirect lexical access, direct lexical access, lexical retrieval and articulation. The programme of research outlined in Chapter 2 consisted of a systematic series of laboratory experiments which each assessed different aspects of cognitive processing. Standardised, semi-factorial stimuli sets were also designed and implemented throughout this programme of research to improve validity. Furthermore, methodological and analytical elements were controlled across the experimental paradigms to ensure reliability and facilitate the comparison of AoA effects across levels of processing. Chapters 3 – 8 report six studies consisting of twelve semi-factorial experiments in which the effects of AoA and word frequency were investigated during perceptual identification, picture-category verification/falsification, picture-name verification/falsification, immediate picture naming task, immediate word reading task and delayed picture naming. These experiments revealed that AoA exerted significant, strong and consistent effects on processing speed across all of the experimental paradigms reported in this thesis when word frequency, imageability, concreteness, familiarity, visual complexity, orthographic <b>neighbourhood</b> density, picture-name <b>agreement</b> and word length were controlled. However, word frequency did not exert a consistent, significant effect when AoA, imageability, concreteness, familiarity, visual complexity, orthographic <b>neighbourhood</b> density, picture-name <b>agreement</b> and word length were controlled. Therefore, AoA effects were independent of word frequency effects. Chapter 9 reports a comparison of the AoA effects which were observed across these experimental paradigms. This chapter indicates that while AoA influenced all levels of processing, the effects were strongest during tasks which required indirect lexical access and arbitrary mapping between levels of representation. These findings lend considerable support to the multi-loci perspective and dispute both the Phonological Completeness Hypothesis (PCH) and the Semantic Hypothesis (SH). Indeed, AoA is a prominent factor which plays a pivotal role in determining processing speed throughout cognitive system rather than solely during one level of processing. Based on the evidence reported in this thesis, the researcher subsequently argues in Chapter 10 that there is at least one, strong locus of AoA effects which occurs during semantic-lexical encoding and at least one weaker locus which occurs during perceptual-semantic encoding...|$|R
40|$|We have {{extended}} our analytical chemical evolution modelling {{ideas for the}} Galaxy to the Magellanic Clouds. Unlike previous authors, we assume neither a steepened IMF nor selective galactic winds, since among the alpha-particle elements only oxygen shows a large deficit relative to iron and a similar deficit {{is also found in}} Galactic supergiants. Thus we assume yields and time delays identical to those we previously assumed for the solar neighbourhood. We include inflow and non-selective galactic winds and consider both smooth and bursting star formation rates, the latter giving a better fit to the age-metallicity relations. We predict essentially solar abundance ratios for primary elements and these seem to fit most of the data within their substantial scatter. Our LMC model also gives a remarkably good fit to the anomalous Galactic halo stars discovered by Nissen & Schuster (1997). Our models predict current ratios of SNIa to core-collapse supernova rates enhanced by 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively relative to the solar <b>neighbourhood,</b> in fair <b>agreement</b> with ratios found by Cappellaro et al. (1993) for Sdm-Im relative to Sbc galaxies, but these ratios are sensitive to detailed assumptions about the bursts. We consider that the high SNIa/SNII ratios found in some late-type galaxies are related to their star formation history rather than to any differences in the IMF.
