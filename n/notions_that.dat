5|$|Wong's {{image and}} career {{have left a}} notable legacy. Through her films, public {{appearances}} and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Asian Americans to white audiences {{during a period of}} overt racism and discrimination. Asian Americans, especially the Chinese, had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society but Wong's films and public image established her as an Asian-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Asian immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> the East and West were inherently different.|$|E

On 16 May 1648 {{he was one of the}} many noble Polish prisoners who fell into the hands of Bohdan Khmelnytsky at the battle of Zhovti Vody, but he was quickly ransomed. He participated in the defense of the Kudak Fortress, which {{surrendered}} on 26 September; he was once again captured and not released until the autumn of 1649, in the aftermath of the Treaty of Zborov. He served as a porucznik in the hussar chorągiew of hetman Mikołaj Potocki, a military judge deputized by the hetman, and a member of his staff, meeting with the new king of Poland, John Casimir Vasa. He was part of the fighting at the battle of Berestechko and battle of Bila Tserkva in 1651. He received the title of chorąży of Sandomierz, and was elected the military deputy for the Sejm in January 1652. According to Nagielski, Czarniecki, while returning from the Sejm, witnessed the massacre of Polish prisoners in the aftermath of the battle of Batoh; This scene made him reject the <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> a compromise with the enemies of the Commonwealth was a likely or desired outcome. Podhorodecki however notes that another historian, Wojciech Jacek Długołecki, questions Czarniecki's presence there, and concludes that we have no conclusive proof whether Czarniecki was present at Batoh, The massacre further escalated the hostilities and the surrounding hatred; illustrating that is a letter Czariecki wrote soon after the battle, in which he promised that if enough military forces are gathered and given to him, he will leave few Ruthenians alive.|$|E

25|$|Similar <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> suggest animals—like fish, for example—feel less pain {{are brought}} forth {{today as a}} {{justification}} for animal cruelty.

25|$|Abul Ala Maududi, {{the founder}} of Jamaat-e-Islami, {{wrote a book called}} Human Rights in Islam, in which he argues that respect for human rights has always been {{enshrined}} in Sharia law (indeed that the roots of these rights {{are to be found in}} Islamic doctrine) and criticizes Western <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> there is an inherent contradiction between the two. Western scholars have, for the most part, rejected Maududi's analysis.|$|E
25|$|Robert Venturi, {{a renowned}} Philadelphia architect, {{conducted}} a little-known planning {{study in the}} 1970s that attempted to understand the dynamics of historicism and tourism, <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> have come into their own in contemporary times.

25|$|His {{relations}} with Dobrogeanu-Gherea was tense, but, in 1890, Zamfirescu {{approved of the}} decision taken by the Theodor Rosetti cabinet to award the Romanian citizenship to the philosopher (at a time when his Jewish ethnicity {{would have made it}} extremely hard to obtain). The same year, Dobrogeanu-Gherea published a study of Zamfirescu's works. The two opposed each other over economic ideas and Dobrogeanu-Gherea's application of Marxism to the Romanian society—examining the works of Achille Loria, Zamfirescu collected Marxist-inspired <b>notions</b> <b>that,</b> he believed, contradicted Dobrogeanu-Gherea from inside his own camp. When Maiorescu and the Romanian Marxists were engaged in a lengthy polemic, he added his own arguments in support of the former.|$|E

25|$|Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith {{published}} {{a detailed description}} of the osteology and biomechanics of T. rex forelimbs. They concluded that T. rex arms were actually rather strong, but with a much smaller range of motion than other carnivorous dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Deinonychus. They concluded that while the arms of Tyrannosaurus would have been useless for actually killing prey, they may have been used to hold on to prey while the tyrannosaur killed it with bites. They dismissed <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> the forelimbs were useless or that Tyrannosaurus rex was an obligate scavenger. This study was the complete description of Tyrannosaurus forelimbs in the scientific literature.|$|E

The possibility that money from the project had been given to former Clinton associate David Hale, a witness in the Whitewater investigation, led to the appointment of Michael J. Shaheen as a special investigator. Shaheen subpoenaed Scaife, who testified before a federal grand jury in the matter.|$|E
25|$|Many criticisms {{focus on}} {{versions}} of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's anthropic cosmological principle, which are teleological <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> tend to describe the existence {{of life as a}} necessary prerequisite for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Shermer, and others claim that the stronger {{versions of the}} anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house barnacles. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been fine-tuned through natural selection to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The {{confined}} {{gender roles}} for females allow {{the strength of}} characters such as Grace and Blanche to remain hidden. They're manipulation, sneaking, and hiding from the law is only successful because they are women. Both are believed by the other characters in the novel to be too submissive, shallow, and dim-witted {{to get away with}} their goals. Blanche soon discovers that she can unravel more of Grace and Everett's treacherous plot to inherit Mumsfield's money because she is in the house, whereas Nate, as a man, is working outside. The biggest twist, that Grace is the mass murderer and plotter of cheating her family out of their fortune, exposes the sexist <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> the readers themselves have rooted into their culture. Throughout the plot, Everett seems to be the most likely suspect to the murders and manipulation of the will, all the while making it easier for Grace to get away with mass murdering anyone in her path. Even though, the heroine and the villain of this novel evoke different emotions from the readers, there is a larger feminist theme in play that is made possible by taking advantage of the cloak of invisibility that society has placed over women.|$|E
