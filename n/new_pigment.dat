50|$|As with tattoos, {{permanent}} makeup can {{be difficult}} to remove. Common techniques used for this are laser resurfacing, dermabrasion (physical or chemical exfoliation), and surgical removal. Camouflaging—adding a <b>new</b> <b>pigment</b> which counteracts the tattoo color and attempts to emulate normal skin color is considered a poor choice by professionals. Removal is more painful and laborious than the tattooing itself.|$|E

The shade {{will also be}} used on AMD's new Radeon Pro WX and Pro SSG {{professional}} GPUs for the energy efficiency that stems from its near-infrared reflecting property. In June 2016, Australian company Derivan released the YIn Mn (known as Oregon Blue) as an experimental colour in their artist range (Matisse acrylics). This experimental product was made using the Shepard licensed pigment.|$|E

50|$|From the 8th century {{until the}} early 20th century, the most {{important}} scarlet pigment used in western art was vermilion, made from the mineral cinnabar. It was used, along with red lake pigments, by artists from Botticelli and Raphael to Renoir. However, in 1919 commercial production began of an intense new synthetic pigment, cadmium red. made from cadmium sulfide and selenium. The <b>new</b> <b>pigment</b> became the standard red of Henri Matisse and the other important painters of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|In one way, {{adding a}} <b>new</b> <b>pigment</b> {{would allow them}} to see a wider range of the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum. Secondly, new random connections would create wavelength opponency and the new wavelength opponent neurons would be much more sensitive than the non-wavelength opponent neurons.This is the result of some wavelength distributions favouring excitation instead of inhibition. Both excitation and inhibition would be features of a neural substrate during the formation of a second pigment. Overall, the advantage gained from increased sensitivity with wavelength opponency would open up opportunities for future exploitation by mutations and even further improvement.|$|E
50|$|Seurat's palette {{consisted}} of the usual pigments of his time such as cobalt blue, emerald green and vermilion. Additionally, Seurat used then <b>new</b> <b>pigment</b> zinc yellow (zinc chromate), predominantly for yellow highlights in the sunlit grass {{in the middle of}} the painting but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments. In the century and more since the painting's completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown—a color degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat's lifetime. The discoloration of the originally bright yellow zinc yellow (zinc chromate) to brownish color is due to the chemical reaction of the chromate ions to orange-colored dichromate ions.In the third stage during 1888-89 Seurat added the colored borders to his composition.|$|E

30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was is the identification of the pigments present in the clock faces of the Parliament Palace clock tower in Helsinki to aid in its restoration. The environmental conditions in Finland are very demanding {{in the vicinity of the}} Senate Square and near the coast. The paint on the clock face layers was cracking and flaking and were too loose and deteriorated to be preserved. It was important to determine the original colour of the clock face for restoration purposes. Gaining knowledge about the other paint layers, provided a history of pigments used in Finland after 1822. In the 19 and 20 th centuries a wide range of <b>new</b> industrial <b>pigments</b> replaced traditional pigments used in Europe. However, there are only few case studies about the use of these <b>new</b> <b>pigments</b> in 19 th century buildings in Finland [24].|$|R

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1968. Bibliography: leaves [132]- 137. xi, 137 l graphs, tablesAlthough many quinoid {{pigments}} are known, {{until recently}} only six naphthoquinone pigments had been isolated from animals and identified. However in 1966, Moore, Singh and Scheuer reported {{the isolation of}} over thirty different pigments from the sea urchins Echinothrix diadema Linn. and E. calamaris Pallis. In addition to five known compounds, eleven <b>new</b> <b>pigments</b> were identified. Several of these pigments were juglone derivatives containing hydroxyl and acetyl functions. The synthesis of only three acetyljuglone derivatives has been described previously. This paucity of data showed {{the need for further}} work in this area. For this reason and in order to facilitate structure proof of several <b>new</b> <b>pigments,</b> the introduction of hydroxyl and acetyl groups into juglone and several of its derivatives was investigated. As a result of this work the structures of three pigments (i, ii, iii) were confirmed, but a fourth compound (iv) did not display identical properties with those of the natural pigment. In addition to the synthesis of compounds i-iv, five new juglone derivatives (v-ix) were prepared. Compounds v-ix have not yet been reported as naturally occurring substances. Investigation of new methods for the synthesis of juglone and naphthazarin derivatives was unsuccessful...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>new</b> <b>pigment</b> “moraxanthin ” {{was found}} in natural samples from a fish {{mortality}} site in the Inland Bays of Delaware, USA. Pure cultures of the species, tentatively named Chattonella cf. verruculosa, and natural samples contained this pigment as a dominant carotenoid. The pigment, obtained from a 10 L culture of C. cf. verruculosa, was isolated and harvested by HPLC and its structure determined from MS and 1 D- and 2 D-NMR. The data identified this pigment as a new acylated form of vaucheriaxanthin called moraxanthin after the berry like algal cell.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the search}} for stable and {{enduring}} organic colors, we have combined indigo, a historical and industrially important chromophore, with silicalite, the MFI zeolite. The resulting pigment presents high color durability against most external agents (e. g., light, temperature). This stability and its physical properties are explained by the association of indigo with an inert mineral, which is also influenced by formation conditions such as the initial indigo concentration and the thermal treatment. The formation of the indigo@silicalite hybrid, particularly diffusion of the organic molecule, is monitored by optical spectroscopies, thermogravimetric measurements, and X-ray diffraction. Color stability is attested when indigo enters the pores of the zeolitic host, thus forming a <b>new</b> <b>pigment</b> with characteristics {{similar to those of}} Maya Blue.
