40|$|A {{comparative}} {{picture of}} the trends in GHG emissions during 1990 – 2007 in Austria and Romania, within EU – 27 tendencies context, with accent on agriculture sources is presented. The green house gases (GHG) emissions fromagriculture in EU – 27 during 1990 and 2007 are mainly represented by methane (CH 4) nitrous oxide (N 2 O) andammonia (NH 3). In Austria, all sectors have a decreasing tendency during the analyzed interval. In Romania, duringanalyzed interval, the GHG emissions from Romanian sector agriculture had the same decreasing tendency. The maindriving force in methane and nitrous oxide decrease, in both studied situations (Austrian and Romanian agriculturalsectors, respectively), is the declining <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> <b>Concerning</b> the ammonia emissions, the decrease was theresult of improvement in different sectors: housing, storage, spreading, and animal diets...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was (i) to select options for enteric methane {{abatement}} in French conditions, while maintaining production and changing practices but not systems, and (ii) to evaluate the extent of abatement and its cost from 2010 to 2030. Two options were selected: supplying unsaturated fats, and using nitrates as a dietary additive in the diet. Unsaturated fats resulted in a higher abatement, because a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> were <b>concerned</b> by the option, but incurred a higher total cost and a higher cost per ton of CO 2 -equivalent avoided. The results were sensitive to methodology, and to variations in the choice of fats and in the cost of ingredients, among other factors. Given their cost, evaluated in the frame of a marginal abatement cost curve, these options will require strong public policies for their applicatio...|$|R

This article discusses when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to be used can best be estimated from previous experience and when a simple power and sample size calculation should be performed. Even complicated experimental designs requiring sophisticated statistical models for analysis can usually be simplified to a single key or critical question so that simple formulae {{can be used to}} estimate the required sample size. Approaches to sample size estimation for various types of hypotheses are described, and equations are provided in the Appendix.

[...] Russell and Burch suggested {{a reduction in}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> used could be achieved in several ways. One general way in which great reduction may occur is by the right choice of strategies in the planning and performance of whole lines of research. A second method is by controlling variation amongst the animals used in studies, and a third method is careful design and analysis of studies.With the advent, development and availability of computers since the original 3Rs, large data-sets can be used in statistical analysis, perhaps most notably meta-analysis, thereby reducing the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> used. In some cases, by using previously published studies, the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> can be totally avoided by avoiding unnecessary replication. Modern imaging techniques also allow reductions in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> used, for example by providing greater information from each animal used.|$|R
