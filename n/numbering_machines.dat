The little group of appliances for telegraphic communication attracted the Master so strongly that his delightfully prepared dinner, served by a number of charmingly dexterous girls, waited for a space. The habit of smoking had almost ceased {{from the face of the}} earth, but when he expressed a wish for that indulgence, enquiries were made and some excellent cigars were discovered in Florida, and sent to him by pneumatic despatch while the dinner was still in progress. Afterwards came the aeronauts, and a feast of ingenious wonders in the hands of a latter-day engineer. For the time, at any rate, the neat dexterity of counting and <b>numbering</b> <b>machines,</b> building machines, spinning engines, patent doorways, explosive motors, grain and water elevators, slaughter-house machines and harvesting appliances, was more fascinating to Graham than any bayadère.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling jobs on a pool of machines. Each job requires multiple machines on which it executes in parallel. For each job, the input specifies release time, deadline, processing time, profit and the <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> required. The total <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> may be different at different points of time. A feasible solution is a subset of jobs and a schedule for them such that at any timeslot, the total <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> required by the jobs active at the timeslot does not exceed the <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> available at that timeslot. We present an O(log(Bmax/Bmin)) approximation algorithm, where Bmax and Bmin are the maximum and minimum available bandwidth (maximum and minimum <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> available over all the timeslots). Our algorithm and the approximation ratio are applicable for more a general problem that we call the Varying bandwidth resource allocation problem with bag constraints (BAGVBRAP). The BAGVBRAP problem is a generalization of some previously studied scheduling and resource allocation problems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> minimization scheduling problem with restricted processing time on identical parallel environment. Up to now, some multi-machines scheduling problems, including identical parallel environment etc., {{have concentrated on}} minimizing make-span under a fixed <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> (facilities or resources). However, in real situations, the make-span may be pros-pected by accumulative experiences of expert or desired due-date of customer, etc. So, we treat the make-span with fixed and prospected constant, and focus on scheduling to minimize <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> with the fixed make-span. For solving the problem, a linear time algorithm based on the bin packing alforithm is proposed and its validity is discussed. In addition, by supposing the make-span with decision variable, we consider a bi-objective problem to minimize <b>number</b> of <b>machines</b> and desired make-span, simultaneously. For solving the above problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on a bin packing algorithm and binary search...|$|R
