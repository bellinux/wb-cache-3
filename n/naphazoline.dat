40|$|<b>Naphazoline</b> is a {{peripheral}} 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist commonly {{used as a}} topical decongestant. In Japan, over-thecounter antiseptics often contain <b>naphazoline</b> to effect local hemostasis. We present the first case involving the development of hypercoagulopathy, with kidney and liver dysfunction, following a <b>naphazoline</b> overdose. A 22 -year-old Japanese woman {{with a history of}} depression ingested 160 mL of a commercially available antiseptic containing 0. 1 % <b>naphazoline.</b> Three days later, she was brought to the emergency department because of general fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed cool, pale extremities. Laboratory data showed evidence of severe kidney and liver dysfunction (creatinine, 9. 2 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase, 2948 IU/L), hypercoagulation (D-dimers, 58. 3 g/mL), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 90, 000 /L). After infusion of normal saline, intravenous administration of alprostadil, and hemodiafiltration, her organ function completely recovered. Because both the kidney and liver express 2 -adrenergic receptors, their failure was likely associated with <b>naphazoline</b> overdose-induced hypoperfusion. The most plausible causes of hypercoagulation are peripheral low perfusion and subsequent microthrombus formation. This case illustrates that severe organ dysfunction can occur following over-the-counter antiseptic ingestion and serves as a caution for both drug manufacturers and healthcare professionals...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic {{headache}} is an incapacitating condition afflicting {{patients at}} least for 15 days per month. In the most cases it is developed {{as a consequence of}} an excessive use of symptomatic drugs. Case: Here we report the case of a 34 year-old man suffering from chronic headache possibly related to the overuse of <b>naphazoline</b> nitrate nasal decongestant, used to treat a supposed chronic sinusitis. However, the patient did not suffer from sinusitis, but from a medication overuse headache (ICHD-II 8. 3; ICD- 10 44. 41) that appeared to be due to excessive use of <b>naphazoline.</b> Conclusion: The use of <b>naphazoline</b> nitrate may result in an analgesic effect upon first use, through activation of adrenergic and opioidergic systems, followed by a pro-migraine effect via a late induction of an inflammatory cascade, modulated by nitric oxide and arachidonic acid. The observation that <b>naphazoline</b> detoxification relieved the patient’s headache, indicates that prolonged use of <b>naphazoline</b> may cause chronic headaches. Therefore, physicians should ask for details on the use of nasal decongestants in patients complaining of chronic headache, as they could potentially be suffering from a medication-overuse headache...|$|E

40|$|Nine pale perspiring {{drug addicts}} with drowsiness, nausea, headache, normal blood {{pressure}} and marked sinus bradycardia with premature ventricular beats were seen at the Casualty Department soon after alleged i. v. cocaine administration. Eight were treated with atropine, as the bradycardia suggested intoxication with a parasympathomimetic compound. Seven were discharged in good condition after a few hours' observation. One patient developed a blood pressure of 150 / 120 mmHg after atropine. Subsequently, a hemiparesis was found and an intracerebral haematoma was evaluated at surgery. Another patient was admitted forthwith to the CCU. He did not receive any medication and recovered within two days. Urinalysis of these two patients disclosed contents of <b>naphazoline,</b> a powerful alpha-adrenergic agent. Samples of the alleged cocaine contained 97 % <b>naphazoline</b> HCl.

Pretreatment of animals with the α 1 -antagonist prazosin (20 μg/kg - 1. min 1 for 30 min) prevented the inhibitory effects of phenylephrine on reticuloruminal motility.

The second method is a chemometric-assisted spectrophotometric method in which partial least squares (PLS- 1) and partial component regression (PCR) were used for the determination of NAP, CLO and NAP Deg using the information contained in their absorption spectra of ternary mixture. The third method is a TLC-densitometric one where NAP, CLO and NAP Deg were separated using HPTLC silica gel F 254 plates using ethyl acetate:methanol:ammonia: (8 : 2 : 0. 5, by volume) as the developing system followed by densitometric measurement at 245 nm.

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} {{the effects of}} circadian rhythm, feeding time, age, general anesthesia, and ocular hypotensive compounds on intraocular pressure (IOP) of the Tibetan monkey (Macaca thibetana). Methods: Tibetan monkeys were trained for IOP measurement with the TonoVet ® rebound tonometer without sedation or anesthesia. Their circadian IOP fluctuation was monitored every 3 h. Effects of changing the feeding time, general anesthesia, age (2 – 3 year-old versus 8 – 15 year-old animals), and various pharmacological agents, such as travoprost, timolol, <b>naphazoline</b> and spiradoline, on IOP were also evaluated. Results: After behavioral training, conscious Tibetan monkeys were receptive to IOP measurement. The lowest and highest IOP values in a circadian cycle were recorded at 3 : 00 AM (19. 8 ± 0. 4 mmHg, mean±SEM, n= 12) and noon (29. 3 ± 0. 9 mmHg), respectively. Changing the feeding time from 11 : 30 AM to 12 : 30 PM lowered the noon IOP to 25. 1 ± 1. 2 mmHg. General anesthesia lowered IOP in these monkeys, while IOP of young and mature animals were similar. Three hours after topical ocular administration, travoprost reduced IOP by 5. 2 ± 0. 6 mmHg (n= 6, p< 0. 001), and timolol reduced IOP by 2. 8 ± 0. 7 mmHg (p< 0. 05). <b>Naphazoline</b> and spiradoline lowered IOP by 4. 8 mmHg and 2. 5 mmHg (both p< 0. 001), respectively, 2 h after drug administration.
