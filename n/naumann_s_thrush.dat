40|$|Introduction As {{many of you}} know, the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (AOU) {{has changed}} some generic names and rearranged the taxonomic order for shortbirds in the {{expanded}} genus Tringa and for the terns. This Spring Report uses the new taxonomic order. Observers (thank you, I think!) submitted {{a huge amount of}} data that I distilled for this report; I entered more than 3, 500 sightings into my database, which allows for a comprehensive overview of what birds were doing this spring. As has been the case the last few years, there were several record or near-record early arrival dates, some requiring documentation (readily supplied!) and some only marginally early relative to the previous early dates. Shorebirds had several of these early dates, with at least eight species at or near record-early arrival dates. Two species of grebes and Blue-winged Teal also were early. Three species of swallow, along with Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Rock Wren, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Thrush,</b> and American Pipit also showed up early.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the thermodiffusion behavior of microemulsion droplets {{of the type}} H 2 O / n-alkane / C 12 E 5 using the n-alkanes: n-octane, n-decane, n-dodecane and n-tetradecane [1]. In {{order to determine the}} thermodiffusion behavior of these microemulsion droplets, we apply the infrared thermal diffusion forced Rayleigh scattering technique. We measure the Soret coefficient S_T as function of the structure upon approaching the emulsification failure boundary (efb) and {{as a function of the}} radius of the spherical o/w-microemulsion droplets close to the efb. By varying the chain length of the n-alkanes we are able to study the thermodiffusion behavior of droplets of different sizes at the same temperature. In the investigated range a linear dependence of the Soret coefficient as function of the radius was found. Using a proposed relationship between the Soret coefficient and the temperature dependence of the interfacial tension, the transition layer, l, could be determined for the first time [2]. Additionally, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments are performed to determine the size and to examine in detail the shape of the microemulsion droplets, as the droplets are known to elongate with increasing temperature. Close to the efb the scattering curves could be quantitatively described by a combination of a spherical core-shell form factor and sticky hard sphere structure factor.

Many of these populations have seen significant declines since the 1960 <b>s.</b> The Wood <b>Thrush,</b> Hylocichla mustelina, is one such species. Shade coffee and other agroforestry practices show potential for benefiting migratory species, but the quality of coffee habitat and optimal habitat characteristics for Wood Thrushes remain unknown. I surveyed a spatially complex, agricultural landscape in Honduras outside the recognized winter range of the Wood Thrush and radio-tagged 46 individuals within rustic coffee farms during the winters of 2012 and 2013. I used telemetry data to calculate metrics of habitat quality based on survival and persistence while also collecting detailed vegetation measurements across the landscape and within each home-range. Mixed-effects models were used to explore the relationship of survival, transience, movement, and home-range size to habitat class and microhabitat variables. Estimates for all four habitat quality metrics fell within the range of previous studies and were significantly related to habitat attributes. Structure, edge habitat, and shade coffee played a key role determining habitat quality. The variables associated with higher habitat quality in this study suggest that rustic coffee farms have potential to support wintering wood thrush populations. However, estimates of survival may be overly optimistic in the presence of transients, transforming highly fragmented landscapes into winter sinks. This study highlights several gaps in current scientific knowledge about some of the most essential questions of Wood Thrush winter ecology...|$|R

Analysis of the high-affinity IgE {{receptor}} genes reveals epistatic {{effects of}} FCER 1 A variants on total IgE levels and eczema risk. Allergy 2009; DOI: 10. 1111 /j. 1398 - 9995. 2009. 02297. x. Abstract Background: High levels of total and allergen-specific IgE levels {{are a key}} feature in allergic diseases. The high-affinity receptor for IgE, which is composed of one alpha (FCER 1 A), one beta (FCER 1 B), and two gamma (FCER 1 G) subunits, represents the central receptor of IgE-induced reactions. In a genome-wide association scan, we recently identified associations between functional FCER 1 A variants and total serum IgE levels. Previous studies had reported linkage and association of FCER 1 B variants with IgE and atopic traits. The FCER 1 G gene {{has not yet been}} investigated with regard to atopy. Filaggrin (FLG) is the strongest known risk gene for eczema, in particular the allergic subtype of eczema. Methods: We investigated the association of FCER 1 A, FCER 1 B, and FCER 1 G variants with IgE in a large population-based cohort (n = 4261) and tested for epistatic effects using the model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MB-MDR) method. In addition, we investigated a potential interaction between FLG and FCER 1 A variants in a large collection of eczema cases (n = 1018) and population controls. Results: Three strongly correlated FCER 1 A polymorphisms were significantly associated with total and specific IgE levels as well as allergic sensitization. No associations were seen for FCER 1 B and FCER 1 G. After adjustment for FLG effects, a significant epistatic effect of the FCER 1 A variants rs 10489854 and rs 2511211 on eczema risk was detected. Conclusions: These results suggest that FCER 1 A variants by themselves and in combination influence IgE levels and act synergistically to influence eczema risk. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In many {{experimental}} situations {{temperature gradients}} {{play an important}} role. For almost one century thermogravitational columns and thermal field flow fractionation channels {{have been used for}} separation and characterization of soft matter [1]. Presently researchers design synthetic microswimmers, micromotors, or micropumps to explore possibilities to recycle waste heat using such microfluidic devices [2]. So far there is only a limited microscopic understanding of thermodiffusion or thermophoresis in simple and complex fluids. In the recent years some progress has been made for non-polar systems, but in aqueous systems the situation is complicated due to charge effects and strong specific cross interactions so that simple thermodynamic concepts fail. On the other hand a detailed understanding of aqueous systems would be valuable due to important applications in biotechnology, where the response to temperature gradients is successfully employed to monitor the reaction kinetics of large proteins with small ligand molecules. The strong sensitivity of proteins and other water soluble biomolecules is probably caused by a change in the hydration layer, which is influenced by subtle conformation changes induced by the binding of the ligand molecule. To get a better understanding we systematically investigated various small water soluble molecules, microemulsions and colloids by a holographic grating method called infrared thermal diffusion forced Rayleigh scattering (IR-TDFRS). In order to elucidate the mechanism in biomolecules we performed systematic measurements of amides, which often serve as model systems for peptide bonds, an essential structure in proteins. Using the experimental data determined for fomamide we perform numerical finite-element simulations in hydrothermal pores and show that a combination of thermophoresis and convection can lead to accumulation of formamide up to concentrations where nucleobases are formed [3], which might serve as an ‘origin-of-life’ scenario. Further we study microemulsion droplets as soft colloids to investigate the relation between the interfacial tension and the Soret coefficient [4]. Other important contributions in aqueous systems are charge effects, which we study systematically for colloidal model systems. Using a theoretical model by Dhont and Briels [5] valid for spherical charged colloids with arbitrary double-layer thicknesses we are able to calculate the surface charge density of the colloid. It turns out that the surface charge density agrees well with electrophoresis measurements. The same holds for an extended model for charged colloidal rods [6].
