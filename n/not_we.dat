None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or <b>not</b> <b>we</b> went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is <b>not,</b> <b>we</b> fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman.

500|$|In the {{original}} line-up, Hanneman, King and Araya {{contributed to the}} band's lyrics, and King and Hanneman wrote the music with additional arrangement from Lombardo, and sometimes Araya. It is unclear why Lombardo has never received any writing credits in Slayer's history. Araya formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which sometimes overshadowed the creative input of King. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music was a [...] "free-for-all": [...] "It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry – it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good, we use it; if <b>not,</b> <b>we</b> don't." ...|$|E
500|$|When writing new material, {{the band}} writes the music before the lyrics.

500|$|Although {{there was}} state support for many industries, {{this did not}} extend to shipping. In 1933 de Valera's {{government}} established the Turf Development Board, turf became Ireland's primary source of fuel during the emergency years and was stockpiled as imported coal was in short supply. In 1935 civil servants in deValera's own department warned him of the consequences a war {{would have on the}} importation of fuel. He ignored that warning. Earlier, in 1926 the Ports and Harbours Tribunal was initiated. The tribunal received [...] "abundant evidence" [...] of [...] "inefficient, uneconomic and extravagant management". It submitted a report in 1930 with recommendations which were not implemented until after the war. The tribunal observed [...] "the public generally do <b>not,</b> <b>we</b> fear, appreciate the importance of our harbours ...".

500|$|The second {{movement}} {{begins with}} a soft instrumental introduction of thirteen measures. Horns and trombones play the same note three times in unison, which is later sung with the word [...] "" [...] ("Realize" [...] or Recognize")“. The rhythm dominates the introduction. The choir picks up, singing it first on a unison C, marked ppp. After several repetitions, the phrase is continued in measure 26: [...] "" [...] (that the Lord is God) with a rapid crescendo from Lord to God. The Swiss musicologist Michael Eidenbenz, writing for the , describes the section as mystical and reflective (""). In a middle section the divided voices express, mostly in homophony, gradually more intense: [...] "" [...] (He has made us, and <b>not</b> <b>we</b> ourselves, his people). The continuation [...] "" [...] (and the sheep of his pasture) is presented expessively by the lower voices, then repeated by pure triads in A major and B major, first by three soprano parts, then three alto parts, finally three male voices, with a solo violin.|$|E
500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said {{of a possible}} reunion, [...] "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate {{if it were a}} nostalgia act: [...] "The thing that would make me decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or <b>not</b> <b>we</b> could do new songs". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement.... But, if Dave feels good about it and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{action was}} {{considered}} a defeat by the Admiralty and was not reported in the London Gazette. The British naval authorities were particularly disturbed by rumours that began to circulate concerning the death of Captain Corbet and the behaviour of his crew during the battle. Prominent among these rumours was the suggestion that Corbet had been murdered by his disaffected crew: historian William James wrote in 1827 that [...] "There are many who will insist, that Captain Corbett's [...] death-wound was inflicted {{by one of his}} own people." [...] although he goes on to point out the unlikelihood of Corbet being shot by one of his own cannon. He gives more credence to the story that Corbet committed suicide to avoid the shame of defeat, that he [...] "cut the bandages from his amputated limb, and suffered himself to bleed to death." [...] This story was also alluded to in Edward Pelham Brenton's 1825 history: [...] "Corbet did <b>not</b> (<b>we</b> fear would not) survive his capture". The truth of Corbet's end will never be known with certainty, although James ultimately concludes that Corbet's wound was almost certainly a mortal one and thus the most likely cause of death.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} came for {{development}} in the Everglades at the proposition of an expanded airport after Miami International Airport outgrew its capacities. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined, and the chosen location was [...] north of Everglades National Park. The first sentence of the U.S. Department of Interior study of {{the environmental impact of}} the jetport read, [...] "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park". When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create [...] of raw sewage a day and [...] of jet engine pollutants a year, the project met staunch opposition. The New York Times called it a [...] "blueprint for disaster", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: [...] "It is a test of whether or <b>not</b> <b>we</b> are really committed in this country to protecting our environment." [...] Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded at 79years old to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it. Nixon instead established Big Cypress National Preserve, announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program [...]|$|E

This is the proof: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them' (Matt. 18:20). How much more is he present where the whole congregation is assembled to his honor! But that his body is literally eaten is far from the truth and the nature of faith. It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught).
