40|$|<b>Net</b> <b>Curtains</b> is a site {{specific}} project involving {{local women}} {{in the creation of}} an ambitious art installation that will embellish every glazed surface of Elmfield House. Artist Andrea Stokes has devised the installation as part of the joint THG/Devon Guild intoLACE exhibition. <b>Net</b> <b>Curtains</b> {{take the form of a}} drawing that appears to thread its way throughout the entire building, creating the illusion of one continuous delicate <b>net</b> <b>curtain</b> which engages with the house and its history, and incorporates designs from traditional hand-made Honiton lace, for which the town has been renowned since the 17 th century. <b>Net</b> <b>Curtains</b> will cover the inside of every window and will be visible both inside and out. The drawing will be transferred by hand onto the windows by a team of 25 local women in a two-day event. The completed drawing will form a major part of the exhibition intoLACE at the Thelma Hulbert Gallery. intoLACE brings together artists whose work references lace and runs from 14 September – 2 November 2013 in partnership with Devon Guild of Craftsmen...|$|R

50|$|Munsing was a {{technologist}} and {{the company}} received several patents, including those for a <b>crocheting</b> <b>machine</b> in 1891 and a union suit in the early 1890s. The union suit was the company's flagship product until the 1920s, when central heating made it less useful. It continued until 1969. The cream-colored garment became iconic and was featured in the company's advertising with children and adults outfitted in them; underwear ads had never used live models before. In 1894 Munsing left the company.|$|R

50|$|When done by machine, it may {{be called}} a whip stitch or, sometimes, a Merrow Crochet Stitch, after the first sewing machine {{that was used to}} sew a blanket stitch. This machine was {{produced}} and patented by the Merrow Machine Company in 1877. The defining characteristic of the <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> is its ability to sew with yarn and stitch thick goods with a consistent overlock edge. From 1877-1925 the machine evolved dramatically, and consequently so did the capacity of manufacturers to produce goods with the whip stitch.|$|R

The results showed that blending ratio significantly influenced WVT and WER. Moreover, antibacterial activity of the elastic warp- knitted fabric was tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in accordance with AATCC 90 - 2011. Finally, the extension- stress value curves were used to analyse the elastic stretching property, and the fabric exhibited greater breaking elongation and lower stress value in the walewise than in the weft direction...|$|R

50|$|The Merrow® Sewing Machine Company, {{best known}} for inventing the {{overlock}} sewing machine is a manufacturer of sewing machines. After the explosion of his gunpowder mill in 1837, in 1838 J.M. Merrow built a knitting mill on the same site. The company developed <b>crocheting</b> <b>machines</b> for its own use and by 1887 evolved to design, build and market sewing machines exclusively. During its early decades it was organized as a partnership under various names: established in 1838 as Joseph M. Merrow & Sons by J. Makens Merrow, then Pitkin, Merrow, & Co., renamed Merrow Manufacturing Co. in 1857, then Merrow and Millard in 1863, J.B. Merrow and Sons in 1870, and incorporated as The Merrow Manufacturing Company in 1893. Originally all of its manufacturing was done at facilities in Merrow, Connecticut and then in Hartford, Connecticut after 1894. The company is currently based in Fall River, Massachusetts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{improvement}} {{of science and}} technology, the life quality was significantly promoted. And people are more aware of health care. It has been proved that bamboo charcoal owns special properties including air purification, water refining, deodorization, far-infrared radiation, and anion release, thus it is widely applied on textile industry in form of fiber and yarn after mixing with its power. This study aims to seek for the optimal twist number of bamboo charcoal (BC) /Nylon(NY) / stainless steel(SS) wrap yarn. And then {{the one or two}} wrap yarns were fed into <b>crocheting</b> <b>machine</b> to weave BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics with different structures. Afterwards, the far-infrared radiation, anion amount, air permeability were discussed by changes of number of layers. The result shows that, as increasing layers of BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics, the far-infrared radiation and air permeability both decrease; but all the single-layer warp knitted fabric reaches above 0. 8, corresponding with the functional standards...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{sportswear}} fabrics are functional textiles {{that can}} mitigate the impaired muscles caused by exercises for the wearers, {{but they can}} also cause discomfort and skin allergy. This study proposes combining two yarns to form functional composite yarns, by using a twisting or wrapping process. Moreover, a different twist number is used in order to adjust the performance of functional composite yarns. A <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> is used to make the functional composite yarns into functional elastic knits that are suitable for use in sportswear. The test results show that, in comparison to the non-processed yarns, using the twisted or wrapped yarns can considerably decrease the water vapor transmission rate of functional elastic knits by 38 %, while also improving their far infrared emissivity by 13 %, water absorption rate by 39 %, and air permeability by 136 %. In particular, the functional elastic knits that are made of B-wrapped yarns (bamboo charcoal- wrapped yarns), composed of 20 twists per inch, have the optimal diverse functions...|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a <b>machine</b> for <b>crochet</b> stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces <b>crochet</b> <b>machines</b> based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R
