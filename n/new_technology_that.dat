5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. <b>New</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E

25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.|$|E
25|$|Device {{fingerprinting}} is {{a fairly}} <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. ThreatMetrix {{is one of the}} leading vendors of device fingerprinting. This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.|$|E

25|$|The fast-paced and {{unpredictable}} nature {{of health care}} places nurses at risk for injuries and illnesses, including high occupational stress. Nursing is a particularly stressful profession, and nurses consistently identify stress as a major work-related concern and have among {{the highest levels of}} occupational stress when compared to other professions. This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> must be mastered, the emotional labor involved in nursing, physical labor, shift work, and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including sleep disorders, depression, mortality, psychiatric disorders, stress-related illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing compassion fatigue and moral distress, which can worsen mental health. They also have very high rates of occupational burnout (40%) and emotional exhaustion (43.2%). Burnout and exhaustion increase the risk for illness, medical error, and suboptimal care provision.|$|E
25|$|Disco music {{developed}} from the funk, soul and jazz of the 1960s, becoming a distnct genre music, eschewing the raw sound of a four piece garage band and embracing a <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> employed driving synthesizers with booming a bass drum that defined the dsco sound with a steady quarter note beat, or Four on the floor (music). It was not unusual for producers to contract local symphony and philharmonic orchestras as well as session musicians to further refine the sound. Disco, a musical idiom that was strongly associated with minorities (pimarily black and gay audiences), became a phenomenon in dance clubs and anf discothèques in the 1970s. Many of the major disco nightclubs were in New York, including Paradise Garage, Danceteria and Studio 54, attracting notable followers from the art world, such as Andy Warhol, the fashion industry like Karl Lagerfeld, as well as socialites, musicians and intellectuals. This tradition continued in the 1980s with Area, Danceteria, and Limelight.|$|E

500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the show, the producers had wanted to introduce the concept of LMDs, which Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb noted [...] "have always been part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history in the comics". However, they were unable to before , which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. For the fourth season, they particularly pushed the idea, and Whedon noted that the introduction of Ghost Rider and mysticism allowed the series to introduce <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> could launch LMDs in a way deemed rewarding, so the Ghost Rider storyline [...] "dovetails" [...] into the LMD storyline. The S.H.I.E.L.D. program is introduced through the character Aida, an android. Additionally, with LMDs chosen as one of the pods for the season, Whedon said the writers questioned, [...] "what are all the things we could do? You don't want to do the ones that have been done , and you don't want to leave any on the table." [...] One idea that [...] "we knew we wanted to have early on" [...] was to reveal that the majority of S.H.I.E.L.D. have been replaced at once.|$|E
