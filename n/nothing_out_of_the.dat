5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E

500|$|Now {{qualified}} to play county cricket for Kent, Chapman played only {{four times in}} the County Championship in 1925, preferring to establish himself in his new career in the brewery trade. Not sufficiently wealthy to play cricket full-time as an amateur, Chapman's business commitments frequently restricted his appearances on the cricket field. During his limited first-class appearances in 1925, he scored 207 runs at 25.87 and Wisden said that he [...] "did <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common".|$|E

[...] More new commemoratives followed in 1935, and over 20 in 1936. [...] These issues included the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, issued to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, although <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary is known to have taken place in that city's musical life in 1886.|$|E

500|$|Engels {{felt that}} the three largest {{influences}} on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series The Wild Wild West, Mayberry R.F.D. and The Fugitive—the inclusion of a one-armed character in Twin Peaks was a direct homage to the latter of these. Engels has {{also noted that the}} series would make use of normal, conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a [...] "familiar" [...] framework, allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop—he particularly cites this episode's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example, as it offers <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary other than the single domino which Jennings is playing with at all times, drawing attention to the item as it is the only thing which seems out of place.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{retained}} {{his position}} in the Cambridge team in 1920 and once more played against Oxford. In the University Match, he was ineffective with the ball as the damp conditions did not suit his style of bowling. At {{the end of the}} Cambridge term, Gilligan, playing as an amateur, made his Sussex debut. The Times later commented that in 1920, Gilligan was [...] "known as a fast but unreliable bowler, a dashing and vulnerable batsman and a mid-off without his equal in England". Wisden commented on his 1920 performance: [...] " [...] remained stationary, doing <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common either as bowler or batsman for Cambridge, and proving a decidedly expensive bowler for Sussex". In all first-class cricket, he scored 624 runs at an average of 17.33 and took 81 wickets at 23.55. Subsequently, Gilligan left Cambridge and joined Gilbert Kimpton & Co., a general produce merchants in London in which his father was a senior partner.|$|E
500|$|After {{falling in}} love with Suzette, and finding out about her {{marriage}} in September 1993, Vela wrote down his feelings (which he had kept private) for her. The resulting song was titled [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and it was given to Selena to record for the album. When her brother asked her to do a fifth take she replied that she had enough of recording the song. She informed him that [...] "what you got there is what you got" [...] and left to go shopping. A.B. approached Pérez and asked if he would be interested in working with Vela on [...] "Ya No", a song he had written. The band was scheduled to record the album the following day. Pérez found his behavior <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary and worked on the song with Vela throughout the night [...] "coming up with drum sounds and programing the pattern for it," [...] finalizing its structure before sunrise. Despite A.B.'s assistance, Pérez was dumbfounded that he was given creative control over the track. He added electric guitar riffs and complemented it with his own musical style.|$|E

500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} {{as a part}} of History Matters, a campaign led by several heritage organisations such as the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.|$|E
500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary.

He fired four torpedoes from two hit, stopping the target dead in the water. Daspit immediately fired another two; these hit as well. With no enemy anti-submarine combatants in sight, Daspit then took time to carefully maneuver into a textbook firing position, [...] square off the target's beam, where he fired nine more Mark14s and observed all with his periscope (despite the Japanese firing at it).

2500|$|Commaille was {{not merely}} a player on the tour to England in 1924; he was vice-captain to Herbie Taylor. Taylor, however, played in every single {{first-class}} match on the tour and Commaille's captaincy was restricted to three non-first-class games against Scotland, Durham and a side from North Wales. But he played regularly as an opening batsman, and scored 1118 first-class runs {{at an average of}} 25.40 and with a highest score of 85. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote of him that he was a [...] "good useful batsman but, though a consistent run-getter, he did <b>nothing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common". Commaille appeared in all five Test matches. In the first game, Commaille's first Test for 14 years, the South Africans were sensationally dismissed in the first innings for just 30, and Commaille, batting at No 5, was the not-out batsman, though he made only one run; in the second innings, he resumed his more normal position as an opener and made 29 out of 101 runs added while he was at the wicket, as the South Africans totalled 390, still losing the match by an innings. The second Test had a similar result, but more even batting by the South Africans; Commaille was out without scoring in the first innings but made 37, his best of the series, in the second. Commaille's personal pattern for the series was maintained in the third Test, with just four runs in the first innings and 31 in the second. Rain ruined the final two Tests, but Commaille was not successful in either of his two single innings in these matches: he failed to reach double figures in the first innings in all five Tests.
