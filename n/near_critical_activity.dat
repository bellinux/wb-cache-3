40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Uncertainty of the {{magnitude}} of merge bias in PERT networks has long been of concern to the users of this technique. A simple rule to determine {{the magnitude}} has since posed a problem. The purpose of this thesis was to develop empirical rules to correct the time estimates of cumulative durations as found by the conventional PERT calculation procedure. Merge bias is insignificant when a large number of activities in a network are left skewed. The bias is also considered insignificant when the <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> path length is less than 70 percent of the critical path length. However, merge bias is a definite factor in other networks. The bias is significant and cannot be ignored in a network whose nodes on the critical path have a large number of <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> paths with lengths close to the critical path length. Monte Carlo simulations of series and parallel networks were used to compare experienced durations with PERT calculated times to realize the same node of the networks. Since the average simulated time is accurate, the difference was the bias in the PERT calculated time. The difference is made up of two distinct parts, activity bias and merge bias. Simulation of series networks was used to study activity bias. The activity bias in the PERT time estimates was then eliminated to determine the magnitude of merge bias. Simulation of the networks required a computer program to perform the large number of iterations of the networks whose activities three time estimates are specified and follow a beta distribution. A FORTRAN IV based PERT simulation model was developed. The model was tested for its accuracy and capability of generating the beta distributions of the activities. The results of the model were compared with the ordinates of a beta distribution generated by a computer program. The magnitude of bias for typical small parallel networks was used to form the merge bias correction table. The table gives the magnitude of bias due to two activities merging at a node. One of these <b>activities</b> is the <b>critical</b> <b>activity.</b> The table is entered corresponding to the mean and standard deviation values of the <b>critical</b> and <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> <b>activities</b> of the network. It is based on the symmetrical distributions of the two activities. The <b>activity</b> on the <b>critical</b> path is always assumed to have symmetrical distribution. A rule was developed to normalize the <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> path <b>activity</b> when it has an unsymmetrical distribution. In such cases, the mode of the activity is treated as the mean of an equivalent symmetrical distributed activity. To determine the magnitude of bias for merge nodes on the critical path of a network, the process of segregating the network at the merge nodes into small networks is described. The decomposition of limited networks into typical small networks is shown. A rule for the reduction of activities in series to an equivalent single activity is given. When more than two activities merge at a node, the rule of addition of the bias due to each path is developed and substantiated...|$|R
40|$|Schedule {{performance}} index of earned value method {{has been reported}} to generate misleading results at times because of its failure to account for criticality of activities involved, as well as its consideration of monetary values for status reporting. Material {{can be seen as the}} fuel needed to execute projects from inception to completion. Material installed provides good indicators of progress achieved onsite vis-a-vis project schedule performance. It correlates well with the role of the schedule {{performance index}} (SPI) of the earned value method (EVM). Material is recognized to have a significant impact on achieved progress for physical completion of project activities. This research project is geared towards circumventing the reported limitations of SPI. It presents a study on the development of material status index (MSI) in support of the EVM. Unlike the SPI, the newly developed index accounts for the criticality of project activities. The proposed method is composed of two modules: current status reporting and forecasting. The two modules include selection procedures that allow for engaging only (<b>near)</b> <b>critical</b> <b>activities</b> and by extension materials that impact project duration. Consideration of criticality is carried out via the total float of each activity and percent float (i. e. the ratio of float to activity duration). The MSI current status reporting and also the forecasting module utilize seventy-eight material based factors recognized to cause schedule delays. These factors were reported in a number of studies, primarily the CII 2011 publication on “Global Procurement and Materials Management” and are refined by means of a structured interview with an experienced practitioner in industry. They cover the supply chain material management before material reaches the site, once material is at the gate prior to acceptance and finally onsite. A simulation model is run utilizing users’ judgment on the applicability of these probable causes to the project at hand in the forecasting module. The simulated model serves as input to the forecasting function, which generates probability distribution of forecasted project duration. MSI, can independently and jointly with SPI provide root causes behind problems encountered during project execution. MSI serves to provide added value in alerting management to take corrective actions. A software application is developed to automate the process of MSI method. To validate and demonstrate capabilities of the developed method, it is implemented on two case studies in which the introduced enhancements are clearly portrayed. Forecasting duration and reporting on schedule performance of project using MSI as a supplementary index is more accurate because of its consideration of level of criticality of project activities and capturing actual progress represented by quantity of material installed...|$|R

Particle-in-cell simulations show that both the speed of laser-driven collisionless electrostatic shock and the energies of shock-accelerated ions can be greatly enhanced due to fast laser propagation in <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> density plasmas. However, a response time longer than tens of laser wave cycles is required before the shock formation in a <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> density plasma, {{in contrast to the}} quick shock formation in a highly overdense target. More important, we find that some ions can be reflected by the collisionless shock even if the electrostatic potential jump across the shock is smaller than the ion kinetic energy in the shock frame, which seems against the conventional ion-reflection condition. These anomalous ion reflections are attributed to the strongly time-oscillating electric field accompanying laser-driven collisionless shock in a <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> density plasma.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of float and critical path {{are central to}} analyzing activity networks in project management. In resource-constrained projects, schedule multiplicity {{makes it difficult to}} calculate float and identify <b>critical</b> <b>activities</b> accurately.

The investigations included the total yield of the extracts, the recovery and the purity of artemisinin, and then the growth inhibition of rat hepatic stellate cells. Experimental results showed that dry supercritical carbon dioxide extraction was favorable for obtaining high purity but low recovery of artemisinin. A pre-loaded and continuing addition of co-solvent was proved {{to be effective in}} enhancing the recovery of artemisinin for the extractions <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> region. Moreover, a two-factor and three-level response surface methodology (RSM) disclosed that carbon dioxide added with 16. 25 wt. % of N-hexane, extracted at 2700 psig (18. 72 MPa), 33 degrees C, and for a period of 1. 5 h could obtain an optimal value of quick recovery and high purity of artemisinin.

40|$|Although today’s {{the trends}} of {{technology}} scaling {{is going to}} bring higher performance computer systems, it also results in integrated circuits (ICs) suffering from increasing Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations and adverse aging effects. In most cases, these reliability threats manifest themselves as timing errors on critical speed-paths of the circuit, if a large design guard band is not reserved. In this work, three categories of resilient design methodologies for timing errors are introduced and their ability to recovery error-state is evaluated. In addition, we propose an architectural approach consists of detection and recovery phases to recover circuit from BTI-induced aging. The BTI impact on the <b>critical</b> and <b>near</b> <b>critical</b> paths performance is continuously examined through a small logic circuit which is responsible to assert error signal in the case of any timing violation in those paths.
