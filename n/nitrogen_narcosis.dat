5|$|When inhaled at high partial {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30m in scuba diving), nitrogen is an anesthetic agent, causing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis.</b> In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis.</b> Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
25|$|Heliox is {{a mixture}} of oxygen and helium and is often used in the deep phase of a {{commercial}} deep dive to eliminate <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Depth rules: Gas consumption, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> and {{decompression}} obligation {{increase with}} depth, {{and the effects}} of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> may be more critical in a cave due to the high task loading and presence of combinations of hazards. Cave divers are advised not to dive to depths exceeding the planned depth and the applicable range of their equipment and the breathing gases in use, and to keep in mind this effective difference between open water depth and cave depth. Excessive depth is frequently cited as a contributory factor in fatal incidents involving fully trained cave divers.|$|E
25|$|Henry's law - as {{pressure}} {{increases the}} quantity of gas absorbed by the tissues {{of the human body}} increases. This mechanism is involved in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> oxygen toxicity and decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Trimix is {{a mixture}} of oxygen, {{nitrogen}} and helium and is often used at depth in technical diving and commercial diving instead of air to reduce <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> and to avoid the dangers of oxygen toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen (N2) is a {{diatomic}} gas and {{the main}} component of air, the cheapest and most common breathing gas used for diving. It causes <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> in the diver, so its use is limited to shallower dives. Nitrogen can cause decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{blending}} for {{scuba diving}} (or Gas mixing) is the filling of diving cylinders with non-air breathing gases such as nitrox, trimix and heliox. Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall {{safety of the}} planned dive, by {{reducing the risk of}} decompression sickness and/or <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> and may improve ease of breathing.|$|E
25|$|Controlled {{tests have}} not shown {{breathing}} nitrox {{to reduce the}} effects of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> as oxygen seems to have similarly narcotic properties under pressure to nitrogen; thus one should not expect a reduction in narcotic effects due only {{to the use of}} nitrox. Nonetheless, {{there are people in the}} diving community who insist that they feel reduced narcotic effects at depths breathing nitrox.|$|E
25|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Stillson's {{team was}} sent to salvage the F-4 submarine. On these deep dives, the divers {{experienced}} the debilitating effects of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> leading them to try the addition of helium to their breathing mix. The navy salvage operations then came {{under the direction of}} Warrant Gunner C. L. Tibbals who led teams through the salvage of the S-51 in 1925 and S-4 in 1927 further establishing the naval need for equipment, training, and procedures for rescue operations.|$|E
25|$|Technical diving {{and the use}} of rebreathers are increasing, {{particularly}} in areas of the world where deeper wreck diving is the main underwater attraction. Generally, recreational diving depths are limited by the training agencies to a maximum of between 30 and 40 meters (100 and 130 feet), beyond which a variety of safety issues such as oxygen toxicity and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> significantly increase the risk of diving using recreational diving equipment and practices, and specialized skills and equipment for technical diving are needed.|$|E
25|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the dissolved state, such as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
25|$|The diver {{must be able}} to {{positively}} {{identify the}} gas supplied by any one of the several demand valves that these configurations require, to avoid potentially fatal problems of oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> or divergence from the decompression plan which may occur if an inappropriate gas is used. One of the conventions puts the oxygen rich gases to the right, Other methods include labelling by content and/or maximum operating depth (MOD), and identification by touch. Often several or all of these methods are used together.|$|E
25|$|Filling {{cylinders}} with {{a mixture}} of gases has dangers for both the filler and the diver. During filling there is a risk of fire due to use of oxygen and a risk of explosion due to the use of high-pressure gases. The composition of the mix must be safe for the depth and duration of the planned dive. If the concentration of oxygen is too lean the diver may lose consciousness due to hypoxia and if it is too rich the diver may suffer oxygen toxicity. The concentration of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, are planned and checked to avoid <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> and decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Doolette and Mitchell's {{study of}} Inner Ear Decompression Sickness (IEDCS) {{shows that the}} inner ear may not be well-modelled by common (e.g. Bühlmann) algorithms. Doolette and Mitchell propose that a switch from a helium-rich mix to a nitrogen-rich mix, as is common in {{technical}} diving when switching from trimix to nitrox on ascent, may cause a transient supersaturation of inert gas within the inner ear and result in IEDCS. They suggest that breathing-gas switches from helium-rich to nitrogen-rich mixtures should be carefully scheduled either deep (with due consideration to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis)</b> or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from the decompression. Switches should also be made during breathing of the largest inspired oxygen partial pressure that can be safely tolerated with due consideration to oxygen toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{underwater}} environment {{presents a}} constant hazard of asphyxiation due to drowning. Breathing apparatus used for diving is life-support equipment, and failure can have fatal consequences - {{reliability of the}} equipment {{and the ability of}} the diver to deal with a single point of failure are essential for diver safety. Failure of other items of diving equipment is generally not as immediately threatening, as provided the diver is conscious and breathing, there may be time to deal with the situation, however an uncontrollable gain or loss of buoyancy can put the diver at severe risk of decompression sickness, or of sinking to a depth where <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> or oxygen toxicity may render the diver incapable of managing the situation, which may lead to drowning while breathing gas remains available.|$|E
25|$|However Doolette and Mitchell's {{more recent}} study of Inner Ear Decompression Sickness (IEDCS) shows that the inner ear may not be well-modelled by common (e.g. Bühlmann) algorithms. Doolette and Mitchell propose that a switch from a helium-rich mix to a nitrogen-rich mix, as is common in {{technical}} diving when switching from trimix to nitrox on ascent, may cause a transient supersaturation of inert gas within the inner ear and result in IEDCS. They suggest that breathing-gas switches from helium-rich to nitrogen-rich mixtures should be carefully scheduled either deep (with due consideration to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis)</b> or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from the decompression. Switches should also be made during breathing of the largest inspired oxygen partial pressure that can be safely tolerated with due consideration to oxygen toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen is the {{essential}} component for any breathing gas, at a partial pressure of between roughly 0.16 and 1.60 bar at the ambient pressure. The oxygen is usually the only metabolically active component unless the gas is an anaesthetic mixture. Some of the oxygen in the breathing gas is consumed by the metabolic processes, and the inert components are unchanged, and serve mainly to dilute the oxygen to an appropriate concentration, and are therefore also known as diluent gases. Most breathing gases therefore are a mixture of oxygen and one or more inert gases. Other breathing gases {{have been developed to}} improve on the performance of ordinary air by reducing the risk of decompression sickness, reducing the duration of decompression stops, reducing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> or allowing safer deep diving.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{perceived}} differences between technical {{and other forms of}} recreational diving is the associated hazards, of which there are more associated with technical diving, and risk, which is often, but not always greater in technical diving. Hazards are the circumstances that may cause harm, and risk is the likelihood of the harm actually occurring. The hazards are partly due to the extended scope of technical diving, and partly associated with the equipment used. In some cases the equipment used presents a secondary risk while mitigating a primary risk, such as the complexity of gas management needed {{to reduce the risk of}} a fatal gas supply failure, or the use of gases potentially unbreathable for some parts of a dive profile to reduce the risk of harm caused by oxygen toxicity, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> or decompression sickness for the whole operation. Reduction of secondary risks may also affect equipment choice, but is largely skill-based. Training of technical divers includes procedures which are known from experience to be effective in handling the most common contingencies. Divers proficient in these emergency drills are less likely to be overwhelmed by the circumstances when things do not go according to plan, and are less likely to panic.|$|E
500|$|The {{recreational}} diving depth {{limit set}} by the EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 level 2 [...] "Autonomous Diver" [...] standard is [...] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from [...] for PADI divers, (this is the depth at which <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), [...] specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council, [...] for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, and [...] for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air.|$|E
500|$|Krypton is {{considered}} to be a non-toxic asphyxiant. Krypton has a narcotic potency seven times greater than air, and breathing an atmosphere of 50% krypton and 50% natural air (as might happen in the locality of a leak) causes narcosis in humans similar to breathing air at four times atmospheric pressure. This is comparable to scuba diving at a depth of [...] (see <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis)</b> and could affect anyone breathing it. At the same time, that mixture would contain only 10% oxygen (rather than the normal 20%) and hypoxia would be a greater concern.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen dissolves in {{the blood}} and body fats. Rapid {{decompression}} (as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) {{can lead to a}} potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness (formerly known as caisson sickness or the bends), when nitrogen bubbles form {{in the blood}}stream, nerves, joints, and other sensitive or vital areas. Bubbles from other [...] "inert" [...] gases (gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen) cause the same effects, so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> but does not prevent decompression sickness.|$|E
500|$|Narcosis while diving (also {{known as}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> inert gas narcosis, raptures of the deep, Martini effect) is a {{reversible}} alteration in consciousness that occurs while diving at depth. It {{is caused by}} the anesthetic effect of certain gases at high pressure. The Greek word ναρκωσις (narcosis) is derived from narke, [...] "temporary decline or loss of senses and movement, numbness", a term used by Homer and Hippocrates. Narcosis produces a state similar to drunkenness (alcohol intoxication), or nitrous oxide inhalation. It can occur during shallow dives, but does not usually become noticeable at depths less than [...]|$|E
500|$|Submersibles {{and rigid}} {{atmospheric}} diving suits (ADS) enable diving {{to be carried}} out in a dry environment at normal atmospheric pressure. An ADS is a small one-person articulated submersible which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate joints to allow bending, while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. An ADS can be used for dives of up to about [...] for many hours. [...] It eliminates the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving – the occupant need not decompress, {{there is no need for}} special gas mixtures, and there is no danger of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> – at the expense of higher cost, complex logistics and loss of dexterity.|$|E
500|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> {{is caused}} by the {{pressure}} of dissolved gas in the body and produces [...] to the nervous system. This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver's ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease motor skills, and worsen performance in tasks requiring manual dexterity. As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may not be aware of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless. Since the choice of breathing gas also affects the depth at which narcosis occurs, the table below represents typical manifestations when breathing air.|$|E
500|$|Beneath the surface, {{freediving}} {{is necessarily}} restricted to shallow descents. Pearl divers have traditionally greased their skins, put cotton {{in their ears}} and clips on their noses, and dived to [...] with baskets in order to collect pearl oysters. Human eyes are not adapted for use underwater, but vision can be improved by wearing a diving mask. Other useful equipment includes fins and snorkels. Scuba equipment allows underwater breathing, permitting hours of time beneath the surface. The depths that {{can be reached by}} divers and the length of time they can stay underwater is limited by the increase of pressure they experience as they descend and the need to prevent decompression sickness as they return to the surface. Recreational divers are advised to restrict themselves to depths of under [...] beyond which the danger of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> increases. Deeper dives can be made with specialized equipment and training.|$|E
500|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air {{in an air}} separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds (since those compounds give off alpha particles). Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over [...] to keep the diver from experiencing oxygen toxemia, the lethal effect of high-pressure oxygen, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis,</b> the distracting narcotic effect of the nitrogen in air beyond this partial-pressure threshold, and carbon dioxide poisoning (hypercapnia), the panic-inducing effect of excessive {{carbon dioxide in the}} bloodstream. After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.|$|E
500|$|The most {{straightforward}} way {{to avoid}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>narcosis</b> is for a diver to limit the depth of dives.

Most recreational dive schools will only certify basic divers to depths of , and at these depths narcosis does not present a significant risk. Further training is normally required for certification up to [...] on air, and this training should include a discussion of narcosis, its effects, and cure. Some diver training agencies offer specialized training to prepare recreational divers to go to depths of , often consisting of further theory and some practice in deep dives under close supervision. Scuba organizations that train for diving beyond recreational depths, may forbid diving with gases that cause too much narcosis at depth in the average diver, and strongly {{encourage the use of}} other breathing gas mixes containing helium in place of {{some or all of the}} nitrogen in air– such as trimix and heliox– because helium has no narcotic effect.
