5|$|Aposematic species do <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hide or stay {{still as}} cryptic organisms do, so aposematic {{individuals}} benefit from more freedom in exposed areas and can {{spend more time}} foraging, allowing them to find more and better quality food. Aposematic individuals can similarly make use of conspicuous mating displays.|$|E

5|$|After five {{successful}} seasons, Chris Carter {{wanted to}} tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film. He later explained that the main problem was to create a story for which the viewer would <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be familiar with the show's setting and the various story arcs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they do <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E

5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} {{because they had}} not been consulted prior to the issuance of the orders, the High Court observed that where the public interest is at stake the English courts have held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified manner. In a 1977 case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle did <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be complied with if the public interest so demanded.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be transported.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia {{in which}} each swimming style {{is associated with a}} vivid experience of a color. These synesthetes do <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E

5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, does <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E

She has come to believe Mulder's assertion that Boggs arranged everything. Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father again through Boggs. She tells him that she did <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hear anything, because she already knew what her father would have said.|$|E

Notably, pharmacists do <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.|$|E
5|$|She finally narrates {{the story}} of her {{abandonment}} to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she does <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E
