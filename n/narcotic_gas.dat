40|$|International audienceNitrogen-oxygen {{breathing}} mixtures, for pressures {{higher than}} 0. 5 MPa, decrease {{the release of}} dopamine in the rat striatum, due to the narcotic potency of nitrogen. In contrast, high pressures of helium-oxygen breathing mixtures of more than 1 - 2 MPa induce an increase of the striatal dopamine release and an enhancement of motor activity, {{referred to as the}} high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS), and attributed to the effect of pressure per se. It has been demonstrated that the effect of pressure could be antagonized by <b>narcotic</b> <b>gas</b> in a ternary mixture, but most of the <b>narcotic</b> <b>gas</b> studies measuring DA release were executed below the threshold for pressure effect. To examine the effect of narcotic gases at pressure on the rat striatal dopamine release, we have used two gases, with different narcotic potency, at sublethargic pressure, nitrogen at 3 MPa and argon at 2 MPa. In addition, to dissociate the effect of the pressure, we have used nitrous oxide at 0. 1 MPa to induce narcosis at very low pressure, and helium at 8 MPa to study the effect of pressure per se. In all the narcotic conditions we have recorded a decrease of the striatal dopamine release. In contrast, helium pressure induced an increase of DA release. For the pressures used, the results suggest that the decrease of dopamine release was independent of such an effect of the pressure. However, for the same <b>narcotic</b> <b>gas,</b> the measurements of the extracellular DA performed in the striatum seem to reflect an opposing effect of pressure, since the decrease in DA release is lower with increasing pressure...|$|E

A {{number of}} {{simulations}} were performed using the CFAST zone fire model {{to predict the}} relative times at which smoke inhalation and heat exposure would result in inca-pacitation. Fires in three building types were modeled: a ranch house, a hotel, and an office building. Gas species yields and rates of heat release for these design fires were derived from a review of real-scale fire test data. The incapacitation equations were taken from draft 14 of ISO document 13571. Sublethal effects of smoke were deemed important when incapacitation from smoke inhalation occurred before harm from thermal effects occurred. Real-scale HCl yield data were incorporated as available; the modeling indicated that the yield {{would need to be}} 5 to 10 times higher for incapacitation from HCl to precede incapacitation from <b>narcotic</b> <b>gases,</b> including CO CO 2, HCN and reduce O 2. The results suggest that occupancies in which sublethal effects from open fires could affect escape and survival include multi-room residences, medical facilities, schools, and correctional facilities.

Inhalent anaesthetics are proposed as an alternative {{but they have not}} been fully characterized yet. The aim of this study was the comprehensive investigation of the induction of euthanasia with CO 2 (100 % CO 2 with filling rates of 20, 60 and 100 % of chamber volume per minute (KV%/min)) as well as with isoflurane (2 % and 5 % isoflurane with 71 KV%/min) and sevoflurane (4. 8 % and 8 % sevoflurane with 71 KV%/min) in NMRI and C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. We compared stress reactions between the groups or in comparison to an air stream (71 KV%/min). We evaluated the effectiveness and reliability of the <b>narcotic</b> <b>gas</b> treatment, the time course of the phases of induction of narcosis, behaviour inclusive vocalisations, plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations, blood glucose concentrations as well as the effects of the gases on respiratory movements and on tissues of the respiratory tract. The period of investigation was form start of the gas exposure until surgical tolerance was reached or after maximum 300 s. Mice were decapitated and blood and tissue samples were collected. In both strains only the CO 2 treatments with 60 and 100 KV%/min and the treatments with 5 % isoflurane as well as the treatment with 8 % sevoflurane in NMRI mice induced surgical tolerance within 300 s in at least 93, 8 % of animals of a group and were considered as effective and reliable. The induction of narcosis can be divided into a normal phase, a phase of ataxia, of muscle relaxation and of loss of consciousness until the onset of surgical tolerance. CO 2 with 100 KV%/min was the fasted treatment to induce surgical tolerance. The CO 2 treatment with 60 KV%/min did not differ from the treatment with 5 % isoflurane in regard to time to reach surgical tolerance. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations of the effective CO 2 treated groups were ca. 10 -fold higher than the concentrations of isoflurane and sevoflurane treated groups. In C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, blood glucose concentrations were partly higher in isoflurane and sevoflurane treated groups than in CO 2 treated groups. In NMRI mice, we could not detect any differences between the groups. We could not find distinct stress or pain indicating behaviour, all changes in behaviour in relation to normal behaviour under air stream exposure (e. g. ataxia, hypotonic gait, forward movement, rearings, grooming, excitatory phenomena) could mainly be explained by the narcotic properties of the gases. We could not detect any vocalizations in the audible nor in the ultrasound range. Respiratory movements were influenced by all narcotic gases. Except atelectasis, all macroscopic and microscopic pathological findings were detected in all treatment groups {{as well as in the}} air control group. They could not clearly be ascribed to as effects of the <b>narcotic</b> <b>gas</b> treatment but are rather due to decapitation or cardiac and circulatory failure in agony. Regarded in context with the reviewed literature the stress reaction under CO 2 exposure, which is reflected by elevated adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations in plasma, could be explained by the massive physiological changes (as hypercapnic acidosis, dyspnea, aversion and fear behaviour) that are produced by the inhalation of CO 2. Viewed from the outside, the induction of narcosis with CO 2 mostly seemed to look nice and peaceful yet hypotonic gait, reduced forward movements and reduced rearings should not deceive the real (inner) stress reaction. Strain differences need to be considered when choosing a <b>narcotic</b> <b>gas</b> and gas concentration. In regard to our results, 5 % isoflurane with 71 KV%/min is better than CO 2 with 20 and 60 KV%/min for the induction of narcosis or euthanasia in NMRI- and C 57 Bl/ 6 -mice.

EXODUS is an egress model designed to simulate the evacuation {{of large numbers of}} individuals from an enclosure, such as an aircraft.

40|$|Microporous {{hollow fibre}} {{membrane}} oxygenators with clinically-established polypropylene (PP) or innovative polymethylpentene (PMP) membranes are used clinically for cardiopulmonary bypasses (CPB) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Membrane oxygenators with silicone plates {{may also be}} used. During long-term use of PP membrane oxygenators, plasma leakage is possible due {{to a variety of}} factors. The PMP membrane oxygenators developed to avoid this undesirable occurrence should be able to prevent this due to their modified, denser membrane structure. In the clinical use of PMP membrane oxygenators for CPB, the halogenated anaesthetic isoflurane cannot be administered in sufficient amounts. In the set-up to test steam transfer, the PP and PMP oxygenator modules were analysed for differences in permeability through perfusion with distilled water on the fluid side and streaming of dry gas on the gas side. No differences could be detected in the amount of water condensate, whose function as a trigger for plasma leakage is controversial. As with the silicone membrane oxygenators, the gas was fully saturated with water condensate. Should the condensation process in the microporous membrane be a trigger mechanism for plasma leakage, using a PMP membrane oxygenator would not offer a higher level of safety. However, the thin sealing membrane at the surface of PMP membrane oxygenators should theoretically provide greater resistance to capillary attraction. Leakage tests of the microporous hollow fibre membranes with Perfluorcarbon FC- 43 ® and oxygenator test modules showed that PP membranes were able to prevent considerably less transfer. Admittedly, transfer was also detected with the PMP membranes. Silicone membranes appeared to retain FC- 43 ® the best. Thus although PMP membranes could be considered to have better liquid retention properties than PP membranes, they are not 100 % impervious. This observation means that plasma leakage seems far unlikelier when PMP membranes are used, although cannot be ruled out definitively. Thus in long-term clinical application for ECLS, PMP hollow fibre membrane oxygenators should be favoured over those with PP membranes. The <b>narcotic</b> <b>gas</b> transport capacity of hollow fibre membranes was explored in an in-vitro investigation. The oxygenator modules were perfused with saline solution and native porcine blood on the liquid side and aerated with the gaseous anaesthetics isoflurane, nitrous oxide and xenon on the gas side. The transport capacity of PP and PMP membranes showed no difference in the case of nitrous oxide and xenon, but the gas transfer performance of PP membranes was lower with isoflurane. Should a halogenated anaesthetic such as isoflurane be used during CPB and administered via a hollow fibre membrane oxygenator, use of PMP hollow fibre membrane oxygenators should be discouraged. This restriction does not apply to the administering of nitrous oxide or xenon. As purely in-vitro-experiments, the new test set-ups developed for the investigations could provide clinically-relevant knowledge. Further standardisation of the set-up could establish its use in future studies...|$|E

40|$|Accidental fires {{represent}} a risk for {{people from the}} heat and fire effluents produced. It is clear from fire statistics that it is, in fact, the toxic gases that kill and injure many fire victims. Further, {{there are a number of}} compounds that are readily produced in fires, which have important sublethal effects on humans. Some of those compounds are known to have a long-term effect on people, and fires might significantly contribute to the emission of such compounds to the environment. Although, the importance of the quality of the fire effluents has been acknowledged for a long time in the fire science community, information on the detailed composition is to some degree missing. In particular, there has been a lack of real-scale fire experiments including detailed chemical analysis, to confirming the present knowledge-base, which in many cases relies on data from small-scale experiments. The work presented in this thesis is largely based on the results of a number of unique series of large-scale fire experiments, where the composition of the fire effluents has been characterised in detail. The analyses have included many types of species, e. g. : <b>narcotic</b> fire <b>gases</b> such as CO and HCN, irritants such as HF, HCl and isocyanates, carcinogenic compounds such as benzene, PAHs and dioxins. The particulate phase of the fire effluents has also been characterised in a number of tests. Information on the production of toxic gases, such as HCN, is important for estimating the time for evacuation in case of fires in buildings. Quantitative information on HCN, and other toxic gases relevant for an evacuation scenario, has been determined in real-scale fire experiments. An application of an FED model for asphyxiant gases, showed that these gases presented the greatest danger in a series of experimental tunnel fires, and that HCN, in particular, had a major impact in these fires. Further, a chemical kinetic model included in a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study, has been evaluated for the prediction of HCN production in fires. The prediction of the model was satisfactory compared to the results of large-scale enclosure tests. An estimate of the total amounts of dioxin, PAH and VOC from fires in Sweden during a specific year was made, by combining the amounts of materials involved in fires with emission factors for these fires. It was concluded that the emissions of PAH, VOC and dioxins from fires are large. The fire related emissions of PAH and dioxins were further shown to be significant and comparable to those from many other sources. For dioxins it is further clear that large catastrophic fires can lead to major emissions...|$|R
