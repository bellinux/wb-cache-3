5|$|In May 2007, YouTube {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos. YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels. The trophies made of <b>nickel</b> <b>plated</b> copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal and ruby are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million and fifty million views, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{whistles}} today {{are made of}} brass tubing, or <b>nickel</b> <b>plated</b> brass tubing, with a plastic fipple (mouthpiece). Generation, Feadóg, Oak, Acorn, Soodlum's (now Walton's), and other brands fall in this category. The next most common form is the conical sheet metal whistle with a wooden stop in the wide end to form the fipple, the Clarke's brand being the most prevalent. Other less common variants are the all-metal whistle, the PVC whistle, the Flanna square holed whistle, and the wooden whistle.|$|E

60|$|There {{were six}} single and four double staterooms aboard the steam yacht, so the Rovers {{and their friends}} were not crowded for accommodations, since even a single room {{contained}} two berths, an upper and a lower.

Some papers which his hand brushed within the safe he pushed aside as though preadvised of their inutility to one of his calling. Then he closed the safe door, closed the tapestry upon it and turned toward a dainty dressing table. From a drawer in this exquisite bit of Sheraton the burglar took a small, <b>nickel</b> <b>plated</b> automatic, which he slipped into an inside breast pocket of his coat, nor did he touch another article therein or thereon, nor hesitate an instant in the selection of the drawer to be rifled. His knowledge of the apartment of the daughter of the house of Prim was little short of uncanny.

The <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> also added Pullman club cars and sleepers to compete with New York Central Railroad service (such as the Forest City) over the same route.

The electrochemical tests were to analyze the corrosion behavior of satin <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> with different processes in 3. 5 % NaCl solution. The results show that,because the satin <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> has an organic film on its surface due to process characteristics,the film results in different corrosion resistance. By increasing satin additive dosage,the <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> chroma decreases,the microsurface of the plating becomes rough,and the corrosion resistance is followed by decrease...|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Van Sweringen Brothers {{purchased}} the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> Road from the New York Central, Bernet {{was asked to}} lead the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> in 1916. [...] By {{the time he left}} the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate,</b> the railroad had grown considerably thanks to Bernet's work at upgrading the system.

The LS&MS quickly gained control of the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate,</b> and later allowed it into its LaSalle Street Station as a tenant. In July 1916 the LS&MS sold the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> to the Van Sweringens, but it continued to operate into LaSalle {{until the end of}} <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> passenger service.|$|R
50|$|In early 1881, William Henry Vanderbilt {{could have}} had the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> for one million dollars, equal to $ today.

50|$|Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> layers {{are known}} to provide extreme surface {{adhesion}} when <b>plated</b> properly. Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> is non-magnetic and amorphous. Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> layers are not easily solderable, nor do they seize with other metals or another electroless nickel-plated workpiece under pressure. This effect benefits electroless nickel-plated screws made out of malleable materials like titanium. Electrical resistance is higher compared to pure metal plating.|$|R
