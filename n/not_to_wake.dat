5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E
500|$|Teddy is Mr. Bean's {{teddy bear}} and perhaps Mr. Bean's best friend. The little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs, which {{invariably}} end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotises Teddy, he snaps {{his fingers and}} the bear's head falls backwards {{as if it had}} fallen asleep instantly (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy's head up). Mr. Bean behaves as if the bear is real, buying it a Christmas present or trying <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> it in the mornings. The bear is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated ("Mr. Bean in Room 426"), used as his paint brush ("Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean"), and shrunk in the wash ("Tee Off, Mr. Bean"). Teddy is also Mr. Bean's [...] "pet" [...] in [...] "Hair by Mr. Bean of London" [...] and is used to win a pet show.|$|E

500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Blinky! ... Gee, I'd clean {{forgot his}} right name," [...] laughed Pan, mentally kicking himself. [...] "She's still sound asleep. I told Blinky <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> her. She looked white and worn out." ...|$|E
6000|$|She faltered, {{and still}} I kept my eyes closed. I did <b>not</b> want <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up from that dream. [...] "Have I been very--very sad?" [...] she went on.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Live!' cried Martin. 'Yes, it's {{easy to say}} live; but if {{we should}} happen <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> when rattlesnakes are making corkscrews of {{themselves}} upon our beds, it may be {{not so easy to}} do it.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he did not}} kiss her, {{for fear}} she should be cold and strange to him. It eased him she slept so beautifully. He shut her door softly, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> her, and went to bed.|$|E
6000|$|Very gently, so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> him, I touched poor papa's {{forehead}} with my lips. [...] "I {{must have some}} of your medicine," [...] I whispered to him; [...] "I want it, dear, as badly as you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We do <b>not</b> want <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> {{the village}} {{if we can}} help it, Tawaina; but I do not see any chance of {{escaping}} without a fight. Our horses are all dead beat, and the Indians will easily overtake us, even {{if we get a}} night's start.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it is no}} {{dream to}} me, Felix;--or if so, I do <b>not</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> any more. I {{used to think that}} I should never care very much for anybody out of my own family;--but now--" [...] And she then pressed her little hand upon his arm.|$|R

60|$|He {{reached out}} in a sudden need for company. The Merchant was warm to the touch. His {{breathing}} was rough, he moved in an occasional spasm, and was obviously asleep. The Explorer hesitated and decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> him. It would serve no real purpose.|$|E
50|$|Howard’s {{suicide and}} the {{circumstances}} surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis his entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was <b>not</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>wake,</b> he walked out to his car and {{shot himself in the}} head.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{should have}} been, if I had been woke," [...] Bob said, indignantly. [...] "I am <b>not</b> {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up, just after I go to sleep. It doesn't {{seem to me}} that I have been in bed five minutes. If you wake me, tomorrow morning, you will see I will be up, sharp enough.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there comes}} a tapping at the door, <b>not</b> loud enough <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> the sleepers. Then knocking, which {{disturbs}} Mrs. Dudgeon a little. Finally the latch is tried, whereupon she springs up at once.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} {{lingering}} {{in the pantry}} in the greatness of his zeal, giving a rub-up to a plated cruet stand the last thing before going to bed. Being careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up the mate, whose room was opposite, I spoke in an undertone.|$|E
60|$|He {{was asleep}} {{there on the}} bed when Richard came home to dinner and looked softly in. He decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> him, and Mary said the sleep would do him more good than the dinner.

60|$|The wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop {{and bend}} {{this way and}} that. Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam of the lamp falls {{straight}} from the window.

60|$|In the tap-room downstairs {{he found}} Pythagoras and Socrates {{curled up on}} the floor in front of the hearth. They were fast asleep, and Diogenes did <b>not</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> them. He had given them their orders for the next day earlier in the evening and with the promise of 500 golden guilders to be won by {{implicit}} obedience the two worthies were <b>not</b> like <b>to</b> disobey.|$|R
6000|$|Slowly {{the evening}} wore on, {{until the last}} trace of {{sunshine}} had gone and only the stars shone down upon the Hasty. Phil was fast asleep, and I did <b>not</b> like <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> him, so much did he appear to enjoy the nap. Poor boy! for once {{he knew that he}} would not be aroused by a kick or blow! ...|$|R
500|$|Eddie told an {{interviewer}} that [...] "Girl Gone Bad" [...] was written {{in a hotel room}} {{that he and his wife}} at the time Valerie Bertinelli had rented. Valerie was asleep, and Eddie woke up during the night with an idea he had to put on tape. <b>Not</b> wanting <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> Valerie, Eddie grabbed a cassette recorder and recorded himself playing guitar in the closet.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is useless}} {{to tell me}} 'not' to 'reason', but to 'believe'. You [...] might as well tell a man <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake,</b> but 'sleep'. And then to 'bully' [...] with torments, and all that! I cannot help {{thinking}} that the 'menace' [...] of hell makes as many devils as the severe penal codes of inhuman [...] humanity make villains." ...|$|E
60|$|As to Mrs. Bretton, my active godmother--who, I {{afterwards}} found, {{had been}} out in the open air all day--lay half-reclined in her deep-cushioned chair, actually lost in a nap. Her son seeing me, came forward. I noticed that he trod carefully, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> the sleeper; he also spoke low: his mellow voice never had any sharpness in it; modulated as at present, it was calculated rather to soothe than startle slumber.|$|E
60|$|Dazedly Decoud {{observed}} {{that he must}} have fallen sound asleep, and Nostromo said, with a vague smile, that he had looked in at the window and had seen him lying still across the table with his head on his arms. The English senora had also come in the carriage, and went upstairs at once with the doctor. She had told him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up Don Martin yet; but when they sent for the children he had come into the cafe.|$|E
5000|$|Amid {{controversy}} of the singer's previous single {{being accused}} of plagiarism, G-Dragon quickly released his follow-up single, [...] "Breathe," [...] to promote his album. The song managed to chart within the Top 20 of the Korean music chart. [...] The lyrics, which portray the singer <b>not</b> wanting <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up from a dream, was complimented by {{a writer for the}} Newsen as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "impressive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In my opinion, he's doing capitally, Mrs. Donald. His pulse {{is quiet}} and even, and he's {{breathing}} {{as quietly as}} a child; and I believe he is simply {{in a state of}} exhaustion, from which he is <b>not</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> till tomorrow morning; and I predict that, in a few days, he will be up and about. Indeed, if that bullet hasn't misbehaved itself, I see no reason why he shouldn't be up tomorrow." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} I hesitated {{as to whether}} I would or would not run in and shoot those horses. Two {{considerations}} stayed me. The first was that if I did so my pistol would be empty, or even if I shot one horse and retained a barrel loaded, with it I could only kill a single man, leaving myself defenceless against the knife of the other. The second consideration was that now as before I did <b>not</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up Miss Holmes.|$|R
