50|$|The case is {{especially}} important in the law of delict, as an illustration {{of the concept of}} the <b>nova</b> <b>causa</b> <b>interveniens.</b> The plaintiff's leg had been broken in a collision, and he was discharged from hospital after the bone had clinically sufficiently knitted. Shortly thereafter, however, his crutches slipped on a smooth floor and the bone broke again. The court found that the fall had been caused by the plaintiff' own carelessness, and that the defendant was not liable for the prolongation of the recovery. The court also disallowed costs for the doctor's qualifying expenses.|$|E
50|$|A {{novus actus interveniens}} (or <b>nova</b> <b>causa</b> <b>interveniens)</b> is a new {{intervening}} act, or a new intervening cause: that is to say, {{an abnormal}} interposition or event which breaks the chain of causation. A number of factors are important, according to Burchell, in determining what kind of intervening act or event breaks the causal chain. It is important {{to bear in mind}} that this stage of the enquiry involves strong policy considerations. It is not an enquiry merely into {{whether or not there was}} some kind of additional or external factor that contributed towards the consequence in question; the enquiry is into whether that factor is of such a nature and magnitude that it should exonerate the accused from liability for the actual consequences of his conduct.|$|E
