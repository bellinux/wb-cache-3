40|$|Cooperative {{spectrum}} sensing is a promising method for improving {{spectrum sensing}} performance in cognitive radio. Although it yields better spectrum sensing performance, it also incurs additional energy consumption that drains more {{energy from the}} sensor nodes and hence shortens the lifetime of sensor networks. This paper proposes energy minimization approach to reduce energy consumption due to spectrum sensing and sensed result reporting in a cooperative spectrum sensing. The approach determines optimal <b>number</b> of cooperative <b>sensing</b> nodes using particle swarm optimization. We derived mathematical lower bound and upper bound for the <b>number</b> of cooperative <b>sensing</b> nodes in the network. Then we formulate a constraint optimization problem and used particle swarm optimization to simultaneously optimize the two mathematical bounds to determine the optimal <b>number</b> of <b>sensing</b> nodes. Simulation results indicate viability of the proposed approach and show that {{significant amount of energy}} savings can be achieved by employing optimal <b>number</b> of <b>sensing</b> nodes for cooperative spectrum sensing. Performance comparison with conventional approach shows performance improvement of the proposed approach over the conventional method in minimizing spectrum sensing energy consumption without compromising spectrum sensing performance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUser {{cooperation}} for {{spectrum sensing}} in cognitive radios {{has been proposed}} {{in order to improve}} the overall performance by mitigating multi-path fading and shadowing experienced by the users. However, user cooperation results in high energy consumption, extra time for results exchange, as well as delay and security risks. In this paper, we investigate the effects of cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) on energy consumption and achievable performance. Our analysis is based on a limited time resources assumption. This implies that the time resources dedicated for CSS process are limited and shared between spectrum sensing and results reporting, which depend on the <b>number</b> of <b>sensing</b> users. Our results show that cooperation among large number of users not only causes high energy consumption, but it also degrades the performance. Motivated by these considerations, the <b>number</b> of <b>sensing</b> users is optimized for different setups: throughput maximization, energy consumption minimization, and energy efficiency maximization. The optimal <b>number</b> of the <b>sensing</b> users is computed in a closed-form for both throughput maximization and energy minimization setups, while a simple iterative algorithm is proposed for obtaining the optimal <b>number</b> of <b>sensing</b> users for maximizing energy efficiency. Moreover, a novel energy efficient approach is presented that is able to significantly improve energy efficiency without degrading achievable throughput...|$|R
