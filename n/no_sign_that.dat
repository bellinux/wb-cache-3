5|$|The {{following}} match, {{which was}} not broadcast in the United Kingdom, pitted Crush against the Repo Man. Crush used his size advantage to perform a Gorilla press slam on Repo Man. Repo Man performed a back suplex, but Crush showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the move affected him. Crush continued to dominate the match with such moves as a belly to belly suplex. Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope, but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission.|$|E
5|$|When Edward II {{left the}} country early in 1308 to marry the French king's {{daughter}} Isabella, he appointed Gaveston regent in his place. This was a responsibility that would normally be given to a close family member of the reigning king. There is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Gaveston exploited the regency for personal gains, but the other nobles were still offended by his arrogant behaviour. This behaviour continued at the coronation feast after the King's return, during which the King largely ignored his new wife in favour of Gaveston. The collective grievances first found expression in the so-called 'Boulogne agreement' of January 1308, in which the earls of Warenne, Hereford, Lincoln and Pembroke expressed concern about oppression {{of the people and}} attacks on the honour of the crown. Though not mentioned by name, Gaveston was the implied target of this document. Later that year, in the April parliament, the so-called Declaration of 1308 demanded the renewed exile of Gaveston, again without explicitly mentioning the favourite by name. The King initially resisted, but had to give in to the demand once {{it became clear that the}} barons had the support of King Philip IV of France, who was offended by Edward's treatment of his daughter. On 18 May, Edward consented to sending Gaveston into exile.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1307, {{less than}} a month after succeeding, Edward II made Piers Gaveston Earl of Cornwall. According to {{contemporary}} narrative sources, this was a controversial decision. Gaveston came from relatively humble origins, and his rise to the highest level of the peerage was considered improper by the established nobility. Furthermore, the earldom of Cornwall had traditionally been reserved for members of the royal family, and Edward I had intended it for one of his two younger sons from his second marriage. The discontent reported by the chronicles may have been the result of hindsight, however; there is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the established nobility objected to the ennoblement of Gaveston at the time. The earldom gave Gaveston substantial landholdings over great parts of England, to the value of £4,000 a year. These possessions consisted of most of Cornwall, as well as parts of Devonshire in the south-west, land in Berkshire and Oxfordshire centred on the honour of Wallingford, most of the eastern part of Lincolnshire, and the honour of Knaresborough in Yorkshire, with the territories that belonged to it. In addition to this, Edward also secured a prestigious marriage between Gaveston and Margaret de Clare, sister of the powerful Earl of Gloucester. The possessions and family connection secured Gaveston a place among the highest levels of the English nobility.|$|E

Taeping, also signalling for a pilot, was coming up fast and was close astern of Ariel at 5:00 am. There was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Taeping would heave to, so Captain Keay ordered Ariel's sails to be filled to keep ahead of the other ship, {{to be sure of}} getting the first pilot. On Taeping Captain MacKinnon conceded and also hove to.|$|E
25|$|Although clouds {{extended}} down {{as low as}} 300–400 {{feet above}} the sea surface and surface visibility had fallen to 1,500–2,500 meters at Campeltown Airport, the wind was from the west at 12 knots, and the aircraft was below the freezing level (reported at 6,500 feet). Conditions {{at the time of}} the accident made it possible for ice to form in the carburetors, and carburetor heat was not applied to counteract this possibility, but there was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the engine function was impaired. The switches for pitot and stall warning probe heating, and for propeller de‑icing were selected ON. The switches for airframe de-icing, heated windshield and for the ice inspection lamp were selected OFF.|$|E
25|$|The {{recording}} of its follow up, Play, {{took place during}} 1998 in Moby's Mott Street home studio in Manhattan, New York. At the time, Moby planned on making the album his last before ending his career. When he finished recording, there was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the album would perform any differently than Animal Rights. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label (from Warner Bros. to Sony to RCA) and was rejected every time. After V2 finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it. According to manager Eric Härle {{in an interview with}} HitQuarters, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what Everything Is Wrong, Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 1346, while {{campaigning in}} France at an {{important}} {{stage of the}} Hundred Years’ War, Edward III licensed the prioress and convent of Brewood to appropriate the church of Rode in Somerset, where they already held the advowson. There is no indication of which prioress and convent. However, this was {{at the request of}} Thomas Swynnerton and Alice Swynnerton is known to have been prioress of Black Ladies until 1332. There is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the appropriation was ever implemented. More certain is a receipt of 28 September 1394 by which Petronilla, named as prioress of the Black Nunnery of Brewood, acknowledged a gift of £100 from Thomas Gech to establish a chantry for Thomas de Brompton, formerly lord of Church Eaton, and his forebears. It is possible that Gech had married Brompton’s widow, Isabella, but this is disputed. This was the largest recorded gift to the priory.|$|E

In 2010 the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court of Germany) called the allegations outlandish.

2500|$|On December 7, 2009, {{the former}} Massachusetts Attorney General, after an {{independent}} internal investigation of ACORN, found the videos {{that had been}} released {{appeared to have been}} edited, [...] "in some cases substantially". He found no evidence of criminal conduct by ACORN employees, but concluded that ACORN had poor management practices that contributed to unprofessional actions by a number of its low-level employees. On March 1, 2010, the District Attorney's office for Brooklyn determined that the videos were [...] "heavily edited" [...] and [...] "many of the seemingly crime-encouraging answers were taken out of context so as to appear more sinister", and concluded that there was no criminal wrongdoing by the ACORN staff in the videos from the Brooklyn ACORN office. [...] On April 1, 2010, an investigation by the California Attorney General found the videos from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino to be [...] "heavily edited," [...] and the investigation did not find evidence of criminal conduct on the part of ACORN employees.

The National Post used the subheading [...] "IPCC report skeptics seize on lull in global warming". Even Nature headlined their news report [...] "IPCC: Despite hiatus, climate change here to stay", though it said that [...] "the 'hiatus' since the record hot year of 1998 — probably due to increased heat uptake by the oceans — is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> global warming has stopped, as some would like to hope", and quoted climatologist Thomas Stocker saying that [...] "Comparing short-term observations with long-term model projections is inappropriate", and adding [...] "We {{know that there is a}} lot of natural fluctuation in the climate system. A 15-year hiatus is not so unusual even though the jury is out as to what exactly may have caused the pause."

2500|$|Despite {{the release}} of {{intelligence}} information from the American and Israeli sources, {{the attack on the}} Syrian site was initially controversial.

Mohammed ElBaradei had previously stated that Syria's ability to construct and run a complex nuclear process was doubtful—speaking ahead of the IAEA inspection of the alleged Syrian nuclear site, which has been demolished, he said: [...] "It is doubtful we will find anything there now, assuming there was anything in the first place." [...] The New York Times reported that after the publishing of US intelligence data on April 24, [...] "two senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the evidence had left them with no more than [...] "low confidence" [...] that Syria was preparing to build a nuclear weapon.
