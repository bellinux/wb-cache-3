25|$|In health, {{the optimistic}} bias tends to prevent {{individuals}} from taking on preventative measures for good health. Therefore, researchers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the optimistic bias {{and the ways}} it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative {{risk of heart disease}} know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease. Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important to look at how risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.|$|E
25|$|Follower-focused {{approaches}} look at {{the processes}} by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature {{in the domain of}} motivation in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in teams and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.|$|E

25|$|Privacy {{concerns}} with social networking services {{have been raised}} growing concerns among users {{on the dangers of}} giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are {{variable in the}} manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E

2500|$|Payne [...] {{identified}} that an eclectic approach to theory has {{the benefits of}} increasing a workers effectiveness, but that this should not {{come at the expense}} of being “internally inconsistent or debas(ing) the full theory.” [...] Mullen offers several criticisms of PPMs, that they are duplicative, time consuming and overly subjective. [...] He offers responses to these three points, firstly in refuting the claim that they simply duplicate existing General Practice Models (GPM). [...] A PPM allows for development and tweaking of GPMs, making them more relevant to individual practice. [...] He concedes that they can be time consuming, but mostly in their inception, and that maintaining and developing them is much easier. [...] As for the subjectivity of a PPM, workers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this, and critically engaged with GPMs to bring esoteric theory and research into contact with everyday practice.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the growing}} number of {{international}} business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and teachers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have [...] been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|The boat models {{discovered}} at Meketre′s tomb feature several {{different kinds of}} boats, including traveling boats, sporting boats, and several papyriform crafts. [...] Two of the papyriform skiffs have a trawling net slung between them. It is uncertain {{whether or not the}} net is meant to be depicted as being under the water or being pulled out of the water by the fishermen. In the event that the artist meant for the net to be in the water, {{it is interesting to note}} that the net is upside down. Needless to say, the upside down net would not work for catching fish. [...] This ambiguity points up the question of artistic veracity of the craftsmen who make ship models. As is attested by the ambiguity of the holes in the sides of the Phoenician model, and the skiff from Meketre, archaeologists <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the possibility of artistic error while interpreting ancient ship models. While a mistake involving an inverted trawling net may seem trivial, the lesson is important. It is important for archaeologists to be aware of the possibility that ancient artists may not have been familiar with the finer details of ships and boats.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{published}} on 26 February 2015 was Kate Lampard's report into {{lessons to be}} learned from the health service's handling of the Savile scandal. [...] She concluded that:"Savile was a highly unusual personality whose lifestyle, behaviour and offending patterns were equally unusual. As a result of his celebrity, his volunteering, and his fundraising he had exceptional access to a number of NHS hospitals and took the opportunities that that access gave him to abuse patients, staff and others on a remarkable scale. Savile’s celebrity and his roles as a volunteer and fundraiser also gave him power and influence within NHS hospitals which meant that his behaviour, which was often evidently inappropriate, was not challenged as it should have been. Savile’s ability to continue to pursue his activities without effective challenge was aided by fragmented hospital management arrangements; social attitudes of the times, including reticence in reporting and accepting reports of sexual harassment and abuse, and greater deference than today towards those in positions of influence and power; and less bold and intrusive media reporting. [...] While it might be tempting to dismiss the Savile case as wholly exceptional, a unique result of a perfect storm of circumstances, the evidence we have gathered indicates that there are many elements of the Savile story that could be repeated in the future. There is always a risk of the abuse, including sexual abuse, of people in hospitals. There will always be people who seek to gain undue influence and power within public institutions including in hospitals. And society and individuals continue to have a weakness for celebrities.
