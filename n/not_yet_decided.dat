In November 2011, reports began that the film's name might be changed again to Muqtasar. At the time Kohli stated only that they had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>decided</b> {{the title of the}} film.

5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council have <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>decided</b> {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This has proved to be problematic as the revenue collected from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is not a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|E

25|$|By April 2003, The Georgetown Co. had {{withdrawn}} its proposal and partnered with Hines Interest Limited Partnership/Charles E. Smith Residential. Two groups, East End Redevelopment Associates and Human Vision Partners, had been eliminated from contention by the city. District {{officials said they}} would meet with the remaining development teams in May, meet with an external advisory panel in June, and pick a winning proposal in late June. They hoped that construction would begin 18 to 24 months later. Interestingly, the city had still <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>decided</b> {{what to do with}} the existing convention center.

25|$|During {{a hearing}} on August 10, 2006, Haq {{surprised}} the court by indicating that he wished to enter a guilty plea on all charges. The judge refused to accept this plea before a competency hearing had been conducted. Additionally, experts consulted by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer expressed doubts as to whether Haq {{would be allowed to}} plead guilty at such an early point in the legal process because the prosecution had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>decided</b> whether Haq would face the death penalty. On August 16, C. Wesley Richards, Haq's attorney, told the court that Haq had changed his mind and chosen to plead not guilty. Additionally, Richards said that Haq was mentally competent to stand trial since he understood the charges against him and was capable of assisting in his own defense.|$|E
25|$|Separation of {{isotopes}} by laser excitation is an Australian {{development that}} also uses UF6. After a protracted development process involving U.S. enrichment company USEC acquiring and then relinquishing commercialization {{rights to the}} technology, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) signed a commercialization agreement with Silex Systems in 2006. GEH has since built a demonstration test loop and announced plans to build an initial commercial facility. Details of the process are classified and restricted by intergovernmental agreements between United States, Australia, and the commercial entities. SILEX has been projected to be {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient than existing production techniques but again, the exact figure is classified. In August, 2011 Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of GEH, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a permit to build a commercial plant. In September 2012, the NRC issued a license for GEH to build and operate a commercial SILEX enrichment plant, although the company had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>decided</b> whether the project would be profitable enough to begin construction, and despite concerns that the technology could contribute to nuclear proliferation.|$|E

500|$|Béarn was {{launched}} in April 1920 to clear the slip; the Navy had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>decided</b> {{what to do with}} the vessel. Plans to complete the battleship included replacement of the coal-fired boilers with eight oil-fired Niclausse boilers and new, more powerful turbines. A new quadruple turret that allowed for greater range was considered, along with twin turrets mounting [...] guns. In 1922, the Navy instead decided to complete the ship as an aircraft carrier. Conversion work began in August 1923, and was completed by May 1927. The ship was the first carrier of the French Navy. She served in the fleet through World War II, though she was used as a ferry for aircraft. In 1944, she was refitted in the United States and equipped with a battery of modern American anti-aircraft guns. She remained in service through the First Indochina War, still as an aircraft ferry. She was ultimately broken up for scrap starting in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Rome, meanwhile, {{appears to}} have been largely unaware of the real {{situation}} in Armenia.

Their demands, and the subsequent interrogation of the centurion who accompanied them, revealed to Nero and the Senate the true extent of the disaster, which Paetus had concealed in his dispatches. Nevertheless, in the words of Tacitus, the Romans decided to [...] "accept a dangerous war over a disgraceful peace"; Paetus was recalled, and Corbulo placed again in charge of the campaign into Armenia, with extraordinary imperium which placed him above all other governors and client rulers in the East. Corbulo's post as governor of Syria was entrusted to Gaius Cestius Gallus.|$|E

Both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control both Manchuria and Korea which naturally caused problems between them.

Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>decided</b> exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable.|$|E
