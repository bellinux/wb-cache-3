5|$|Root {{extensions}} are additions {{of one or}} two sounds, often plosives, {{to the end of a}} root. These extensions do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> {{to change}} the meaning of a root, and often lead to variant root forms across different descendants. The source and function of these extensions is not known.|$|E

5|$|A 2012 {{study by}} Schott and David C. Evans {{found that the}} number {{and shape of the}} {{individual}} nodes on the squamosal shelf of the examined S. validum skulls varied considerably, and that this variability does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to correlate with ontogenic changes, but was due to individual variation. These researchers found no correlation between the width of supratemporal fenestrae {{and the size of the}} squamosal.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E
5|$|A few {{attempts}} {{to build a}} cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies's one) and over the net, but such a task does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> simple to achieve. General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have been driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E

As these have not been shown elsewhere, it does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> likely {{that they are a}} common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Ascending and {{descending}} chain {{conditions are}} general, {{meaning that they}} can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to use them to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E

5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> {{to have been}} {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to detonate at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force {{trying to keep the}} pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E

5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther from their mothers and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. Unlike many other primates, male orangutans do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to practice infanticide. This {{may be because}} they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to have required extensive repairs.|$|E
5|$|In August 1912 Massenet went to Paris {{from his}} house at Égreville to see his doctor.

Within a few days his condition deteriorated sharply. His wife and family hastened to Paris, and were {{with him when he}} died, aged seventy. By his own wish his funeral, with no music, was held privately at Égreville, where he is buried in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|In the {{extended}} edition of The Two Towers, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him {{in favour of}} Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that {{the extended}} edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion The prone {{positioning}} in French-speaking pediatric {{intensive care}} units {{is not very}} well protocolized.
