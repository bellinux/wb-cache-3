5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge</b> (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge,</b> scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge.</b> An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E

25|$|The facial {{features}} of 1p36 deletion syndrome {{have been considered}} to be characteristic, although few patients have been diagnosed {{solely on the basis}} of facial appearance. These features may include microcephaly, small, possibly slanted, deep-set eyes, a flat nose and <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge,</b> anomalous, low-set and small ears, a small mouth with down-turned corners and a pointed chin. Distinguishing features in another study were a large or late-closing anterior fontanelle (up to 85% of patients) and facial asymmetry.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{symptoms}} generally include coarse or rough {{facial features}} (including a flat <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge,</b> thick lips, and enlarged mouth and tongue), short stature with disproportionately short trunk (dwarfism), dysplasia (abnormal bone size and/or shape) and other skeletal irregularities, thickened skin, enlarged organs such as liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly), hernias, and excessive body hair growth. Short and often claw-like hands, progressive joint stiffness, and {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} can restrict hand mobility and function. Recurring respiratory infections are common, as are obstructive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea. Many affected individuals also have heart disease, often involving enlarged or diseased heart valves.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of {{tetrasomy}} X {{are highly}} variable, ranging from relatively mild to severe. Symptoms are often {{similar to those}} of trisomy X. Physically, tetrasomy X patients tend to have distinctive facial features such as epicanthal folds, flat <b>nasal</b> <b>bridges,</b> upslanting palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia, small mouths, cleft or high arched palates, delayed or absent teeth, or enamel defects. The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including hypotonia and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine. An informal study conducted found that 10% of girls had joint laxity in the hips and 20% had joint limitations in a sample size of 20 tetrasomy and pentasomy patients.|$|R
5000|$|Larsen {{syndrome}} (LS) is a congenital disorder {{discovered in}} 1950 by Larsen and associates when they observed dislocation {{of the large}} joints and face anomalies in six of their patients. [...] Patients suffering from Larsen syndrome normally present {{with a variety of}} symptoms, including congenital anterior dislocation of the knees, dislocation of the hips and elbows, flattened facial appearance, prominent foreheads, and depressed <b>nasal</b> <b>bridges.</b> [...] Larsen syndrome can also cause a variety of cardiovascular and orthopedic abnormalities. [...] This rare disorder is caused by a genetic defect in the gene encoding filamin B, a cytoplasmic protein that is important in regulating the structure and activity of the cytoskeleton. [...] The gene that influences the emergence of Larsen syndrome is found in chromosome region, 3p21.1-14.1, a region containing human type VII collagen gene. [...] Larsen syndrome has recently been described as a mesenchyme disorder that affects the connective tissue of an individual. [...] Autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disorder have been reported, although most cases are autosomal dominant. Reports have found that in Western societies, Larsen syndrome can be found in one in every 100,000 births, but this is most likely an underestimate because the disorder is frequently unrecognized or misdiagnosed.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Costello {{syndrome}} is probably an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that {{is characterized by}} postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, coarse facies, loose skin, nonprogressive cardiomyopathy and friendly behavior. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate a variety of clinical findings and cardiac involvement of six patients diagnosed as Costello syndrome. Materials and Methods: Six cases that had a typical features of Costello syndrome admitted to pediatric cardiology department due to cardiac murmur between 2002 - 2013 years were evaluated. Their complaints, clinical findings, treatments and clinical courses were examined. Results: Three of the patients were male and the mean age of patients was 34 ± 12 months (7 months to 11 years). All of the cases had coarse faces, deep palmar and plantar creases, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, depressed <b>nasal</b> <b>bridges</b> and cardiac murmur at auscultation. Congenital heart disease was found in all patients. Five patients had pulmonary stenosis and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed in 3 of these patients. Atrial septal defect was detected in 3 patients and 1 of the patient had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mental retardation was found in 2 patients. Conclusions: Costello syndrome must be keep in mind in all patients with psychomotor retardation, coarse faces, sparse hairs, deep palmar and plantar creases, phenotypical features resembling a storage disease especially in association with pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

25|$|Face mask — In {{resuscitation}} and {{for minor}} procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient {{to achieve a}} seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or {{by the use of}} nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the pharynx through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge</b> ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for non-invasive ventilation in conscious patients. A full face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{children}} may be quite large at birth and appear normal but may have inguinal (in the groin) or umbilical (where the umbilical cord passes through the abdomen) hernias. Growth in height may be faster than normal but begins to slow {{before the end of}} the first year and often ends around age 3. Many children develop a short body trunk and a maximum stature of less than 4 feet. Distinct facial features (including flat face, depressed <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge,</b> and bulging forehead) become more evident in the second year. By age 2, the ribs have widened and are oar-shaped. The liver, spleen, and heart are often enlarged. Children may experience noisy breathing and recurring upper respiratory tract and ear infections. Feeding may be difficult for some children, and many experience periodic bowel problems. Children with Hurler syndrome often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, and cardiac complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms of idic(15) vary greatly between individuals. Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor {{skills such as}} walking or sitting up. Other traits may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures (>50%), short stature, and intellectual disability. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15), where present, are usually very subtle but may include epicanthal folds (skin folds at the inner corners of one or both eyes), broad forehead, a flattened <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge,</b> button nose, and a high arched palate (roof of the mouth). Many individuals with idic(15) display features of autism, such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy {{in the same manner}} over and over again, hand flapping, rocking back and forth). A high pain threshold is often observed. If speech develops, it is often echolalic but some individuals do grasp some language. With a severely affected person there may be an inability to walk or talk.|$|E
40|$|The brain {{develops}} in concert and {{in coordination with}} the developing facial tissues, with each influencing {{the development of the}} other. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) result from alterations in the embryological brain, suggesting that the development of the face of children with ASD may show subtle facial differences compared to typically-developing children. We test this hypothesis by comparing three-dimensional photographic images acquired from children with ASD and agematched, typically-developing children. The 3 dMD Cranial system was used to acquire 3 D stereophotogrammetric images for our study sample of 8 - 12 year old children diagnosed with ASD (N= 60) and typically-developing children (N= 69) following approved IRB protocols. Three-dimensional coordinates were recorded for 17 facial anthropometric landmarks from these images using 3 dMD software. Age-matched comparisons of facial morphology in the two groups were completed using Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis (EDMA). Results show that there are significant differences in facial morphology in children with ASD compared to typically-developing children. Children with ASD have significantly broader orbits, philtrums, and mouths, and higher foreheads relative to typically-developing children. Typically-developing children display more anteriorly prominent foreheads and <b>nasal</b> <b>bridges</b> relative to children with ASD. We also find a subgroup of children with ASD with facial morphology that differs from the majority of the children with ASD and the typically-developing children; this subgroup is defined by a superoinferiorly longer midface. These results indicate that alterations in the developing brain may be associated with subtle, but distinct differences in facial phenotypes...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Many {{cells are}} {{involved}} in the orchestra that is bone homeostasis [...] particularly osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which mediate remodeling of bones. This creates a balance that must be kept in check, otherwise pathologies arise. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is crucial to maintaining this balance. It has long been known that the transcription factor STAT 3 has more profound effects on bone homeostasis than other members of the STAT family of proteins. Recently, a genetic condition called Job’s Syndrome has been specifically linked to point mutations in the Stat 3 gene. These patients present with severe bone abnormalities, including prominent foreheads, broad <b>nasal</b> <b>bridges,</b> and abnormal eye spacing. For this reason, our lab has extensively studied conditional knockouts of Stat 3 in all three types of bones cells in mice and observed severe deficiencies in numerous parameters of normal bone phenotypes. STAT 3 seems to play a principal role in the signaling that takes place upon mechanical loading of bone tissues and calling cells into action where they are needed. Furthermore, STAT 3 {{has been found to be}} up-regulated in the early-response gene cluster following mechanical loading. Our current approach to studying STAT 3 ’s effects on bone includes both in vivo and in vitro comparisons of WT and KO STAT 3 models. The conditional knock-out of STAT 3 in 8 -week old mice revealed significant phenotypic variations as compared to the WT controls, while no significant differences were observed in cKO newborn pups. We also looked at immortalized WT and STAT 3 KO cell lines. The STAT 3 KO cells had diminished proliferation rates and decreased differentiation capabilities. Furthermore, STAT 3 KO cells showed significantly reduced mRNA levels of both Wnt 3 a and Wnt 5 a when exposed to fluid shear stress. By employing available ChIP-seq data, we were able to elucidate the genome-wide binding patterns of STAT 3. From the peak distribution, we can begin to uncover novel downstream effectors of STAT 3 signaling that are responsible for the observed phenotypes in our conditional knockout mouse model. A preliminary look at the ChIP-seq data reveals Wnt and Nrf 2 signaling to be under the putative control of STAT 3. In our further research, we endeavor to experimentally confirm the ChIP-seq data for STAT 3 with RNA-seq experiments in the hopes of finding potential therapeutic targets for bone pathologies...|$|R
25|$|A rhinoplastic {{correction}} can {{be performed}} on {{a person who is}} under sedation, under general anaesthesia, or under local anaesthesia; initially, a local anaesthetic mixture of lidocaine and epinephrine is injected to numb the area, and temporarily reduce vascularity, thereby limiting any bleeding. Generally, the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilagenous nasal framework, and then corrects (reshapes) them as required, afterwards, sutures the incisions, and then applies either an external or an internal stent, and tape, to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose, and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts. Occasionally, the surgeon uses either an autologous cartilage graft or a bone graft, or both, in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal contour(s). The autologous grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum, but, if it has insufficient cartilage (as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty), then either a costal cartilage graft (from the rib cage) or an auricular cartilage graft (concha from the ear) is harvested from the patient’s body. When the rhinoplasty requires a bone graft, it is harvested from either the cranium, the hips, or the rib cage; moreover, when neither type of autologous graft is available, a synthetic graft (nasal implant) is used to augment the <b>nasal</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Rhinoplasty corrects the {{aesthetic}} appearance, facial harmony and {{the proportions of}} nose. It can also correct nasal airway passage by removing the structural defects in the nose.

2500|$|A final {{layer of}} adornments {{added to the}} helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads.

As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap. From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head. That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of [...] "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide." [...] A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap; its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by [...] "a massive rivet shank." [...] To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires separated by niello. Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows, where individual bronze cells held square garnets. The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head. This tang was itself riveted to the cap, one of five attachment points for the cast bronze nose and mouth piece. Both sides of the nose featured [...] "two small round projecting plates," [...] connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets. An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the [...] "background was punched down" [...] and filled with niello, leaving [...] "triangles in relief" [...] that were silvered.
