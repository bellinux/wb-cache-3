Scully muses that they thought the worm was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, 2009 at Lockdown, he {{defeated}} Sting {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship for {{his first}} ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at Sacrifice. Foley had also stated on Impact! tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at Victory Road, commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a spinning toe hold) and swore he'd <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the ankle lock.|$|E

500|$|After the {{shooting}} of the film, Leto quickly went on a liquid diet. He explained, [...] "I've been fasting ever since. I've been doing this very strange, like, lemon and cayenne pepper and water fast. I didn't eat any food for 10 days straight; I think I lost 20 pounds that first 10 days." [...] Losing the excess weight after Chapter 27 proved a challenge. [...] "It took about {{a year to get}} back to a place that felt semi-normal," [...] he said; [...] "I don't know if I'll ever be back to the place I was physically. I'd <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again; it definitely gave me some problems." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin {{influenced}} {{several of}} her songs. [...] While showering one day during rehearsals, {{she came up with}} the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage. [...] This gave rise to [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair". Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in South Pacific. To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] for her. [...] When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. [...] Rodgers gazed down at her, [...] "That's exactly what I want. [...] <b>Never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> differently. [...] We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Falle's pimp {{regularly}} {{beat her}} {{and she began to}} suffer from battered person syndrome. The worst beating she received was in a brothel where she and four other teenagers engaged in prostitution. Over the years that she was married to her pimp, she hoped he would change. She later said that she [...] "wanted to love him, believe he'd <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] She tried to make him enough money through prostitution to convince him not to find another girl. He threatened her family, and conditioned her not to call the police. Fear of being labelled a [...] "snitch" [...] or [...] "rat" [...] prevented her from going to the police. None of the other women she knew in the sex industry were in healthy relationships. At her peak, Falle owned a Ford Mustang, bought her pimp a Mercedes-Benz, and lived in a four-bedroom penthouse apartment, but she continued to experience violence. She used her material possessions to elevate herself above the women around her who were dependent on cocaine; she dismissed them as [...] "crackheads" [...] and [...] "crackhoes".|$|E

500|$|Hooper {{made his}} debut as {{a feature film}} {{director}} with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission drama Red Dust (2004), which stars Hilary Swank, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jamie Bartlett. The film was not widely seen, which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the Iraq War: [...] "When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of 'we'd <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in our own country…they're the horrible people but it's not us.' By the time the film came out (there were) these revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing. The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences {{it was designed to}} target. I have learned that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led." [...] The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on BBC Two in 2005, making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} an A-, while Television Without Pity {{gave it a}} C+. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named it the fourth best episode of the series, {{explaining}} [...] "The late season lark that officially launched a tradition for similar stunts, the musical film noir homage 'Brown Betty'... was an offbeat gem that expressed all of Fringes core themes — redemption, connection, rehumanization — and encapsulated the key relationships (the slow-moving Walter-Peter reconciliation; Peter and Olivia's carefully tended soul-deep romance) more poignantly than most on-point episodes of Fringe, and it left fans wanting the show to keep pushing the innovation. It could <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> enough." [...] In a similar list, Den of Geek named it the ninth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "it shouldn’t work, and yet it does, because although technically nothing happens, the episode shows us just how deep Walter has sunk into a metaphorical pit of despair and guilt, making himself the villain in his own story and despairing of ever being forgiven. It also gives the audience a refreshing break {{from some of the}} high level angst {{of the end of the}} season, allowing Peter and Olivia to act out a properly romantic storyline while their characters in the ‘real’ world have been torn apart. Also, there are singing corpses in it. Only on Fringe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rowling cites Jane Austen as her {{favourite}} {{author and}} a major influence. Rowling has said: [...] "My attitude to Jane Austen is accurately summed up by that wonderful line from Cold Comfort Farm: 'One of the disadvantages of almost universal education was that {{all kinds of people}} gained a familiarity with one's favourite books. It gave one a curious feeling; like seeing a drunken stranger wrapped in one's dressing gown.'" [...] The Harry Potter series is known for its twist endings, and Rowling has stated that, [...] "I have never set up a surprise ending in a Harry Potter book without knowing I can never, and will <b>never,</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anywhere near as well as Austen did in Emma." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, DeVille {{recorded}} Backstreets of Desire, {{the first}} of four albums he would record in Los Angeles with producer John Philip Shenale. [...] "I say it every time I record in L.A. — that I'll <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again, and I keep doing it... It's crazy. I just record and go to the hotel, and never go out, then back to the studio. I hate L.A. It's the worst. I think they eat their children there. I never saw any kids. It's a pity there aren't more studios in New Orleans." [...] Although DeVille complained about having to record in Los Angeles, recording in that city put him in touch with many talented Latino musicians who helped shape his distinctive Spanish-Americana sound.|$|E

And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again."

2500|$|Baron, who {{describes}} bottling as a [...] "traumatic time for wine", has said, [...] "To me, wine {{has always been}} more than something to drink. My family’s love and appreciation of good food, the time I’ve spent in France and the many mentors I've had along the way have led me to {{an appreciation of the}} role wine plays in daily life as well as history and culture. To me, creating wine is one of the ways people preserve civilization." [...] Baron has also said, [...] "Even after years of experience, every vintage feels like a childbirth-if we remembered how much it hurt, we might <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. And wines are much like our children. Their personality is there from day one, and we can track it through, know its essence even if its behavior at any particular moment is off. You get a feel from all of this of where the fruit has been and where it’s going. You have to remember this when you think about judging wines. They're alive and changing moment to moment; they have good days and bad; they show well in a particular glass or with particular food. Judging a wine at any particular moment in its life is like giving a kid a letter grade based on his behavior in the supermarket." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 2011 Booth {{retained}} his British {{title for}} the fourth time and retained his old Commonwealth title. His opponent, Jamie Arthur, had won the vacant belt beating Kris Hughes after Booth had given it up in order to fight for the World title. The fight, at the Brentwood Leisure Centre, resulted in a split decision win with both fighters suffering cuts during the fight. Speaking after the fight, Booth's manager Jimmy Gill said that the fight had only been arranged with three weeks' notice and said that Jason had only just come back from holiday and so had little time to prepare. Gill said, [...] "Jason is 34 in November and small guys like him don't normally last that long. They burn out". He added that he would never allow Booth to take a fight at such short notice again, saying, [...] "That was a favour to promoter Frank Maloney...It was a big ask but he pulled it off...But it was a one-off, I'll <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] Of the fight, Booth paid tribute to Arthur, saying, [...] "That was the hardest fight I've had yet...I had to show heart because I was getting out-foxed by a clever champ. For saying we had three weeks' notice, we put on a good show." [...] Following the fight, it was confirmed that Booth would challenge Spain's Kiko Martínez for the European super bantamweight title, the fourth time Booth would have fought for a variation of the European belt. The fight against Martínez was eventually confirmed for Spain and took place on 15 April 2011 in front of a sell out 30,000 crowd in the city of Madrid. Martínez, a former two time European champion, won the fight in front of his home fans when in the tenth round a left hook was catalyst for the referee to call off the fight early, the first time Booth had been stopped in his career to date.|$|E
