5|$|There {{are several}} ways around the {{original}} doctrine which were not loopholes created by case law but situations which {{by their very nature}} must involve three parties. Broadly speaking these are agency, assignment and <b>negotiable</b> instruments.|$|E
5|$|A <b>negotiable</b> {{instrument}} {{is a type}} of contract that allows the transfer of money, such as a cheque. With a cheque there are three parties - the person holding the bank account who gives the cheque (the drawer), the party the cheque is made out to (the payee) and the drawer's bank which promises to pay the money to the payee (the drawee).|$|E
5|$|The {{short and}} unworthy reigns of Radu V’s successors only {{increased}} {{the crisis of}} Wallachia. Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (15451559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became <b>negotiable,</b> according to the largest tribute offered. Even Michael the Brave who in time would turn against the Ottomans ascended the throne {{with the support of}} some people who had influence with the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the time}} spent outside of battle takes place either in the game's overworld or within dungeons, caves, and other locales with puzzles {{integrated}} into their layout. Unlike the original game, in which the overworld was explored on foot except for a brief, non-navigable boat ride, {{a large portion of}} The Lost Age's gameplay involves navigating a magical ship across a large sea, visiting continents and islands. To complete puzzles, players must either push pillars to construct <b>negotiable</b> paths between elevated areas, climb up or descend cliffs, or obtain a special item to progress through the story and game world. Many of these puzzles revolve heavily around the usage of the game’s resident form of magic spells, Psynergy, requiring the player to find items that grant the bearer new forms of Psynergy in order to accomplish tasks. Acquiring new Psynergy spells gives players access to new locations and secrets hidden within the game world.|$|E
5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (<b>Negotiable</b> Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E
25|$|Outstanding Cashier's Checks, Interest Checks, {{and other}} <b>negotiable</b> {{instruments}} {{drawn on the}} accounts of the credit union.|$|E
25|$|Prepayment. Some {{agreements}} {{may require}} the buyer to pay special fees or penalties if the ARM is paid off early. Prepayment terms are sometimes <b>negotiable.</b>|$|E
25|$|An American {{depositary}} receipt (ADR, and sometimes spelled depository) is a <b>negotiable</b> security that represents securities of a non-U.S. company that trades in the U.S. financial markets.|$|E
25|$|A {{banknote}} (often {{known as}} a bill, paper money, or simply a note) {{is a type of}} <b>negotiable</b> instrument {{known as a}} promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand.|$|E
25|$|Intangible rights {{could not}} be lost or found, and the {{original}} common law rule was that there {{could not be}} a conversion of such. This restriction has been discarded for the most part. In the absence of contravening evidence, the measure of damages for conversion of a <b>negotiable</b> instrument usually is taken to be its face value.|$|E
25|$|Taxis are {{ubiquitous}} in Bangkok, {{and are a}} popular form of transport. , there are 106,050 cars, 58,276 motorcycles and 8,996 tuk-tuk motorized tricycles cumulatively registered for use as taxis. Meters have been required for car taxis since 1992, while tuk-tuk fares are usually negotiated. Motorcycle taxis operate from regulated ranks, with either fixed or <b>negotiable</b> fares, and are usually employed for relatively short journeys.|$|E
25|$|Issue of money, in {{the form}} of {{banknotes}} and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customer's order. These claims on banks can act as money because they are <b>negotiable</b> or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash.|$|E
25|$|The National Commission for Higher Education officially {{accredited}} the AUM on 30 June 2016, after a 14-month {{process which}} included financial and academic evaluations. The commission imposed {{a number of}} conditions on the AUM, including an annual audit by the Clemson University. Sadeen asked for a compromise on these conditions, but the commission insisted {{that they were not}} <b>negotiable.</b> After the conditions were accepted, the commission issued a 5-year university licence on 19 September 2016.|$|E
25|$|ADRs are {{one type}} of {{depositary}} receipt (DR), which are any <b>negotiable</b> securities that represent securities of companies that are foreign to the market on which the DR trades. DRs enable domestic investors to buy securities of foreign companies without the accompanying risks or inconveniences of cross-border and cross-currency transactions. Companies may choose to issue depository receipts in another jurisdiction {{for a host of}} commercial reasons including signalling to their investors and clients about their enhanced corporate governance standard.|$|E
25|$|Payment {{through a}} banker or by written draft against deposit was frequent. Bonds to pay {{were treated as}} <b>negotiable.</b> Interest was rarely charged on {{advances}} by the temple or wealthy landowners for pressing needs, but {{this may have been}} part of the metayer system. The borrowers may have been tenants. Interest was charged at very high rates for overdue loans of this kind. Merchants (and even temples in some cases) made ordinary business loans, charging from 20% to 30%.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s are {{characterized}} {{in the same}} line through an immobility in terms of feminist reforms, {{with the exception of}} some advances not <b>negotiable</b> {{at the beginning of the}} decade: law no. 81-7 of February 18, 1981 entrusting to the widow mother the upbringing of minor children and favouring women in divorce cases. Moreover, on November 1, 1983, Bourguiba named two women ministers, Fathia Mzali to the Ministry of the family and of the Advancement of Women and Souad Yaacoubi to Public Health.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, at {{the insistence}} of Joseph Stalin during the Tehran Conference, {{confirmed}} (as not <b>negotiable)</b> at the Yalta Conference of 1945, Poland's borders were redrawn and Brześć – then again, Brest (Cyrillic: Брест) – was incorporated into the Belorussian SSR of the Soviet Union. The remaining Polish population was expelled and resettled back to new Poland before the end of 1946. The Jewish community was never restored. The USSR officially ceased to exist on 31 December 1991.|$|E
25|$|In {{most common}} law jurisdictions {{there is a}} Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in {{relation}} to <b>negotiable</b> instruments, including cheques, and this Act contains a statutory {{definition of the term}} banker: banker includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.|$|E
25|$|Lamont {{decided that}} the best way of {{securing}} the first two of his negotiating objectives was for Britain to draw up a protocol listing those parts of the treaty from which Britain would be exempted. When Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister chairing the finance ministers' negotiations at Maastricht {{decided that the}} meeting should review the British opt-out line-by-line, Lamont said the text was not <b>negotiable.</b> After Kok persevered, Lamont walked out of the meeting. In his absence, the protocol was endorsed without amendment.|$|E
25|$|The bond is a debt security, {{under which}} the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on {{the terms of the}} bond) is obliged to pay them {{interest}} (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is <b>negotiable,</b> that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Flockhart {{was asked}} to {{audition}} for the starring role in David E. Kelley's Fox television series Ally McBeal. Kelley, having heard of Flockhart, wanted her to audition for the contract part. Though Flockhart at first hesitated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a <b>negotiable</b> contract, she was swayed by the script and traveled to Los Angeles to audition for the part, which she won. She earned a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1998. Flockhart also appeared on the June 29, 1998, cover of Time magazine, placed as the newest iteration {{in the evolution of}} feminism, relating to the ongoing debate about the role depicted by her character.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with changes}} to {{surveillance}} measures, the Patriot Act also made substantial changes to laws relating to money laundering. The main law changed was the Money Laundering Control Act (MLCA), which was itself {{an amendment to}} the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) The BSA was passed by Congress in 1970 and is designed to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and other financial crimes. It requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of <b>negotiable</b> instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $US10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities. The MLCA, passed in 1986, further enhanced the BSA by making it a crime to structure transactions {{in such a way as}} to avoid BSA reporting requirements.|$|E
25|$|Western Pennsylvania {{leaders and}} {{most notably the}} {{designer}} of the 1992 modernization of Pittsburgh International, Tasso Katselas, {{pointed out that the}} reason fees and payments were higher than average is expressly because US Airways requested the most modern and advanced airport in the world in return for basing its hub there. Katselas has also been vocal that the issue of <b>negotiable</b> fees and payments are irrelevant when compared to the three biggest costs of any airline: fuel, time and labor, all of which his redesign of PIT from 1987–1992 helped to reduce. In fact, those changes created the most efficient, least costly and least financially wasteful airfield in the world. Although conceding that those updates cost more, he argued they were more than offset by Pittsburgh's vast built-in nonnegotiable fuel and time, and to a lesser degree, labor savings.|$|E
25|$|In April 1847, Polk sent Undersecretary of State and Chief Clerk Nicholas P. Trist to Mexico with a draft treaty. Secretary of State Buchanan told Trist {{that the}} Californias, upper and lower, New Mexico, and the Texas {{boundary}} were not <b>negotiable.</b> Because of the continued fighting and {{the reluctance of}} the Mexican government to appear frail, Trist did not make contact with Mexican authorities until June. On September 1, negotiations began and lasted five days, breaking down because Polk would not compromise on the Rio Grande boundary and Santa Anna would only give up the area north of Monterey, California, to the United States. He refused to yield any of New Mexico. Mexican politicians argued for continuing the war and stressed their reluctance to endorse any agreement that would give up national territory. Hearing about this, Polk decided to recall Trist, since Mexico would negotiate only if the terms were different. Trist became the Mexican government's only hope for resolution, and therefore gained power in the negotiations. He stayed true to the United States’ territorial ambitions, not yielding on the Rio Grande boundary, or backing down to Mexican resistance to giving up New Mexico and California.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, in Germany, the {{relation}} between individual employees and employers {{is considered to be}} asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not <b>negotiable</b> due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association Verein Deutscher Ingenieure does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.|$|E
25|$|City Bank of New York was {{chartered}} by New York State on June 16, 1812, with $2million of capital. Serving a {{group of}} New York merchants, the bank opened for business on September 14 of that year, and Samuel Osgood was elected as the first President of the company. The company's name was changed to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U.S. national banking system, and it became the largest American bank by 1895. It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had, since the mid-19th century, been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry. The 1918 purchase of U.S. overseas bank International Banking Corporation helped it become the first American bank to surpass $1 billion in assets, and it became the largest commercial bank {{in the world in}} 1929. As it grew, the bank became a leading innovator in financial services, becoming the first major U.S. bank to offer compound interest on savings (1921); unsecured personal loans (1928); customer checking accounts (1936) and the <b>negotiable</b> certificate of deposit (1961).|$|E
25|$|The Leva or Lewa are {{synonymous with}} the Lewa Patil—the suffix Patil is a feudal title. The {{community}} {{does not have an}} oral history of their origin or migration, but they generally accept that they migrated from Gujarat to the Vidharba region via Nimar (now part of Madhya Pradesh). The community is associated with two other communities from Gujarat: the Lewa and the Lewa Patidar. The former are a well known community; the latter are sometimes referred to as their parental group, but the Kunbi Leva Patil of Maharashtra have roots which are long established in the Kunbi community of Maharashtra. The community perceives their distribution to be in 72 villages in the Jalgaon and Buldhana districts. The Lewa Patil are numerically, economically and educationally superior in some of the multi-ethnic villages of the Buldhana and Jalgaon district. Nuclear families are replacing the traditional extended family system due to a changing economy and an increasing number of conflicts over property inheritance. Cremation of the dead is the norm, burial the exception for the very young (up to three to four months old). There is no distinctive attire of the Leva community—they follow local fashion trends. On very rare occasions, older Leva men wear a Gujarati style, boat shaped topi or hat made from black or brown silk. Some of the common Leva surnames are Warade (Deshmukh), Narkhede, Kharche, Supe, Borle, Panchpande and Kolte. Dowry is practiced in the Leva community. The amount is <b>negotiable.</b> The attitude towards formal education is positive though Leva girls drop out of school earlier due to social conditions.|$|E
25|$|Christchurch {{was popular}} with smugglers {{for a number}} of reasons: Firstly, the only land {{approaches}} to the town were across two bridges, and one of these was frequently out of use. The other could easily be blocked, perhaps by a herd of sheep or a heavy cart, giving the smugglers time for a leisurely escape. Secondly, it was close to the Cotentin Peninsula but not so close that a boat placed mid channel could observe both coasts. In good weather the coast of France is visible from the Kent coast but a vessel crossing to and from Dorset would be out of site for almost half the journey, and would therefore be able to claim it had come from another port or had been involved in the business of fishing. The beaches around Christchurch were sandy and gently sloping so boats could be run ashore without fear of damage. Although remote from its neighbours, cut off by heathland and forest, the roads inland were good; added to which the two rivers provided alternative routes for contraband, at a time when transport by water was faster and cheaper than overland movement of goods. Finally, there was the harbour itself. The entrance to which is a narrow channel, the Run, which was <b>negotiable</b> only with extreme care. Entering the harbour was made even more difficult by sandbanks that could shift overnight. To the smugglers, most of whom were professional and experienced seamen the harbour entrance was an open gate. But to the less skilled sailors on the revenue cutters, who had no local knowledge, the Run acted as 'a barrier that they feared to pass'.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} was desirous of attracting wealthy Jews to the country, {{but it was}} equally careful to keep out itinerant door-to-door sellers of trinkets, {{quite a number of}} whom had in previous years entered Sweden from Germany. Any foreign Jew who landed in Sweden was accordingly required to report, within eight days of his arrival, to the local authorities, and to produce his passport and a certificate of character, as well as a statement of his purpose in coming to the country. These certificates were issued by the elders of the congregation to which the immigrant belonged in his native country, and had to be verified by the municipal authorities of the place in which the immigrant had last resided. If the certificates were unsatisfactory, the authorities were at liberty to expel the holder; but in case he was admitted he was directed to Stockholm, Gothenburg, or Norrköping. Jews who were residents of the country prior to the promulgation of this ordinance were called upon to present their certificates of character to the proper authorities, together with a statement setting forth in which city they desired to settle and make their living. The ordinance enumerated the different trades the Jews were permitted to follow, and it stipulated also that they should apprentice their sons to Swedish tradesmen in one of the three cities mentioned above. In order to prevent the overcrowding of the mercantile field it was prescribed that no foreign-born Jew should be allowed to start in business unless he possessed at least 2,000 Swedish riksdaler in cash or <b>negotiable</b> securities; a native-born Jew need have only 1,000 riksdaler. Rabbis were exempt, and according to previous ordinances, poor Jews were to be deported from the country.|$|E
500|$|A {{substitute}} check (also {{called an}} Image Replacement Document or IRD) is a <b>negotiable</b> instrument {{used to represent}} the digital reproduction of an original paper check. In the United States, as a <b>negotiable</b> payment instrument, a substitute check maintains {{the status of a}} [...] "legal check" [...] in lieu of the original paper check as authorized by the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as the Check 21 Act). Instead of presenting the original paper checks, financial institutions and payment processing centers electronically transmit data from a substitute check by either the settlement process through the United States Federal Reserve System or by clearing the deposit based on a private agreement between member financial institutions of a clearinghouse that operates under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).|$|E

500|$|In the Golden Sun games, players guide {{a cast of}} {{characters}} as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, interact with other characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and {{take part in a}} building, predefined narrative. Much of the game's time spent outside of battle takes place in dungeons, caves, and other locales, which generally require the player to find items that grant the bearer new forms of [...] "Psynergy", or magical spells, in order to solve the puzzles integrated into their layout. To complete these puzzles, players must either push pillars to construct <b>negotiable</b> paths between elevated areas, climb up and rappel down cliffs or obtain a special item to progress through the story and game world.

500|$|Historian David Carter {{presents}} information {{indicating that}} the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those {{who worked in the}} Financial District. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of <b>negotiable</b> bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay Wall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered, ...|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Ben Davis, {{who also}} worked with Marvel on Guardians of the Galaxy, shot the film with a main unit of three Arri Alexa cameras. Davis said, [...] "Although the Alexa was Marvel's {{preferred}} camera, we weren't locked into that choice from the start. What wasn't <b>negotiable</b> {{was the fact that}} we were shooting digital: that's how Marvel shoots all of its films." [...] Davis also used Blackmagic Design's Pocket Cinema Cameras to meet the needs of the second unit kit explaining, [...] "The second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire, as it were, that we throw at them." [...] About the camera system, Whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one; using lots of long lenses, and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary. To create the scenes depicting how Quicksilver views the world, scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of Taylor-Johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed.|$|E

500|$|After {{signing the}} group, Virgin Records {{launched}} a major campaign for their debut song to promote {{them as the}} new high-profile act. There {{was a period of}} indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be [...] "Wannabe", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be [...] "Say You'll Be There", which they considered a much [...] "cooler" [...] track, or [...] "Love Thing". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that [...] "Wannabe" [...] should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, [...] "It's not <b>negotiable</b> as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single." [...] Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.|$|E
