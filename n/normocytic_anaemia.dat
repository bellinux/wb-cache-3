40|$|Background Previous {{research}} has demonstrated an association between anaemia and poor outcomes in acute stroke. This study aimed {{to assess the impact}} of anaemia on stroke by anaemia subtype. Methodsandnbsp; Data from a prospective UK Regional Stroke Register were used to assess the association between hypochromic microcytic and normochromic <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> on inpatient-mortality, length of stay (LOS) and discharge modified Rankin scale (mRS). Analysis was stratified by stroke subtypes and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders, was used to quantify this association. Patients who were not anaemic were the reference category. Results A total of 8167 stroke patients (admitted between 2003 and 2015) were included, mean age (SD) 77. 39 andplusmn; 11. 90 years. Of these, 3. 4 % (n = 281) had hypochromic microcytic anaemia and 15. 5 % (n = 1262) had normochromic <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> on admission. Normochromic <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> was associated with increased odds of in-patient mortality OR 1. 48 (1. 24 andndash; 1. 77), 90 -day mortality OR 1. 63 (1. 38 andndash; 1. 92), longer LOS OR 1. 21 (1. 06 andndash; 1. 40), defined as andgt; 7 days, and severe disability defined as discharge mRS andge; 3 OR 1. 31 (1. 06 andndash; 1. 63), in patients with ischaemic stroke. Hypochromic microcytic anaemia was associated with 90 -day mortality OR 1. 90 (1. 40 andndash; 2. 58) and a longer LOS OR 1. 57 (1. 20 andndash; 2. 05) in patients with ischaemic stroke. Conclusions Hypochromic microcytic and normochromic <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> are associated with differing outcomes in terms of inpatient mortality and post stroke disability. While it is unclear if anaemia per se or another underlying cause is responsible for adverse outcomes, subtype of anaemia appears to be relevant in stroke prognosis. </p...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the haematological profile of healthy adolescents in Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire). Our study was undertaken with 847 healthy volunteers adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years. They were selected in three municipalities of Abidjan. The complete blood cells count was analyzed for each of these adolescents and each blood sample was screened for hemoglobin pathologies by using electrophoresis on cellulose acetate membranes at alkaline pH. The values of all parameters in the complete blood cells count were normal for 9. 4 % against 90. 6 % with the abnormal haematological status.

40|$|Background: Anaemia is a known {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} disease and treating anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) may improve outcomes. However, {{little is known about}} the scope to improve primary care management of anaemia in CKD. Methods. An observational study (N = 1, 099, 292) with a nationally representative sample using anonymised routine primary care data from 127 Quality Improvement in CKD trial practices (ISRCTN 5631023731). We explored variables associated with anaemia in CKD: eGFR, haemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), iron status, cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of therapy which associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, oral iron and deprivation score. We developed a linear regression model to identify variables amenable to improved primary care management. Results: The prevalence of Stage 3 - 5 CKD was 6. 76 %. Hb was lower in CKD (13. 2 g/dl) than without (13. 7 g/dl). 22. 2 % of people with CKD had World Health Organization defined anaemia; 8. 6 % had Hb ≤ 11 g/dl; 3 % Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 1 % Hb ≤ 9 g/dl. <b>Normocytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> was present in 80. 5 % with Hb ≤ 11; 72. 7 % with Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 67. 6 % with Hb ≤ 9 g/dl; microcytic anaemia in 13. 4 % with Hb ≤ 11 g/dl; 20. 8 % with Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 24. 9 % where Hb ≤ 9 g/dl. 82. 7 % of people with microcytic and 58. 8 % with <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> (Hb ≤ 11 g/dl) had a low ferritin (60 % of people with <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia.</b> Prescribing oral iron has not corrected anaemia. © 2013 Dmitrieva et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In iron {{deficiency}} anaemia basic red cell content of ferritin is appreciably reduced. This variable was determined in 62 patients with rheumatoid arthritis to evaluate conventional laboratory indices for {{iron deficiency}} in the anaemia of rheumatoid arthritis. For 23 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> irrespective of plasma ferritin concentration, red cell ferritin content {{did not differ significantly}} from that for non-anaemic patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For 27 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and microcytic anaemia, the mean red cell ferritin content for patients with a plasma ferritin concentration in the 13 - 110 micrograms/l range was appreciably reduced. It was indistinguishable from that for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and classical {{iron deficiency anaemia}}, indicated by plasma ferritin concentrations of less than 12 micrograms/l. In contrast, the mean red cell ferritin content for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, microcytic anaemia, and plasma ferritin concentrations above 110 micrograms/l did not differ from that for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia.</b> Oral treatment with iron in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, microcytic anaemia, and appreciably reduced red cell ferritin concentrations was accompanied by significant increases in haemoglobin concentration (p less than 0. 01), mean corpuscular volume (p less than 0. 01), and red cell ferritin contents (p less than 0. 05). This treatment, however, did not produce any appreciable change in haemoglobin concentration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, <b>normocytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> and normal red cell ferritin contents.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{cause of}} 1. 2 - 1. 5 million deaths worldwide, {{including}} deaths from TB among HIV positive people. Determining the extent of immune cells belonging to cell mediated immunity and haematological parameters is critical to maximize the potential benefit of anti-tubercular treatment and case management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative cross sectional {{study was conducted to}} determine the white blood cell (WBC) count, CD 4, CD 8, haemoglobin (Hgb), red blood cell (RBC) count, mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) between newly diagnosed TB patients and apparently healthy controls (HCs). RESULTS: From consecutively enrolled 108 TB patients, pulmonary TB (PTB) accounted for 48 (44. 4 %), TB lymphadenitis accounted for 48 (44. 4 %), and disseminated/miliary TB accounted for 12 (11. 1 %). Analysis of variance revealed that mean + SD of CD 4 count of male TB patients (650 + 224 cells/µl) was significantly lower than male control group (883 + 256 cells/µl) (p = 0. 001). In a similar manner, the mean CD 4 count of female TB patients (793 + 332 cells/µl) was lower than female control group (975 + 300 cells/µl) (p= 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference in CD 8 counts between cases and controls for both genders. Forty (37. 0 %) TB patients had developed anaemia of whom 22 (55 %) were among PTB, 13 (32. 5 %) from tuberculous lymphadenitis and 5 (20 %) from disseminated TB. Morphologically, from all anaemia among TB patients, <b>normocytic</b> normochromic <b>anaemia</b> accounted for 15 (37. 5 %) followed by <b>normocytic</b> hypochromic <b>anaemia</b> 13 (30. 4 %).

Such patients not only have depressed erythropoiesis but also have inappropriately low serum erythropoietin levels [1]. In addition, cisplatin impairs erythropoietin production by causing progressive damage to the renal tubules, further blunting the response to anaemia.

We report a 48 -year-old {{woman who was}} admitted to hospital due to malaise, jaundice, fever and pain in the neck. Physical examination revealed jaundice, tachycardia (pulse rate was 120 /min), hypotension 90 / 60 mm Hg. Laboratory findings showed <b>normocytic</b> normochromic <b>anaemia,</b> inflammatory syndrome and abnormal liver function tests indicating cholestasis and hepatocellular necrosis. Abdominal ultrasonography detected hepatosplenomegaly. Chest computed tomography showed bronchopneumonic infiltrates. Percutaneous liver biopsy was performed using a Menghini needle of 1. 4 mm. Pathohystological analysis of the liver tissue confirmed reactive, intrahepatic cholestasis. Blood cultures isolated Staphylococcus aureus. After the diagnosis was established the treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics was carried out, resulting in the improvement of general condition of the patient, regression of inflammatory syndrome, disappearance of cholestasis and regression of pulmonary infiltrates. Abdominal ultrasonography after antibiotic treatment did not show hepatosplenomegaly. Conclusion. Concerning patients with cholestasis of uncertain origin, we should always think of sepsis as a possible cause in order to start antibiotic treatment in time...|$|R
40|$|Canine {{babesiosis}} is {{a frequent}} and clinically significant tick-borne disease. Sixty symptomatic dogs with clinical findings compatible with babesiosis were {{included in this study}} conducted in Serbia. After clinical examination, blood samples were taken for microscopic examination, complete blood count (CBC), Canine SNAP 4 Dx Test, DNA analyses and sequencing. The main clinical signs included apathy, anorexia, fever, brown/red discoloration of urine, pale mucous membranes, icterus, splenomegaly, and vomiting. The main clinicopathological findings in Babesia infections were a slight to severe thrombocytopenia and a mild to very severe <b>normocytic</b> normochromic <b>anaemia.</b> Microscopic evaluation revealed 58 positive samples with the presence of large and small intraerythrocytic piroplasms in 57 and 1 sample(s), respectively. No co-infections were found using SNAP test. Two Babesia species, B. canis (58 / 60) and B. gibsoni (2 / 60), were differentiated by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Species identification was further confirmed by sequencing PCR products of B. gibsoni samples and six randomly selected B. canis samples. All dogs were treated with imidocarb dipropionate (6. 6 mg/kg of body weight), given intramuscularly twice at an interval of 14 days. This report presents the first molecular evidence of the occurrence of B. gibsoni and B. canis, confirmed by DNA sequencing, in sick dogs from Serbia. ...|$|R
40|$|Anaemia is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality in bovine trypanosomiasis and has served as the main parameter to monitor the severity of the disease. In fact, trypanosome-infected cattle experience intermittent episodes of pancytopaenia including anaemia, leucopaenia and trombocytopaenia. Considering the multiple blood cell lineages affected by the disease, it was hypothesized that a defect in the bone marrow, site of origin of those cells, might be a cause. Study of the bone marrow response was intitiated in the laboratory using a Trypanosoma congolense rechallenge infection in five Boran cattle. The cattle developed a non-responsive, <b>normocytic,</b> <b>normocytic,</b> normochromic <b>anaemia</b> during the first ten weeks of the infection, characterized by low levles of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. Subsequently, between week 10 and 14, a responsive macrocytic hypochromic anaemia followed, characterized by peaks of CFU-E, slight increase of BFU-E levels and appearance of BFU-E in the peripheral blood. During trypanosome infection the trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle usually develop a moderate anaemia associated with lower parasitaemia when compared to the susceptible Zebu cattle such as the Boran. The present study was undertaken to determine if the ability of the N'Dama cattle to better control anaemia resides in a superior bone marrow response...|$|R
