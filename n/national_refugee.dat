2500|$|According to {{a foreign}} aid-agency {{official}} {{who was in the}} north after the fighting broke out: the Siyad Barre government was so eager to arm the Ogaden refugees that it enlisted workers of the civilian <b>National</b> <b>Refugee</b> Commission – which administers the Ogaden refugee camps – to help distribute weapons... 'Now all the camps are heavily armed' an experienced western aid official said. Some of the camps' adult males are thought to have headed for the bush to avoid being drafted by the government... Many others are said to have accepted weapons from the government and left their camps in search of Isaaqs ... Recent travellers in the north added that many Ogaden Somalis from the UN refugee camps – and a fair number of another pro-government group, the Oromo, have been seen carrying American M-16 rifles.The Ogadeni refugees formed militant groups that hunted Isaaq civilians around Bioley, Adhi-Adais, Saba'ad, Las-Dhureh, Daamka and Agabar refugee camps. In many cases, the Isaaq victims were left unburied [...] "to be eaten by wild beasts." ...|$|E

50|$|Building on the {{resettlement}} {{program that}} had been established under the NCC, the <b>National</b> <b>Refugee</b> Service within its first year expanded the network of cooperating organizations to an additional 200 communities.p. 366 Moreover, it maintained a staff of field representatives that communicated with and traveled to local communities in order to troubleshoot {{in a variety of}} matters related to the communities' work with refugees, including migration, family assistance, employment, retraining, and loans.p. 53 The <b>National</b> <b>Refugee</b> Service also produced reports and statistical studies that documented its own work and the work of cooperating agencies; and disseminated factual information about United States immigration during the period, and the changing character and situation of the refugee population in the United States. Through its newsletters and community bulletins, and special reports the <b>National</b> <b>Refugee</b> Service kept cooperating groups informed about the international situation, new legislation, changing government regulations, and any other circumstances that affected the lives of refugees and the work of those helping them. Beginning in late 1941, the <b>National</b> <b>Refugee</b> Service also had a Community Relations department, which took the lead in soliciting the participation of lay leaders in the agency's work by forming a number of advisory committees; oversaw relationships with local communities across the country; and directed promotional mailings and maintained a speakers bureau.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} six years, {{the war on drugs}} in Mexico has {{resulted}} in the out-migration {{of tens of thousands of}} Mexican nationals fleeing violence, many settling in El Paso, Texas. The historical context of being pulled to the U. S. for economic opportunity had changed. Mexican <b>nationals</b> were now <b>refugees</b> pushed out of their country for safety. Because the context of migration had changed, the close proximity and similarities between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, and the availability of social support in the U. S., the experiences of this refugee cohort were unique. Because increasing numbers were seeking mental health and legal assistance in El Paso, Texas, it was important to understand their perspectives in order to provide culturally enhanced services to this population. Therefore the purpose of this study was to explore and describe the pre, peri, and post-migration perspectives of Mexican <b>national</b> <b>refugees</b> fleeing violence in Mexico. ^ This study was nested within a larger, mixed methods study entitled 2 ̆ 2 Subjective Experiences and Mental Health Sequelæ of Mexican Refugees Fleeing Violence in Mexico 2 ̆ 2 and conducted from November 2010 through November 2011. This criterion-based sample was comprised of 22 Mexican <b>national</b> <b>refugees</b> in El Paso, Texas. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews. Following IRB approval for secondary data analysis of these interviews, qualitative within and across-context analysis using Silove 2 ̆ 7 s core adaptive systems framework was conducted on 18 interviews and data saturation maintained. Analysis identified that in the pre-migration phase, loss of trust and experiences of violence led to a fear for safety that catalyzed the decision to migrate to El Paso, Texas. Personal attachments were most affected during the peri-migration phase. The post-migration phase marked a period of improved sense of personal safety, yet issues of mistrust and a sense of injustice continued. Deconstruction of categories and themes revealed that despite cumulative violence exposures, Mexican refugees had maintained a strong sense of identity and culture through adaptive mechanisms of maintaining a culture of silence and cultural coherence. Based on these findings, it was concluded that Mexican <b>national</b> <b>refugees</b> exhibited an incredible resilience. Because of the cultural discontinuity between the U. S. and Mexico and systems of structural violence in the U. S., Mexican children are vulnerable to poor identity and moral development. Policy, educational, and cultural interventions and recommendations are presented. ...|$|R
