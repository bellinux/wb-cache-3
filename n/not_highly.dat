However, he recovered well from the injury and was given a two-year professional contract in 1998. He made his Premier League debut on 10 May 1998, coming on for Michael Clegg 60 minutes into a 2–0 win over Barnsley at Oakwell.|$|E

He went unnoticed by scouts until he experienced a growth spurt {{at the age of}} 15. Local scouts asked Nova to pitch in a game against older players, and he continued to train as a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|The archeological {{record for}} the {{prehistory}} of Biblical Hebrew is far more complete than the record of Biblical Hebrew itself. Early Northwest Semitic (ENWS) materials are attested from 2350BCE to 1200BCE, {{the end of the}} Bronze Age. The Northwest Semitic languages, including Hebrew, differentiated noticeably during the Iron Age (1200–540BCE), although in its earliest stages Biblical Hebrew was <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> differentiated from Ugaritic and the Canaanite of the Amarna letters.|$|E

During his adolescence, he briefly fronted A Shot in the Dark, a Rolling Stones cover band. When he was younger, he had hoped to study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving. The damage also left him deaf in his right ear.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet {{decided to become a}} pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Harry S. Truman became President of the United States on {{the death}} of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and won an {{unexpected}} victory in the 1948 presidential election. He was the only president who served after 1897 without a college degree. Although <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> educated, Truman was well read. When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901, he enrolled in a local business school, but only lasted a semester. He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School, but dropped out. Truman attempted to gain admission to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was rejected for his poor eyesight. He was proud of his military service in the artillery during World War I, and held a reserve commission as a colonel.|$|E

5|$|Income and {{enrollment}} fell {{during the}} Great Depression. Between 1917 and 1930, enrollment fell from 205 students to 140. The school sought accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, but the application was denied because {{the college and}} academy could not be accredited as a single institution, and financial constraints prevented their separation. In 1932 the abbey and the school lost most of their money when the Kaspar American Bank in Chicago failed. Academic programs and student activities were not greatly affected, {{in part because the}} faculty was mainly clergymen, who were <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> paid. Still unaccredited, the school was certified by the state of Illinois in September 1934.|$|E
5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E

He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.|$|E

5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|Relatively speaking, bites {{from this}} species are <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although {{it is not clear whether}} her death was due to the effect of the venom. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year.|$|E
5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is reportedly <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> active, spending much time {{buried in the}} sediment. It is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects the most available prey in its environment. It mainly captures prey off the bottom, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. A variety of invertebrates, as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and scup, {{are known to be}} consumed. Off Massachusetts, the main prey are crabs (Cancer), bivalves (Mya), gastropods (Polinices), squid (Loligo) and annelid worms. In Delaware Bay, most of its diet consists of the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata; the overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays (D. say) that share the bay. The shrimp Upogebia affinis is a major food source off Virginia. Off Florida, crustaceans (Rananoides, Ovalipes, Sicyonia brevirostris, and Portunus) and polychaete worms are the most important prey.|$|E

5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E

Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint because they are <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> energetic.

5|$|Waxwings are <b>not</b> <b>highly</b> territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest {{close together}} {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
