500|$|Renwick {{decided to}} use the {{flashback}} structure for several reasons. He felt that the episode should be about [...] "life After Victor, which I think will be more interesting and not the route people are expecting you to take." [...] He realised that most viewers would have been aware of Victor's death because of the press coverage; there would be little point in having the death be the climax of the episode because everyone already knew the outcome. However, the focus would be upon Victor's death rather than the details of the accident. Renwick's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer's concerns about reckless driving. Also, the suddenness of an accident, as opposed to death by illness, would not negate the comic tone {{of the rest of the}} episode. The twist that the person responsible for Victor's death is Margaret's <b>new</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was designed to add some complexity to the show.|$|E
