5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland does <b>not</b> <b>require</b> thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) {{makes it more}} likely that thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach.
