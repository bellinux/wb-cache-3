25|$|Drinking {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{a significant part of}} Wisconsin culture, and the state ranks at or near the top of <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> of per-capita alcohol consumption, consumption of alcohol per state, and proportion of drinkers. Consumption per-capita per-event, however, ranks low among the nation; number of events (number of times alcohol is involved) is significantly higher or highest, but consumption at each event smaller, marking Wisconsin's consumption as frequent and moderate. Factors such as cultural identification with the state's heritage of German immigration, the longstanding presence of major breweries in Milwaukee, and a cold climate are often associated with the prevalence of drinking in Wisconsin.|$|E

It adopted a first reading report on harmonizing the <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for fighting copyright abuse. If the European Parliament and the Council approve the legislation, the submitted directive will oblige the member states to consider a crime a violation of international copyright committed with commercial purposes. The text suggests numerous measures: from fines to imprisonment, depending on {{the gravity of the}} offense. The EP members {{supported the}} Commission motion, changing some of the texts. They excluded patent rights from the range of the directive and decided that the sanctions should apply only to offenses with commercial purposes. Copying for personal, non-commercial purposes was also excluded from the range of the directive.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 2013, Croatian {{nationals}} became European Union {{citizens and}} acquired {{the right to}} move and reside freely in other EU member states, {{as well as in}} Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On the same day, 14 EU member states (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden) allowed Croatian nationals to work without restrictions in their country. However, 13 other EU member states imposed transitional restrictions on Croatian nationals wishing to access their labour markets. Annex V of the Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union allows member states to apply <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> regulating Croatian nationals’ access to their labour markets for a period of up to five years, and in case of serious disturbance to their labour markets or the threat thereof, and after notifying the Commission, for a further two years (i.e. up to a maximum of seven years in total).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The 2006 {{request by}} the USDA-RBCS to <b>measure</b> the <b>national</b> {{economic}} impact of cooperatives {{is an indication of}} the perceived importance of this sector to the <b>national</b> economy. <b>Measuring</b> the <b>national</b> {{economic impact of}} cooperatives is a complex process. After reviewing some of the previous work done to generate region-specific measures of economic impacts, this paper identifies a set of research issues which must be addressed in the course of conducting this research. Resolving these research issues will make the <b>national</b> <b>measure</b> more useful for members of the cooperative community and policy makers...|$|R

60|$|But I {{remember}} one dancer {{who was really}} a great artist. She was ill-favoured, of middle age, thin; but every part of her was imbued with grace, expressive, from {{the tips of her}} toes to the tips of her fingers. The demands of the public sometimes forced upon her odious ballet-skirts, sometimes she wasted her talent on the futilities of skirt-dancing; but chiefly she loved the <b>national</b> <b>measures,</b> and her phenomenal leanness made her only comfortable in the national dress. She travelled from place to place in Spain with another woman whom she had taught to dance, and whose beauty she used cleverly as a foil to her own uncomeliness; and so wasted herself in these low resorts, earning hardly sufficient to keep body and soul together. I wish I could remember her name.|$|E
60|$|In such a {{state of}} things can it be amiss if I aim at holding out some comfort to the nation; another sort of comfort, indeed, than that which this writer {{provides}} for it; a comfort not from its physician, but from its constitution: if I attempt to show that all the arguments upon which he founds the decay of that constitution, {{and the necessity of}} that physician, are vain and frivolous? I will follow the author closely in his own long career, through the war, the peace, the finances, our trade, and our foreign politics: not {{for the sake of the}} particular measures which he discusses; that can be of no use; they are all decided; their good is all enjoyed, or their evil incurred: but for the sake of the principles of war, peace, trade, and finances. These principles are of infinite moment. They must come again and again under consideration; and it imports the public, of all things, that those of its ministers be enlarged, and just, and well confirmed, upon all these subjects. What notions this author entertains we shall see presently; notions in my opinion very irrational, and extremely dangerous; and which, if they should crawl from pamphlets into counsels, and be realized from private speculation into <b>national</b> <b>measures,</b> cannot fail of hastening and completing our ruin.|$|E
