40|$|An {{electroretinogram}} (ERG) screen {{identified a}} mouse {{with a normal}} a-wave but lacking a b-wave, and as such it was designated no b-wave 3 (<b>nob</b> 3). The <b>nob</b> 3 phenotype mapped to chromosome 11 in a region containing the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 gene (Grm 6). Sequence analyses of cDNA identified a splicing error in Grm 6, introducing an insertion and an early stop codon into the mRNA of affected mice (designated Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 3). Immunohistochemistry of the Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 3 retina showed that GRM 6 was absent. The ERG and visual behaviour abnormalities of Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 3 mice are similar to Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 4 animals, and similar deficits were seen in compound heterozygotes (Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 4 /nob 3), indicating that Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 3 is allelic to Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 4. Visual responses of Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 3 retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to light onset were abnormal. Grm 6 <b>nob</b> 3 ON RGCs were rarely recorded, but when they were, had ill-defined receptive field (RF) centres and delayed onset latencies.

Extracorporeal antitumor test showed that <b>Nob</b> may be a new category of effective anticancer medicine which had excellent cytotoxicity as well as inhibited vascular endothelial cell (VEC) proliferation and migration in vitro and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis in vivo at a lower dose. Unfortunately, the clinical application of <b>Nob</b> was severely limited by the low bioavailability of <b>Nob</b> after oral administration, and highly toxic especially heart toxicity and the ability causing hemolysis of blood cells after intravenous injection. To reduce the hemolysis and toxicity of <b>Nob</b> after intravenous injection, liposomes were used as its carriers and good effect was acquired in our previous study.

NIN 1 /RPN 12 binding protein 1 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (<b>NOB</b> 1) encodes a {{chaperone}} protein that joins the 20 S proteasome with the 19 S regulatory particle in the nucleus and facilitates the biogenesis of the 26 S proteasome, which {{plays a role}} in maintaining cellular homeo-stasis by controlling protein degradation. In order to investigate the role of <b>NOB</b> 1 in osteosarcoma, <b>NOB</b> 1 protein expression in human osteosarcoma cell lines was assessed using western blot analysis. Lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA was employed to knock down <b>NOB</b> 1, and the effects of <b>NOB</b> 1 silencing on cell growth were assessed using MTT, colony formation and cell cycle assays. Cell migration was observed using the Transwell assay. In addition, the expression levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin were examined by western blot analysis. Functional analysis indicated that <b>NOB</b> 1 -knockdown markedly inhibited cell growth and caused G 2 /M-phase arrest in human osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, <b>NOB</b> 1 inhibi-tion decreased cell migration and increased E-cadherin and β-catenin expression in U 2 OS cells. In conclusion, the present study suggested that <b>NOB</b> 1 depletion may inhibit osteosarcoma development by increasing E-cadherin and β-catenin expres-sion and, for the first time, indicated the potential of <b>NOB</b> 1 as a target in osteosarcoma treatment...|$|R

The absence of <b>NOB</b> in the microbial aggregates could partially {{be explained by the}} alternating inhibitions of free ammonia (FA, ~ 140  mg-NH 3 -N/L) and free nitrous acids (FNA, ~ 0.15  mg-HNO 2 -N/L) at {{the beginning and the end}} of the aerobic phases, respectively (Anthonisen et al. 1976). These values are much higher than the inhibition thresholds on <b>NOB</b> reported previously. Kim et al. pointed out 0.1 – 1.0  mg/L of FA will inhibit <b>NOB,</b> while AOB exhibit a much stronger tolerance to FA, withstanding concentrations up to 10 – 160  mg/L (Kim et al. 2005). Vadivelu et al. (2006) reported that <b>NOB</b> is thoroughly inhibited when concentration of FA and FNA reach 6 and 0.02  mg/L, respectively. Low DO concentration exerts a competitive inhibition by AOB over <b>NOB</b> due to the higher half-saturation coefficient of DO affinity for <b>NOB</b> (Picioreanu et al. 1997). <b>NOB</b> were more severely inhibited under low DO conditions than AOB, which partially account for the absence of <b>NOB</b> in granular activated sludge.

40|$|Background/Aims: An {{increase}} in oxidative stress has {{been implicated in}} the pathophysiology of pressure-overload induced cardiac hypertrophy. Nobiletin (<b>NOB),</b> extracted from the fruit peel of citrus, possesses anti-oxidative property. Our study aimed to investigate the protective role of <b>NOB</b> in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Mice received aortic banding (AB) operation to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Experimental groups were as follows: sham+vehicle (VEH/SH), sham+NOB (NOB/SH), AB+vehicle (VEH/AB), and AB+ <b>NOB</b> (NOB/AB). Animals (n = 15 per group) were treated with vehicle or <b>NOB</b> (50 mg/kg) for 4 weeks after disease onset. Results: <b>NOB</b> prevented cardiac hypertrophy induced by aortic banding (AB), as assessed by the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes, heart weight-to-body weight ratio, gene expression of hypertrophic markers and cardiac function. In addition, <b>NOB</b> supplementation blunted the increased expression of NAPDH oxidase (NOX) 2 and NOX 4 and mitigated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and myocyte apoptosis in cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, <b>NOB</b> treatment attenuated the neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (NRCM) hypertrophic response stimulated by phenylephrine (PE) and alleviated ER stress. However, our data showed that <b>NOB</b> dramatically inhibited NOX 2 expression but not NOX 4 in vitro. Finally, we found that knockdown of NOX 2 attenuated ER stress in NRCMs stimulated by PE. Conclusions: Inhibition of oxidative and ER stress by <b>NOB</b> in the myocardium may represent a potential therapy for cardiac hypertrophy.

40|$|Ribosome {{assembly}} is {{a hierarchical}} process that involves pre-rRNA folding, modification, and cleavage and assembly of ribosomal proteins. In eukaryotes, this process requires a macromolecular complex comprising over 200 proteins and RNAs. Whereas the rRNA modification machinery is well-characterized, rRNA cleavage to release mature rRNAs is poorly understood, and in yeast, only 2 of 8 endonucleases have been identified. The essential and conserved ribosome assembly factor <b>Nob</b> 1 {{has been suggested}} to be the endonuclease responsible for generating the mature 3 ′-end of 18 S rRNA by cleaving at site D. Here we provide evidence that recombinant <b>Nob</b> 1 forms a tetramer that binds directly to pre-rRNA analogs containing cleavage site D. Analysis of <b>Nob</b> 1 's affinity {{to a series of}} RNA truncations, as well as <b>Nob</b> 1 -dependent protections of pre-rRNA in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that <b>Nob</b> 1 's binding site centers around the 3 ′-end of 18 S rRNA, where our data also locate <b>Nob</b> 1 's suggested active site. Thus, <b>Nob</b> 1 is poised for cleavage at the 3 ′-end of 18 S rRNA. Together with prior data, these results strongly implicate <b>Nob</b> 1 in cleavage at site D.

Key soil variables (moisture, organic carbon content and gross mineralization – i. e. ammonification – measured by the 15 N dilution technique) were also surveyed. PNO was always higher for the no-tillage than tillage treatments. Establishment of tillage led to a strong and rapid decrease in PNO whereas cessation of tillage did not change PNO even after 17 months. PNO was strongly and positively correlated to the abundance of Nitrobacter-like <b>NOB</b> and was also strongly related to gross mineralization, a proxy of N-availability; in contrast, PNO was weakly and negatively correlated to the abundance of Nitrospiralike <b>NOB.</b> Selection of a dominant population was observed under no-tillage, and PNO was loosely correlated to the community structure of Nitrobacter-like <b>NOB.</b> Our results demonstrate that Nitrobacter-like <b>NOB</b> are the key functional players within the <b>NOB</b> community in soils with high N availability and high activity level, and that changes in PNO are due to shifts between Nitrospira-like and Nitrobacter-like <b>NOB</b> and to a weaker extent by shifts of populations within Nitrobacter-like <b>NOB...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ribosome {{assembly}} in eukaryotes requires hundreds of conserved essential proteins {{not present in}} the mature particle. Because deletion of individual assembly factors typically disrupts multiple assembly steps and changes {{the composition of the}} entire pre-ribosomal particle, determining the essential function of individual assembly factors has become a main focus of ribosomal research. Furthermore, many proteins appear to be present in assembling ribosomes for extended times making it difficult to pinpoint their role to a distinct step.

Analysis of Dim 2 mutants, in which the interaction with <b>Nob</b> 1 is disrupted in vitro, demonstrates that the interaction between Dim 2 and <b>Nob</b> 1 is essential. In vivo analysis of <b>Nob</b> 1 localization on pre-ribosomal particles containing these Dim 2 mutants show that Dim 2 is involved in recruiting <b>Nob</b> 1 to pre-ribosomes.

Furthermore, data indicate that Dim 2 helps position <b>Nob</b> 1 for correct cleavage at the 3 ’-end of 18 S rRNA, as a point mutation that abolishes this interaction in vitro leads to accumulation of pre-ribosomes containing <b>Nob</b> 1 and 20 S rRNA. Interestingly, the site of interaction with <b>Nob</b> 1 is mapped to a KH-like domain in Dim 2, suggesting that this domain typically used for RNA binding can additionally interact with proteins.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} the mutation responsible for an abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) in a transgenic mouse line (tg 21) overexpressing erythropoietin (Epo). The tg 21 line was generated on a mixed (C 3 H; C 57 BL/ 6) background and lacked the b-wave {{component of the}} ERG. This no-b-wave (<b>nob)</b> ERG is seen in other mouse models with depolarizing bipolar cell (DBC) dysfunction and in patients with the complete form of congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). We determined {{the basis for the}} <b>nob</b> ERG phenotype and screened C 3 H mice for the mutation to evaluate whether this finding is important for the vision research community. METHODS: ERGs were used to examine retinal function. The retinal structure of the transgenic mice was investigated using histology and immunohistochemistry. Inverse PCR was performed to {{identify the}} insertion site of the Epo transgene in the mouse genome. Affected mice were backcrossed to follow the inheritance pattern of the <b>nob</b> ERG phenotype. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT PCR), Sanger sequencing, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify the mutation causing the defect. Additional C 3 H sublines were screened for the detected mutation. RESULTS: Retinal histology and blood vessel structure were not disturbed, and no loss of DBCs was observed in the tg 21 <b>nob</b> mice. The mutation causing the <b>nob</b> ERG phenotype is inherited independently of the tg 21 transgene. The qRT PCR experiments revealed that the <b>nob</b> ERG phenotype reflected a mutation in Gpr 179, a gene involved in DBC signal transduction. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of the Gpr 179 (<b>nob</b> 5) insertional mutation in intron 1 of Gpr 179. Screening for mutations in other C 3 H-derived lines revealed that C 3 H. Pde 6 b(+) mice carry the Gpr 179 (<b>nob</b> 5) allele whereas C 3 H/HeH mice do not.

Furthermore, our data indicate that Dim 2 helps regulate <b>Nob</b> 1 cleavage activity at the 3 ′-end of 18 S rRNA, as point mutants where this interaction is abolished in vitro accumulate pre-ribosomes containing <b>Nob</b> 1 and 20 S rRNA in vivo. Interestingly, the site of interaction with <b>Nob</b> 1 is mapped to the canonical RNA binding surface of a KH-like domain in Dim 2, providing another example where an RNA-binding domain can be repurposed for protein interactions...|$|R
