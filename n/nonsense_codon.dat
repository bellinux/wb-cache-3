The study of how <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> alter RNA metabolism is still at an early stage, and our current understanding derives more from incidental vignettes than from experimental undertakings that address molecular mechanisms. Challenges for the future include identifying the gene products and RNA sequences that function in nonsense mediated RNA loss, resolving the cause and consequences of there apparently being more than one cellular site and mechanism for nonsense-mediated RNA loss, and understanding how these sites and mechanisms are related to both constitutive and specialized pathways of pre-mRNA processing and mRNA decay...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> that prematurely {{terminate}} translation generate potentially deleterious truncated proteins. Here, we {{show that}} the T cell receptor– (TCR) gene, which acquires in-frame <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> at high frequency during normal lymphocyte development, gives rise to an alternatively spliced transcript [al-ternative messenger RNA (alt-mRNA) ] that skips the offending mutations that generate such <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons.</b> This alt-mRNA is up-regulated by a transfer RNA–dependent scanning mechanism that responds specifically to mutations that disrupt the reading frame. The finding that translation signals regulate the levels of alternatively spliced mRNAs generated in the nucleus may alter the current view of how gene expression is controlled in eukaryotic cells. Approximately 15 % of all point mutations responsible for human genetic diseases cause alternative RNA splicing (1). Surprisingly, mutations that generate premature termina-tion (<b>nonsense)</b> <b>codons</b> (PTCs) sometimes increase the levels of alternatively spliced transcripts that skip the offending mutations, thereby potentially saving protein function (2 – 7). This putative RNA correction re-sponse is paradoxical, because translation and RNA splicing are thought to occur in different cellular compartments. A solution to this paradox has been that this response is not specific to nonsense mutations but rather re-sults merely from any mutation that disrupts RNA splicing enhancers critical for exon in-clusion (6 – 8). Although this is one mecha-nism by which nonsense mutations can act, we demonstrate here unambiguously the ex-istence of a nonsense codon–specific up-reg-ulatory mechanism that acts independently of splicing enhancer disruption. The gene we used for our studies is the TCR gene, because it commonly acquires PTCs {{as a result of}} programmed rearrange-ments during T cell development (3). Al-though such nonproductively rearranged TCR genes transcribe high levels of precursor messenger RNAs (mRNAs), little or no ma-ture mRNA accumulates {{as a result of the}} nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (3, 9).

This is accomplished by screening libraries of mutant amino acyl tRNA synthetases for mutants which charge nonsense-codon tRNAs with the desired unnatural amino acid. The organism which expresses such a synthetase can then be genetically programmed to incorporate the unnatural amino acid into a desired protein in the usual way, with the <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> now coding for the unnatural amino acid. Normally, the unnatural amino acid itself must be synthesized in the lab and supplied to the organism by adding it to the organism's growth medium.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{incorporate}} a novel amino acid into {{the genetic code}} several changes are required.

Usually a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> (stop codon) or a four-base codon are used. Second, a novel pair of tRNA and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase are required, these are called the orthogonal set. The orthogonal set must not crosstalk with the endogenous tRNA and synthetase sets, while still being functionally compatible with the ribosome and other components of the translation apparatus. The active site of the synthetase is modified to accept only the novel amino acid. Most often, a library of mutant synthetases is screened for one which charges the tRNA with the desired amino acid. The synthetase is also modified to recognize only the orthogonal tRNA. The tRNA synthetase pair is often engineered in other bacteria or eukaryotic cells.|$|E

50|$|A {{premature}} {{stop codon}} {{must be recognized}} as different from a normal stop codon so that only the former triggers a NMD response. It has been observed that {{the ability of a}} <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> to cause mRNA degradation depends on its relative location to the downstream sequence element and associated proteins. Studies have demonstrated that nucleotides more than 50-54 nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon junction can target mRNA for decay. Those downstream from this region are unable to do so. Thus, nonsense codons lie more than 50-54 nucleotides upstream from the last exon boundary whereas natural stop codons are located within terminal exons. Exon junction complexes (EJCs) mark the exon-exon boundaries. EJCs are multiprotein complexes that assemble during splicing at a position about 20-24 nucleotides upstream from the splice junction. It is this EJC that provides position information needed to discriminate premature stop codons from natural stop codons. Recognition of PTCs appears to be dependent on the definitions of the exon-exon junctions. This suggests involvement of the spliceosome in mammalian NMD. Research has investigated the possibility of spliceosome involvement in mammalian NMD and has determined this is a likely possibility. Furthermore, it has been observed that NMD mechanisms are not activated by nonsense transcripts that are generated from genes that naturally do not contain introns (i.e. Histone H4, Hsp70, melanocortin-4-receptor).|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of novel chemical means of incorporating phosphomimetics into proteins has provided important {{insight into the}} effects of phosphorylation events. Historically, phosphorylation events have been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site (serine, threonine or tyrosine) to an amino acid, such as alanine, that cannot be phosphorylated. While this approach {{has been successful in}} some cases, mutations are permanent in vivo and can have potentially detrimental effects on protein folding and stability. Thus, chemical biologists have developed new ways of investigating protein phosphorylation. By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous phosphonate mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations. Protein semisynthesis, or more specifically expressed protein ligation (EPL), has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either the C- or the N-terminus. In addition, researchers have built upon an established technique in which one can insert an unnatural amino acid into a peptide sequence by charging synthetic tRNA that recognizes a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> with an unnatural amino acid. Recent developments indicate that this technique can also be employed in vivo, although, due to permeability issues, these in vivo experiments using phosphomimetic molecules have not yet been possible.|$|E
40|$|For {{most of the}} {{mammalian}} mRNAs {{that have}} been shown to be reduced in abundance by a nonsense or a frameshift mutation that generates a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon,</b> reduction takes place while the mRNA is nucleus-associated rather than after the mRNA has been exported to the cytoplasm (reviewed in Maquat LE, 1995, RNA 1 : 453 - 465). A variety of mechanisms have been put forth to explain how a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> could affect the abundance of nuclear mRNA. Some mechanisms have implicated <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> recognition in the nucleus prior to splicing. Among the best-studied nonsense transcripts that manifest nonsense-mediated alterations in nucleus-associated metabolism are those that derive from human alleles for the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). Nonsense codons within TPI transcripts {{have been shown to}} reduce the half-life of completely spliced TPI (mRNA that co-purifies with nuclei (Belgrader P et al., 1994, Mol Cell Biol 14 : 8219 - 8228). However, whether or not <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> recognition within TPI transcripts takes place prior to or after splicing remained unresolved. To address this issue, codons that span two exons, i. e., are disrupted by an intron prior to pre-mRNA splicing, were converted to nonsense. If <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> recognition were to precede splicing, then the disrupting intron would be expected to preclude <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> recognition by preventing the physical juxtapositioning of the codon nucleotides. In the absence of <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> recognition, there would be no nonsense-mediated reduction in TPI mRNA abundance. The results of northern (RNA) blot hybridization demonstrated that the two nonsense codons of this type that were studied reduced the level of total, nuclear and cytoplasmic TPI mRNA to an average of 12 % of normal, consistent with each <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> being competent to mediate nuclear mRNA degradation. The possibility that the nonsense codons reduced TPI mRNA abundance by altering TPI mRNA abundance or splicing was eliminated by using RT-PCR to demonstrate that the level of each intron within pre-mRNA was essentially unaffected and cDNA sequencing to demonstrate that splice site choice was unaltered. Furthermore, missense codons that harbored some of the <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> changes were found to have little effect on mRNA abundance. These findings, plus the previous finding that a suppressor tRNA abrogates the decay of TPI mRNA brought about by a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> residing within a single exon (Belgrader P, Cheng J, Maquat LE, 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90 : 482 - 486), argue strongly that <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> recognition in the nonsense-mediated decay of TPI mRNA takes place after splicing...|$|E

Aaron isolated 33 null mutations at the Adh locus and in collaboration with other investigators classified 23 as deletions. Of the eight mutants analyzed here, only two produced a detectable ADH protein using the two-dimensional electrophoresis technique. Restriction endonuclease and Southern blot analysis showed that three of the mutants were normal compared to the wild-type restriction pattern, with one of the three producing a mutant ADH protein. Among the five mutants that had altered restriction patterns, only one mutant produced a detectable mutant ADH protein. All the mutants produced a hybridizable mRNA when probed with the genomic clones, suggesting that the mutant phenotype was not due to transcriptional inhibition. Two probable explanations proposed for these observations are (1) mutations may be due to deletions of one or a few bases resulting in frameshifts to <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> and premature termination of ADH peptide synthesis or (2) mutations may be a result of transitions to <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons,</b> again producing shortened ADH proteins.

Until now, a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> at position 23 has been the 5 '-most <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> that has been analyzed. Here, we provide evidence that a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> at position 1, 2 or 10 reduces the abundance of nucleus-associated TPI mRNA to an average of only 84 % of normal because translation reinitiates at the methionine codon at position 14.

40|$|Mammalian {{cells have}} {{established}} mechanisms {{to reduce the}} abundance of mRNAs that harbor a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> and prematurely terminate translation. In {{the case of the}} human triosephosphate isomerase (TPI gene), nonsense codons located less than 50 to 55 bp upstream of intron 6, the 3 ′-most intron, fail to mediate mRNA decay. With the aim of understanding the feature(s) of TPI intron 6 that confer function in positioning the boundary between nonsense codons that do and do not mediate decay, the effects of deleting or duplicating introns have been assessed. The results demonstrate that TPI intron 6 functions to position the boundary because it is the 3 ′-most intron. Since decay takes place after pre-mRNA splicing, it is conceivable that removal of the 3 ′-most intron from pre-mRNA “marks” the 3 ′-most exon-exon junction of product mRNA so that only nonsense codons located more than 50 to 55 nucleotides upstream of the “mark” mediate mRNA decay. Decay may be elicited by the failure of translating ribosomes to translate sufficiently close to the mark or, more likely, the scanning or looping out of some component(s) of the translation termination complex to the mark. In support of scanning, a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> does not elicit decay if some of the introns that normally reside downstream of the <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> are deleted so the <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> is located (i) too far away from a downstream intron, suggesting that all exon-exon junctions may be marked, and (ii) too far away from a downstream failsafe sequence that appears to function on behalf of intron 6, i. e., when intron 6 fails to leave a mark. Notably, the proposed scanning complex may have a greater unwinding capability than the complex that scans for a translation initiation codon since a hairpin structure strong enough to block translation initiation when inserted into the 5 ′ untranslated region does not block nonsense-mediated decay when inserted into exon 6 between a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> residing in exon 6 and intron 6...|$|E
40|$|Genetic code {{expansion}} {{provides a}} powerful tool for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (unAAs) with novel biochemical and physiological properties into proteins in live cells and organisms. To achieve this, a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> suppression system, which consists of an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and tRNA pair that specifically decodes a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> (e. g., amber codon and quadruplet codon) with an unAA but do not “cross talk” with their endogenous counterparts, was established. This Ph. D. thesis presents our efforts on evolution and application of <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> suppression systems for biochemical and biomedical investigations. ^ In Chapter 1, a brief overview of genetic code expansion technique and recent advances in this area of research was given. To improve unAA incorporation efficiency, we focused on systematic evolution of two most commonly used orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs: PylRS/tRNAPyl and MjTyrRS/tRNATyr. We enhanced quadruplet codon decoding efficiency of PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs by completely randomizing the anticodon-stem loop of tRNAPyl (Chapter 3). In addition, we improved amber suppression efficiency of MjTyrRS/tRNATyr derivatives by engineering the anticodon binding pocket of MjTyrRS (Chapter 4). All these efforts lead to a further improvement in current <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> suppression systems and may expand their applications in unAA mutagenesis. Next, we reported the application of an amber suppression system as an unnatural genetic switch to manipulate the expression of essential HIV- 1 proteins, which resulted in either single-cycle or multicycle live-attenuated HIV- 1 viruses (Chapter 2). These genetically modified viruses can be potentially used as preventive vaccines to protect against HIV- 1 infection. Our methodology can also be applied to the generation of vaccines against other pathogens. ...|$|E

An even more severe form of the disease can occur called thalassemia intermedia or ‘inclusion body’ thalassemia. Instead of decreased mRNA levels, a mutant transcript produces truncated β chains, which in turn leads to a clinical phenotype in the heterozygote.Nonsense-mediated decay mutations can also contribute to Marfan syndrome.

40|$|The {{translation}} of human triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) mRNA normally terminates at codon 249 within exon 7, the final exon. Frameshift and nonsense mutations {{of the type}} that cause translation to terminate prematurely at or upstream of codon 189 within exon 6 reduce the level of nuclear TPI mRNA to 20 to 30 % of normal by a mechanism {{that is not a}} function of the distance of the <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> from either the translation initiation or termination codon. In contrast, frameshift and nonsense mutations of another type that cause translation to terminate prematurely at or downstream of codon 208, also within exon 6, have no effect on the level of nuclear TPI mRNA. In this work, quantitations of RNA that derived from TPI alleles in which nonsense codons had been generated between codons 189 and 208 revealed that the boundary between the two types of nonsense codons resides between codons 192 and 195. The analysis of TPI gene insertions and deletions indicated that the positional feature differentiating the two types of nonsense codons is the distance of the <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> upstream of intron 6. For example, the movement of intron 6 to a position downstream of its normal location resulted in a concomitant downstream movement of the boundary between the two types of nonsense codons. The analysis of intron 6 mutations indicated that the intron 6 effect is stipulated by the 88 nucleotides residing between the 5 ' and 3 ' splice sites. Since the deletion of intron 6 resulted in only partial abrogation of the nonsense codon-mediated reduction in the level of TPI mRNA, other sequences within TPI pre-mRNA must function in the effect. One of these sequences may be intron 2, since the deletion of intron 2 also resulted in partial abrogation of the effect. In experiments that switched introns 2 and 6, the replacement of intron 6 with intron 2 was of no consequence to the effect of a <b>nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> within either exon 1 or exon 6.

Conditional disruption of the tetr gene 1 n ̂. coli has also been demonstrated. <b>Nonsense</b> <b>codon</b> MURFI linkers permit conditional fusion of multiple gene products while sense codon linkers can add structural elements (e. g. g-turn, cationic segment, hydrophobic segment) or a desired amino add to a protein (e. g. methionine, cysteine). Shotgun or alterna-tively site-directed insertion of the symmetric linkers is possible. The over-all length of the linker may be adjusted to retain the original reading frame, matching nucleotide additions or subtractions at recipient DNA sites. If a linker restriction site occurs elsewhere 1 n the target DNA, single linker copies may still be Inserted using non-phosphorylated linkers...|$|E
40|$|We cloned and sequenced {{a portion}} of {{chloroplast}} DNA from the hornwort Anthoceros formosae. A nucleotide sequence of 7556 bp contained structures {{similar to those of}} ndhK, ndhC, trnV, trnM, atpE, atpB, rbcL, trnR and accD. The arrangement of these was {{the same as that of}} other chloroplast DNA. However, two <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> were located within the putative coding region of rbcL, although they were used as putative termination codons of the genes. RNA was extensively edited in the transcripts of rbcL when cDNA sequences were analyzed. The unusual <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> of TGA and TAA became CGA and CAA respectively. These are examples of U to C type RNA editing, which was never been found before in chloroplast mRNA. In general, 13 Cs of genomic DNA were found as Ts in the cDNA sequence and seven Ts were found as Cs. This is the first finding of RNA editing on the transcripts of rbcL and also in bryophytes. This event had been thought to arise in land plants after the split of bryophytes. The origin of RNA editing is discussed in relation to the landing of green plants...|$|R
40|$|Three <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> and {{an unusual}} {{initiation}} codon were {{located within the}} putative coding region of the atpB gene of chloroplast DNA of the hornwort Anthoceros formosae. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNA prepared from transcripts revealed extensive RNA editing. The unusual initiation codon ACG was changed to AUG and three <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons</b> were converted into sense codons. In total 15 C residues of the genomic DNA were replaced by U residues in the mRNA sequences, while 14 U residues were replaced by C residues. This is {{the highest number of}} editing events for a chloroplast mRNA reported so far. Partial editing was also shown in a cDNA clone where 23 sites were edited but six sites remained unedited, representing the existence of premature mRNA. The expected two-dimensional structure of the mRNA shows the existence of a sequence complementary to every editing site, which can produce continuous base pairing longer than 5 bp, suggesting that mispairing in the double strand is the site determinant for RNA editing in Anthoceros chloroplasts. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with other chloroplast genes suggests that the mechanism arose in the first land plants and has been reduced during evolution...|$|R
40|$|The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) RNA {{surveillance}} pathway detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs). T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin transcripts, which commonly harbor PTCs as {{a result}} of programmed DNA rearrangement during normal development, are down-regulated much more than other known mammalian gene transcripts in response to <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons.</b> Here, we demonstrate that this is not because of promoter or cell type but instead is directed by regulatory sequences within the rearranging VDJ exon and immediately flanking intron sequences of a Vβ 8. 1 TCR-β gene. Insertion of these sequences into a heterologous gene elicited strong down-regulation (> 30 -fold) in response to PTCs, indicating that this region is sufficient to trigger robust down-regulation. The rearranging Vβ 5. 1 exon and the flanking intron sequences from another member of the TCR-β family also triggered strong down-regulation, suggesting that down-regulatory-promoting elements are a conserved feature of TCR genes. Importantly, we found that the Vβ 8. 1 down-regulatory-promoting element was position dependent, such that it failed to function when positioned downstream of a PTC. To our knowledge, this is the first class of down-regulatory elements identified that act upstream of <b>nonsense</b> <b>codons...</b>|$|R
