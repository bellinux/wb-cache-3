5000|$|Preferred stock can be <b>cumulative</b> <b>or</b> <b>noncumulative.</b> A <b>cumulative</b> {{preferred}} {{requires that}} if a company fails to pay a dividend (or pays less than the stated rate), it must {{make up for it}} at a later time. Dividends accumulate with each passed dividend period (which may be quarterly, semi-annually or annually). When a dividend is not paid in time, it has [...] "passed"; all passed dividends on a cumulative stock make up a dividend in arrears. A stock without this feature is known as a <b>noncumulative,</b> <b>or</b> straight, preferred stock; any dividends passed are lost if not declared.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of dosage-dependent trans-acting regulators of the white eye color gene in combinations to understand their interaction properties. The consequences of the interactions will aid in an understanding of aneuploid syndromes, position-effect variegation (PEV), quantitative traits, and dosage compensation, {{all of which are}} affected by dosage-dependent modifiers. Various combinations modulate two functionally related transcripts, white and scarlet, differently. The overall trend is that multiple modifiers are <b>noncumulative</b> <b>or</b> epistatic to each other. In some combinations, developmental transitions from larvae to pupae to adults act as a switch for whether the effect is positive or negative. With position-effect variegation, similar responses were found as with gene expression. The highly multigenic nature of dosage-sensitive modulation of both gene expression and PEV suggests that dosage effects can be progressively transduced through a series of steps in a hierarchical manner...|$|R

In Southeast Asia in Political Science: Theory, Region, and Qualitative Analysis, edited by Erik Martinez Kuhonta, Dan Slater, and Tuong Vu, a group of bright, young Southeast Asianists argue that contextually sensitive research in Southeast Asia using qualitative research methods has made fundamental and lasting contributions to comparative politics. They challenge other Southeast Asianists to assert proudly the contributions that their work has made and urge {{the rest of the}} comparative politics discipline to take these contributions seriously. This symposium includes four short critical reviews of Southeast Asia in Political Science by political scientists representing diverse scholarly traditions. The reviews address both the methodological and the theoretical orientations of the book and are followed by a response from the editors...|$|R

40|$|In {{traditionally}} managed Howard walnut orchards, {{trees are}} pruned annually during the orchard development phase, an expensive operation {{in terms of}} labor and prunings disposal costs. Our observations and some prior research by others had suggested that pruning may not be necessary in walnut.

Pruning altered canopy shape but {{did not lead to}} increases in canopy development, yield or nut quality. Although fruit removal stimulated more vegetative growth in both the pruned and unpruned treatments, fruit removal did not result in an increase in midday canopy photosynthetically active radiation interception <b>or</b> <b>cumulative</b> yield when fruit removal was stopped after year 4.
