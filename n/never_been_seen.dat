5|$|While militarily Habré {{was only}} partly {{successful}} {{in his attempt}} to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity that had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before in Chad.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} the war {{delineated}} itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed {{the bulk of the}} scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, {{towards the end of the}} war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before in Chad. This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been made about the similarity between Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after reading all of the design documents on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before, designing for example the armor for the Judges on a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Harvey scored {{seven and}} struggled {{in contrast to}} the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match, including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands above his head. His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> at The Oval. The home team's captain Stuart Surridge lofted a drive down the ground, and Harvey ran 25m from wide long-on and leapt in the air to catch the ball, which would have cleared the boundary. Harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with Bill Brown as Australia piled on 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings in the following match.|$|E

The book includes reproductions of documents and photographs of objects that belonged to Starkweather, Fugate, and their victims, several of which Patterson discovered while making his photographs and had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> publicly before. Comic book series Northlanders referenced the story in its 2010 story arc Metal.|$|E
25|$|The former {{systems of}} {{catchments}} and private cisterns have been discontinued.

The water supply was partly privatised in 1991 and is now maintained by AquaGib, a subsidiary of the British water company Northumbrian Water, under licence to the Government of Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they have}} <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen,</b> Higgslike fields play an {{important}} role in theories of the universe and in string theory. Under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of Einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. Such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe.|$|E

25|$|The {{extensive}} witness testimony {{convinced the}} judges {{that there were}} adequate grounds for establishing the guilt of the accused. After Rais admitted to the charges on 21 October, the court canceled a plan to torture him into confessing. Peasants of the neighboring villages had earlier begun to make accusations that their children had entered Gilles' castle begging for food and had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> again. The transcript, which included testimony from the parents {{of many of these}} missing children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Gilles' accomplices, was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst portions to be stricken from the record.|$|E
25|$|Propaganda {{during the}} Reformation, {{helped by the}} spread of the {{printing}} press throughout Europe and in particular within Germany, caused new ideas, thoughts, and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before the sixteenth century. The printing press was invented in approximately 1450 and quickly spread to other major cities around Europe; by the time the Reformation was underway in 1517 there were printing centers in over 200 of the major European cities. These centers became the primary producers of Reformation works by the Protestants, and in some cases Counter-Reformation works put forth by the Roman Catholics.|$|E

25|$|On October 15, 1993 {{the first}} major {{retrospective}} of Consuelo Kanagas work {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition was titled, Consuelo Kanaga: An American Photographer and ran until February 27, 1994. The exhibition contained approximately 120 gelatin silver prints, many of which had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before or published. They were all drawn from a cache of more than 2000 negatives and 340 prints left to the Brooklyn Museum in 1982 by the artists husband and painter, Wallace Putnam. A fully illustrated catalogue published by the Brooklyn Museum in association with University of Washington Press accompanied the exhibition. The publication included an introduction by William Maxwell and essays by Barbara Head Millstein and Sarah M. Lowe.|$|E
25|$|Presence of {{long-lasting}} {{bonds between}} parents and young seen in the family of this species is another attribute of obligate monogamy. Both sexes of the rock-haunting ringtail possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring. An unusual interaction observed {{between parents and}} young were the embrace by adult males and the bridge formation. Both sexes embrace young, whereas only females engage in bridge formation. The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using her body as a bridge. This has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in another possum. Embracing {{is a way for}} the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles.|$|E
25|$|The organism's {{evolutionary}} {{placement and}} unique embryology with five-fold symmetry were the major {{arguments in the}} proposal to seek the sequencing of its genome. Importantly, urchins act as the closest living relative to chordates and thus may {{shed light on the}} evolution of vertebrates. The genome of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, was completed in 2006 and established homology between sea urchin and vertebrate immune system-related genes. Sea urchins code for at least 222 Toll-like receptor genes and over 200 genes related to the Nod-like-receptor family found in vertebrates. This increases its usefulness as a valuable model organism for studying the evolution of innate immunity. The sequencing also revealed that while some genes were thought to be limited to vertebrates, there were also innovations that have previously <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> outside the chordate classification, such as immune transcription factors PU.1 and SPIB.|$|E

25|$|Libya {{sought to}} retake Bardaï and Zouar, {{and sent a}} {{task-force}} of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, aided {{by the use of}} napalm. The attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces. Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the Tibesti, the campaign was a great strategic victory, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before in Chad. After a series of defeats in northeastern Chad, Libyan forces withdrew fully from the Tibesti in March 1987. Although the Tibesti has since entered an era of relative peace, the years of conflict have left the area strewn with thousands of landmines.|$|E
25|$|Settlers {{arriving}} from Spain {{brought with them}} domestic animals that had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in Oaxaca: horses, cows, goats, sheep, chickens, mules and oxen. New crops such as sugar cane, vanilla and tobacco were introduced. However, landholding still remained mostly in indigenous hands, {{in spite of the}} fact that only 9% of Oaxaca's terrain is arable. Spanish official and merchants would try to take indigenous privileges due to their social status, but this was resisted. While some of this was violent, the dominant response was to resort to the administrative-judicial system or yield. Violence was reserved for the worst of situations. One native product to reach economic importance during the colonial period was the cochineal insect, used for the making of dyes for textiles. This product was exported to Europe, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. The use of this insect faded in the 19th century with the discovery of cheaper dyes.|$|E
25|$|When Dove {{returned}} to America in 1909 he met Alfred Stieglitz, probably {{by way of}} Maurer's written introduction. Stieglitz was a well known photographer and gallery owner who was very active in promoting modern art in America, including works by European artists that had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before in the U.S. Dove decided to quit working as an illustrator but {{was in need of}} artistic identity along with emotional bolstering and Stieglitz filled both these roles. The photographer was 16 years older than Dove and his urban, Jewish and European cultural roots were in contrast to Dove's rural Anglo-Saxon Protestant heritage. Dove was said to be gentle, quiet, and a good friend while Stieglitz was known as being argumentative and shrewd. They found their common ground in the idea that art forms should embody modern spiritual values, not materialism and tradition. With Stieglitz's support, Dove produced what are known as the first purely abstract paintings to come out of America. Dove’s works were based on natural forms and he referred to his type of abstraction as “extraction” where, in essence, he extracted the essential forms of a scene from nature.|$|E
