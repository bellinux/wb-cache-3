40|$|Introduction: Nasal {{respiratory}} obstruction is a {{very common}} otolaryngologic problem, often caused by adenoid hypertrophy (AH). <b>Nasal</b> fiberoptic <b>endoscopy</b> (NFE) represents the gold standard method to diagnose AH. Rhinomanometry represents a valid diagnostic support. Objective: The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic value of rhinomanometry after nasal decongestant (ND) test {{for the evaluation of}} adenoid hypertrophy in children. Materials and methods: Seventy-one of 97 collaborative children, aged 6 - 12 years, affected by upper airways obstructive symptoms and diagnosed as 'chronic oral breathers' by a standardized questionnaire were included in the study. The first evaluation included a complete physical examination, anterior rhinoscopy and anterior active rhinomanometry. Patients with a positive rhinomanometry underwent a second rhinomanometry after the administration of the nasal decongestant (ND) xylometazoline. All children were evaluated using <b>nasal</b> fiberoptic <b>endoscopy</b> (NFE). Results: At rhinomanometry a normal nasal airflow was found in 19 (26. 8 %) of children while nasal obstruction was underlined in 52 (73. 2 %). These patients were tested also with rhinomanometry after ND which confirmed the presence of nasal obstruction in 29 (55. 7 %) of patients. All patients included in the study underwent a NFE: 34 (47. 8 %) of them presented severe AH with an occlusion > 75 % of the choanal opening (grade >= 3) and 37 (52. 2 %) presented no or a mild form of AH (grade < 3). When compared to NFE, rhinomanometry test after ND had 82. 7 % sensitivity and 82. 6 % specificity. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 85. 7 % and 79. 2 %, respectively. Two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were derived using data related to rhinomanometry vs NFE, and to rhinomanometry after ND vs NFE. Conclusions: Rhinomanometry after ND, compared to rhinomanometry, is more specific and useful to evaluate nasal obstruction due to AH in children, and it may be helpful to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures in children with temporary nasal obstruction.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Adenoid {{hypertrophy}} (AH) is a {{very common}} problem in children. <b>Nasal</b> Fiberoptic <b>Endoscopy</b> (NFE) represents the gold standard method to diagnose AH. Rhinomanometry represents a valid diagnostic support. The aim of our study was to analyze the grade of nasal obstruction caused by AH, {{in a group of}} children, with rhinomanometry standard and after ND test versus NFE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-four of 300 collaborative children, diagnosed as chronic oral breathers, were enrolled. All children underwent a complete physical examination, anterior active rhinomanometry and a second rhinomanometry after the administration of the nasal decongestant (ND) xylometazoline. All children were evaluated using <b>Nasal</b> Fiberoptic <b>Endoscopy</b> (NFE). RESULTS: At rhinomanometry nasal obstrucion was found of grade 1 in 102 (35. 9 %) children, of grade 2 in 41 (14. 4 %), of grade 3 in 52 (18. 3 %), of grade 4 in 37 (13 %) and of grade 5 in 52 (18. 3 %). Those patients were tested also with rhinomanometry after ND: grade 1 in 108 (38 %) children, grade 2 in 52 (18. 3 %), grade 3 in 56 (19. 7 %), grade 4 in 23 (8. 1 %) and grade 5 in 45 (15. 8 %). At NFE: 83 (29. 2 %) patients presented a grade 0, 73 (28. 7 %) a grade 1, 51 (17. 9 %), 34 (11. 9 %) a grade 3 and 43 (15. 1 %) a grade 4. Comparing the grade of nasal obstruction in NFE and in RM after ND we found a great correlation for grade 1 and grade 5 (respectively 84. 3 % and 79, 1 %, p < 0. 001) and low correlation for the others grades of obstruction. When compared to NFE, rhinomanometry test after ND had 81. 1 % sensitivity and 84. 3 % specificity. Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were derived using data related to rhinomanometry vs NFE, and to Rhinomanometry after ND vs NFE. CONCLUSIONS: Rhinomanometry after ND, compared to rmhinomanometry, is more specific and useful to evaluate nasal obstruction due to AH in children.

40|$|SummaryChronic nasal {{obstruction}} {{is a common}} complaint in Otolaryngology outpatients. The diagnosis of {{nasal obstruction}} {{is based on the}} clinical history, physical examination and diagnostic procedures. Among these, it is already established in the current literature the importance of <b>nasal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> and computer tomography scan. Aim: The objective of this research study was based on a comparative study among findings of <b>nasal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> and CT scan of the paranasal sinuses, within the examinations for etiological investigation in chronic nasal obstruction, individualizing the importance of each exam for a conclusive diagnosis. Study design: Historic cohort. Material and Method: Twenty patients with chronic nasal obstruction complaints were studied, aged between 14 and 51 years old in the Otolaryngology outpatient unit at Nossa Senhora de Lourdes Hospital, Sao Paulo. It is a retrospective clinical study, carried out by revision of medical charts of assisted patients from 2002 to 2004. Results: All the patients presented complaints of chronic nasal obstruction. In the 20 patients, 10 (50 %) presented associated allergic complaints. In 16 out of 20 (80 %), patients presented hypertrophic concha evidenced by nasal endoscopy; in only 9 out of 20 (45 %) patients we found the same affection as in the CT scan. Based on the presented results, the finding of hypertrophic concha was more evidenced in <b>nasal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> compared to CT (80 % X 45 %).

Children with lung problems, neurological disorders and syndromes, obstructive septal deviation, previous orthodontic treatment, orthodontic surgeries or oral surgeries, or obesity were excluded. Patients were subjected to physical examinations, <b>nasal</b> fiberoptic <b>endoscopy,</b> teleradiography for cephalometric analysis, and polysomnography. Methods: Cephalometric analysis included the following skeletal craniofacial measurements: facial axis (FA), facial depth (FD), mandibular plane angle (MP), lower facial height (LFH), mandibular arch (MA), and vertical growth coefficient (VERT) index. Results: The prevalence of sleep apnea was 46. 75 % with no statistical difference between genders. Among children with obstructive sleep apnea (Apneia Hypopnea Index - AHI >= 1) boys had higher AHI values than girls. A predominance of the dolichofacial pattern (81. 9 %) was observed. The following skeletal craniofacial measurements correlated with AHI in boys: FD (r(s) = - 0. 336 /p = 0. 020), MP (r(s) = 0. 486 /p = 0. 00), and VERT index (r(s) = - 0. 337 /p = 0. 019). No correlations between craniofacial measurements and AHI were identified in girls. Conclusions: Craniofacial morphology may influence the severity of sleep apnea in boys but not in girls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Upper {{respiratory}} airway diseases may induce a worsening of asthma. Sinusitis {{represents one of}} the most common chronic diseases. The association of asthma and sinusitis varies greatly in different studies, depending on diagnostic procedures. OBJECTIVE: The aims were: (i) to demonstrate that <b>nasal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> may be easily feasible in asthma at paediatric age; (ii) to evaluate the incidence of rhinosinusitis and adenoiditis in children with asthma by nasal endoscopy; (iii) to correlate inflammatory parameters such as cytology and microbiological cultures with <b>nasal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> findings. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-five asthmatic children were evaluated, 48 males and 97 females, with an average age of 7. 27 years. Evaluated parameters were the incidence of rhinosinusal infections in asthmatic children, and the role of: (i) <b>nasal</b> <b>endoscopy,</b> (ii) nasal cytology, and (iii) nasal microbiology in their diagnoses. RESULTS: <b>Nasal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> was successfully performed on 128 patients. Twenty-six children had endoscopic rhinosinusitis alone, 10 had adenoiditis alone, and 35 showed endoscopic rhinosinusitis associated with adenoiditis.

Immunohistochemically, the malignant cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 18, synaptophysin, CD 56, p 53, Ki- 67 (labeling= 95 %), bcl- 2, KIT, and PDGFRA. However, they were negative for pancytokeratins, high molecular weight CK, CK 5 / 6, CK 7, CK 14, CK 19, CK 20, vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, CD 15, CD 45, S 100 protein, CEA, CA 19 - 9, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilaments, neuroblastoma, CD 99, surfactant apoprotein A, melanosome, and TTF- 1. The pathologic diagnosis was small cell carcinoma. A molecular genetic analysis using PCR-direct sequencing was performed using paraffin sections, and it showed no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes. Imaging modalities including CT, MRI and PET did not reveal any tumors, including the lung, other than the maxillary sinus tumor. The present case is the first of small cell carcinoma of the maxillary sinus with a comprehensive immunohistochemical examination and a gene analysis of KIT and PDGFRA...|$|R
40|$|Background: Optimal {{placement}} of dacryostoma and minimally invasive non-traumatic bypass surgery that creates an anastomosis between the lacrimal sac and {{the nasal cavity}} are important to prevent the recurrence of nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Aim: To develop a simplified technique of bypass creation. Methods: In addition to optic rhinoendoscopy, virtual endoscopy of lacrimal sac and nasal cavity was performed (n = 15). Virtual endoscopy is based on 3 D computer data processing with subsequent reconstruction of nasal cavity and lacrimal sac visualization. This provides 4 D movement effect mimicking optic <b>endoscopy.</b> <b>Nasal</b> mucosal flap was created using radio-wave Jawad tip, lacrimal sac flap was created through the canal using improved radio-wave tip. Flaps were fixed with Tissucol® bioglue. The whole surgery was performed {{under the control of}} video endoscope (Storz). Results: The analysis of virtual endoscopy protocols with visible projection of lacrimal sac on nasal cavity lateral wall enabled to select an optimal place for dacryostoma depending on the size and the {{placement of}} lacrimal sac. The use of curved radio-wave Jawad tip made possible to create mucosal periosteal flap in all patients. Transcanalicular radio-wave formation of the flap from lacrimal sac wall was easier and safer than endonasal one. Glue flap fixation was technologically easier than suturing. Conclusion : Radio-wave endoscopic nasal mucosal flap creation, radio-wave transcanalicular lacrimal sac flap creation, and flap gluing are a simple and safe method of anastomosis formation in endoscopic dacryocystorhinoscopy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hyaluronic acid {{is a major}} {{component}} of many extracellular matrices and plays {{a central role in the}} homeostasis of physiology in upper and lower airways. When topically administered following endoscopic sinus surgery, hyaluronic acid may be effective in functional recovery and in the prevention of recurrence of chronic rhinosinusistis. This pilot study was aimed at evaluating the effects of nebulised 9 mg of sodium hyaluronate given for 15 days per months over 3 months in 46 patients aged greater than 4 years who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for rhino-sinusal remodelling. Eligible patients were randomized to receive nebulised 9 mg sodium hyaluronate nasal washes plus saline solution or 5 ml saline alone (23 patients in each group), according to an open-label, parallel group design, with blind observer assessment. Treatment was administered by means of a nasal ampoule that allows nebulisation of particles with a median aerodynamic diameter greater than 10 micron, i. e. suitable for upper respiratory airways deposition. The efficacy variables included clinical (presence of nasal dyspnoea), endoscopical (ostium of paranasal sinuses, oedema, respiratory patency, synechiae, and appearance of nasal mucosa) and cytological (ciliary motility and presence of neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, bacteria, mycetes and bio film) measures. At the end of the study, patients expressed an opinion on the overall tolerability of treatment. The two treatment groups were comparable at baseline. Treatment with 9 mg of sodium hyaluronate was associated with significantly greater improvements compared to controls in nasal dyspnoea (p less than 0. 001), presence of mycetes (p = 0. 044), ciliary motility (p less than 0. 001) and abnormalities in nasal secretions. A univariate logistic model, in which the odd ratio (OR) indicates the probability of success in the 9 mg sodium hyaluronate group compared to the control group, showed that the highest OR was observed for presence of nasal dyspnoea (OR = 21. 36; 95 percent CI: 1. 07 to 426. 56), normal mucosa at endoscopy (OR: 9. 62; 95 percent CI: 1. 82 to 50. 89), ciliary motility (OR: 7. 27; 95 percent CI: 1. 68 to 31. 42) and presence of bio film (OR: 4. 41; 95 percent CI: 1. 26 to 15. 40). Treatment with 9 mg sodium hyaluronate plus saline was well tolerated. A 3 -month intermittent treatment with 9 mg sodium hyaluronate plus saline solution nasal washes following FESS for rhino-sinusal remodelling was associated with significant improvements in nasal dyspnoea, appearance of <b>nasal</b> mucosa at <b>endoscopy</b> and ciliary motility compared to saline alone...|$|R
