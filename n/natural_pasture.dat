5|$|In the past, Exmoors {{were used}} as pit ponies. Ponies not kept in semi-feral {{conditions}} are used {{for a variety of}} activities including showing, long-distance riding, driving, and agility. Exmoor ponies won both divisions at the International Horse Agility Championships in 2011, and took a third title at the 2012 Championships. The breed's hardiness makes it suitable for conservation grazing, and it contributes to the management of many heathland, chalk grassland and other <b>natural</b> <b>pasture</b> habitats, {{as well as to the}} conservation of Exmoor itself.|$|E

500|$|The Exmoor pony is [...] a horse breed {{native to}} the British Isles, where some still roam as semi-feral {{livestock}} on Exmoor, a large area of moorland in Devon and Somerset in southwest England. The Exmoor has been given [...] "endangered" [...] status by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, and [...] "threatened" [...] status by The Livestock Conservancy. It {{is one of the}} British Isles' mountain and moorland pony breeds, having conformation similar to that of other cold-weather-adapted pony breeds. The Exmoor pony is hardy and used for a variety of equestrian activities. In its free-roaming state, the breed's presence on Exmoor contributes to the conservation and management of several <b>natural</b> <b>pasture</b> habitats.|$|E

60|$|In {{the autumn}} of the year, that succeeded the season, in which the {{preceding}} events occurred, the young man, still in the military service, found himself on {{the waters of the}} Missouri, at a point not far remote from the Pawnee towns. Released from any immediate calls of duty, and strongly urged to the measure by Paul, who was in his company, he determined to take horse, and cross the country to visit the partisan, and to enquire into the fate of his friend the trapper. As his train was suited to his functions and rank, the journey was effected, with the privations and hardships that are the accompaniments of all travelling in a wild, but without any of those dangers and alarms that marked his former passage through the same regions. When within a proper distance, he despatched an Indian runner, belonging to a friendly tribe, to announce the approach of himself and party, continuing his route at a deliberate pace, in order that the intelligence might, as was customary, precede his arrival. To the surprise of the travellers their message was unanswered. Hour succeeded hour, and mile after mile was passed, without bringing either the signs of an honourable reception, or the more simple assurances of a friendly welcome. At length the cavalcade, at whose head rode Middleton and Paul, descended from the elevated plain, on which they had long been journeying, to a luxuriant bottom, that brought them {{to the level of the}} village of the Loups. The sun was beginning to fall, and a sheet of golden light was spread over the placid plain, lending to its even surface those glorious tints and hues, that, the human imagination is apt to conceive, forms the embellishment of still more imposing scenes. The verdure of the year yet remained, and herds of horses and mules were grazing peacefully in the vast <b>natural</b> <b>pasture,</b> under the keeping of vigilant Pawnee boys. Paul pointed out among them, the well-known form of Asinus, sleek, fat, and luxuriating in the fulness of content, as he stood with reclining ears and closed eye-lids, seemingly musing on the exquisite nature of his present indolent enjoyment.|$|E

40|$|The EPIC {{simulation}} model {{was used to}} assess the impact of climate change (CC) on intensive and extensive Mediterranean forage systems to study the effects of CC and adaptation strategies. The intensive cropping system (corn silage – Italian ryegrass) is linked to dairy cattle farms. As first step the EPIC model was calibrated based on experimental data. After calibration the EPIC model was used to perform simulations with different climate scenarios (present and future climate) with different atmospheric CO 2 concentration (380 and 407 ppm). In this way we were able {{to assess the impact of}} CC on crop production, water demand and phenology. Moreover the effect of an adaptation strategy such as the use of different variety was simulated. For extensive cropping systems, <b>natural</b> <b>pastures</b> were considered. Despite their important productive role and environmental significance, the <b>natural</b> <b>pastures</b> are difficult to study. The pasture productive dynamics is known, however, more knowledge regarding the relationships between climate and production are required to improve the interpretation of the interannual variability. To this end, the verification or development of predictive models should go through an approach based on specific research aim to study the multiple sources of environmental variation. With the aim to explore the possibility to assess the impact of CC on <b>natural</b> <b>pastures</b> the EPIC model was chosen thanks to its simplified method used to simulate the crop growth...|$|R
