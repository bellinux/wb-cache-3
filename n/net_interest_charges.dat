The data indicate that tighter regulations on bank entry and bank activities boost <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Inflation also exerts a robust, positive impact on bank margins. While concentration is positively associated with <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins, this relationship breaks down when controlling for regulatory impediments to competition and inflation. Furthermore, bank regulations become insignificant when controlling for national indicators of economic freedom or property rights protection, while these institutional indicators robustly explain cross-bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. So, bank regulations cannot be viewed in isolation. They reflect broad, national approaches to private property and competition.

40|$|Interest rate {{risk and}} bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins 1 Banks and their {{supervisors}} have spent considerable {{time and effort}} in recent years developing systems for monitoring and managing interest rate risk. 2 This special feature examines that specific component of interest rate risk arising from the possible effects of changes in market interest rates on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Such effects can be very large if interest rate risk is not managed carefully. For example, the secondary banking crisis in the United Kingdom in the 1970 s reflected, at least in part, the funding of longer-term assets with short-term liabilities. 3 Similarly, funding of long-term, fixed rate mortgages with savings deposits led to a very sharp drop in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins at US thrift institutions in the early 1980 s when interest rates rose to historic highs and the yield curve inverted. The result was actually negative <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income for two years at US thrifts, after <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins had averaged nearly 1. 5 % over the preceding decade (FHLBB (1984)). By contrast, the results presented here suggest that commercial banks in the 10 industrial countries considered have generally managed their exposures to volatility in the yield curve in ways that have limited effects on their <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Thus, while fluctuations in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins could be {{an important source of}} uncertainty in bank profitability – and could surely have adverse effects for particular institutions – changes in interest rates seem unlikely to undermine sharply the health of the banking sector through their effects on <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income. The next section provides background on interest rate risk at banks, and discusses methods for assessing it. Given data limitations, the approach taken here focuses on the effects of market interest rates on the average yields on bank assets and liabilities and also on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. The subsequent section reports on the empirical findings. A final section provides some concluding remarks and caveats. 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS. Gert Schnabel provided invaluable assistance with the data. 2 For a detailed discussion of interest rate risk, see BCBS (2001). For a broader perspective on bank supervision, see BCBS (1997) ...|$|R

Prior to 2008 the <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins declined primarily due to strong capital inflows and stable macroeconomic environment. In the crisis period, significant rise in government debt accompanied by the increase in macroeconomic risks and abating capital inflows were pushing margins up while other factors such as low credit demand, higher capitalization and significantly increased share of non-performing loans pressured banks’ margins down.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} significant predictors for two selected dependent variables, (1) <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost and (2) number of bids, for Indiana public school building corporation first mortgage revenue bond issues. All Indiana public school building corporations marketing first mortgage revenue bonds during any calendar year that existing or comparable legal and bond market conditions applied constituted the population of the study. The sample consisted of 131 Indiana public school building corporations which issued bonds during the calendar years, 1970 through 1974. Data were obtained through responses by officials of 113 school corporations to the Bond Issue Data Instrument. Eighteen independent variables, identified from the literature as important for receiving favorable <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> costs and a higher number of bids, were selected. A backward stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine the independent variables that served as best predictors for <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost. The analysis was repeated substituting number of bids as the dependent variable. The following conclusions were generated from the data analyses: 1. National weekly bond average interest cost is the strongest predictor of <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost. National bond market declines generally predict lower <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> costs. 2. Lower <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> costs can be obtained by minimizing length of bond issue. 3. Indebtedness ratio is a strong predictor of <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost. Generally, a lower <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost can be expected as indebtedness ratio decreases. 4. Date of issue is a significant predictor of <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost. Generally, the higher number of Julian days, the higher the interest rate. Conclusive evidence identifying any quarter of the year as the best time to market bonds was absent. 5. Type of issue, new or refunded, is a strong predictor of number of bids for a given bond issue. Generally, more bids can be expected for new issues. 6. National weekly bond average interest cost is a strong predictor of number of bids. Generally, a declining national average indicates a larger number of bids. 7. Ratings by more than one rating company cannot be expected to attract more bidders. 8. <b>Net</b> <b>interest</b> cost and number of bids are not affected significantly by administrative practices such as employing bond counsel, outside consultants to prepare prospectus, and financial counsel and the amount or kind of advertising of the bond issue. Recommendations for school officials involved in the process of marketing a school bond issue and for further study were as follows: 1. School administrators should analyze economic trends likely to affect national weekly bond averages. Such factors include: (1) bond and stock market fluctuations, (2) actions by the United States Treasury and Federal Reserve Board with respect to governmental fiscal and monetary policy, and (3) international balance of payments. 2. Because the length of term has been identified as an important predictor of <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost consideration should be given to developing an extensive public relations program which emphasizes the advantages of the shorter term bond issue. Where feasible the term should be 20 years or less. 3. Because the ratio of gross bonded indebtedness to local assessed valuation has been identified as an important predictor of <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost consideration should be given to reducing the existing indebtedness of the school corporation. Where feasible, the debt ratio should not exceed the 20 - 25 per cent range for favorable interest costs. 4. School administrators should assume more responsibility in preparing the prospectus, in the financial planning, and in obtaining the bond rating. 5. The study should be replicated every two years to determine if the predictors identified in this study remain consistent with respect to predictability. The data base could be enlarged to include all public school building corporations marketing bonds for the calendar years 1970 through the most recent year data were available. 6. A national study should be conducted which could randomly sample school districts throughout the nation, using variables selected from the study, with appropriate adjustments, to determine the strongest national predictor variables of lower <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> cost. 7. A study should be conducted which would provide a handbook to assist Indiana school districts in marketing bond issues. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
