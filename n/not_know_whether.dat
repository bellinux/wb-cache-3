5|$|On September 8, 2006, Richard Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of State, {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he was the source of the revelation of Plame's status. Armitage said he was not a part of a conspiracy to reveal Plame's identity and did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> one existed.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, David Clay, one of {{the boys}} assumed to have been killed, is found alive in Hesperia, California. He reveals that {{one of the}} boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter. David, Walter, and another boy escaped, but were separated. David does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Walter was recaptured, but he says Walter helped him escape, giving Christine hope he is alive.|$|E
5|$|His loss {{of faith}} in human {{relationships}} is mirrored in his loss {{of faith in}} God. During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E

5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way to express the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Soma Bringer was first hinted at when Nintendo filed a trademark {{for the title}} alongside others. It was officially announced in October that year at a Nintendo press conference. Published by Nintendo, Soma Bringer was the first Monolith Soft title to be released after its acquisition by Nintendo in April 2007. It was released on February 22, 2008. After positive impressions from previews during public gaming events in Japan, both IGN and 1UP.com voiced a hope that the game would receive a localization. Speaking in 2010, Saga said that she did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> it would be released outside Japan, or whether further games set in the Soma Bringer universe would be developed.|$|E
5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

5|$|The Turks {{began to}} apply {{restrictions}} on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, {{in response to}} the start of the First Aliyah earlier that year. Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and notable classes, in 1901 the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman central government) gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine and the percentage of Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914. At the same time, with growing distrust of the Young Turks – Turkish nationalists who had taken control of the Empire in 1908 – and the Second Aliyah, Arab nationalism was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic. Historians do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second year}} of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{expenses}} disclosures {{were published}} {{over an extended}} period of time, with the focus moving to different MPs daily. As a result, there was significant pressure on MPs who did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether,</b> and for what, they would be discussed, as well as a general deepening hostility that grew over a relatively long period.|$|E

25|$|Several other designs {{have been}} tried since then, but they {{required}} the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as panty hose and slacks, inhibit women from using them {{because they do not}} want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. Often, women have little experience with urinals and do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> to approach them forward or backward.|$|E
25|$|Where arable {{cultivation}} {{continued in}} early Anglo-Saxon England, {{there seems to}} have been considerable continuity with the Roman period in both field layout and arable practices, although we do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> there were also changes to patterns of tenure or the regulation of cultivation. The greatest perceptible alterations in land usage between about 400 and 600 are therefore in the proportions of the land of each community that lay under grass or the plough, rather than in changes to the layout or management of arable fields.|$|E
25|$|In October 1935 District Attorney William E. Parke {{requested}} that {{a grand jury}} investigate the fatal shooting of Evelyn Hoey. The prosecutor asked that the shooting be studied {{as well as the}} conduct of members of the coroner's jury, and people with whom they had been in contact. Particularly he wanted to identify their association with certain newspaper men who covered the inquest. Parke believed the jury's verdict indicated they felt a homicide had been committed. After asking for a grand jury he said he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> any new evidence had been found.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{also charged}} that the {{authorities}} did not organize the siege properly, including failing to keep the scene secure from entry by civilians, while the emergency services were not prepared during the 52 hours of the crisis. The Russian government has been also heavily criticized {{by many of the}} local people who, days and even months after the siege, did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> their children were alive or dead, as the hospitals were isolated from the outside world. Two months after the crisis, human remains and identity documents were found by a local driver, Muran Katsanov, in the garbage landfill at the outskirts of Beslan; the discovery prompted further outrage.|$|E
25|$|Each {{category}} is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, {{such as the}} empty set or the product of two topologies, yet {{in the definition of}} a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> an object A is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find universal properties that uniquely determine the objects of interest.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate Gettysburg Campaign {{began on}} June 3, 1863 with the Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, under its new commander, Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell, moving {{northwest}} from the Fredericksburg area to Culpeper Court House, Virginia. By the next day, Hooker {{learned of the}} Confederate movement but did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Lee was attempting to move north or to attack Hooker's right flank or whether the Confederates were moving their infantry or just cavalry. Hooker proposed to attack Lieutenant General A. P. Hill's Third Corps at Fredericksburg but President Abraham Lincoln and Union Army General-in-Chief Henry Halleck thought that the plan was too risky and would enable Lee to turn his force at Culpeper to attack Hooker's flank, possibly while Hooker's men were engaged in crossing the Rappahannock. Hooker gave up the idea.|$|E
