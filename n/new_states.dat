The room has been restored to its original appearance in 1796.|$|E

5|$|As {{it became}} clear that there was to be no {{reversal}} of Spanish American independence, several of the <b>new</b> <b>states</b> began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Congress Hall is a {{building}} near {{the intersection of}} Chestnut and 6th Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania {{that served as the}} seat of the United States Congress from December 6, 1790 to May 14, 1800. During Congress Hall's duration as the capitol of the United States, the country admitted three <b>new</b> <b>states,</b> Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee; ratified the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution; and oversaw the Presidential inaugurations of both George Washington (his second) and John Adams.|$|E
5|$|From January 11, 1785, to {{the fall}} of 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals of the United States under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall (then at Fraunces Tavern). New York was the first capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States, from March 4, 1789, to August 12, 1790, at Federal Hall. Federal Hall was also the site of where the United States Supreme Court {{met for the first}} time, the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified, and where the Northwest Ordinance was adopted, {{establishing}} measures for adding <b>new</b> <b>states</b> to the Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, Harrison and Gresham {{competed for}} {{influence}} at the 1884 Republican National Convention; the delegation ended up supporting James G. Blaine, the eventual nominee. In the Senate, Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill, {{only to see}} it vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. His efforts to further the admission of new western states were stymied by Democrats, who feared that the <b>new</b> <b>states</b> would elect Republicans to Congress.|$|E
5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} <b>new</b> <b>States</b> in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E
5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the <b>new</b> <b>states</b> began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} irrelevance of the Holy Alliance after 1825 and {{the fall}} of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the July Revolution eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, {{but it was not until}} the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the <b>new</b> <b>states.</b> Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other <b>new</b> <b>states</b> carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E
5|$|During {{the almost}} ten years it served as the capitol, Congress Hall {{witnessed}} many historic events including the admittance of three <b>new</b> <b>states.</b> The United States Bill of Rights was ratified at Congress Hall in 1791. The second Presidential inauguration of George Washington {{took place in the}} House chamber in 1793, as did inauguration of John Adams in 1797. Congress also used the time to establish the First Bank of the United States, the Federal Mint, and the United States Department of the Navy. The Jay Treaty, which secured a temporary peace with Great Britain, was also ratified at Congress Hall in 1796. After the capital moved to Washington, Congress Hall returned to its original function as the Philadelphia County Courthouse and served as the location of both state and federal courts during the early 19th century. Also designed by Samuel Lewis, the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey was built in 1796 and modeled after Congress Hall.|$|E

5|$|In effect, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 {{adopted by}} the Cortes de Cadiz served {{as the basis for}} {{independence}} in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of <b>new</b> <b>states.</b> The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new regime would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agustín de Iturbide, a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} 1789, the {{territory}} today known as Belgium was divided into two states, called the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, both of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, both states experienced revolutions in 1789 in which the old order was overthrown and <b>new</b> <b>states</b> created. These revolutions were condemned by the Holy Roman Empire and were crushed by 1792. The territory was only briefly regained, however, as the area was captured by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars and incorporated into the French First Republic. This French period lasted roughly from 1794 to 1815. In the aftermath of Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, the Congress of Vienna added the territory of Belgium to the Netherlands, and until 1830, Belgium was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states {{in proportion to the}} most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit <b>new</b> <b>states</b> into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.|$|E

5|$|The Adriatic's shores are {{populated}} {{by more than}} 3.5million people; the largest cities are Bari, Venice, Trieste and Split. The earliest settlements on the Adriatic shores were Etruscan, Illyrian, and Greek. By the 2nd century BC, the shores were under Rome's control. In the Middle Ages, the Adriatic shores and the sea itself were controlled, to a varying extent, {{by a series of}} states—most notably the Byzantine Empire, the Serbian Empire, the Republic of Venice, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. The Napoleonic Wars resulted in the First French Empire gaining coastal control and the British effort to counter the French in the area, ultimately securing most of the eastern Adriatic shore and the Po Valley for Austria. Following Italian unification, the Kingdom of Italy started an eastward expansion that lasted until the 20th century. Following World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, the eastern coast's control passed to Yugoslavia and Albania. The former disintegrated during the 1990s, resulting in four <b>new</b> <b>states</b> on the Adriatic coast. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on their maritime boundaries by 1975 and this boundary is recognised by Yugoslavia's successor states, but the maritime boundaries between Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian-Herzegovinian, and Montenegrin waters are still disputed. Italy and Albania agreed on their maritime boundary in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of former princely states with other provinces to form <b>new</b> <b>states</b> has also {{given rise to}} some issues. The Telangana region, comprising the Telugu-speaking districts of the former Hyderabad State, were in many ways different from the Telugu-speaking areas of British India {{with which they were}} merged. In recognition of these differences, the States Reorganisation Commission originally recommended that Telangana be created as a separate state, rather than {{as part of a broader}} Telugu-speaking entity. This recommendation was rejected by the Government of India, and Telangana was merged into Andhra Pradesh. The result was the emergence in the 1960s of a movement demanding a separate Telangana state. The demand has been accepted by the Union Government, leading to formation of Telangana as the 29th state of India in June 2014. A similar movement, although less strong, exists in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, which consists of the former Nagpur state and the Berar region of the former Hyderabad state.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spread}} of {{decolonization}} in the 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 <b>new</b> <b>states</b> joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa. On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but {{with the support of}} many Third World nations, the mainland, communist People's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization. Third World nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN. In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991, shortly {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
