Guadagnino said that Elio probably wouldn’t be gay in the potential sequel: [...] "I don’t think Elio is <b>necessarily</b> <b>going</b> to become a gay man. He hasn’t found his place yet. I can tell you that I believe that he would start an intense relationship with Marzia [...] again.” Guadagnino is also interested in the politics of the 1990s, saying [...] "it would be the beginning of the Berlusconi era in Italy and it would mean dealing with the war of Iraq.” ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, it will {{be clear}} to {{everybody}} that so long as our present social arrangements exist, it must be impossible for the vast mass of labouring men ever to do anything of the sort. It is to be desired, indeed, that every labouring man should by industry and thrift secure independence in the end {{for himself and his}} family; but however much that may be the case, it will still rest certain that the vast mass of men will necessarily remain workers to the last; and that no attempt to raise individual working men above their own class into the professional or mercantile classes can ever greatly benefit the working masses as a whole. What is most of all desirable is that the condition, the aims, and the tastes of working men, as working men, should be raised and bettered; that without <b>necessarily</b> <b>going</b> outside their own ranks, they should become more prudent, more thrifty, better educated, and wider-minded than many of their predecessors have been in the past.

40|$|We reexamine the {{possibility}} of reconstructing the initial fluxes of supernova neutrinos emitted in a future core-collapse galactic supernova explosion and detected in a Megaton-sized water Cherenkov detector. A novel key element in our method is the inclusion, {{in addition to the}} total and the average energies of each neutrino species, of a "pinching" parameter characterizing the width of the distribution as a fit parameter. We uncover in this case a continuous degeneracy in the reconstructed parameters of supernova neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere.

40|$|Resource {{scheduling}} in large-scale, volatile desktop grids {{is challenging}} because resource state is both dynamic and eclectic. Matching available resources with requests {{is not always}} possible with existing approaches. Partial dissemination protocols, such as gossiping, may provide efficient schedules when resource requesters are located near providers that can meet their needs. However, when requesters are distant from available resources, regular information dissemination techniques can waste communication bandwidth with futile messages. Thus, it may be advantageous to attempt to advertise to select remote regions of the grid, without <b>necessarily</b> also <b>going</b> through all intermediate nodes. This paper proposes dissemination proxies to increase coverage footprints and reduce dissemination overhead. We incorporate selecting and adjusting the amount of proxy nodes into an adaptive dissemination algorithm, and show that dissemination proxies are able to reduce dissemination overhead, and handle available resource distribution scenarios where regular information dissemination approaches may not produce efficient protocols. We also report initial results that indicate that randomly selecting nodes to serve as proxies can perform as well as strategies that select seemingly better-qualified proxies. ...|$|R

40|$|Fear {{extinction}} {{refers to}} the ability to adapt as situations change by learning to suppress a previously learned fear. This process involves a gradual reduction in the capacity of a fear-conditioned stimulus to elicit fear by presenting the conditioned stimulus repeatedly on its own. Fear extinction is context-dependent and is generally considered to involve the establishment of inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex over amygdala-based fear processes. In this paper, we review research progress on the neural basis of fear extinction with a focus {{on the role of the}} amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. We evaluate two competing hypotheses for how the medial prefrontal cortex inhibits amygdala output. In addition, we present new findings showing that lesions of the basal amygdala do not affect fear extinction. Based on this result, we propose an updated model for integrating hippocampal-based contextual information with prefrontal–amygdala circuitry. In the presence of threatening or painful stimuli, the brain learns and stores information about other stimuli present so that these can be used as warning signals in future situations. However, the things that are dangerous today are not <b>necessarily</b> always <b>going</b> to be harmful, and it is important to be able to adapt as situations change...|$|R

40|$|Starting with Bruce Lee in the 1960 s, Chinese {{martial arts}} films have been gaining {{increasing}} importance in Hollywood. Amidst global fascination and {{the prevalence of}} male heroes in martial arts films, it is surprising to note {{that only a few}} studies engage the genre with issues of Chinese masculinity, and none by investigating how the audience makes sense or use of what they are seeing. Taking martial arts films as the research site, this study is about how Chinese men negotiate their masculinity in a context where their masculinity is marginal, that is, in a diasporic context. The findings of this research attest to the marginalization and subordination of diasporic Chinese men by two dominant and interlocking discourses in the West, namely that only certain White male characteristics would be considered masculine, and that certain Chinese male characteristics would be considered neutered or even effeminate. The male informants of this study, however, are never entirely marginalized, victimized, and oppressed; they are able to construct alternative, different versions of masculinities, by privileging what they can do with their "small bodies," by downplaying the sexual and romantic dimensions of masculinity, and by emphasizing the importance of control and discipline. These Chinese men are garnering creative resources not <b>necessarily</b> by <b>going</b> into "indigenous" sources of historical or literary Chinese culture, as suggested by theorists on Chinese masculinity. Instead, contemporary transnational popular culture—in this case, Chinese martial arts films—opens up possibilities for them to articulate and construct different masculine ideals...|$|R

A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace.

The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory.
