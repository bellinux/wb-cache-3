As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box.

Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote.

Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own <b>name.</b> <b>She</b> later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
