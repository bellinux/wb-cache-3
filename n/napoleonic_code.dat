5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>Code</b> {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|With Kogălniceanu's participation, {{the authoritarian}} regime {{established}} by Cuza succeeded in promulgating {{a series of}} reforms, notably introducing the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>code,</b> public education, and state monopolies on alcohol and tobacco. At the same time, the regime became unstable and was contested by all sides, especially after his adulterous affair with Marija Obrenović became the topic of scandal. In early 1865, Cuza came into conflict with his main ally Kogălniceanu, whom he dismissed soon after. Over the following months, the administration went into financial collapse, {{no longer able to}} provide state salaries, while Cuza came to rely on his own camarilla (courtiers).|$|E

50|$|Many {{fundamental}} principles of French Law were {{laid in the}} <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>Codes.</b> Basic principles {{of the rule of}} law were laid in the Napoleonic Code: laws can only address the future and not the past (ex post facto laws are prohibited); to be applicable, laws must have been officially published (see Journal Officiel).|$|R
40|$|In many senses, nineteenth-century Belgium can be {{considered}} to be a 'legal province' of Belgium. In the tradition of the exegetical school, legislation is the one and only formal source of law for judicial decisions. This legislation is primarily composed of the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>codes.</b> Judges seem to be afraid of referring to other sources. If a ‘foreign’ source is quoted, it is a French one...|$|R
5|$|Roman {{government}} was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, {{the evolution of}} the Roman {{government was}} heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>Code)</b> can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana's {{civil law}} system is what the {{majority}} of {{nations in the world}} use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the British Empire. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>Code.</b> Although the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>Code</b> and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>Code</b> was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{question}} is debated whether ancient regime legislation can be seen and studied just like present day legislation. Due {{to the influence of}} the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>codes</b> and the 19 th century Exegetic School, we might have a wrong view on the role legislative acts had formerly. The law's subjects didn't have to accept the black letter of the law from the first until its last word, and the text's success was more due to its printed distribution than to its legal validity. Law just interacted with other - even important - formal sources of the law, and is more to be considered a pragmatic programme than an authoritative text. Several examples are given, most of them related to the Edictum Perpetuum of the Archdukes of 1611...|$|R
50|$|The law {{was based}} on the <b>Napoleonic</b> civil <b>code</b> and French {{commercial}} and criminal law. The official language was Polish.

40|$|Founded {{at the end}} of 1842, La Belgique Judiciaire {{lasted until}} 1939 and {{therefore}} was the first successful legal periodical in Belgium. Twelve years after Belgium’s independence and despite the constitutional pledge to change them as soon as possible, the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>codes</b> were still in force. This situation was discussed in the Brussels courts where four young liberal attorneys decided to publish a new periodical providing articles in which every jurist could offer a solution for the juridical inertion. The legal practitioner also benefited from this initiative: the most important Belgian case law was published, even from the lower courts which was at that time a novelty. Next to that, interesting news about the legal world had a place in the magazine. The changes in legislation combined with a lack of renewal in the rigid editorial board and the possibility to buy alternative publications, led almost inevitably {{to the end of the}} review, a monument in the Belgian legal world...|$|R
50|$|The {{constitutional}} {{revision of}} 1984 gave the legislature {{the power to}} regulate the language by law. On February 24, 1984, a law, passed by the constitutional chamber, made Luxemburgish the national language. Furthermore, this law recognised the three languages of Luxembourg (Luxembourgish, French and German) as administrative languages. French remains the language of legislation, due to {{the application of the}} <b>Napoleonic</b> civil <b>code</b> in Luxembourg.|$|R
25|$|There {{were few}} laws restricting sexual {{behavior}} in Japan {{in the beginning}} of modern period.

25|$|In {{his work}} on the Code, Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield was {{inspired}} by contemporary and older codes, by national and international law, and to a large extent by the prevailing doctrines of the period.

50|$|While English {{common law}} {{originated}} in thirteenth century England and has then been transplanted through colonization and occupation to England’s ex-colonies (United States, Canada, Australia, and several countries in Central America, Africa and Asia), the Scandinavian common law {{was developed in}} Denmark and Sweden and the German common law sprang in Germany and Switzerland 2016a, p. 54. These last four countries then exported their common law model to the respective colonies or to those jurisdictions (China, Greece, Japan, Romania, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey), which were never colonized but borrowed their initial legal order from the European codes considered most advanced at the time 2016a, p. 54. Civil law instead {{has its roots in}} Roman law, was incorporated by the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>codes</b> first and then by both the Austrian and Russian Civil codes, and has been then introduced via mainly colonization and occupation into continental Europe, the Near East, Latin America, Africa, and Indochina.

50|$|Throughout the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire {{adhered to}} the use of three {{different}} codes of criminal law. The first was introduced in 1840, directly following the Edict of Gülhane, an event which started the period of the Tanzimat reforms. In 1851, a second code was introduced. In this one, the laws were nearly the same as the ones in the first code of laws, but included the rulings of the previous eleven years. In 1859, the Ottoman Empire promulgated a last code of law inspired by the 1810 <b>Napoleonic</b> criminal <b>code.</b> Each of these variations of code and legislations represented a new phase in Ottoman legal ideology.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} Jefferson {{promoted}} the law, a lien-like privilege already existed in civil law countries like France, the Dutch Republic and Spain, with some laws even tracing their roots to the Roman Empire.

25|$|After the French Revolution the anticlerical {{feeling in}} Catholic {{countries}} {{coupled with the}} liberalizing effect of the <b>Napoleonic</b> <b>Code</b> {{made it possible to}} sweep away sodomy laws. However, in Protestant countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{transition}} from the <b>Napoleonic</b> penal <b>code</b> of 1810 to the newer reformed criminal code, the reform commission considered including an autonomous criminal responsibility for intellectual authors but quickly abandoned the idea {{in the face of the}} difficulty of implementing such a modification of the criminal code while at the same time still preserving freedoms. However, in certain cases the moral authors may be prosecuted for the offense themselves, for instance for provocation to suicide or untruths. The untruths themselves are not criminal offences, nor is suicide. The [...] "Perben 2" [...] law of 2004 also created a specific infraction of instigating a crime, and sanctions the moral author of certain crimes, even when the instigation was not successful and the crime was not committed.|$|R
25|$|Vélez Sársfield's code {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} the continental law and liberal principles of the 17th century.

50|$|In 1804, the <b>Napoleonic</b> Civil <b>Code</b> was decreed, {{breaking}} up the native legal approach to inheritance and property, bringing about the fragmentation of the family's farmstead and restriction to communal lands (duties required by the state), prompting yet further emigration waves. These institutional and legal events were coupled with exactions, recruitment and requisitioning implemented by the different military expeditions during the successive wars, e.g. Peninsular War. Half a century later, the prefect of the Basses-Pyrénées lamented the decrease of 80.000 inhabitants in the population across the region due to taxation and regular military draft, a remark conveniently highlighted by Fermin Lasala {{to make a case}} for the continuation of the Basque institutional specificity on the eve of its permanent suppression in the Basque Provinces (1876). The bulk of the French Basques continued to oppose the idea of a French republic still for over a century, yearning for the restitution of the former regime and their native institutions.|$|R
5000|$|In 1807 Napoleon {{created a}} {{powerful}} outpost of his empire in Central Europe. Poland {{had recently been}} partitioned by its three large neighbours, but Napoleon created the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, which depended on France from the very beginning. The duchy consisted of lands seized by Austria and Prussia; its Grand Duke was Napoleon's ally the king of Saxony, but Napoleon appointed the intendants who ran the country. The population of 4.3 million was released from occupation and by 1814 sent about 200,000 men to Napoleon's armies. That included about 90,000 who marched with him to Moscow; few marched back. [...] The Russians strongly opposed any move towards an independent Poland and one reason Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 was to punish them. The Grand Duchy was dissolved in 1815 and Poland did not become a state until 1918. Napoleon's impact on Poland was huge, including the <b>Napoleonic</b> legal <b>code,</b> the abolition of serfdom, {{and the introduction of}} modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|R
5000|$|Mexican {{independence}} from Spain in 1821 brought {{an end to}} the Inquisition and the colonial homosexual oppression. The intellectual influence of the French Revolution and the brief French occupation of Mexico (1862-67) resulted in the adoption of the <b>Napoleonic</b> Penal <b>Code.</b> This meant that sexual conduct in private between adults, whatever their gender, ceased to be a criminal matter. In matters concerning homosexuality, the Mexican government held that law should not invade the terrain of the individual moral conscience, {{in order to protect the}} precious concerns of sexual freedom and security; and that the law should limit itself [...] "to the minimum ethics indispensable to maintaining society." [...] It should be noted, however, that it did not grant people the right to be overtly homosexual; for included in the [...] "minimum ethics indispensable to maintaining society" [...] are laws against solicitation and any public behavior which is considered socially deviant or contrary to the folkways and customs of the time.
