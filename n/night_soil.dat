5|$|The {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town's economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for fresh produce. Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back <b>night</b> <b>soil</b> to fertilise the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct. A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, {{on the site of}} the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat to}} humans in {{developed}} countries is rising {{as a result of}} social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (<b>night</b> <b>soil)</b> as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.|$|E

5000|$|The {{neck of the}} {{peninsula}} was fortified with three moats, {{one of which was}} 12 m deep, each moat was topped by a palisaded wall. The creation of the moats involved the excavation of [...] of the limestone bedrock, which was then used to build up the ramparts. The innermost and deepest moat was flooded to create an artificial island. The area between these moats was used for intensive agriculture and included box gardens divided by crude stone walls. One of the excavated box gardens was dated to the Terminal Classic and measured 6.9 by 3.7 m and was 0.6 m deep. The box gardens were probably fertilised with organic material dredged from the swampy area immediately south of {{the peninsula}}, with the addition of <b>night</b> <b>soils</b> from the inhabitants. The combination of moats and walls that protected the peninsula made Punta de Chimino the best defended site in the entire Maya lowlands.|$|R

50|$|Human gastrodiscoidiasis is endemic in Assam, and to {{a lesser}} extent in Philippines. Highest {{incidence}} so far recorded is among children in Kamrup district of Assam, where prevalence was as high as 41%. First described from an Indian patient, it was initially believed to have a distribution restricted to India and the southeast Asia. However, investigations reveal that it is widespread, and are further spread by infected persons to other parts of the world, such as Guyana. Level of infection in laboratory animals can be very high among Asian mammals. Regions of high incidence can be attributed to low standard of sanitation, such as rural farms and villages where <b>night</b> <b>soils</b> are used. Infection in both human and animals is most common through the ingestion of vegetation found in contaminated water. It is also assumed that transmission is from infected fish that is under-cooked or eaten in raw, as common among southeast Asian. There is a unique case report of a seven-year-old Nigerian who showed symptoms of malnutrition and anaemia and was eventually diagnosed with infections of G. hominis and Ascaris lumbricoides. The child quickly recovered after proper medication.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine potentially differential effects of day and <b>night</b> warming on <b>soil</b> respiration in a temperate steppe in northern China. A full factorial design with day and night warming was used in this study, including control (C), day (6 a. m. – 6 p. m., local time; D) warming, night (6 p. m. – 6 a. m.; N) warming, and diurnal warming (W). Day warming showed neutral effect on <b>soil</b> respiration, whereas <b>night</b> warming significantly increased soil respiration by 7. 1 % over the first 3 growing seasons. The insignificant effect of day warming on soil respiration could be attributable to the offset of the direct positive effects by the indirect negative effects via aggravating water limitation and suppressing ecosystem C assimilation. The positive effects of <b>night</b> warming on <b>soil</b> respiration were largely due to the stimulation of ecosystem C uptake and substrate supply via over-compensation of plant photosynthesis. In addition, day and night warming showed antagonistic effects on soil respiration, which could be ascribed to their contrasting effects on ecosystem C assimilation. The results suggest differential and non-additive effects of day and <b>night</b> warming on <b>soil</b> respiration, which was driven by the treatment-induced changes in substrate supply...|$|R

25|$|One of the Nauruans' {{methods to}} reach {{self-sufficiency}} was to exploit their gardens to the fullest. They cultivated many edible plants and were soon imitated by the Japanese, {{who began to}} farm every space available. They grew eggplant, corn, pumpkin, and sweet potato. Still lacking sufficient output, they created pumpkin plantations, using half drums filled with <b>night</b> <b>soil</b> which had been collected from the population by forced Chinese workers. This method {{turned out to be}} extremely productive in Nauru's tropical weather, but as a result, dysentery spread, killing several people. Swarms of flies appeared around the plantations, and the smell was unbearable. Toddy, brewed with the sap of coconut trees, was a valuable dietary supplement and at times the only food available. All the trees used for toddy were inventoried and allocated to the population, three for each Japanese, two for a Pacific Islander, and one for a Chinese. They were used {{to such an extent that}} they were no longer able to produce coconuts. After learning that rubber tree fruit was edible, the Japanese forbade the Islanders from gathering it, and started eating it themselves.|$|E
40|$|In the Tarim River Basin, {{the desert}} {{riparian}} forest vegetation is under high-temperature and aridity stress However, the vegetation can grow continuously because of deep rooting that can reach groundwater, which can thus redistribute {{water into the}} upper soil profile This paper describes patterns of hydraulic lift by Populus euphranca Oliv and discusses its ecological effects.

40|$|Introduction. Functional results after low {{anterior}} resection for {{rectal cancer}} are {{an issue of}} increasing attention among colorectal surgeons and others interested in this subject. The consensus on ideal reconstruction type has not been achieved to date, {{although the number of}} papers on this subject has been published in recent years. Objective. We conducted a prospective, parallel group study comparing latero-terminal with colonic J-pouch anastomosis in terms of defecatory function in patients undergoing stapled low colorectal/ coloanal anastomosis. Methods. A total of 80 patients were included in this study with either latero-terminal or colonic J-pouch anastomosis. Defecatory function was evaluated using the modified version of MSKCC questionnaire 6, 12 and 24 months after the operation. Fecal continence was evaluated using the Wexner continence score. Results. In both groups, trend towards improvement was registered in all measured variables in all three control intervals. This can apply to bowel frequency, urgency, <b>night</b> <b>soiling,</b> fragmentation and incomplete evacuation. However, the difference was not statistically significant, and when reviewing the trend of results we can note that in the J-pouch group steady state has not been reached even after 24 month control. Conclusion. This trial did not reveal any significant differences in defecatory function 6, 12 and 24 months after low anterior resection (LAR) between patients with a latero-terminal anastomosis and those with colonic J-pouch anastomosis. Our results did not confirm superiority of colonic J-pouch over the lateroterminal anastomosis...|$|R

500|$|Following {{the successes}} seen in various {{northern}} towns, about 7,000 pail closets {{were introduced in}} 1871 in Leicester, where the implementation of water closets had been hindered by the refusal of the water company to provide adequate supplies. [...] The use of pail closets reduced the demand placed upon the area's inadequate sewerage system, but the town suffered with difficulties in the collection and treatment of the <b>night</b> <b>soil.</b> [...] Initially, <b>night</b> <b>soil</b> was collected by contractors, but after 1873 the local authority became responsible. [...] The authority found dealing with the <b>night</b> <b>soil</b> an expensive and difficult business and, following legal proceedings against the corporation in 1878, transport of <b>night</b> <b>soil</b> was transferred from the railway system to canal barges. [...] This, however, led to complaints that the canal was being polluted. [...] In 1886, the authority found that the River Soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a sewage farm at Beaumont Leys. [...] By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this and {{the construction of a new}} sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by water closets. [...] In Manchester, faced with phenomenal population growth, the council attempted to retain the pail closet system, but following the exposure of the dumping of [...] of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers at their Holt Town sewage works, the council was forced to change their plans. [...] Originally they had intended to build incinerators, but public objections to the dumping of waste into rivers forced the council instead to purchase Carrington Moss in 1886, and Chat Moss in 1895, which were both developed as refuse disposal sites.

Compared to A. rubrum, Q. rubra displays only a minimal level of down-regulation of stomatal conductance, which leads to a reduction of leaf water potential during times when vapor pressure deficit is high and soil moisture is limiting. We determine that the two species, despite typically being categorized by ecosystem models under the same plant functional type—mid-successional, temperate broadleaf—display different hydraulic strategies. These differences may lead to large differences between the species in water relations, transpiration and productivity under different precipitation and humidity regimes...|$|R
