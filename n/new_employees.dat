5|$|In {{conjunction}} with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed {{as the first}} Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It {{was the first time}} a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church's Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of <b>new</b> <b>employees.</b> In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.|$|E
5|$|The Doughnut {{was already}} {{too small for the}} number of GCHQ staff at its completion, as a vast {{expansion}} in the number of employees had occurred {{as a consequence of the}} September 11 attacks in 2001. The staff numbered almost 6,500 by 2008. The addition of a two-storey office block and a three-storey car park to the Doughnut was proposed in 2008, but eventually suspended in 2011. The new buildings were intended to facilitate the arrival of 800 staff from GCHQ's former site at Oakley. Though it was initially felt that the Doughnut would be adequate for the new staff, 600 contractors working on technical projects for GCHQ were eventually relocated in a secret undisclosed building in the 'Gloucestershire area'. The parking of cars by GCHQ staff on residential roads has caused 'annoyance' among local residents in Benhall. It was believed that the arrival of new staff may have further affected local parking but GCHQ stated the presence of the <b>new</b> <b>employees</b> would have been offset by redundancies.|$|E
