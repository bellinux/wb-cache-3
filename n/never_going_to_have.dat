5000|$|Women and {{children}} are vital and under appreciated players in the peace process. Boulding felt children “gentle” the human species.

Women, being mothers, have a great influence in setting the foundation for this peace culture by teaching their children. “…We’re <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> respectful and reverential relationships with the planet- and sensible policies about what we put in the air, the soil, the water - if very young children don’t begin learning about these things literally in their houses, backyards, streets and schools.
