5000|$|A {{study by}} economists Connan Snider and Thomas Youle, in April 2010 corroborated {{the results of}} the earlier Wall Street Journal study, {{concluding}} that the Libor submissions by some member banks were being understated. Unlike the earlier study, Snider and Youle suggested that the reason for understatement by member banks was not that the banks were trying to appear strong, especially during the financial crisis period of 2007 to 2008, but rather that the banks sought to make substantial profits on their large Libor interest-linked portfolios. For example, {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, Citigroup had interest rate swaps of notional value of $14.2 trillion, Bank of America had interest rate swaps of notional value of $49.7 trillion and JPMorgan Chase had interest rate swaps of notional value of $49.3 trillion. Given the large notional values, a small unhedged exposure to the Libor could generate large incentives to alter the overall Libor. In the first quarter of 2009, Citigroup for example reported that it would make that quarter $936 million in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>revenue</b> if interest rates would fall by [...]25 percentage points a quarter, and $1,935 million if they were to fall by 1 percentage point instantaneously.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{individual}} bank fundamental variables on stock market returns using data from a panel of 235 European banks from 1991 to 2005. The sample period marks a significant transition in the European banking sector, characterized by higher competition, lower profit margins in the traditional interest-related business and increasing non-interest income in terms of fees and commissions. In panel regressions, we relate bank stock returns to fundamental accounting information and use several corrections for the standard errors to control for heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation and spatial correlation. Our results indicate that several bank-specific variables exhibit a robust explanatory power across different model specifications. Most important, {{there is a positive}} impact of the ratio of loans to total assets, the ratio of non-interest income to total income, and the ratio of off-balance sheet items to total assets on subsequent bank stock returns. In contrast, the ratio of loan-loss-provisions to <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>revenue</b> and the ratio of book value of equity to total assets load negatively on subsequent bank stock returns. Overall, the valuation of bank stocks incorporates both the traditional loan-related side of the banking business and the growing off-balance activities.

40|$|Credit risk has {{traditionally}} {{been one of the}} greatest risks faced by banks. The recent global credit crisis has re-emphasized its major impact on the wellbeing and profitability of businesses (Brown and Moles, 2012). This study reviews the existing literature on the theoretical concepts and empirical evidence on best practice credit risk management (CRM) tools and techniques employed by banks. Using annual bank data from 2006 to 2011, the impact of credit risk on the profitability of commercial banks in developed and developing countries is examined. A quantitative research approach is employed using financial ratio analysis (FRA) and a panel data regression model driven by credit risk indicators. The FRA suggests Nigerian banks have higher credit risk but with a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2009, before deteriorating in 2009. In contrast, deteriorating asset quality was documented for the developed countries from 2006, with improvements for the US from 2010. From the regression results, the common variables found to have significant impact on both the Return on Average assets (ROAA) and Return on Average equity (ROAE) of US, UK and Nigerian Commercial banks include the ratio of Loan Loss Provisions to <b>Net</b> <b>Interest</b> <b>Revenue</b> (LLPNIR), Net Loans To Total Assets (LTA) and Non-Interest Income to Total Assets (NIITA), but with mixed results.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{domestic}} and cross border bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has increased {{over the last decade}} with a resultant impact on the bank dividend. This study examines the effect of M&A on the dividend policy by comparing the abnormal returns, profitability and dividend policy of the domestic and cross border bank acquirers. The study focused on EU mega-bank mergers and acquisitions within 1997 - 2007 involving only commercial-to-commercial banks. The sample consists of a total of 62 mega-M&A with a minimum deal value of € 500 million. Three hypotheses were formulated specifically to test: (i) the wealth effect and geographical diversification of the M&A between domestic and cross border acquirers; (ii) the effect on in the financial performance of both acquirers and (iii) the M&A impact on dividend policy on banks after bank M&A. Two strands of the literature were reviewed focusing on M&A and dividend policy. The event study methodology was used to calculate the abnormal returns of both the domestic and cross border acquirers which were standardised. A long window of 61 days was applied to capture a satisfactory length of pre and post merger events that could capture the behaviour of the abnormal returns and consequent effect on dividend policy. The hierarchical regression model was used to estimate the impact of the variables on the profitability and dividend policy of the acquirer banks. In comparison with the domestic acquirers, the cross border abnormal returns showed a trend of significant negative results following the M&A announcement. The domestic acquirers showed no significance but, on average have higher cumulative total standardised abnormal returns (CTSAR) than the cross border acquired banks. The result of the financial performance showed that CTSAR of the cross border acquirers is significantly affected by the profitability of the banks but insignificant with domestic acquirers. However, the cost-to –income ratio (CIR) significantly affects the performance of both bank acquirers. CIR and RISK (measured by the ratio of the loan provision to <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>revenue</b> of the banks) highly correlated with profitability of both the domestic and cross border acquirers. The management of costs and loans risks were found to be significant variables in the achievement of profitability among domestic acquirers. The dividend policy hypothesis result indicated that CTSAR has a weak correlation and insignificant effect on the dividend policy variables. Infact, the Causality test result confirmed that the CTSAR does not Granger cause dividend policy. However, the study provides strong support to previous studies that beta, liquidity, taxes, and the finance structure of the acquirers are significant variables in the formulation of the dividend policy of the merged banks. The beta, which a proxy for risk, is the most significant factor affecting the dividend policy of the merged banks...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates three {{comprehensive}} research {{issues in}} the context of five selected Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) banking markets (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) during the period 1998 - 2010. This study is motivated by the extensive restructuring efforts {{that took place in the}} aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) which has shaped the banking behaviour in ASEAN countries to enable them to sustain their financial systems’ stability. As a result of the crisis, banks adopted several strategies in response to various structural and policy changes and, therefore, there were vast effects on banks’ behaviour following the AFC and pre and post the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period. The first empirical study of this thesis investigates the impact of market power on credit risk, revenue diversification and bank stability. The findings suggest that bank market power is positively associated with credit risk and revenue diversification. Nevertheless, these associations diminished during the GFC, implying that banks with greater market power were able to better manage their non-performing loans during the crisis period. Bank stability, however, is not associated with market power. Instead, it is found to be a negative function of state-ownership, asset composition and banking freedom. Overall, even though ASEAN banks with greater market power have higher credit risk, they are more diversified thus leaving their overall bank risk unaffected. The second empirical study examines the association between <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margin, <b>revenue</b> diversification and risk-adjusted profitability. The findings suggest a two-way association between <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margin and <b>revenue</b> diversification. The results denote a significant inverse relationship in the period 1998 - 2002, indicating subsidisation between interest and fee-generating business in the aftermath of the crisis. For the latter part of the sample (2003 - 2010), a positive association has been reported for <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margin and <b>revenue</b> diversification implying that non-interest income does not necessarily increase with the detriment of the <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margin. The findings reveal that diversification benefits exist for the same sub-sample period i. e. after the Basel II regulations came into force around 2003. The results also suggest that in the aftermath of both crises, risk adjusted profitability declined as banks had limited scope to diversify their sources of revenue. Overall, ASEAN banks have evolved over time, moving from the worsening risk-return trade-off to the beginnings of the benefits of diversification. The third empirical study investigates the influence of the cost of deposits, market power and the business cycle on the bank capital buffer determination. The findings imply that the capital buffer is positively associated with the cost of deposits, bank market power and the business cycle. The findings indicate that the higher the cost of deposits and the greater their market power, banks tend to hold a greater capital buffer. Furthermore, the capital buffer can vary pro-cyclically with the business cycle suggesting that banks can increase their capital buffers by expanding through various lending during economic upturns which will provide opportunities for banks to make use of this excess capital during recessions. Further, the findings suggest that the banking sector can contribute to the performance of the economy if they hold sufficient buffers and retain a healthy flow of credit when the economy is in crisis. This analysis provides some insight into ASEAN banks’ response to Basel III, which indicates that these banks will find it much harder to comply with the new regulations. This study contributes to the literature through providing evidence of the ASEAN banks’ diverse responses in the aftermath of the AFC and pre- and post-GFC with regard to the research issues. In addition, this thesis adds to the limited, but fast growing, literature on bank market power by using an improved version of the Lerner index in the form of a Funding adjusted Lerner index. Regarding the methodology, unlike other studies, this thesis extends the literature by addressing endogeneity by employing the GMM method for estimation. In addition, this thesis is includes a broader set of bank-specific, country-specific and industry-specific determinants together to address the research issues. Apart from the academic contributions, this thesis offers several implications for bankers, shareholders and regulators. The regional focus of the analysis provides useful insights for ASEAN banks for future policy formulation involving bank market power, credit risk, revenue diversification, bank stability, <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margin, cost of deposits and the business cycle, given the restructured banking system in the region...|$|R

40|$|Interest rate {{risk and}} bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins 1 Banks and their {{supervisors}} have spent considerable {{time and effort}} in recent years developing systems for monitoring and managing interest rate risk. 2 This special feature examines that specific component of interest rate risk arising from the possible effects of changes in market interest rates on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Such effects can be very large if interest rate risk is not managed carefully. For example, the secondary banking crisis in the United Kingdom in the 1970 s reflected, at least in part, the funding of longer-term assets with short-term liabilities. 3 Similarly, funding of long-term, fixed rate mortgages with savings deposits led to a very sharp drop in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins at US thrift institutions in the early 1980 s when interest rates rose to historic highs and the yield curve inverted. The result was actually negative <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income for two years at US thrifts, after <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins had averaged nearly 1. 5 % over the preceding decade (FHLBB (1984)). By contrast, the results presented here suggest that commercial banks in the 10 industrial countries considered have generally managed their exposures to volatility in the yield curve in ways that have limited effects on their <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Thus, while fluctuations in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins could be {{an important source of}} uncertainty in bank profitability – and could surely have adverse effects for particular institutions – changes in interest rates seem unlikely to undermine sharply the health of the banking sector through their effects on <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income. The next section provides background on interest rate risk at banks, and discusses methods for assessing it. Given data limitations, the approach taken here focuses on the effects of market interest rates on the average yields on bank assets and liabilities and also on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. The subsequent section reports on the empirical findings. A final section provides some concluding remarks and caveats. 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.
