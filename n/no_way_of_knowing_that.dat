5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated {{from the rest of the}} orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E

By {{giving the impression}} that the Czechs would accept a settlement favorable to the Poles without a plebiscite, Beneš got the Poles to sign an agreement that Poland would abide by any Allied decision regarding Teschen. The Poles, of course, had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> Beneš had already persuaded the Allies to make a decision on Teschen. After a brief interval, to make it appear that due deliberation had taken place, the Allied Council of Ambassadors in Paris imposed its 'decision'. Only then did it dawn on the Poles that at Spa they had signed a blank check. To them, Beneš' stunning triumph was not diplomacy, it was a swindle (...) As Polish Prime Minister Wincenty Witos warned: 'The Polish nation has received a blow which will {{play an important role in}} our relations with the Czechoslovak Republic. The decision of the Council of Ambassadors has given the Czechs a piece of Polish land containing a population which is mostly Polish.... The decision has caused a rift between these two nations which are ordinarily politically and economically united' ( ...|$|E

2500|$|While provincehood of {{some sort}} for the prairie territories was seen as {{inevitable}} by 1903, it had been widely expected that only one province would eventually be created instead of two.

[...] He, in fact, {{did not yet have}} the phrase by which Gilda would soon after be associated, [...] a term that the French critics had not, in 1946, even invented: film noir, with Rita, that genre's most remarkable femme fatale. [...] The erotic sadism and covert homoeroticism were actively encouraged on set by director Vidor, a sophisticated Vienna-born expatriate, though Glenn Ford always denied any awareness of the latter in his character's fervent loyalty to his boss, who had unwittingly married the love of Johnny's life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lowering}} of Boat 2, {{the second of}} the two cutters, with an occupancy of 25 people was overseen by Wilde and Smith at about 1:45a.m. When Lightoller moved to the boat to get it ready for loading, he found that it was already filled with a large group of male passengers and crewmen. He ordered them out at gunpoint, telling them, [...] "Get out of there, you damned cowards! I'd like to see every one of you overboard!" [...] They fled, but had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> his revolver was not loaded. Even at this late stage some boats were leaving with plenty of space aboard; Boat 2 appears to have been lowered with only 17 people aboard, out of a capacity of 40. The occupants were principally women, plus one male Third Class passenger, Anton Kink, who joined his wife and young daughter in the boat. Fourth Officer Boxhall was given charge of the boat.|$|E
