25|$|Fantasy is {{commonly}} associated with science fiction, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> worked in both genres, while writers such as Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Marion Zimmer Bradley have written works that appear to blur {{the boundary between the}} two related genres. The authors' professional organization is called the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA). SF conventions routinely have programming on fantasy topics, and fantasy authors such as J. K. Rowling have won the highest honor within the science fiction field, the Hugo Award.|$|E

500|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{criticized the}} game library for {{its lack of}} depth. Computer Gaming World {{compared}} new Sega titles to [...] "drops {{of water in the}} desert". [...] Due to Nintendo's licensing practices, few third-party developers contributed games for the Master System. [...] According to Damien McFerran, [...] "Nintendo requested that developers keep their games 'NES exclusive', and given the unassailable position the console enjoyed, few had the will to defy this request." [...] In addition, according to game designer Mark Cerny, most of Sega's early Master System titles were developed within a strict three-month deadline, which negatively impacted game quality. [...] Titles for the Master System, however, did take advantage of the advanced hardware of the console in comparison to the NES; Alex Kidd in Miracle World, for example, showcases [...] "blistering colors and more detailed sprites" [...] than competing NES games. In addition, the Master System version of R-Type has garnered retrospective praise for its quality, with its visuals considered comparable to those found in the TurboGrafx-16 port of the same title.|$|E
50|$|The film {{is based}} on a novel which had been adapted for {{television}} by ITV in 1960. It was intended to use the TV script with some embellishing, but investors required several changes and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> to work on it. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios.|$|R
50|$|Initially it {{had been}} the purpose to publish work <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> Algerian soil only. Hellal and Hadjadj noticed though, that the civil war had caused that a great <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> fled abroad. For this reason the focus changed to publish work of authors that lived in exile as well as giving a chance to authors who {{otherwise}} probably wouldnt have had a chance.|$|R

2500|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> [...] {{produced}} {{books and}} articles that incorporate and elaborate the ideas on which health realization is based.

In addition, Sydney Banks has written several books, listed below, presenting his ideas, and his lectures are reproduced {{in a number of}} videotapes and audio CDs.|$|E
2500|$|Sedevacantists {{defend their}} {{position}} using numerous arguments, including that particular provisions of canon law prevent a heretic from being elected or remaining as pope. Paul IV's 1559 bull, Cum ex apostolatus officio, stipulated that a heretic cannot be elected pope, while Canon 188.4 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law provides that a cleric who publicly defects from the Catholic faith automatically loses any office {{he had held}} in the Church. [...] A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> engaged sedevacantists in debate {{on some of these}} points. Theologian Brian Harrison has argued that Pius XII's conclave legislation permitted excommunicated cardinals to attend, from which he argues that they could also be legitimately elected. Opponents of Harrison have argued that a phrase in Pius XII's legislation, [...] "Cardinals who have been deposed or who have resigned, however, are barred and may not be reinstated even for the purpose of voting", though it speaks of someone deposed or resigned from the cardinalate, not of someone who may have incurred automatic excommunication but has not been officially declared excommunicated, means that, even if someone is permitted to attend, that does not automatically translate into electability.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> {{suggested}} that London Stone was once regarded as London's [...] "Palladium", a talismanic monument in which, like the original Palladium of Troy, the city's safety and wellbeing were embodied. This view {{seemed to be}} confirmed when a pseudonymous contributor to the journal Notes and Queries in 1862 quoted a supposedly ancient proverb about London Stone {{to the effect that}} [...] "So long as the Stone of Brutus is safe, so long shall London flourish".|$|R
5000|$|Since then a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{contributed to}} {{the debate about the}} [...] "Jave La Grande" [...] landmass that appears on the Dieppe maps. These include; ...|$|R
5000|$|The London {{historian}} John Stow, {{writing at}} the end of the 16th century, reported [...] "there remaineth in this church a table whereon is written, I know not by what authority, but of a late hand, that King Lucius founded the same church to be an archbishop's see metropolitan, and chief church of his kingdom, and that it so endured for four hundred years". The [...] "table" [...] (tablet) seen by Stow was destroyed when the medieval church was burnt in the Great Fire, but before this time a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> recorded what it said.

50|$|Although many of {{her views}} are {{considered}} unsupported by most anthropologists and archaeologists today, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> continued to develop the themes that Gould Davis originated.|$|E
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{worked with}} Kara on the {{production}} of Demon Diary. The story for volume 1 was written by Lee Chi-hyong. Lee stopped writing, {{because he had to}} prepare for the upcoming high school exams. The stories for volumes 2 through 7 were written by Lee Yun-hee.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1989, Bart Everson was arrested for public indecency (streaking) and {{assigned}} to community service at Community Access Television Services (then Bloomington Community Access Television) in Bloomington, Indiana. It was here that Everson learned how to produce videos for local cablecast, which a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> suggested was key {{to the development of}} the series.|$|E
5000|$|Aldred {{returned}} to music journalism, {{contributing to a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pop magazines of the time. Some of these articles were written under his own name, others under pseudonyms, {{one of which was}} 'Gary Glitter'. Paul Gadd - a runner on Ready Steady Go, later appropriated it as his own stage name. [...] Aldred's other work included an article entitled [...] "Why I'd Send A Valentine to Marianne Faithfull" [...] for Fabulous magazine in 1965. Despite the article's sentiments, Aldred was gay - and according to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers,</b> <b>had</b> brief affairs with Dave Davies of The Kinks and Andrew Oldham, manager of The Rolling Stones, who he had met through Brian Jones.|$|R

[...] This verse, if it were genuine, would link London Stone to Brutus of Troy, legendary founder of London, as well as confirming its role as a Palladium.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{magazine}} now employs professional writers (the September 2009 issue credited 15 journalists as being [...] "regular contributors") it still commissions articles by fans. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> guest <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> also written for {{the magazine}}, including Cris Freddi, Nick Hornby and Simon Kuper.|$|R
50|$|Although a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that Charles Walton had lent Potter money and its repayment was overdue, {{there is no}} proof that this was the case. Edith clearly did not believe it and the £300 that Walton was said to have inherited from his wife, Isabella, in 1927, was all but gone by the time he and Potter first crossed paths.|$|E
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{alleged that}} the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was {{involved}} in cocaine trafficking during the 1980s. These claims have led to investigations by the United States government, including hearings and reports by the United States House of Representatives, Senate, Department of Justice, and the CIA's Office of the Inspector General. The subject remains controversial.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, {{the accusations}} of {{deliberate}} textual tampering and forgery for doctrinal purposes {{are based on}} scribes making deliberate changes away from the original text. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> theories of direct forgery as the motive for the insertion of the Comma into the text. Some of these theories were developed after the 1883 Priscillian discovery and fingered Priscillian as the culprit.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Turkish-Dutch <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> come to prominence. [...] Halil Gür {{was one of}} the earliest, writing {{short stories}} about Turkish immigrants. Sadik Yemni is well known for his Turkish-Dutch detective stories. Sevtap Baycili is a more {{intellectual}} novelist, who is not limited to migrant themes.|$|R
60|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> European <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> made able {{studies of}} the work of Verrazano, and two American {{scholars}} have contributed valuable works on that explorer's life and achievements; these are, De Costa's 'Verrazano the Explorer: a Vindication of his Letter and Voyage', and Murphy's 'The Voyage of Verrazano'.|$|R

50|$|Sranan as {{a written}} {{language}} has existed {{since the late}} 19th century, and was given an official spelling {{by the government of}} Suriname on July 15, 1986 (resolution 4501). A small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> used Sranan in their work, most notably the poet Henri Frans de Ziel ("Trefossa"), who also wrote Suriname's national anthem (the second verse is sung in Sranan Tongo).|$|E
50|$|During the criminalization of the Kurdish {{language}} {{after the}} coup d’état of 1980, dengbêj (singers) and çîrokbêj (tellers) were silenced, {{and many of the}} stories had become endangered. In 1991, the language was decriminalized, yet the now highly available radios and TV’s had as an effect a diminished interest in traditional storytelling. However, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> made great strides in the preservation of these tales.|$|E
5000|$|Fisher's {{analysis}} {{gave rise}} to the Mendelian Paradox, a paradox that remains unsolved to this very day. Thus, on the one hand, Mendel's reported data are, statistically speaking, too good to be true; on the other, [...] "everything we know about Mendel suggests that he was unlikely to engage in either deliberate fraud or in unconscious adjustment of his observations." [...] A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> attempted to resolve this paradox.|$|E
50|$|Since the day Dr. Killfile {{attacked}} the LNH, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> LNH <b>Writers</b> <b>have</b> {{filled in the}} gaps within the Looniverse's back history. Retcons, however, often make the task of history scribing very difficult in an ever-changing Looniverse. The more popular ideas tend to remain and the other ones tend to disappear.|$|R
50|$|While a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{published}} <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{emerged from}} their work having been marketed on the site, there is suspicion {{both within and outside}} the community that the agenda for HarperCollins in establishing Authonomy is to service print on demand. Conversely, {{it could be argued that}} many think that the future of publishing lies exactly in this area.|$|R
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> noted lesbian <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> been {{published}} include: - Anna Livia, Margaret Sloan-Hunter, Jay Taverner, Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson, Mary Eliza Fullerton and Sheila Jeffreys.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{collective}} intelligence might be constructible by better organizing humans at present levels of individual intelligence. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> suggested that human civilization, or {{some aspect of}} it (e.g., the Internet, or the economy), is coming to function like a global brain with capacities far exceeding its component agents. If this systems-based superintelligence relies heavily on artificial components, however, it may qualify as an AI {{rather than as a}} biology-based superorganism.|$|E

5000|$|Pakin {{published}} {{with various}} frequencies, as monthly, bi-monthly and quarterly {{and is considered}} one of the main literary publications in Western Armenian. Its longest-running editor in chief was writer Boghos Snabian from 1964 to 2003 when writer Hagop Balian took over the responsibility. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers,</b> <b>have</b> contributed including Haroutioun Keghart, Dikran Vosgouni, Papken Papazian, and Vahe Oshagan. [...] The magazine is also renowned for its series of special issues dedicated to certain writers or events.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to covering {{the more common}} traditions of Neopaganism, such as Wicca, Harvest also gave a forum {{to some of the}} emerging Polytheistic Reconstructionist movements. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Neopagan <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> their first publication in Harvest, and the letters column provided an active forum for the development of community consensus on terminology and other issues of importance to Neopagans in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|R

A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Spanish <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> been {{teachers in the}} Sub-faculty; these include Jorge Guillén, Dámaso Alonso, José Angel Valente, Vicente Molina Foix, Félix de Azúa and Javier Marías. The novel Todas las almas (1989; trans. All Souls, 1992) by Javier Marías is set in Oxford and alludes to {{several members of the}} Sub-faculty at that time.|$|R
40|$|Discussions of the British extreme right, both in its pre-war and post-war manifestations, {{have tended}} to ignore the {{question}} <b>of</b> gender. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers,</b> however, <b>have</b> argued that, by definition, the extreme right {{should be seen as}} a highly patriarchal force. Closer examination casts doubt on this supposition, and suggests instead that for a movement organised around ultra-nationalism and resistance to the racial 'Other', but not around anti-feminism, gender {{has proved to be a}} matter of considerable debate...|$|R
