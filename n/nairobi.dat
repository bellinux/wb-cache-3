5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today <b>Nairobi</b> had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above <b>Nairobi.</b> As <b>Nairobi</b> grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of <b>Nairobi,</b> and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from <b>Nairobi</b> including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Kenyatta {{moved to}} Narok, {{where he was}} {{involved}} in transporting livestock to <b>Nairobi,</b> possibly as an administrative clerk or a ranching hand. After the British Army conquered German East Africa, Kenyatta relocated to <b>Nairobi</b> where he worked in a store selling farming and engineering equipment. In the evenings, he took classes in a Church Mission School. Several months later he returned to Thika to work with another company, and then gained employment constructing houses for the Thogota Mission. He also lived for a time in Dagoretti, where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a <b>Nairobi</b> court.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nairobi</b> National Park is a {{national}} park in Kenya. Established in 1946, the national park was Kenya's first. It is located approximately 7 kilometres (4mi) south of the centre of <b>Nairobi,</b> Kenya's capital city, with an electric fence separating the park's wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi's skyscrapers {{can be seen from}} the park. The proximity of urban and natural environments has caused conflicts between the animals and local people and threatens animals' migration routes.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{opened in}} 1946, <b>Nairobi</b> National Park {{was the first}} {{national}} park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of <b>Nairobi</b> National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.|$|E

In January 1994, bin Laden was personally presented with the team's surveillance reports, and he and his senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated al-Qaeda activities in <b>Nairobi,</b> they had not detected any warnings of imminent attacks.|$|E
5|$|In April 1922, Kenyatta began a job {{working as}} a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been {{appointed}} water superintendent for the <b>Nairobi</b> municipal council. In this position he earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and {{a growing sense of}} self-confidence. Kenyatta lived in Kilimani, although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood. He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by <b>Nairobi,</b> which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.|$|E

5|$|On 29 December 2000, British Airways Flight 2069 was {{en route}} from London to <b>Nairobi</b> when a mentally-ill {{passenger}} entered the cockpit and grabbed the controls.

5|$|On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda {{teams in}} <b>Nairobi,</b> Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, {{attacked}} the cities' U.S. embassies simultaneously with truck bombs. In <b>Nairobi,</b> the explosion collapsed the nearby Ufundi Building and destroyed the embassy, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans; another 4,000 people were wounded. In Dar es Salaam, the bomber {{was unable to}} {{get close enough to}} the embassy to demolish it, but the blast killed 11 Africans and wounded 85. Bin Laden justified the high-casualty attacks, the largest against the U.S. since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, by claiming they were in retaliation for the deployment of U.S. troops in Somalia; he also alleged the embassies had devised the Rwandan Genocide and a supposed plan to partition Sudan.|$|E

5|$|The {{conservationist}} Mervyn Cowie {{was born}} in <b>Nairobi.</b> Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed {{to see that the}} amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become <b>Nairobi</b> National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign {{for the establishment of a}} national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.|$|E
