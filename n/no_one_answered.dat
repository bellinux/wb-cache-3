5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> {{at the phone}} number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{cell phone}} usage, police believe the killings {{took place on}} the evening of September 11. A call was placed at 8:54p.m. from Weissman's cell phone to Gerry's Italian Kitchen, a Watertown restaurant, for {{delivery}} of three dinner entrees. When a delivery woman arrived at 9:14p.m., there was no answer at the door, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> when the restaurant called Weissman's cell phone.|$|E
25|$|By February 19, {{not having}} {{heard from her}} {{daughter}} herself, Nelson asked her parents, who lived near Ashburn, to drive by and {{see if she was}} there. Bethany's Hyundai was still out front, but it was parked at an unusual angle, with one tire flat, and noticeably dusty. This was not the condition it had been in one week earlier, when the grandparents had last driven by. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> when they knocked on the door.|$|E

5000|$|Despite its common usage {{to address}} {{people who call}} with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answering</b> the phone, the here here is semantically {{contradictory}} to one's absence. Nevertheless, this is considered normal for most people as speakers have to project themselves as answering the phone {{when in fact they}} are not physically.|$|R
25|$|Rodger {{drove to}} the Alpha Phi {{sorority}} house at Embarcadero del Norte and Segovia Road near the University of California Santa Barbara. He knocked on the sorority house door for a few minutes. After <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answered,</b> he began shooting people who were nearby. He first shot three Delta Delta Delta sorority sisters, killing {{two of them and}} wounding the third. Responding sheriff's deputies and nearby pedestrians ran to the victims and tried to tend to their wounds before ambulances arrived.|$|E
2500|$|Included in the {{testimony}} was that by Grand Goblin William S. Coburn, {{who said he}} knew there were no Klansmen present at the Inglewood raid because {{he walked through the}} groups gathered in front of the Elduayen home and gave the [...] "Grand Goblin's call" [...] and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Miss Gilchrist had {{recognised}} {{a painting}} by Vermeer in Cora's purchases, but Cora did not recognise it. Mr Guthrie {{would have seen the}} painting's value, so Miss Gilchrist made her plan of murder. Miss Gilchrist covered the Vermeer with her own painting of the destroyed pier. The scent of the oils lingered when Mr Entwhistle visited the cottage the day after the murder. Miss Gilchrist's dream was to rebuild her beloved tea shop with funds raised on the Vermeer. Poirot deduced the key role of the painting. It was sent to Guthrie, who replied tersely by telegram, [...] "definitely a Vermeer, Guthrie." [...] Inspector Morton added that two nuns had called at Cora's cottage the day of Richard Abernethie's funeral. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>answered,</b> yet they heard noises from a person, witnessing the real Cora Lansquenet's presence in her own home as Miss Gilchrist was impersonating her at Enderby Hall.|$|E

The papers continued to refer to the case as 'the Liverpool Mystery.' Scotland Yard sent Mr. Fairburn down--the celebrated detective--at the request of the Liverpool police, to help in the investigations, but nothing availed.|$|R

Those who remain are asked one more multiple-choice question apiece, and all who answer correctly win an equal share of the prize fund.

2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answered.</b> One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E

60|$|Guided by {{the painted}} name of Mr. Grewgious, she went up-stairs and softly tapped and tapped several times. But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answering,</b> and Mr. Grewgious’s door-handle {{yielding}} to her touch, she went in, {{and saw her}} guardian sitting on a window-seat at an open window, with a shaded lamp placed far from him {{on a table in}} a corner.|$|R

Meanwhile, the cloud has enveloped the hut. Anne suddenly faints again, and Brooks phones the hut but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Bender was a forerunner in {{proposing that}} {{childhood}} disorders {{were not always}} due to poor up-bringing.

Although she did not consider herself a Gestaltist, she made several contributions to the field.|$|R
