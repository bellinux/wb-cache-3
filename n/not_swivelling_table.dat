40|$|Measuring and {{compensating}} {{the pivot}} points of five-axis machine tools is always challenging and very time consuming. This paper presents a newly developed approach for automatic measurement and compensation of pivot point positional errors on five-axis machine tools. Machine rotary axis errors are measured using a circular test. This method {{has been tested}} on five-axis machine tools with <b>swivel</b> <b>table</b> configuration. Results show that up to 99 % of the positional errors of the rotary axis can be compensated by using this approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} and compare interactions between the abdominal musculature and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during controlled dynamic and static trunk muscle loading. Myoelectric activity was recorded in six subjects from the rectus abdominis, obliquus externus, obliquus internus, transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles using surface and intra-muscular fine-wire electrodes. The IAP was recorded intra-gastrically. Trunk flexions and extensions were performed lying on one side on a <b>swivel</b> <b>table.</b> An adjustable brake provided different friction loading conditions, while adding weights to an unbraked <b>swivel</b> <b>table</b> afforded various levels of inertial loading. During trunk extensions at all friction loads, IAP was elevated (1. 8 - 7. 2 kPa) with concomitant activity in transversus abdominis and obliquus internus muscles-little or no activity was seen from rectus abdominis and obliquus externus muscles. For inertia loading during trunk extension, IAP levels were somewhat lower (1. 8 - 5. 6 kPa) and displayed a second peak when abdominal muscle activity occurred in the course of decelerating the movement. For single trunk flexions with friction loading, IAP was higher than that seen in extension conditions and increased with added resistance. For inertial loading during trunk flexion, IAP showed two peaks, the larger first peak matched peak forward acceleration and general abdominal muscle activation, while the second corresponded to peak deceleration and was accompanied by activity in transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles. It was apparent that different loading strategies produced markedly different patterns of response in both trunk musculature and intra-abdominal pressure...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of this method, aside from its relatively straightforward nature, {{is the fact that}} with a large enough solid surface, multiple droplets can be deposited in various locations on the sample to determine heterogeneity. The reproducibility of particular values of the contact angle will reflect the heterogeneity of the surface’s energy properties. Conversely, the disadvantage is that if the sample is only large enough for one droplet, then {{it will be difficult to}} determine heterogeneity, or consequently to assume homogeneity. This is particularly true because conventional, commercially available goniometers do <b>not</b> <b>swivel</b> the camera/backlight set up relative to the stage, and thus can only show the contact angle at two points: the right and the left edge of the droplet. In addition to this, this measurement is hampered by its inherent subjectivity, as the placement of the lines is determined either by the user looking at the pictures or by the image analysis software’s definition of the lines.|$|R
50|$|Two {{years later}} he invented the Shay Locomotive. In about 1877 he {{developed}} {{the idea of having}} an engine sit on a flat car with a boiler, gears, and trucks that could pivot. The first Shay only had two cylinders and the front truck was mounted normally while the rear truck was fixed to the frame and could <b>not</b> <b>swivel,</b> much as normal drivers on a locomotive. He mounted the 3 ft diameter by 5 ft tall boiler centered on the car with the water tank over the front trucks and the Crippen's engine mounted crossways over the rear trucks. Shay experimented first with a chain drive from the engine through the floor to the truck axle. It is not known if he powered one or both axles, but he soon found that the chain drive was not practical and he next tried a belt drive. It did not take long for the idea to become popular.|$|R

40|$|In humans, intra-abdominal {{pressure}} (IAP) is elevated during many everyday activities. This experiment aimed {{to investigate the}} extent to which increased IAP-without concurrent activity of the abdominal or back extensor muscles-produces an extensor torque. With subjects positioned in side lying on a <b>swivel</b> <b>table</b> with its axis at L 3, moments about this vertebral level were measured when IAP was transiently increased by electrical stimulation of the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve. There was no electromyographic activity in abdominal and back extensor muscles. When IAP was increased artificially to similar to 15 % of the maximum IAP amplitude that could be generated voluntarily with the trunk positioned in flexion, a trunk extensor moment (similar to 6 Nm) was recorded. The size of the effect was proportional to the increase in pressure. The extensor moment was consistent with that predicted from a model based on measurements of abdominal cross-sectional area and IAP moment arm. When IAP was momentarily increased while the trunk was flexed passively at a constant velocity, the external torque required to maintain the velocity was increased. These results provide the first in vivo data of the amplitude of extensor moment that is produced by increased IAP. Although the net effect of this extensor torque in functional tasks would be dependent on the muscles used to increase the IAP and their associated flexion torque, the data do provide evidence that IAP contributes, at least in part, to spinal stability.

50|$|Wing {{stations}} require pylons {{to carry}} objects. Stations on the fuselage {{may not necessarily}} require a pylon, such as the fuselage stations on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, while other aircraft need pylons for certain stations {{in order to provide}} clearance for the landing gear retraction sequence (like in F-14 Tomcat) or to provide necessary item space (like in Mikoyan MiG-27). Swing-wing aircraft that mount pylons on the moving portion of the wing (such as the General Dynamics F-111 and the Panavia Tornado) must include a mechanism for swiveling the pylon as the wing sweeps fore or aft, {{in order to keep the}} pylon and store facing directly forwards at all times. The F-111's outermost pair of hardpoints do <b>not</b> <b>swivel,</b> and can only be used while the wing is fully extended. This restricts the aircraft to subsonic flight only while these pylons are fitted, usually fitted with fuel tanks during ferry flights. The pylons are automatically jettisoned if the wing sweep moves past 26 degrees, which would mean that the aircraft is accelerating towards transonic speeds.|$|R

5000|$|The Mooney M10 Cadet {{is a light}} {{airplane}} {{manufactured by}} the Mooney Aircraft Company in 1969 and 1970. The M10 {{is derived from the}} ERCO Ercoupe, the type certificates for which Mooney purchased from the Alon Corporation in 1967. [...] The M10 is similar to the Alon A2-A, and indeed a handful of [...] "Mooney A2-As" [...] were built in Kerrville in 1968 before changeover of Mooney's production line was completed. [...] According to the FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet, the [...] "Model 10 is similar to Model A2-A except for new design empennage, ailerons and fuel tank vent." [...] The most obvious difference is that the M10 replaces the iconic Ercoupe-style dual vertical stabilizer with a tail designed to allow the airplane to spin. Changes to the ailerons, along with replacement of the A2-A's tail, were motivated by Mooney's intent to market the M10 as a trainer: student pilots receiving training in a non-spinnable airplane, as the Ercoupe was, were issued FAA pilot certificates carrying the restriction that they could only fly airplanes which were [...] "characteristically incapable of spinning"; thus the spinnable tail was necessary to turn the A2-A into a general-purpose trainer. Given that they were replacing the tail, Mooney's engineers opted to give it the [...] "backward" [...] profile characteristic of the M20 series. Note however that although the M10's empennage has the same silhouette as the [...] "big Mooneys", it does <b>not</b> <b>swivel</b> the way the M20's does ... the Cadet's tail is a conventional design with fixed horizontal stabilizer, hinged elevator, and trim tabs.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited I This report describes the conceptual {{design of a}} direct pump-out facility for Corps of Engineers 1 hopper dredges. Operational conditions were a significant wave height of 6. 0 ft, wind velocity of 30 knots, I and a current velocity of 2 knots. The mooring system was designed for operation in a minimum depth of 30 ft and a maximum depth of 45 ft. The following operational criteria were also required for the mooring design: (a) transportation by truck or rail, (b) rapid assembly {{with little or no}} diver support, and (c) installation with a minimum of lift support. The report examines five alternatives: (a) a guyed tower, tension leg platform (TLP), (b) a single anchor mooring (SALM), (c) a three-leg catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), and (d) a four-leg CALM. The four-leg CALM was selected for further study because it best met the operational criteria.
