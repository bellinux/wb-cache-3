5|$|Russian {{historian}} Oleg Sokolov {{posits that}} Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic {{victory for the}} French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> apparent to either side. Sokolov adds {{that the decision to}} not commit the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon's finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. Digby Smith calls Borodino 'a draw' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to not commit the Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy, the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century, when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory.|$|E

TTC staff {{concluded}} that the pilot project was not a success and {{that it should be}} discontinued, but the Commission disagreed, and voted to not only continue it, but to direct that bike racks would be installed on all new buses starting in 2007. The Commission then directed staff to look into the cost of retrofitting the entire bus fleet with bike racks. The original bike rack model will not be used on newer buses, due to it blocking the high beams on the Orion VII, and a different model from the same manufacturer will be used starting on 2007 deliveries. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> included in the five-year capital budget.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{increasing}} visibility through his books, LaVey {{was the subject}} of numerous articles in the news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as Look, McCall's, Newsweek, and Time, and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as The Joe Pyne Show, Donahue and The Tonight Show, and in a feature-length documentary called Satanis in 1970. He would be credited for the mainstreaming of Satanism and witchcraft in the U.S. during the 1960s, 1970s and after. LaVey claimed that he had been appointed consultant to the film Rosemary's Baby, which revolved around a group of fictional Satanists, and that he also had a cameo appearance in the film as the Devil, however critics have argued that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> true. In an article published in Rolling Stone magazine in 1991, the journalist Lawrence Wright revealed that through his own investigative work, he found that many of LaVey's claims about his life had been untrue. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including The Devil's Avenger by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974 and The Secret Life of a Satanist by Blanche Barton, published in 1990.|$|E

25|$|In a {{surprising}} and shocking trade, Gretzky, along with enforcer Marty McSorley and centre Mike Krushelnyski, were {{traded to the}} Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988. In exchange, the Oilers received US$15 million, young star Jimmy Carson, 1988 first-round draft choice Martin Gelinas and the Kings' first round draft picks in 1989, 1991 and 1993. The trade occurred because Pocklington didn't want to risk Gretzky leaving Edmonton without getting anything in return. Gretzky had converted his personal services contract with Pocklington into a standard five-year player's contract with the Oilers {{in the summer of}} 1987 with an option to declare himself an unrestricted free agent after the 1988–89 season. During the 1987–88 season, Pocklington had approached Gretzky about renegotiating the contract, but Gretzky, unwilling to give up his chance at free agency, refused, which ultimately led to the trade. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> public knowledge at the time. However, the Oilers and their fans were still upset. Nelson Riis, the New Democratic Party leader in Canada's House of Commons, {{went so far as to}} ask the government to block the trade. Several of the Oilers considered launching a team-wide strike, and even considered demanding that Pocklington sell the team.|$|E

Andre and DiBiase wrestled WWF Tag Team Champions the Valiant Brothers (Johnny and Jerry) several times for the belts at untelevised house shows, with the Andre-DiBiase team usually winning by countout or disqualification (thus, never winning the belts). At least one Andre-DiBiase teaming was televised, this being a special series of shows taped at the Resorts International Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Andre and DiBiase would frequently team elsewhere through the years, including Japan and other smaller territory promotions, well before the Mega Bucks storyline; <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> acknowledged by the WWF when DiBiase returned in 1987 under his [...] "Million-Dollar Man"/"evil millionaire" [...] gimmick and became involved in André's ongoing feud with Hulk Hogan.|$|E

500|$|Prompted by {{the launch}} of and {{misinformation}} about , the US Navy and Congress faced what they perceived as a vastly better battleship than the two [...] battleships then under construction, which were designed under tonnage constraints that Congress had imposed on capital ships. Actually, the South Carolinas were inferior only in speed to Dreadnought; they carried fewer heavy guns but, unlike Dreadnought, could bring {{all of them to}} bear on the broadside. Because of this, they could fire an equal weight of metal. Also, because greater time and care had been taken with their armor and bulkhead arrangement, they were better protected than the British ship. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> realized at the time. Nevertheless, the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) had struggled tremendously to design an adequate warship under congressional limits and had taken battleship design as far under those restrictions as it could. Seeing now that those limits had become unrealistic, Congress ended them; any subsequent constraints would be dictated by treaty limitations.

500|$|Steven Spielberg, {{a fan of}} {{the comics}} and toys, signed on as {{executive}} producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons, and featured the Ark spaceship. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon, were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005. Spielberg suggested that [...] "a boy and his car" [...] should be the focus. This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, [...] "the things that a car represents in the United States". The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft. The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase. The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon. Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement. The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit).

2500|$|After being a stalwart of chat shows, in {{the mid-1980s}} Monkhouse {{presented}} his own for the BBC, The Bob Monkhouse Show. The show lasted two series and showcased comedians of every age. Monkhouse was criticised for sycophancy towards his guests but {{said that they were}} all heroes of his and that was how he really felt about them. Monkhouse was known as a keen supporter of new comedy and he used the show to introduce audiences to new comedians such as Kelly Monteith, Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. The format of the interviews varied between [...] "true" [...] chat and analysis of comedy, to scripted routines in which Monkhouse would willingly play the role of the guest's stooge as he did with Bob Hope. On one occasion the guest was the comedian Pamela Stephenson who, after prior arrangement with the show's producer, appeared in a series of fake plaster casts, apparently the result of accidents whilst at home. During the interview she produced a handgun and fired it on several occasions, destroying a plant pot on the set and a series of lights in the studio roof.

2500|$|In 1974 Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane {{reclaimed}} his {{ancestral home}} and moved {{with his new}} wife back into Brympton d'Evercy {{with the intention of}} restoring it and opening it to the public as a stately home. His problem was that, while the empty and neglected house may have been his home, it was far from stately. While the house was structurally in a fair condition, it had not been redecorated since the 18th century and had endured the obvious ravages caused by its use as a boys' school. The redecoration of the state rooms was executed on a very restricted budget. The principal problem facing the owners was furnishing the house. Few of its former contents remained, and while Brympton d'Evercy is not on a par with Blenheim Palace in size, it still required large items and quantities of high quality antique furniture. This was the stumbling block to the stately home scheme. The Clive-Ponsonby-Fanes made great efforts to draw in the crowds, an agricultural museum, a vineyard, a distillery of apple brandy, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> interesting enough to attract visitors from as far afield as London, let alone those from across the Atlantic. Ultimately, as a financial enterprise, opening to the public failed. In 1992 after almost 300 years of ownership the family sold Brympton d'Evercy. The situation was summed up at the time by the satirist Auberon Waugh: [...] "Last week we learnt that the most beautiful house in Somerset has been sold.....it is sad of course for the family who owned it who had made a valiant effort to keep it going [...].it did not succeed as a showpiece: they had run out of money, the internal decorations were dreadful, and they lacked the proper kit {{to make it look like}} anything more than a prep school on open day.

By all modern standards the business was, as my uncle would say, [...] "absolutely bona fide."
