5|$|Borislow's most {{successful}} horse was Toccet, who won four graded stakes, including the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. Toccet's {{name is a}} misspelled tribute to former National Hockey League (NHL) player Rick Tocchet. The horse was named runner-up to Vindication for the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2002, {{a part of the}} Eclipse Award. Once a favorite to enter the 2003 Kentucky Derby, Toccet was derailed by ankle injuries early in the year. He won one listed stakes after his juvenile season out of 15 starts and <b>now</b> <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> Castleton Lyons.|$|E

The average house price across Angus has risen by 14.9% in the past year (to November 2006) and <b>now</b> <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> £124,451.

The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population <b>now</b> <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree <b>now</b> <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> the spot.|$|E
