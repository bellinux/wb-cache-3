During her schooling, the Chaco War broke out, and though there was no fighting in Asunción, the family could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> be affected since her father and uncle were both involved in the war. The ensuing political upheavals, sent her uncle Estigarribia, with whom her family were close, into exile. Her schooling included study of both French and Guarani languages, as well as the typical religious education.|$|E

At the age of 22, she applied to work at the Dutch Dairy Bureau, while taking City & Guilds courses in the evenings. She then persuaded her manager to pay for her to undertake the professional qualification from the French Le Cordon Bleu school. The temporary move to France came as a culture shock; she could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> cry all the way through her first meal, consisting of horse meat, reminding her of the pony she had left behind at home in Bath.|$|E

500|$|Writing in Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot {{found the}} album [...] "drearily monochromatic" [...] {{compared}} to its predecessor, and to PopMatters' Zeth Lundy, it suffers from [...] "a more anonymous tract" [...] {{next to the}} [...] "cathedral-grade significance" [...] of All Things Must Pass. Reviewing Harrison's solo career for Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson considered the 1973 album to be the equal of All Things Must Pass, reasoning: [...] "While history insists that Living in the Material World could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> be eclipsed by its gargantuan forebear, with the two albums in the CD player and the 'shuffle' function mixing them up, it's difficult to play favourites." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> search {{everywhere}} for meaning. He {{says of the}} windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises [...] "the sheer {{hard work}} needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard {{the future of the}} nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are [...] "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". Slive is more reluctant to read too much into the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the [...] "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says [...] "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".|$|E
500|$|In {{a section}} {{apparently}} reprinted from earlier publications, the pamphlet discerns [...] "Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy" [...] {{in a number}} of aspects of British culture. It claims that, in past ages, British middle-class gentlemen had led moral, industrious lives, serving King, country, and family. This era, the pamphlet claims, was now past and lost; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated. Contemporary infants, it says, faced grim prospects, being pampered in nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers. Such children, the pamphlet argued, could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> to grow up effete and were [...] "scarcely worth raising". Some of the blame for this, the pamphlet claims, lay with the increasing popularity of raising children at home, and having them educated by women, rather than sending them to school or to be apprenticed. Lacking the boisterous companionship of other boys they could not acquire manly traits; governed by women, they never learned to dominate women themselves, which, the pamphlet claimed, was requisite to please a wife.|$|E
500|$|Shea's role {{in resolving}} {{differences}} within NASA, and between NASA and its contractors, {{placed him in}} a position where criticism was inevitable. However, even Shea's critics could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> respect his engineering and management skills. Everyone who knew Shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer,Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 121. and his time as manager at ASPO only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the Titan project. Of Shea's work in the mid-1960s, Murray and Cox write that [...] "these were Joe Shea's glory days, and whatever the swirl of opinions about this gifted, enigmatic man, he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward." [...] Shea's work also won wider attention, bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to Wernher von Braun or Chris Kraft. Kraft had appeared on the cover of Time in 1965; Time planned to offer Shea the same honor in February 1967, the month in which the first manned Apollo mission was scheduled to occur.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{and critics}} are divided in their {{views about the}} value of the {{recovered}} excerpts. On the one hand, Josephson is convinced that sufficient material exists for a reconstruction of the entire symphony and eagerly awaits the undertaking of this task. This view is echoed by Stearns: [...] "here's absolutely no reason not to attempt a completion". Others, however, are more circumspect: Virtanen, in particular, emphasises that although the music is irrefutably late Sibelius, it has not been established beyond doubt that any of it belongs to the Eighth Symphony. Sirén, who {{played a major role in}} organising the performance of the fragments, believes that completion is impossible on the basis of existing sketches, and would be dependent on further discoveries. He also surmises that Sibelius, having rejected the work, would not have relished hearing the fragments played, a viewpoint which McKenna endorses: [...] "Watching the performance on YouTube, I could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> think how disappointed the composer would have been to hear his unfinished music performed." [...] Reviewing the recorded excerpts in Gramophone, Andrew Mellor remarks that even if further manuscripts should come to light, the Sibelius Rights Holders would have full control over the material and would decide whether performance was appropriate. Mellor concludes: [...] "We've had to wait some 80 years to hear less than three minutes of music, and the mystery of the Eighth isn't set to unfold any more rapidly from here".|$|E

[...] It was Roger Moore's favourite Bond film, and many reviewers consider it the best installment to star the actor. Christopher Null praised the gadgets, particularly the Lotus Esprit car. James Berardinelli of Reelviews said that the film is [...] "suave and sophisticated", and Barbara Bach proves to be an ideal Bond girl – [...] "attractive, smart, sexy, and dangerous". Brian Webster stated the special effects were [...] "good for a 1979 [...] film", and Marvin Hamlisch's music, [...] "memorable". Danny Peary described The Spy Who Loved Me as [...] "exceptional... For once, the big budget was not wasted. Interestingly, while the sets and gimmicks were the most spectacular to date, Bond and the other characters are toned down (there's a minimum of slapstick humour) so that they are more realistic than in other Roger Moore films. Moore gives his best performance in the series... are an appealing couple, equal in every way. Film is a real treat – a well acted, smartly cast, sexy, visually impressive, lavishly produced, powerfully directed mix of a spy romance and a war-mission film." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times considered the film formulaic and [...] "half an hour too long, thanks to the obligatory shoot-'em-up conclusion,... nevertheless the dullest sequence here" [...] but praised Moore's performance and the film's [...] "share of self-mockery", which she found refreshing.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the use of}} type {{dynamics}} is disputed: in {{the conclusion}} of various studies {{on the subject of}} type dynamics, James H.

His studies gave the clear result that the descriptions and workings of type dynamics do not fit the real behavior of people. He suggests getting completely rid of type dynamics, because it does <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> hinders understanding of personality.

2500|$|Yet despite Khrushchev's May 7 {{political}} trap, the Soviet premier still {{attempted to}} allow Eisenhower to save face, possibly {{to salvage the}} peace summit to some degree.

[...] On May 9, the Soviet premier told US ambassador Thompson that he [...] "could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> suspect that someone had launched this operation with the deliberate intent of spoiling the summit meeting."

2500|$|It {{turned out}} that the {{machinery}} was too heavy to be worked by people, and Stephenson had to use a horse. On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: Summer and Winter, by Morris Barnett; a melodrama, The Sergeant's Wife; and a farce, The Midnight Hour. The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did <b>not</b> <b>help,</b> <b>but</b> the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill. She sought to lease the theatre, but it was empty for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of Charles Dickens's productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property.|$|E
