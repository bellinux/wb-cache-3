We make use of earliest arrivals to detect the line of sight components. <b>Directional</b> <b>beacons</b> are generated using four element uniform linear antenna array (ULA) at the transmitting nodes. To achieve narrow beamwidth, we design the beampattern using Dolph-Chebyshev method that provides a way to tradeoff beamwidth for sidelobes level in an optimum manner. Simulation results show that the minimum error in time estimation (consequently position location) does not occur at the minimum beamwidth. The increase in range estimation error at the minimum beamwidth is due to the significant sidelobes level at this point. Through simulation results, we show that the minimum error in range estimation occurs at 0. 33 rad beamwidth for 20 dB SNR case. I...|$|R

The observed DOE-RSSI signature is used as a fingerprint to search a map of previously measured DOE-RSSI signatures.

40|$|The {{detection}} of the theoretically expected dark matter {{is central to}} particle physics and cosmology. Current fashionable supersymmetric models provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor and/or spin response function), permit {{the evaluation of the}} event rate for LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however, very low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation effect, i. e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth’s annual motion. Also it is useful to consider the directional rate, i. e its dependence on the direction of the recoiling nucleus. In this paper we study such a modulation effect both in <b>non</b> <b>directional</b> and directional experiments. We calculate both the differential and the total rates using both isothermal, symmetric as well as only axially asymmetric, and non isothermal, due to caustic rings, velocity distributions. We consider We find that in the symmetric case the modulation amplitude is small. The same is true for the case of caustic rings. The inclusion of asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced velocity dispersion in the galactocentric direction, yields an enhanced modulation effect, especially in directional experiments. ...|$|R
50|$|Sonography can be {{enhanced}} with Doppler measurements, which employ the Doppler effect to assess whether structures (usually blood) are moving towards or away from the probe, and its relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualised. This is particularly useful in cardiovascular studies (sonography of the vascular system and heart) and essential in many areas such as determining reverse blood flow in the liver vasculature in portal hypertension. The Doppler information is displayed graphically using spectral Doppler, or as an image using color Doppler (directional Doppler) or power Doppler (<b>non</b> <b>directional</b> Doppler). This Doppler shift falls in the audible range and is often presented audibly using stereo speakers: this produces a very distinctive, although synthetic, pulsating sound.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, the {{incorporation}} of the directional antennas within mobile devices has been studied in many areas. The usage of directional antennas can greatly reduce the radio interference, which results in improved utilization of the wireless medium. It becomes practical to exploit the directional antennas in the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design. In this paper, a Location and Mobility Aware (LMA) MAC protocol is developed for the vehicular ad hoc networks. The predictive location and mobility of the vehicles are adopted to provide robust communication links while using the directional beams. The deafness problem is also alleviated using the directional listen (D-Listen) mechanism in the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the exploitation of the <b>Directional</b> <b>Beacons</b> (DBs) within the scheme can enhance {{the reliability of the}} communication linkages even the moving directions and speeds of the vehicles have been changed. Under dynamic moving scenarios, both the spatial reuse and the routing efficiency are preserved using the proposed LMA MAC scheme. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with other existing MAC protocols in simulations.

In this method, <b>Directional</b> <b>Beaconing</b> {{is combined with}} Fingerprinting whereby the WiFi access points (APs) transmit a narrow beamwidth signal switching between {{a small number of}} fixed directions of emission (DOEs) and the MD records the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for all in-range APs and all DOEs. These observations give a DOE-RSSI signatures at the MD for each AP. The location of the MD is determined using a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm which finds the best matching DOE-RSSI signature in a pre-stored map. The method improves on previous omnidirectional fingerprinting methods by increasing the number of RSSI maps available per AP. A testbed network was deployed in an office building and its performance was evaluated. The results show a reduction in mean location error from 2. 87 m to 1. 64 m (43 % improvement) for the proposed method compared with conventional omnidirectional RSSI fingerprinting, when using 3 APs in a positioning space of 12 m by 13. 5 m...|$|R
40|$|Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSN) {{are widely}} used in many applications, such as oceanic {{resource}} exploration, pollution monitoring, tsunami warnings and mine reconnaissance. In UWSNs, determining the location information of each sensor node is a critical issue, because many services {{are based on the}} localization results. In this paper, we introduce a novel underwater localization approach based on directional signals, which are transmitted by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our method utilizes <b>directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (UDB) to replace traditional omnidirectional localization which provides more accurate and efficient ways to locate the sensors themselves by simple calculations. The advantage of this novel scheme is that the communications between AUV and sensors are not necessary because the AUV broadcasts signals and sensors only need to passively listen to the signals. Since the energy consumption for transmissions in underwater environments is a nontrivial factor, our localization scheme not only supports accurate positioning, but also reduces energy consumption of sensors. We evaluate our scheme by simulations. The results show that our new approach is very precise in a strap area. At the same time, we minimize the number of beacons issued from the AUV. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
