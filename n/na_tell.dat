There'll be some Frasers, I'm thinking, {{and some of the}} Gregara; and I would never deny but what the both of them, and the Gregara in especial, were clever experienced persons. A man kens little till he's driven a spreagh of neat cattle (say) ten miles through a throng lowland country and the black soldiers maybe at his tail.

25|$|The twelfth-century work Acallam <b>na</b> Senórach <b>tells</b> of Patrick {{being met}} by two ancient warriors, Caílte mac Rónáin and Oisín, during his evangelical travels. The two were once members of Fionn mac Cumhaill's warrior band the Fianna, and somehow survived to Patrick's time. In the work St. Patrick seeks {{to convert the}} warriors to Christianity, while they defend their pagan past. The heroic pagan {{lifestyle}} of the warriors, of fighting and feasting and living close to nature, is contrasted with the more peaceful, but unheroic and non-sensual life offered by Christianity.|$|R

500|$|Azalea found [...] "Bounce" [...] to be {{different}} from her previous releases and the most commercial song on The New Classic. She initially felt that it was a risky choice for a single, and consulted Nas regarding the decision; [...] "With 'Bounce,' I was like, 'It's a pop record. I don't know.' [...] was like, 'Just fucking do it. It's something different. It's one song, what's the big deal?' I couldn't believe <b>Nas</b> was <b>telling</b> me to do a hip-pop record." [...] Azalea also did not intend to include the song on The New Classic, believing that it strayed too far from the album's musical and lyrical themes, but her record label convinced her otherwise and it was included as one of the album's three bonus tracks. The song was later included in the main track listing of the album's reissue, Reclassified.|$|R

60|$|He {{did not go}} at once into camp. He felt troubled, {{and wished}} {{that he had not}} {{encountered}} the two. His duty in the matter, of course, was to <b>tell</b> <b>Nas</b> Ta Bega what he had seen. Upon reflection Shefford decided to give the missionary the benefit of a doubt; and if he really cared for the Indian girl, and admitted or betrayed it, to think all the better of him for the fact. Glen Naspa was certainly pretty enough, and probably lovable enough, to please any lonely man in this desert. The pain and the yearning in Shefford's heart made him lenient. He had to fight himself--not to forget, for that was impossible--but to keep rational and sane when a white flower-like face haunted him and a voice called.|$|R
5000|$|He united {{three generations}} of fans {{including}} a strong following of [...] "educated" [...] adolescent fans. At {{the end of the}} 1980s, he interpreted [...] "difficult" [...] songs with lyrics written by Kostas Tripolitis and music by Thanos Mikroutsikos. In between he sang [...] "Chorevo" [...] (I am Dancing) and in the new decade he sang for the second time after 1978 in [...] "Stavros tou Notou" [...] (Southern Cross) songs by Nikos Kavvadias and Thanos Mikroutsikos. Although his songs of the last years follow the sound of [...] "popular" [...] culture he hasn't hesitated to record LP albums on the verses of two of the most celebrated Greek poets. In 1984 he sang poetry by Kostas Karyotakis in a record named after the poet, and in 1993 [...] "Fissai" [...] (It is Blowing) had verses by Tassos Livaditis and music by Giorgos Tsegaris. He interpreted Nikolas Asimos again in 1992 in [...] "Falimento tou Kosmou" [...] (The end of the World) and in the last decade he made [...] "Sfedona" [...] (Sling). In 1995 he made [...] "The Shikoni" [...] (Impossible) cooperating with Alkis Alkeos, Christophoros Krokides, Vassilis Giannopoulos, Stamatis Mesimeris, Aphrodite Manou, Odysseas Ioannou and Minos Matsas. The last record that hit the market in April 1997 under the title [...] "Pes mou ena Psemma gia <b>na</b> Apokimitho" [...] (<b>Tell</b> me a Lie to Sleep), included songs of Nikolas Asimos, Apostolos Boulassikis (making his first appearance), Stamatis Messimeris, Giannis Ioannou, Vassilis Gianopoulos, Christophoros Krokides, as well as the song, [...] "Malista Kyrie" [...] (Yes Sir) by Giorgos Zampetas and Alekos Kagiantas.|$|R
