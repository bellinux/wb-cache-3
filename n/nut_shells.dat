This study employed four fuels namely, neat diesel, neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel, fuel comprising 10 % (by volume) of hexanol and 90 % (by volume) of neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel and fuel comprising 20 % of hexanol and 80 % of neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel in a constant speed compression ignition engine.

30|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of doping hexanol into {{biodiesel}} which is from neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel oil on the emissions and the performance characteristics was studied in a constant speed diesel engine. The main purpose of this work is to reduce various emissions and also to improve {{the performance of the}} diesel engine when fueled with blends of hexanol and neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel. Cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> oil is not edible, and hence it {{can be used as a}} viable alternative to diesel. Cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel is prepared by conventional transesterification. Hexanol with 99.2 % purity was employed as an oxygenated additive. Experimental studies were conducted by fueling diesel as a baseline and by fueling hexanol and neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel mixture. A fuel comprising 10 % (by volume) of hexanol and 90 % (by volume) neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel was referred to as CNSBD 900 H 100 and fuel comprising 20 % (by volume) of hexanol and 80 % (by volume) of neat cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel was referred to as CNSBD 800 H 200. This study also investigated the possibility of using pure biofuel in an unmodified naturally aspirated diesel engine. The outcome of this study showed that adding hexanol at 10 % and 20 % (by volume) to cashew <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> biodiesel results in a reduction in emissions. In addition, a significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency and reduction in brake-specific fuel consumptions were achieved. Hence, it could be concluded that hexanol could be a viable and promising additive for improving the drawbacks of biodiesel when it was used to fuel an unmodified diesel engine.|$|R

Before the pistachio <b>nut</b> <b>shell</b> was activated, platinum uptake (%) was poor compared to the rice husk.
