5|$|Nodes were {{designated}} 'A', 'B' or 'C' depending upon {{how long they}} were expected to hold out. Home Guard troops were largely responsible for the defence of <b>nodal</b> points and other centres of resistance such as towns and defended villages. Category 'A' <b>nodal</b> points and anti-tank islands usually had a garrison of regular troops.|$|E
5|$|Traditional mesh {{analysis}} and <b>nodal</b> analysis in electronics {{lead to a}} system of linear equations that can be described with a matrix.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the French Revolution began in 1789 Givors had 2,800 inhabitants. Its <b>nodal</b> position, later {{reinforced}} by construction of various railways, explains {{the development of the}} glass works and later of iron and steel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|A focal {{mechanism}} {{solution of}} the earthquake confirmed two <b>nodal</b> planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east-west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate <b>nodal</b> plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, the Government of India {{approved}} Delhi's bid for World Heritage City status. The historical city of Shahjahanabad and Lutyens' Bungalow Zone in New Delhi {{were cited}} in the bid. A team from UNESCO was scheduled to visit Delhi in September 2014 to validate its claims. INTACH acted as the <b>nodal</b> agency for the bid. The announcement of accepted cities was {{to be made in}} June 2015. However, the Government of India withdrew its nomination on 21 May 2015.|$|E
5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the <b>nodal</b> distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If it is due to the extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|E

25|$|On 8 July 1680, Hooke {{observed}} the <b>nodal</b> patterns {{associated with the}} modes of vibration of glass plates. He ran a bow {{along the edge of}} a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the <b>nodal</b> patterns emerge. In acoustics, in 1681 he showed the Royal Society that musical tones could be generated from spinning brass cogs cut with teeth in particular proportions.|$|E

25|$|Kathmandu Municipal Corporation, {{abbreviated}} KMC, is {{the chief}} <b>nodal</b> agency for the administration of Kathmandu. The Municipality of Kathmandu was upgraded to incorporated in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Many {{established}} markets do not employ <b>nodal</b> pricing, examples {{being the}} UK, EPEX SPOT (most European countries), and Nord Pool Spot (Nordic and Baltic countries).|$|E
25|$|More general spherical {{harmonics}} of degree ℓ {{are not necessarily}} those of the Laplace basis , and their <b>nodal</b> sets can be of a fairly general kind.|$|E
25|$|The {{elements}} are interconnected {{only at the}} exterior nodes, and altogether they should cover the entire domain as accurately as possible. Nodes will have <b>nodal</b> (vector) displacements or degrees of freedom which may include translations, rotations, and for special applications, higher order derivatives of displacements. When the nodes displace, they will drag the elements along in a certain manner dictated by the element formulation. In other words, displacements of any points in the element will be interpolated from the <b>nodal</b> displacements, {{and this is the}} main reason for the approximate nature of the solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} a central bus station (CAXA) which is a <b>nodal</b> point for many bus {{companies}} operating in the area, including AU, ADO, ADO-GL, OCC, Auto-Tour and Buses Sierra-Texcoco.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nodal</b> binds to activin A {{receptor}}, type IIB ACVR2B. It {{can then}} either form a receptor complex with activin A receptor, type IB (ACVR1B) or with activin A receptor, type IC (ACVR1C).|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus's long draconitic lunar period (5458 months = 5923 lunar <b>nodal</b> periods) {{also appears}} {{a few times}} in Babylonian records. But the only such tablet {{explicitly}} dated is post-Hipparchus so the direction of transmission is not settled by the tablets.|$|E
25|$|The park, {{along with}} the Chennai Snake Park, Madras Crocodile Bank and the Mysore Zoo, is slated to become a <b>nodal</b> point for captive {{breeding}} of endangered pythons in the country, especially the Indian rock python (Python molurus) and reticulated python (Python reticulatus).|$|E
25|$|The {{properties}} of the <b>nodal</b> membrane largely determine the axon's strength-duration properties, and these will change with changes in membrane potential, with temperature, and with demyelination as the exposed membrane is effectively enlarged by the inclusion of paranodal and intermodal membrane. Thus, the strength-duration time constant {{is a reflection of}} persistent Na+ channel function, and is furthermore influenced by membrane potential and passive membrane properties. As such, many aspects of nerve excitability testing depend on sodium channel functions: namely, the strength-duration time constant, the recovery cycle, the stimulus-response curve, and the current-threshold relationship. Measuring responses in nerve that are related to <b>nodal</b> function (including strength-duration time constant and rheobase) and internodal function has allowed insight into normal axon physiology as well as normal fluctuations of electrolyte concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The CrocBank, {{along with}} the Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Chennai Snake Park and the Mysore Zoo, is slated to become a <b>nodal</b> point for captive {{breeding}} of endangered pythons in the country, especially the Indian rock python (Python molurus) and reticulated python (Python reticulatus).|$|E
25|$|Both primary {{generalized}} <b>nodal</b> osteoarthritis and erosive osteoarthritis (EOA, {{also called}} inflammatory osteoarthritis) are sub-sets of primary osteoarthritis. EOA {{is a much}} less common, and more aggressive inflammatory form of osteoarthritis which often affects the distal interphalangeal joints of the hand and has characteristic articular erosive changes on x-ray.|$|E
25|$|This {{discussion}} {{thus far}} has assumed a symmetrical lens for which the entrance and exit pupils coincide with the object and image <b>nodal</b> planes, and for which the pupil magnification is unity. Although this assumption usually is reasonable for large-format lenses, it often is invalid for medium- and small-format lenses.|$|E
25|$|Machado {{was born}} in the central Province of Las Villas (now Villa Clara). He had two younger siblings, a brother Carlos and a sister Consuelo. He married Elvira Machado <b>Nodal</b> (28 October 1868 in Villa Clara – 1968) and they had three daughters: Laudelina (Nena), Ángela Elvira and Berta.|$|E
25|$|Industry {{is mostly}} found in Telford, Oswestry, Whitchurch, Market Drayton and Shrewsbury, though small {{industrial}} estates {{can be found}} in most of the market towns as well as former airfields in rural areas. Shrewsbury is becoming a centre for distribution and warehousing, as it is located on a <b>nodal</b> point of the regional road network.|$|E
25|$|Baart et al. (2012) {{show that}} it is {{important}} to account for the effect of the 18.6-year lunar <b>nodal</b> cycle before acceleration in sea level rise should be concluded. Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global average sea level rise during the 20th century lies in the range 0.8 to 3.3mm/yr, with an average rate of 1.8mm/yr.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, 2014, the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet had {{approved}} the proposed Metro Rail projects in Meerut, to boost urban mass transport infrastructure in Meerut.The state government has nominated RITES Limited and Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation (LMRC) for preparing the respective detailed project report (DPR) and as coordinator, respectively. The development authorities would be <b>nodal</b> agencies for DPR.|$|E
25|$|The {{discussion}} {{thus far}} has assumed a symmetrical lens for which the entrance and exit pupils coincide with {{the front and rear}} <b>nodal</b> planes, and for which the pupil magnification (the ratio of exit pupil diameter to that of the entrance pupil) is unity. Although this assumption usually is reasonable for large-format lenses, it often is invalid for medium- and small-format lenses.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{related to}} the {{creation}} of vortices in BECs is the generation of so-called dark solitons in one-dimensional BECs. These topological objects feature a phase gradient across their <b>nodal</b> plane, which stabilizes their shape even in propagation and interaction. Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximity}} to Paradip Port comes {{as an added}} advantage. OSL Group, {{one of the leading}} stevedore firms of the country is headquartered in Cuttack. Cuttack, being the largest business hub of the state is the <b>nodal</b> point of trade and transport. It also has the largest wholesale commodities market of the state at Malgodown and Chhatra Bazaar catering the whole state.|$|E
25|$|Rural Electrification Corporation of India, a Government of India {{enterprise}} {{will be the}} <b>nodal</b> agency at Central Government {{level to}} implement the programme for achieving the goal set by National Common Minimum Programme of giving access to electricity to all the households in next five years. Its role is being suitably enlarged to ensure timely implementation of rural electrification projects.|$|E
25|$|To give an example, in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, {{the moment}} tensor {{solution}} gives two <b>nodal</b> planes, one dipping northeast at 6 degrees and one dipping southwest at 84 degrees. In {{this case the}} earthquake can be confidently associated with the plane dipping shallowly to the northeast, as this is {{the orientation of the}} subducting slab as defined by historical earthquake locations and plate tectonic models.|$|E
25|$|The final {{management}} plan {{will depend on}} the site, stage (tumour size, <b>nodal</b> spread, distant metastasis), and histological type. The overall health and wishes of the patient must also be taken into account. A prognostic multigene classifier {{has been shown to be}} potentially useful for the distinction of laryngeal cancer of low or high risk of recurrence and might influence the treatment choice in future.|$|E
25|$|Chhattisgarh's {{total exports}} were US$353.3million in 2009–10. Nearly 75% of exports comes from Bhilai and the {{remaining}} from Urla, Bhanpuri and Sirgitti. The major exports products include steel, handicrafts, handlooms, blended yarn, food and agri-products, iron, aluminium, cement, minerals and engineering products. CSIDC (Chhattisgarh State Industrial Development Corporation Limited) is the <b>nodal</b> agency of the Government of Chhattisgarh for export promotion in the state.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from having}} a flat, <b>nodal</b> skull, the most {{prominent}} feature of Dracorex is the pair of huge and unrestricted superior temporal openings. The supratemporal fenestrae are much larger front-to-back and side-to-side than in Homalocephale, and larger than in Goyocephale. Only a fragmentary Wannanosaurus skull shows fenestrae as large as those of Dracorex. This fenestral architecture has been seen in ancient archosaurs, but not in other pachycephalosaurs.|$|E
