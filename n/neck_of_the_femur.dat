25|$|Nonunion, {{failure of}} the {{fracture}} to heal, is common in fractures of the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur,</b> but much more rare {{with other types of}} hip fracture. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head occurs frequently (20%) in intracapsular hip fractures, because the blood supply is interrupted.|$|E
25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the femur results in compressive stress. Bending load at the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> causes tensile stress along {{the upper part of}} the neck and compressive stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as we age, these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Background: The sliding screw-plate {{devices and}} cephalo-medullary nail devices have {{performed}} well in stable inter-trochanteric fractures {{in patients with}} reasonably good quality of bone. However, their suboptimal performance in comminuted fractures in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> osteoporotic bone has prompted many surgeons to consider bipolar hemiarthroplasty as <b>the</b> primary modality <b>of</b> management of comminuted inter-trochanteric fractures in elderly patients. However, long term stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hemiarthroplasty implant also may be compromised due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> postero-medial bone loss at <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calcar. Materials and Methods: We have presented a simple and effective technique of calcar grafting by harvesting cortical bone strut from <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fractured <b>femur.</b> A total of 34 patients with inter-trochanteric fractures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> were treated with calcar grafting. The mean age was 79. 2 years. The graft was harvested from <b>the</b> calcar region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and <b>neck</b> fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> and wedged between the medial femoral cortex and medial edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosthesis. The mean followup period was 54. 5 months. Results: In 32 of 34 (94 %) patients in our series, the calcar graft healed well without dislodgement. There was graft resorption in two patients associated with subsidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implant and loosening. Conclusion: Calcar grafting using this technique provides stability to the implant in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> comminution and incorporates well in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> patients.

25|$|Hemiarthroplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure which replaces {{one half of}} the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a subcapital (just below the head) fracture of the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because {{with the passage of time}} the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the acetabulum.|$|E
2500|$|The three extracapsular ligaments {{of the hip}} joint— the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral, and pubofemoral ligaments— form a {{twisting}} mechanism encircling the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur.</b> [...] When sitting, {{with the}} hip joint flexed, these ligaments become lax permitting {{a high degree of}} mobility in the joint. [...] When standing, with the hip joint extended, the ligaments get twisted around the femoral neck, pushing the head of the femur firmly into the Acetabulum, thus stabilizing the joint.|$|E
2500|$|Hip pain {{is usually}} {{seen by the}} age of 6 to 8 months. [...] The disease is {{bilateral}} in 12 to 16% of cases.

2500|$|Early hip {{dysplasia}} {{can often be}} treated using a Pavlik harness (see photograph) or the Frejka pillow/splint {{in the first year}} of life with usually normal results.

[...] Cases of Femoral Nerve Palsy and Avascular Necrosis of the femoral head have been reported with the use of the Pavlik harness, but whether these cases were due to improper application of the device or a complication encountered in the course of the disorder remains unresolved. Complications arise mainly because the sheet of the iliopsoas muscle pushes circumflex artery against the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>femur</b> and decreases blood flow to the femoral head, so the Frejka pillow is not indicated in all the forms of the developmental dysplasia of the hip.|$|E

40|$|Background: The bipolar hip {{prostheses}} {{after some}} time functions as a unipolar device. There {{is a need to}} change <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> bipolar hip prostheses to make it function as a bipolar device over a prolonged period of time.

Materials and Methods: Fifty two cases were operarted with the Bicentric bipolar prosthesis for indications like fracture <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> femur and various other diseases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip and were followed up with serial radiographs at periodic intervals to evaluate, what fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total abduction at the hip was occurring at the interprosthetic joint. Results: In cases <b>of</b> intracapsular fracture <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>femur,</b> <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> total abduction occurring at the interprosthetic joint at 3 months follow-up was 33. 74 % (mean value <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> patients), which fell to 25. 66 % at 1. 5 years.
