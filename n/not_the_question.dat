5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed {{that there was no}} increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40. Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E
25|$|In the July 2 Cases, the Court's {{goal was}} to provide {{guidance}} to states {{in the wake of}} Furman. In Furman only one basic idea could command a majority vote of the Justices: capital punishment, as then practiced in the United States, was cruel and unusual punishment because there were no rational standards that determined when it was imposed and when it was <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> the Court resolved in these cases was not whether the death sentence imposed on each of the individual defendants was cruel, but rather whether the process by which those sentences were imposed was rational and objectively reviewable.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Braeden {{experienced}} multiple contract negotiation issues, {{leading to}} former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) {{out of the}} series. Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts {{in the middle of}} already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> is, when do you squeeze too much?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lossky {{insisted that}} {{any notion of}} a double {{procession}} of the Holy Spirit from both the Father and the Son was incompatible with Orthodox theology. For Lossky, this incompatibility was so fundamental that [...] "whether {{we like it or}} <b>not,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the procession of the Holy Spirit has been the sole dogmatic grounds of the separation of East and West". Orthodox scholars who share Lossky's view include Dumitru Stăniloae, Romanides, Christos Yannaras, and Michael Pomazansky. Sergei Bulgakov, however, was of the opinion that the Filioque did not represent an insurmountable obstacle to reunion of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches.|$|E
2500|$|His {{resignation}} in February 1938 {{was largely}} attributed to growing dissatisfaction with Chamberlain's policy of appeasement. That is, however, disputed by new research; it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> if {{there should be}} negotiations with Italy, but only when they should start and how far they should be carried. Similarly, he at no point registered his dissatisfaction with the appeasement policy directed towards Nazi Germany in his period as Foreign Secretary. He became a Conservative dissenter leading a group that conservative whip David Margesson called the [...] "Glamour Boys,", and a leading anti-appeaser like Winston Churchill, who led a similar group, called [...] "The Old Guard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern Orthodox {{theological}} {{scholarship is}} split, according to William La Due, between {{a group of}} scholars that hold to a [...] "strict traditionalism going back to Photius" [...] and other scholars [...] "not so adamantly opposed to the filioque".

For Lossky, this incompatibility was so fundamental that, [...] "whether {{we like it or}} <b>not,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the procession of the Holy Spirit has been the sole dogmatic grounds of the separation of East and West".
