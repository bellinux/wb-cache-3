The software is written in 8086 assembly language. The <b>numeric</b> <b>processor</b> 8087 is invoked to do accurate floating point calculations. The look up tables for extinction values is thus completely avoided. The module can be called from another assembly language module.

5000|$|The <b>numeric</b> <b>processor</b> used a 256 bit-wide {{instruction}} word with seven [...] "fields". In {{most cases the}} compiler would find instructions that could run in parallel and place them together in a single word. It also had a special mode where each of the operations could be executed sequentially. It implemented register rotation to aid in software pipelining of loops. There was an instruction cache only, since {{it was felt that}} a data cache would be inefficient on sparse array operations.|$|R

The multichip module (MCM) input/output pin density in z 990 <b>processor</b> <b>units</b> {{is more than twice}} that of the MCMs in z 900 <b>processor</b> <b>units.</b> This increase in packaging density and the consequent tripling of the current drawn by the <b>processor</b> <b>units</b> were accommodated by the first-time use of land grid array (LGA) MCM-to-board interconnections in an IBM zSeries � eServer. This was done by using innovative refrigeration cooling of the MCM with air cooling as backup, and by a new mechanical packaging and power distribution scheme. This paper describes the mechanical engineering of the CEC cage, the LGA MCMto-board interconnection scheme, and the mechanical isolation of the MCM evaporator–heat-sink mass from the LGA contacts. The paper also describes the electrical power and the cooling solutions implemented to meet the more demanding requirements of the denser CEC package...|$|R

50|$|Early x86 {{processors}} {{could be}} extended with floating-point hardware {{in the form}} of a series of floating point numerical co-processors with names like 8087, 80287 and 80387, abbreviated x87. This was also known as the NPX (<b>Numeric</b> <b>Processor</b> eXtension), an apt name since the coprocessors, while used mainly for floating-point calculations, also performed integer operations on both binary and decimal formats. With very few exceptions, the 80486 and subsequent x86 processors then integrated this x87 functionality on chip which made the x87 instructions a de facto integral part of the x86 instruction set.|$|R
50|$|To {{improve its}} {{commercial}} viability, TMC launched the CM-2 in 1987, adding Weitek 3132 floating point numeric coprocessors and more RAM to the system.

Two later variants of the CM-2 were also produced, the smaller CM-2a with either 4096 or 8192 single-bit processors, and the faster CM-200.|$|R
