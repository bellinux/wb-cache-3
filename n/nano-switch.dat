In this paper, Gurtin-Murdoch surface theory incorporating with strain gradient elasticity is employed to study the pull-in instability of narrow-width beam-type <b>nano-switch</b> with small width to height ratio. The model accounts for the force corrections, i. e. the impact of finite dimensions on the fringing field, Casimir attraction and van der Waals force. Furthermore, a modified gas damping model has been incorporated in the governing equation. The nonlinear governing equation was solved using analytical Rayleigh-Ritz method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} static and dynamic {{responses}} of a nano-beam {{subjected to the}} electrostatic force have been studied. For this purpose, the governing nonlinear equations for static and dynamic behavior of a nano-beam have been obtained. Due to the nonlinearity of electrostatic, van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir forces, the governing differential equation for static analysis has been linearized using step by step linearization method (SSLM) and the developed linearized equation has been discretized using Galerkin weighted residual method. Dynamic responses have also been studied using linearized form of the Galerkin based reduced order model. In this model, nonlinear force terms have been taken into account using an iteration procedure. Using this model, dynamic response of a <b>nano-switch</b> to a stepwise DC voltage excitation at the presence of Casimir and vdW forces has also been studied. The {{results show that the}} Casimir force for some orders of geometric properties has more effect on the static pull-in voltage than the vdW force; and therefore the effect of the vdW force, in some cases can be ignored. The results also show that un-damped dynamic pull-in voltage at the presence of Casimir and vdW forces is 89 % of the static pull-in voltage, whereas, this ratio rises to 90. 8 % when the effect of these forces has been ignored. By considering damping effects, pull-in voltage increases up to a definite value of DC voltage. At this level, the nano beam tends to be critically damped and the dynamic pull-in voltage approaches the static pull-in voltage limit...|$|E

Nanofabrication, and in particular 3 -D nanostructure fabrication, has been intensively studied for the creation of novel devices, the scaling of existing systems, and the improvement in utilities and reliabilities. However, {{there are quite a few}} challenges in nanofabrication, such as the spontaneous attractions among nanostructures. Spontaneous attractions have often caused adhesion or stiction that affects a wide range of nanoscale devices, particularly nano/microelectromechanical systems. Previous explorations of the attraction mechanisms have suggested a wide range of origins but none of them is universally applicable to most nanostructures. Here a simple capacitive force model based on the nanoscale electrostatic interaction is proposed to quantitatively study this universally observed phenomenon. Our model is experimentally verified using arrays of vertical silicon nanowire pairs with varied spacing, diameter, and size differences. This work illustrates a new understanding of spontaneous attraction that will impact the design, fabrication and reliable operation of nanoscale devices and systems. By taking advantage of the nanoscale electrostatic attraction, low voltage nano-electro-mechanical (NEM) switches are built with innovative grayscale electron-beam lithography. The main benefit of this new fabrication technique is that the essential air gaps for movable components (nano-cantilevers or nano-beams) can be generated in a straightforward one-step lithography process, without any growth or etching to traditional sacrificial layers such as dielectrics. The structural dimensions of the <b>nano-switches,</b> as well as switch-on (pull-in) voltages are both readily controllable.

It has also been found that when both waveguides are far away from each other (or equivalently, the width of photonic crystal C is large), the energies of bound photons within the waveguides are degenerate. However, when the waveguides are brought close to each other, the degeneracy of the bound states is removed due to the coupling between them, which causes these states to split into symmetric and anti-symmetric pairs. We have also investigated the effect of the nonlinearity of photonic crystal C. By applying a pump laser, the photonic band gap of crystal C changes due to the Kerr effect [8]. This change in band structure effectively modifies the energy barrier separating the waveguides, which in turn changes the splitting energy of the coupler.

No alternatives or roadmap for solving these challenges has yet been identified. The recognition of this problem by the industry has led to a demand on the development of alternative technologies such as mechanical relays. ^ This work describes the design, fabrication and testing of dual-beam mechanical relays for the development of logic elements that can be integrated with present day CMOS technology or, in the future, act as possible MOSFET replacement devices. The dual beam design is a stress-resilient design that helps in realizing <b>nano-switching</b> gaps. In addition, the introduction of a new actuation technique based on body-biasing enables achieving very low switching voltages (3 ̆c 1 V). By using body-biasing these mechanical relays are used to achieve basic and complex logic elements like inverter, NAND, NOR, XOR, OR, AND, Half-Adder, Latch, 2 - and 3 -Stage Inverters at low voltages. The presence of an air-gap in the switch, the high resonance frequency of the fabricated structures, and a metal to metal contact gives this technology the ability to achieve fast and abrupt switching with distinct on and off states (on/off current ratio 3 ̆e 10 orders of magnitude). All these features make the dual-beam mechanical relay capable of realizing computing systems that can operate with unprecedentedly low operating voltages in the order of tens of mVs. ^ Scaling relationships are presented to offer a projection of the ultimate energy savings that this technology will enable.

40|$|Graphene is a {{monolayer}} of graphite. The {{surge of}} interest in graphene, as epitomized by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010, is largely attributed to its exceptional properties. Ultra thin, mechanically tough, electrically conductive, and transparent graphene films promise to enable a wealth of possible applications ranging from thin-film solar cells, flexible displays, to biochemical sensing arrays. However, significant gaps remain to realize these potential applications, {{largely due to the}} difficulty of precisely controlling graphene properties. Graphene is intrinsically non-flat and tends to be randomly corrugated. The random graphene morphology can lead to unstable performance of graphene devices as the corrugating physics of graphene is closely tied to its electronic properties. Future success of graphene-based applications hinges upon precise control of the graphene morphology, a significant challenge largely unexplored so far. This dissertation aims to explore viable pathways to tailoring graphene morphology and leverage possible morphologic instability of graphene for novel nano-device applications. Inspired by recent experiments, we propose and benchmark a strategy to precisely control the graphene morphology via extrinsic regulation (e. g., substrate surface features, patterned nanowires and nanoparticles). A general energetic framework is delineated to quantitatively determine the extrinsically regulated graphene morphology through energy minimization. Such a framework is benchmarked by determining the graphene morphology regulated by various types and dimensions of nanoscale extrinsic scafffolds, including two dimensional herringbone and checkerboard corrugations on substrate surfaces and one dimensional substrate surface grooves and patterned nanowires. The results reveal a snap-through instability of the graphene morphology, that is, depending on interfacial bonding energy and substrate surface roughness, the graphene morphology exhibits a sharp transition between two distinct states: (1) closely conforming to the substrate surface and (2) remaining nearly flat on the substrate surface. This snap-through instability of graphene holds potential to enable graphene-based functional nano-devices (e. g., ultrasensitive <b>nano-switches).</b> Another type of morphologic instability of graphene is the spontaneous scrolling of graphene into a carbon nanoscroll (CNS). The spiral multilayer nanostructure of CNSs is topologically open and thus distinct from that of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The unique topological structure of CNSs can enable an array of novel applications, e. g., hydrogen storage, water channels and ultrafast nano-oscillators. However, the realization of CNS-based applications is hindered by the lack of reliable approach to fabricating high quality CNSs. We propose a simple physical approach to fabricating CNSs via CNT-initiated scrolling of graphene on a substrate. The successful formation of a CNS depends on the CNT diameter, the carbon-carbon interaction strength and the graphene-substrate interaction strength. We further demonstrate that the resulting CNS/CNT nanostructure can be used as an ultrafast axial nano-oscillator that operates at 10 s GHz. Such CNS-based nano-oscillators can be excited and driven by an external AC electric field, further illustrating their potential to enable nano-scale energy transduction, harnessing and storage...|$|R
