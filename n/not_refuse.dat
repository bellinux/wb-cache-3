5|$|There is some {{distance}} between legislation and its enforcement. The governmental attacks on recusancy were mostly upon the gentry. Few recusants were actually fined; the fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates; the persecution eased; priests came to recognise {{that they should}} <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> communion to occasional conformists. The persecutions did not extinguish the faith, but they tested it sorely. The huge number of Roman Catholics in East Anglia and the North in the 1560s disappeared into the general population in part because recusant priests largely served the great Roman Catholic houses, which alone could hide them. Without the Mass and pastoral care, yeomen, artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism. Roman Catholicism, supported by foreign or expatriate priests, {{came to be seen}} as treasonous.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's health {{problems}} {{kept him from}} military service. In 1939, he met actor Pierre Fresnay, who was already an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay's only directorial feature Le Duel, {{as well as two}} plays for him: On prend les mêmes, which was performed in December 1940, and Comédie en trois actes, which was performed in 1942. Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf, who declined to purchase them. After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation of France during World War II, the German-operated film production company Continental Films was established in France in October 1940. Alfred Grevin, the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas-André Steeman. Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> Grevin's offer. Clouzot's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman's mystery novel Six hommes mort (Six Dead Men). Clouzot retitled the film Le Dernier des six, having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.|$|E
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E

50|$|Another {{theme of}} the novel, though not {{unrelated}} to the first, is 'the issue of resistance versus collaboration'. Beauvoir {{seems to be saying}} that to not actively resist the German occupation is in effect to accept it. This, argues David E. Cooper, is an illustration of an existentialist view of the nature of freedom, according to which an individual is just as responsible for <b>not</b> <b>refusing</b> something as for choosing it. Any distinction between choosing and <b>not</b> <b>refusing</b> is elided.|$|R

25|$|Religious {{educational}} institutions may {{in many cases}} discriminate based on sexual orientation against students and staff according to religious doctrine.

25|$|Flagging a taxi down {{is fairly}} easy {{throughout}} most city neighborhoods, but {{can often be}} more difficult in areas where there is low demand for cabs.

25|$|In commerce, {{payment in}} kind was still common, though {{contracts}} usually stipulated cash, naming the currency expected—that of Babylon, Larsa, Assyria, Carchemish, etc. The Code stipulated, however, that a debtor {{must be allowed to}} pay in produce according to a statutory scale. If a debtor had neither money nor crops, the creditor must <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> goods.|$|E

25|$|The {{daughter}} {{was not only}} in her father's power to be given in marriage, but he might dedicate her {{to the service of}} a god as a vestal or a hierodule or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> her wish.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of basic {{amenities}} and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil. They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.|$|E
25|$|Even in regiments {{in which}} there was direct confrontation, such as the 74th Infantry Regiment, the men did not harm their {{officers}} but simply refused to return to the trenches. Most mutineers were veterans who did <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> to fight but wanted the military authorities to be more attentive to the realities of modern war. The soldiers had come to believe that the attacks they were ordered to make were futile. Moreover, news on the February Revolution in Russia was being published in French socialist newspapers, and anonymous pacifist propaganda leaflets were very widely distributed.|$|E

25|$|Every city (without exception) had a Council and a Bench, the Council {{being the}} {{administrative}} branch and the Bench the judicial branch. A new Council {{was chosen by}} the old one whose term had expired. The Council was responsible for administration, law, privileges, security, finances, guild oversight, and the like. The Council chose the Mayor, and its members' decision was final—even the Starosta or Voivode could only listen to the Mayor's swearing-in and could <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> to give him his seal. The Council met daily in the larger cities, less often in smaller ones.|$|E
25|$|A {{maximum of}} four {{passengers}} may be carried in most cabs, although larger minivans may accommodate five passengers, and one child under seven {{can sit on}} an adult’s lap {{in the back seat}} if the maximum has been reached. Drivers are required to pick up the first or closest passenger they see, and may <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> a trip to a destination anywhere within the five boroughs, neighboring Westchester or Nassau, or Newark Liberty International Airport. The TLC undertakes undercover operations to ensure cabbies do not engage in racial profiling or otherwise discriminate against passengers hailing cabs.|$|E
25|$|According to Hyang Eum Ju Rye (향음주례; 鄕飮酒禮), the {{drinking}} etiquette established in Choseon Dynasty, it is impolite for a {{king and his}} vassal, a father and his son, or a teacher and his student to drink face to face. Also, a guest should <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> the first drink offered by host, and in the most formal situations, the diner should politely refuse twice a drink offered by the eldest male or a host. When the host offers for the third time, then finally the guest can receive it. If the guest refuses three times, drink {{is not to be}} offered any more.|$|E

25|$|The CP did <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> {{to put up}} a fight when {{it broke}} with Hillman and the ACW leadership. The {{struggle}} was most acute in outlying areas, such as Montreal, Toronto and Rochester, where the CP and its Canadian counterpart were strongly entrenched. In New York City the fight was often physical, as Hillman brought in , a prominent member of the Socialist Party with close ties to The Forward, to use strongarm tactics on communist opponents within the union. By the end of the decade, the CP was no longer a significant force in the union.|$|E
25|$|Section 11 of the Arbitration Act 1950 {{said that}} any {{reference}} to a dispute {{should be made to}} an official referee, and that the referee could <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> this request. Section 99 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 amends this and changes the language to be permissive rather than mandatory—a referee must consult the Lord Chief Justice before he is allowed to take part. This section of the Act also allows the referee to claim fees, and the control over outside arbitrators previously held by the High Court is moved to the Court of Appeal.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the Mexican War, Generals Taylor and Scott emerged as strong Whig candidates, {{alongside}} anti-war Senator Thomas Corwin and longtime party leader Henry Clay. As the war continued, Taylor's stature with the public grew, and he announced in 1847 that he would <b>not</b> <b>refuse</b> the presidency. The 1848 Whig National Convention took place on June 8, with Taylor, Clay, Scott, and Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster emerging as the major candidates. Taylor narrowly led Clay after the first ballot, but Taylor steadily grew his support until he captured the nomination on the fourth ballot. Clay bemoaned the selection of Taylor, as the ideologically ambiguous Taylor had not articulated his preferred policies. The Whigs chose former Congressman Millard Fillmore of New York as Taylor's running mate.|$|E
