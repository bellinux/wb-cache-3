50|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, {{the emergence of}} alternative medicine, if not the term itself, is typically dated to the 19th century. This is {{despite the fact that}} there are variants of Western <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> that arose in the late-eighteenth century or earlier and some non-Western medical traditions, currently considered alternative in the West and elsewhere, which boast extended historical pedigrees. Alternative medical systems, however, can only be said to exist when there is an identifiable, regularized and authoritative standard medical practice, such as arose in the West during the nineteenth century, to which they can function as an alternative.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{alternative}} medical systems which developed {{during this period}} can be approximately categorised according to the form of treatment advocated. These were: those employing spiritual or psychological therapies, such as hypnosis (mesmerism); nutritional therapies based upon special diets, such as medical botanism; drug and biological therapies such as homeopathy and hydrotherapy; and, manipulative physical therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic massage. <b>Non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> might define health in terms of concepts of balance and harmony or espouse vitalistic doctrines of the body. Illness could be understood as due to the accretion of bodily toxins and impurities, to result from magical, spiritual, or supernatural causes, or as arising from energy blockages in the body such that healing actions might constitute energy transfer from practitioner to patient.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview on the regulations of Chinese medicinal materials (CMMs) in various countries and regions. Harmonization of CMM monographs would provide standards for the quality control of CMM products and {{play an important role}} in the modernization and globalization of Chinese medicine. A harmonized regulatory system would improve the quality of CMMs thereby ensuring the safety of the products and assisting Chinese medicine practitioners in their practice. The fast growing demand worldwide for traditional medicines calls for harmonized monographic standards to safeguard the safety and quality of CMM products. Background Seventy to eighty percent of the world population relies on <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> (mainly of herbal sources) as their primary health care [1]. Chinese medici-nal materials (CMMs) have the highest turnover-trading-figure among all herbal medicines [1]. At present there is a lack of methodology for the qualit...|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{drugs are}} more and more used both in human and {{veterinary}} medicine to mitigate and prevent minor diseases and to support conventional medicine using allopathic drugs. Nevertheless, ‘natural product’ does not mean lack of adverse effects, and many people and veterinarians do not know enough about the adverse reactions that can occur following the administration of such drugs in domestic animals. Moreover, herbal products can interact with each other when administered concomitantly or can agonize or antagonize the effects of synthetic drugs administered as primary therapy. The use of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> (NCM) should be considered as a veterinary practise. In this paper, the herbal drugs most utilized in domestic animals, both pets and large animals, are reviewed, as their use is increasing, despite the prejudices of the academic world and some of the adverse effects and interactions that can occur in domestic animals...|$|R
5000|$|Medicinal plant {{conservation}} strategies need to {{be understood}} and planned for based on an understanding of indigenous knowledge and practices. Many drugs contain herbal ingredients, {{and it has been}} said that 70-80% of the world's population relies on some form of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> and around 25-40% of all prescription drugs contain active ingredients derived from plants in the United States alone. Many countries rely on these medicinal plants for the health and well being of its population, but the market demand has led to an increased pressure on the natural resources that lend to the production of some of these plants. The most serious proximate threats when extracting medicinal plants generally are habitat loss, habitat degradation, and over harvesting. Developing markets for natural products, particularly those that are harvested from the wild, can trigger a demand that cannot be met by available or legal supplies and demands a conservation initiative [...] so the local populations are not exploited, causing more damage to their resources. Many times populations are taken advantage of for their resources and knowledge, which can often be for financial gain. Conservation of medicinal plants in its biocultural perspective not only implies conservation of biodiversity but also places an equal emphasis on conservation of cultural diversity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{alternative}} medicine is problematic as it cannot exist autonomously {{as an object}} of study in its own right but must always be defined in relation to a non-static and transient medical orthodoxy. It also divides medicine into two realms, a medical mainstream and fringe, which, in privileging orthodoxy, presents difficulties in constructing an historical analysis independent of the often biased and polemical views of regular medical practitioners. The description of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> as alternative reinforces both its marginality and the centrality of official medicine. Although more neutral than either pejorative or promotional designations such as “quackery” or “natural medicine”, cognate terms like “unconventional”, “heterodox”, “unofficial”, “irregular”, [...] "folk", [...] "popular", [...] "marginal", “complementary”, “integrative” or “unorthodox” define their object against the standard of conventional biomedicine, entail particular perspectives and judgements, often carry moral overtones, and can be inaccurate. Conventional medical practitioners in the West have, since the nineteenth century, used some of these and similar terms as a means of defining the boundary of [...] "legitimate" [...] medicine, marking the division between that which is scientific and that which is not. The definition of mainstream medicine, generally understood to refer to a system of licensed medicine which enjoys state and legal protection in a jurisdiction, is also highly specific to time and place. In countries such as India and China traditional systems of medicine, in conjunction with Western biomedical science, may be considered conventional and mainstream. The shifting nature of these terms is underlined by recent efforts to demarcate between alternative treatments on the basis of efficacy and safety and to amalgamate those therapies with scientifically adjudged value into complementary medicine as a pluralistic adjunct to conventional practice. This would introduce a new line of division based upon medical validity.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{monitoring}} attitudes of general practitioners in Southern Bohemia toward <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine.</b> In its theoretical part, the thesis deals with clarifying {{the concepts of}} <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine,</b> alternative medicine, and scientific medicine. Furthermore, the thesis describes various approaches to <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine.</b> In its practical part I examined the level of knowledge about <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> among doctors. The research was conducted through anonymous questionnaires filled in by general practitioners. The questionnaires were then used for creating the charts. These charts indicate how doctors view various approaches to <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine,</b> to what extent they support using these methods among their patience, and how they view the quality of medical education in this area in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|Objective To test a {{methodology}} to evaluate, at population level, {{the effectiveness of}} homeopathic treatment through standard objective public health indicators. Methods and settings Indicators of hospitalization and drug use {{were obtained from the}} Health Statistical Documentation System of Tuscany for two homeopathic centers in the Local Health Authority of Pisa, Italy. We compared homeopathic users with the general population in the same area and by comparing patients before and after homeopathic treatment. Results The homeopathic patients used less drugs than the reference population, this effect was more evident for patients with repeated homeopathic consultations. A significant decrease in drug use was found on comparing the same patients before and after homeopathic treatment. Hospitalization indicators tended to favour patients who had received homeopathic treatment but were not always statistically significant. Conclusions This paper demonstrates a new methodological approach to assess the effectiveness of a therapeutic modality, without ad-hoc clinical trials. This methodology can be used by public health institutions in which <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> are integrated into the public health care system...|$|R
40|$|The current lack of {{scientific}} validation of <b>non-conventional</b> treatments in <b>medicine,</b> whose epistemological foundations lie in scientific evidence and experimentation, raises a significant {{questions regarding the}} costs and benefits of alternative-treatment forms. Nonetheless, in the last few decades non-conventional treatments have been increasingly recognised by the Italian medical profession, with one regional healthcare administration adopting some non-conventional practices as part of its conventional healthcare services. Aims: The Authors aim to analyse <b>non-conventional</b> treatments in <b>medicine</b> from an epistemological, cultural, ethical, political and economic point of view, in order to highlight criticalities and incongruities, especially when these treatments are approved by a public healthcare system, which should be grounded on the “evidence-based medicine” principle. Conclusions: <b>Non-conventional</b> treatments in <b>medicine</b> are constituted by meta-theories, i. e. philosophical, religious and ideological concepts that conflict with contemporary rational, empirical medicine. In the interest of patients and society, the paper stresses the incongruity of a healthcare system which, despite being grounded on the “evidence-based medicine” principle, allows the development of non conventional treatments. Having said that, medical science should address not only the biological domain of illness but also its existential implications. Awareness and respect for the individual experience can undoubtedly lead to a new medical model that allows for a more effective therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Little {{has been}} done to {{investigate}} and promote the importance of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> (NCMs) in the realization of the right to health, yet all over the world people regularly resort to NCMs to secure healing or to prevent or mitigate the occurrence {{of a wide range of}} morbidities. This study aims to elucidate the theoretical framework of the role of NCMs in realizing the right to health, to identify the potential manifestations and causes of violations of the right to health in their practice, and to propose the practice of NCMs that could be included in a Framework Convention on Global Health. We use both the documentary analysis and the violation of rights approaches. Through a non-directive review of the literature, we have tried to clarify the concepts and uniqueness of NCMs. We have also tried to unveil the challenges facing NCMs in a context where conventional medicines assume extensive power. The human rights approach has enabled us to bring to light the potential challenges to the rights of the various stakeholders that NCMs create. We argue that NCMs can contribute to realizing the right to health through their availability, accessibility, acceptability, and relative quality. The Framework Convention on Global Health could contribute to the effective realization of this right by integrating basic principles to ensure the recognition, protection, promotion, and conservation of NCMs—at least of those NCMs that have shown evidence of efficacy—as well as catalyzing increased international cooperation in this area...|$|R
40|$|Remedies used by rural farmers {{for their}} {{livestock}} production {{are divided into}} two; conventional medicine and also the <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine.</b> Both of these remedies are very important in livestock production and are used worldwide. Small-scale farmers use both conventional and <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> to treat livestock diseases, {{in order to improve}} livestock production. However, most of them are illiterate thus they cannot follow the procedures of drug administration properly, as much as they find conventional drugs to be expensive. Therefore most of resource-limited farmers use ethno-veterinary medicines as their alternative, because they find the remedies to be cheap, easy to access and the procedures are easy to follow when administering as compared to conventional medicine. The main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the factors that influence the use of remedies by small-scale livestock farmers. The study was conducted at Bozwana Village, Lady Frere at Eastern Cape, South Africa. The results showed that illiteracy has an effect in the appropriate use of conventional remedies, while employment status did not affect any types of remedies use. It showed that 65. 50 % of the Bozwana Village used conventional remedies to treat their livestock, while 48. 04 % solely use non-conventional remedies...|$|E
40|$|Decisions {{about whether}} or not to include non-conventional therapies in a cancer {{treatment}} regimen are potentially critical. An illness such as cancer, perceived to be life-threatening, inevitably raises existential questions which, in the present study, were posited to underlie the cognitive approach to treatment choice for cancer patients. The hypotheses tested in the study were that those who use <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> will be more knowledgeable and have a more positive belief system about cancer, will be more interested in and motivated about health matters, will desire more personal control and assume more responsibility for their health and its treatment, and will be more intrinsically oriented in terms of meaning in illness and life. It was further hypothesised that the differences between those who use only conventional treatments and those who include non-conventional treatments will become more marked as the boundary between the two is altered to incorporate more non-conventional treatments in the conventional category, suggesting that patients' perceptions of the distinction varies from the medical establishment's view. An important underlying objective of the study included the exploration of the conceptualisation of meaning in life and its events in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic orientations. 212 adult participants, all having been diagnosed with any form of cancer for at least three months, volunteered and completed a postal survey. Overall, the results indicated that the conceptualisation of meaning as intrinsically or extrinsically oriented was an appropriate basis for exploring the role of existential issues in treatment decision making. The combination of constructs in the study was also confirmed as appropriate. In terms of the specific hypotheses, the expectation that users of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> would be more knowledgeable and more positive in their beliefs about cancer was supported only when conventional treatment was deemed to include certain physical and natural types of treatment usually labelled as non-conventional. Users of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> were found to be more interested in and more motivated to be involved in health matters than those who used only conventional medicine. They were also found to be those who desired more personal control over their health and its treatment and were also prepared to assume more responsibility. The results also supported the hypothesised difference between conventional only and non-conventional users in terms of intrinsic life meaning, but results for extrinsic life meaning only partially supported the expectation that this would be associated with conventional medicine use. These were discussed in terms of measurement issues and the reconceptualisation of the religious, spiritual and philosophical derivations of extrinsic meaning. No difference was found between users of conventional only and users of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> in terms of illness meaning, suggesting that conceptualisation in intrinsic and extrinsic terms was inappropriate for this sub-construct. There was also support for the view that treatments are viewed by many as being on a continuum from conventional to non-conventional, rather than being in defined dichotomous groups. Multivariate results (from a series of 2 -group discriminant analyses) confirmed that health interest and motivation, attributions of control, responsibility and blame, and intrinsic and extrinsic meaning in life were the most important contributors to discrimination. Internal control attributions were consistently the most important relative discriminator. These results also showed that the influence of the discriminating variables in combination, including sociodemographic control variables, explained variances ranging from 25. 4 % to 33. 6 % across the altered groupings of treatment type. The results are discussed in relation to the conceptualisation of meaning and attributions of control and responsibility as pivotal concepts, and in relation to the indication that the greatest separation between conventional and non-conventional use was found when certain physical and natural treatments were classified as conventional rather than non-conventional. Psychometric, and conceptual limitations of the study are discussed, suggestions for future research are made, and some applications of the findings for health professionals are offered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In Italy the {{different}} regional healthcare models are structured, {{in order to}} provide both a single theoretical framework and to enable direct comparisons. In this paper we examine whether and how the regional healthcare systems include alternative medicines and, if so, whether this can be specifically attributed to {{the different}} organisa-tional models in place. This analysis will be preceded by a framework to show how in Italy there is a constant and continuous increase in <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> (NCM), determined from a research by citizens of a person-centred medicine and preventive. We shall examine how NCM has been incorporated in the National Health System (SSN) in Italy, from the time the Regional Health Systems were set up, and the factors that have contributed to their inclusion or exclusion. After a brief synopsis of the process of growth, distribution and recognition of NCM in Italy, we shall describe how it has been incorporated and consolidat-ed in the regional healthcare systems...|$|E
40|$|Tumor hypoxia is {{an adverse}} factor for {{chemotherapy}} and radiotherapy. Ozone therapy is a <b>non-conventional</b> form of <b>medicine</b> {{that has been}} used successfully in the treatment of ischemic disorders. This prospective study was designed to assess the effect of ozone therapy on tumor oxygenation. Eighteen subjects were recruited for the study. Systemic ozone therapy was administered by autohemotransfusion on three alternate days over one week. Tumor oxygenation levels were measured using polarographic needle probes before and after the first and the third ozone therapy session. Overall, no statistically significant change was observed in the tumor oxygenation in the 18 patients. However, a significant decrease was observed in hypoxic values ≤ 10 and ≤ 5 [*]mmHg of pO 2. When individually assessed, a significant and inverse non-linear correlation was observed between increase in oxygenation and the initial tumor pO 2 values at each measuring time-point, thus indicating that the more poorly-oxygenated tumors benefited most (rho = − 0. 725; P = 0. 001). Additionally, the effect of ozone therapy was found to be lower in patients with higher hemoglobin concentrations (rho = − 0. 531; P < 0. 034). Despite being administered over a very short period, ozone therapy improved oxygenation in the most hypoxic tumors. Ozone therapy as adjuvant in chemo-radiotherapy warrants further research...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> (NCM) {{has grown}} tremendously in {{popularity}} and economic importance. This paper explores a relatively unresearched phenomenon: patients' dissatisfaction with non-conventional medical treatment they have received. 16 out of 20 {{patients who had}} severed their contact with a large, hospital-adjacent multi-modality NCM clinic in Israel were interviewed. Two of these patients had severed {{their relationship with the}} clinic right after being referred to a certain practitioner and 18 did not keep their next appointment while in the process of treatment. The narratives through which participants understand and communicate their experience regarding dissatisfaction with NCM are organized around three main topics: independence versus paternalism, foreign versus familiar, and care versus cure. Findings illustrate the patients' views concerning the desirable doctor-patient relationship and their expectations of non-familiar treatments. Patients are characterized as "smart consumers" who place utmost importance on outcome and do not hesitate to discontinue treatment. Findings are further discussed in the context of domestication and the minimizing of cultural difference through the integration of NCM into a biomedical setting.

40|$|A World Health Organisation survey {{indicated}} that about 70 - 80 % {{of the world}} populations rely on <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> mainly of herbal sources in their primary healthcare. In recent years, we have witnessed the increasing growth in popularity of over-the-counter (OTC) health foods, nutraceuticals, and medicinal products from plants or other natural sources in developed countries. This indirectly indicates {{that the public is}} not satisfied with their orthodox medical (OM) treatment. Such increase in popularity has also brought concerns and fears over the professionalism of practitioners, and quality, efficacy and safety of their treatment methods and products from herbal and natural sources available in the market. Over the past decade several news-catching episodes in developed communities indicated adverse effects, sometimes life threatening, allegedly arisen consequential to taking of OTC herbal products or traditional medicines from various ethnic groups. These OTC products may be contaminated with excessive or banned pesticides, microbial contaminants, heavy metals, chemical toxins, and for adulterated with orthodox drugs. Excessive or banned pesticides, heavy metals and microbial contaminants {{may be related to the}} source of these herbal materials, if they are grown under contaminated environment or during collection of these plant materials. Chemical toxins may come from unfavourable or wrong storage conditions or chemical treatment due to storage. The presence of orthodox drugs can be related to unprofessional practice of manufacturers. Some of these environment related factors can be controlled by implementing standard operating procedures (SOP) leading to Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Supply Practice (GSP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for producing these medicinal products from herbal or natural sources. The public's belief that herbal and natural products are safer than synthetic medicines can only be ascertained by imposing regulatory standards on these products that should be manufactured using these Good Practices. Using Chinese medicines, as examples, this paper illustrate how advances in chemical and biomedical analysis would help to detect intentional and unintentional toxic contaminants in herbal substances. The paper also summarises how modernization and progress are being carried out to get the best out of Chinese medicines for public healthcare...|$|E

De therapie werd tegelijkertijd vanuit een wetenschappelijke, sociologische, juridische en organisatorische invalshoek bekeken, een Belgische primeur!ABREVIATIONS 3 [...] 1 INTRODUCTION 5 [...] 1. 1 BACKGROUND 5 [...] 1. 2 OBJECTIVES AND METHODS 6 [...] 1. 3 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 6 [...] 1. 3. 1 Definition of acupuncture 6 [...] 1. 3. 2 The Chinese {{origins of}} acupuncture 6 [...] 1. 3. 3 Importing acupuncture into Europe 8 [...] 1. 3. 4 Acupuncture between tradition and modernity 8 [...] 1. 3. 5 The origins of acupuncture in Belgium 9 [...] 2 EFFICACY AND ADVERSE EVENTS 10 [...] 2. 1 INTRODUCTION 10 [...] 2. 2 METHODS 10 [...] 2. 2. 1 Databases and search terms 10 [...] 2. 2. 2 Selection criteria 11 [...] 2. 2. 3 Quality assessment 11 [...] 2. 2. 4 Clinical relevance 11 [...] 2. 3 RESULTS 12 [...] 2. 3. 1 Selected reports and papers 12 [...] 2. 3. 2 Main findings on published effects 13 [...] 2. 3. 3 Discussion and conclusions 19 [...] 3 USE OF ACUPUNCTURE IN BELGIUM 21 [...] 3. 1 SURVEY AMONG THE POPULATION 21 [...] 3. 1. 1 Objective 21 [...] 3. 1. 2 Methods 21 [...] 3. 1. 3 The use of alternative medicines in general 22 [...] 3. 1. 4 Use of acupuncture 23 [...] 3. 2 INSURANCE COVERAGE 24 [...] 3. 2. 1 Objective 24 [...] 3. 2. 2 Methods 24 [...] 3. 2. 3 Results 24 [...] 3. 2. 4 Discussion 25 [...] 3. 2. 5 Conclusions 26 [...] 3. 3 SOCIOLOGICAL ASPECTS: USAGE AND PRACTICE OF ACUPUNCTURE IN BELGIUM [...] TODAY 26 [...] 3. 3. 1 Scope {{of this section}} 26 [...] 3. 3. 2 Material and methods 26 [...] 3. 3. 3 The experience of users 28 [...] 3. 3. 4 The practitioners 38 [...] 4 THE PRACTICE 46 [...] 4. 1 OBJECTIVE 46 [...] 4. 2 METHODS 46 [...] 4. 3 RESULTS 46 [...] 4. 3. 1 Response rate 46 [...] 4. 3. 2 Baseline characteristics 47 [...] 4. 3. 3 Training 47 [...] 4. 3. 4 Practice 48 [...] 4. 3. 5 Provider delay 50 [...] 4. 3. 6 Workload and profile of patients 50 [...] 4. 3. 7 Patient referral: 53 [...] 4. 3. 8 Complaints for use of acupuncture 54 [...] 4. 3. 9 Techniques used 55 [...] 4. 4 DISCUSSION 56 [...] 5 ORGANISATIONAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS 57 [...] 5. 1 BELGIAN AND EUROPEAN LEGAL FRAMEWORK 57 [...] 5. 1. 1 Introduction 57 [...] 5. 1. 2 Methodology 57 [...] 5. 1. 3 The exercise of conventional healthcare in Belgium {{under the terms of}} Royal Decree [...] no. 78 57 [...] 5. 1. 4 The exercise of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> in Belgium 59 [...] 5. 1. 5 The relationship between the Colla law and Royal Decree no. 78 66 [...] 5. 1. 6 The consequences of the (non-) conventional exercise of healthcare 68 [...] 5. 1. 7 The exercise of <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> in the European context 73 [...] 5. 1. 8 Conclusion concerning the Belgian and European legal framework 74 [...] 5. 2 THE SITUATION IN THE NETHERLANDS, FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM 75 [...] 5. 2. 1 Structure of the chapter 75 [...] 5. 2. 2 Netherlands 75 [...] 5. 2. 3 France 77 [...] 5. 2. 4 United Kingdom 79 [...] 5. 2. 5 Conclusion on the situation in the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom 81 [...] 5. 3 ACUPUNCTURE TRAINING 81 [...] 5. 3. 1 Objectives 81 [...] 5. 3. 2 Methods 82 [...] 5. 3. 3 Results 82 [...] 5. 3. 4 Discussion 84 [...] 5. 3. 5 Conclusion 86 [...] 5. 4 PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS 87 [...] 5. 4. 1 Objective 87 [...] 5. 4. 2 Methods 87 [...] 5. 4. 3 Results 87 [...] 5. 4. 4 Discussion 89 [...] 5. 4. 5 Conclusion 90 [...] 6 GENERAL SYNTHESIS AND DISCUSSION 91 [...] 6. 1 INTRODUCTION 91 [...] 6. 1. 1 Context 91 [...] 6. 1. 2 Objectives and methods 91 [...] 6. 1. 3 Limitations 92 [...] 6. 2 ACUPUNCTURE IN BELGIUM: USERS, PRACTITIONERS AND PRACTICES 92 [...] 6. 2. 1 Non-conventional medicines: an increasingly frequent use 92 [...] 6. 2. 2 Acupuncture in Belgium: general background 92 [...] 6. 2. 3 Who are the patients? 93 [...] 6. 2. 4 Who are the practitioners? 94 [...] 6. 2. 5 The pathway of the Patient 95 [...] 6. 3 IS ACUPUNCTURE CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE? 99 [...] 6. 3. 1 Evidence in the scientific literature 99 [...] 6. 3. 2 Patient point of view 100 [...] 6. 3. 3 Which risks? 100 [...] 6. 4 TRAINING 100 [...] 6. 5 LEGAL FRAMEWORK 101 [...] 6. 5. 1 Background 101 [...] 6. 5. 2 The Colla law 101 [...] 6. 5. 3 Consequences of partial execution of the Colla law 103 [...] 7 CONCLUSION 104 [...] 8 REFERENCES 10...|$|E
40|$|VII, 110 p. ill. Er is geen enkel wetenschappelijk bewijs dat homeopathie werkt. Toch wordt het veel gebruikt voor allerlei kwalen. De positieve ervaringen van de gebruikers kunnen te maken hebben met het placebo-effect, dus omdat patiënt en therapeut een effect verwachten. Tegelijk is er wel een risico dat men een noodzakelijke klassieke medische behandeling niet of te laat opstart, door een gemiste of verkeerde diagnose. Daarom wordt de uitoefening van homeopathie best beperkt tot artsen, die nu al de meerderheid van de homeopaten uitmaken. Dit concludeert het Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de gezondheidszorg (KCE) in zijn derde studie over de situatie van niet-conventionele therapieën in België. Eerder waren osteopathie en chiropraxie aan de beurt, en vervolgens acupunctuur.

40|$|Ayurveda, the {{traditional}} Indian medicine, is {{recognized by the}} European Union as <b>non-conventional</b> <b>medicine</b> and it includes more than 7000 plants used for therapeutic purposes in complex formulations poorly investigated under a chemical and biological point of view (Guerrini and Sacchetti, 2012). On these premises, preparations (decoction, DEC, and hydro-alcoholic extract, HE) of Boerhaavia diffusa L. (roots), Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy (whole plant) and Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. (roots) were studied {{for the first time}} through a chemical and bioactivity approach. GC-FID, GC-MS, HPLC and HPTLC, and NMR strategies were employed to identify and quantify the main chemical compounds and to verify the repeatability of their fingerprinting. The study of biological activities was driven both by the ethnomedical traditional uses of the species in the Ayurvedic culture (Agrawal et al., 2011; Bhowmik et al., 2012; Chauhan et al., 2010) and by those aspects related to modern western phytotherapic culture: antioxidant activity; genotoxic and anti-genotoxic potential; and cytotoxicity against cancer and normal human cell lines. Ferulic acid and vanillin were identified and quantified in DEC and in HE of B. diffusa. However, HE showed the presence of other two characterising molecules: boeravinone B and eupalitin. β-sitosterol was identified and quantified in both preparations, but resulted more abundant in DEC. Ferulic acid showed antioxidant activity by ABTS assay higher than positive control. Preparations and pure compounds did not show anti-genotoxic activity towards two compounds with mutagenic properties. The study of cytotoxicity using DEC, HE and pure molecules against human cancer cell lines (A 549, CaCo- 2, MCF 7, LoVo and HepG 2), showed once more data far from those stated by the American National Cancer Institute (Suffness and Pezzuto, 1991). DEC of Convolvulus pluricaulis was characterised by the presence of phenolic acids (caftaric acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, iso-ferulic acid and tr-ferulic acid). Stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, lupeol and vanillin isomers and derivatives (2 H 4 MB, 3 H 4 MB and acetovanillone) were also detected in the same preparation. HE showed the presence of p-coumaric acid, vanillin, 2 H 4 MB, acetovanillone, and vanillic acid, but the absence of phytosterols. The antioxidant activity evaluation indicated DEC as the preparation that exhibited always the best efficacy. HE showed instead an higher activity than DEC in the ABTS assay, no activity against DPPH radical and a lower capacity of blocking the radical propagation than DEC in the β-carotene bleaching test. Cytotoxic activity of the considered preparations against A 549, CaCo- 2, MCF 7, LoVo and HepG 2 cancer cell lines are not significant. The tests carried out with DEC and HE extracts against two leukaemia cell lines, drug-sensitive (CCRF-CEM) and multi-drug-resistant (CEM/ADR 5000), showed, instead, interesting results: DEC CHCl 3 extract and the HE soxhlet extract exhibit experimental data in line with the one stated by the American National Cancer Institute against the CCRF-CEM cell line, but respectively about 2 and 3 fold higher in the tests against CEM/ADR 5000, showing cross-resistance phenomena. Curculigoside A and orcinol-β-D-glucoside were identified and quantified through HPLC methods in C. orchioides, and chosen as characterising compounds of preparations. β-sitosterol was also identified and quantified using GC-FID. The HE samples showed the highest antioxidant activity in every performed test. Regarding the anti-genotoxic activity, DEC resulted slightly more active than HE, but the highest activity was showed by orcinol-β-D-glucoside, even if it did not reach the 50 % inhibition at the maximum concentration tested. The evaluation of the cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines exhibited an opposite trend, pointing out DEC as more active than HE for A 549, CaCo- 2, and HepG 2. HE was instead more active against CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR 5000, but with IC 50 data far from significant indication given by the American National Cancer Institute. Pure molecules did not exhibit any activity. However, further chemical and biological investigations will be carried out to shed an even more clear light on efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic preparations...|$|E
