40|$|The {{hereditary}} motor <b>neuronopathies</b> (HMN [MIM 158590]) are {{a heterogeneous}} group of disorders {{characterized by an}} exclusive involvement of the motor part of the peripheral nervous system. They are usually subdivided in proximal HMN, i. e., the classical spinal muscular atrophy syndromes and distal hereditary motor <b>neuronopathies</b> (distal HMN) that clinically resemble Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndromes. In this review, we concentrate on distal HMN. The distal HMN are clinically and genetically heterogeneous and were initially subdivided in seven subtypes according to mode of inheritance, age at onset, and clinical evolution. Recent {{studies have shown that}} these subtypes are still heterogeneous at the molecular genetic level and novel clinical and genetic entities have been delineated. Since the introduction of positional cloning, 13 chromosomal loci and seven disease-associated genes have been identified for autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, and X-linked recessive distal HMN. Most of the genes involved encode protein with housekeeping functions, such as RNA processing, translation synthesis, stress response, apoptosis, and others code for proteins involved in retrograde survival. Motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord seems to be vulnerable to defects in these housekeeping proteins, likely because their large axons have higher metabolic requirements for maintenance, transport over long distances and precise connectivity. Understanding the molecular pathomechanisms for mutations in these genes that are ubiquitous expressed will help unravel the neuronal mechanisms that underlie motor neuropathies leading to denervation of distal limb muscles, and might generate new insights for future therapeutic strategies. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Although JC virus {{infection}} is classically associated with white matter demyelination and PML pathogenesis, recent literature has identified viral variants as etiological agents of other novel syndromes. For example, JCV {{has been found}} to infect the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, while sparing purkinje fibers, ultimately causing severe cerebellar atrophy. [...] This syndrome, called JCV granule cell layer <b>neuronopathy</b> (JCV GCN), is characterized by a productive and lytic infection by a JC variant with a mutation in the VP1 coding region.|$|E

He {{and his colleagues}} have identified two novel clinical entities distinct from PML - JCV-granule cell <b>neuronopathy</b> and JCV-encephalopathy - that are caused by JCV deletion variants. He and his colleagues also demonstrated that JCV can infect meningeal and choroid plexus cells and cause JCV meningitis. They are studying the development of epilepsy in PML patients as well. Koralnik has also been studying the determinants of latency and reactivation of JCV in patients with MS who have been treated with natalizumab (Tysabri) or dimethylfumarate (Tecfidera).

5000|$|... "Polyneuropathy" [...] is {{a pattern}} of nerve damage that is quite {{different}} from mononeuropathy, often more serious and affecting more areas of the body. The term [...] "peripheral neuropathy" [...] sometimes is used loosely to refer to polyneuropathy. In cases of polyneuropathy, many nerve cells {{in various parts of the}} body are affected, without regard to the nerve through which they pass; not all nerve cells are affected in any particular case. In distal axonopathy, one common pattern is that the cell bodies of neurons remain intact, but the axons are affected in proportion to their length; the longest axons are the most affected. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of this pattern. In demyelinating polyneuropathies, the myelin sheath around axons is damaged, which affects the ability of the axons to conduct electrical impulses. The third and least common pattern affects the cell bodies of neurons directly. This usually picks out either the motor neurons (known as motor neuron disease) or the sensory neurons (known as sensory <b>neuronopathy</b> or dorsal root ganglionopathy).|$|E

The authors describe the clinical course of a 6 -year-old girl with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and a novel homozygous mutation c. 1156 T>C in the SLC 52 A 3 gene, who presented {{at the age of}} 2. 5 years with progressive brain stem dysfunction including ptosis, facial weakness, hearing loss, dysphagia, anarthria with bilateral vocal cord paralysis, and ataxic gait. She subsequently developed respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and worsening dysphagia necessitating a gastrostomy. Following riboflavin supplementation, resolution of facial diplegia and ataxia, improvements in ptosis, and bulbar function including vocalization and respiration were noted.

40|$|The neuromuscular {{junction}} (NMJ) is a specialized synapse with a complex molecular architecture that provides for reliable transmission between the nerve terminal and muscle fiber. Using linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples from subjects with distal hereditary motor neuropathy type VII, we identified a mutation in SLC 5 A 7, which encodes the presynaptic choline transporter (CHT), a critical determinant of synaptic acetylcholine synthesis and release at the NMJ. This dominantly segregating SLC 5 A 7 mutation truncates the encoded product {{just beyond the}} final transmembrane domain, eliminating cytosolic-C-terminus sequences known to regulate surface transporter trafficking. Choline-transport assays in both transfected cells and monocytes from affected individuals revealed significant reductions in hemicholinium- 3 -sensitive choline uptake, a finding consistent with a dominant-negative mode of action. The discovery of CHT dysfunction underlying motor neuropathy identifies a biological basis for this group of conditions and widens the spectrum of disorders that derive from impaired NMJ transmission. Our findings compel consideration of mutations in SLC 5 A 7 or its functional partners in relation to unexplained motor <b>neuronopathies...</b>|$|R

Additionally, omigapil can prevent NMDA and kainate receptor excitotoxicity in rat cortical neurons as well as toxicity from cytosine arabinoside (ara C) in cerebellar granule cells. Omigapil also rescues rat oligodendrocytes from AMPA receptor excitotoxicity and rat embryonic mesencephalic (midbrain) dopaminergic cells from toxicity by MPP+/MPTP. [...] In human neuroblastoma (PAJU) cells, omigapil can also prevent toxicity from rotenone and GAPDH overexpression. Omigapil has an active concentration range from about 10−12 M to 10−5 M, with a maximum at about 10−9 M. Omigapil prevents neurodegeneration in facial motor neuron axotomy animal models as well as mouse models of progressive motor <b>neuronopathy,</b> MPTP-induced nigrostriatal degeneration, and oxidopamine-induced neuronal injury. Omigapil also prevents the death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in monkeys treated with MPTP to mimic Parkinson's disease symptoms. While omigapil was able to prevent programmed cell death for high-risk cells and prevent deterioration of concomitant motor deficits associated with Parkinson's symptoms, omigapil was unable to reverse pre-existing Parkinson's symptoms in MPTP monkeys.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{autosomal}} dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs), {{it is unclear}} whether the associated peripheral nerve involvement is always a typical length-dependent axonopathy rather than primary <b>neuronopathy</b> due to neuronal degeneration in the spinal anterior horns and/or dorsal root ganglia. OBJECTIVE: To study {{the nature and extent of}} peripheral nerve involvement in patients with ADCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standardized clinical and electrophysiologic studies of 27 genotyped patients with ADCA were conducted prospectively, with special emphasis on the distinction between primary <b>neuronopathy</b> and dying-back axonopathy. RESULTS: Electrophysiologic evidence of involvement of the peripheral nervous system was present in 70 % of patients. Findings were compatible with dying-back axonopathy in 30 %, while in 40 % of patients, <b>neuronopathy</b> was diagnosed. Patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1 and SCA 2 mostly displayed features of <b>neuronopathy,</b> while patients with SCA 3 and SCA 7 displayed both <b>neuronopathy</b> and axonopathy. In SCA 6, no significant peripheral nerve involvement was demonstrated. We did not observe an influence of age, disease duration, or ataxia severity on the presence or type of peripheral nerve involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral nerve involvement in ADCA manifests not only as distal axonal neuropathy, but also as primary <b>neuronopathy.</b> Electrodiagnostic studies in this group of patients should be conducted in such a way that primary <b>neuronopathy</b> is detected...|$|E
40|$|Sensory <b>neuronopathies</b> (SN) are {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} disorders associated with degeneration of dorsal root ganglion neurons. Despite the evidence of a defective proprioceptive sensory input in SN, the prominent gait and truncal ataxia {{raises the question of}} a concomitant involvement of the cerebellum. Objective: To evaluate cerebellar atrophy in SN. Method: We analyzed MRI-based volumetry of anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) and total cerebellum in patients with non-paraneoplastic chronic SN and compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Results: Cerebellum and anterior lobe MRI volumetry were performed in 20 patients and nine controls. Mean anterior lobe and cerebellar volume were not statistically different. Three patients (15 %), however, had an abnormal anterior lobe and cerebellar volume index (values outside 2. 5 standard deviations). One of them also had a specific atrophy of the anterior lobe. All these patients had infectious or dysimmune associated SN. Conclusion: Cerebellar atrophy is infrequently associated with SN, but can be found in some patients with SN related to infectious or immune mediated conditions. It can be more prominent in the anterior lobe and may contribute to the ataxia seen in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Childhood-onset {{proximal}} spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) are an autosomal recessive, clinically heterogeneous {{group of}} <b>neuronopathies</b> characterized by selective degeneration of anterior horn cells. The causative genes {{to be reported}} are survival motor neuron (SMN) and neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) genes. The deletion of telomeric copy of SMN (SMN(T)) gene was observed in over 95 % of SMAs. The deletion rate of NAIP gene is 20 - 50 % according to disease severity. The objective {{of this article is}} to genetically characterize the childhood-onset spinal muscular atrophy in Koreans. Five Korean families (14 constituents containing 5 probands) with SMA were included in this study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used for the deletion analysis of SMN(T). Multiplex PCR method was used for NAIP analysis. Four probands showed deletion of SMNT gene. Deletion of SMN(C) (centromeric SMN) gene was found in one proband who did not show the deletion of SMN(T) gene and in the father of one proband who showed the deletion of SMN(T) gene. The deletion of NAIP gene was not found among all the studied individuals. The extent of deletion in Koreans was smaller than that in other studied population.

Pattern A, with an acute or subacute onset in the four limbs or arms, early pain, and frequently affecting males over 60 years of age, identified mainly paraneoplastic, toxic, and infectious SNN. Pattern B identified patients with progressive SNN and was divided into patterns C and D, the former corresponding to patients with inherited or slowly progressive idiopathic SNN with severe ataxia and electrophysiological abnormalities and the latter to patients with idiopathic, dysimmune, and sometimes paraneoplastic SNN with a more rapid course than in pattern C.

40|$|The {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} (PNS) comprises the cranial nerves, spinal nerve roots, dorsal root ganglia, the peripheral nerve trunks (motor and sensory nerves), the terminal branchings of motor nerves as they innervate skeletal muscle, and the peripheral autonomic system [1]. Disorders of the parent cell bodies located in the spinal cord (and/or brainstem) are discussed under motor neuron diseases. In people, dorsal root ganglion degenerations are described as sensory neuropathies, while in animals such disorders are sometimes called ganglionopathies or sensory <b>neuronopathies.</b> In the chapter on Localization, I have arbitrarily classified small animal neuropathies into hereditary/degenerative and developmental disorders, and acquired toxic, traumatic, metabolic, inflammatory/infectious, neoplastic/paraneoplastic, and vascular disorders (see neuropathic syndrome). Peripheral nerve disorders are common and usually well-recognized in dogs and cats, although in some instances problems may arise in distinguishing neuropathies from diffuse muscle disease, certain CNS disorders, or skeletal problems. In general, most acquired neuropathies are seen in both dogs and cats, although hereditary disorders are more commonly reported in dogs. Both sophisticated electrodiagnostic testing and qualitative/quantitative pathological studies have further defined peripheral nerve disease in small animals.

40|$|The human {{androgen}} receptor (hAR) is a ligand-activated, DNA-binding nuclear transcription factor. Mutations in the hAR result {{in varying degrees}} of androgen insensitivity (AI); they may play a predisposing or pathogenetic role in both prostate and breast cancer. Expansion of the hAR's N-terminal polymorphic Glutamine (Gln) repeat causes a late-onset progressive motoneuronopathy which is associated with mild androgen insensitivity: spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). SBMA belongs {{to a group of}} translated CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion <b>neuronopathies</b> that includes Huntington disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and five distinct spinocerebellar ataxias. The fact that this group of disorders is caused by polyGln expansions in totally unrelated proteins, {{is one of the main}} reasons for postulating that a common gain-of-function mechanism must underlie their communal pathogenesis. This common pathogenetic mechanism is postulated to occur via aberrant protein interactions. I undertook a search for hAR-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. A human testes cDNA library was screened several times with two forms of an N-terminal fragment of the hAR: a normal (20 Gin) hAR and an expanded (50 Gin) hAR. A few candidate hAR-interacting proteins were isolated during the library screenings and I tested them for physiological relevance. A second aspect of my project included the analysis of an aberrant 75 -kD protein fragment generated in COS- 1 cells transfected with a polyCAG-expanded (n = 44) hAR cDNA. Recent work in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 shows the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates primarily in the nucleus of certain brain cells (Davies et al., 1997; Scherzinger et al., 1997; Paulson et al., 1997).
