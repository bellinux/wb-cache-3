50|$|A {{number of}} {{criteria}} and indicators are defined to assure coherent reporting of <b>nuclear</b> <b>events</b> by different official authorities. There are seven nonzero levels on the INES scale: three incident-levels and four accident-levels. There {{is also a}} level 0.|$|R
25|$|On 19 April 2005, leaked {{radioactive}} waste was discovered from ThORP (Thermal Oxide reprocessing plant) {{through a crack}} into a sump chamber which may have started as early as August 2004, and was categorised as a level 3 event on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale, resulting in fines.|$|E
25|$|The {{events at}} units 1, 2 and 3 have been rated at Level 5 each on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale, and those at unit 4 as Level 3 (Serious Incident) events, {{with the overall}} plant rating at Level 7 (major release of {{radioactive}} material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures).|$|E
25|$|The Three Mile Island {{accident}} {{occurred on}} March 28, 1979, in reactor number 2 of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (TMI-2) in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States, near Harrisburg. It {{was the most}} significant accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history. The incident was rated a five on the seven-point International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale: Accident with wider consequences.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} results concerning <b>nuclear</b> <b>events</b> in cosmic-ray underground, obtained by E. P. George and J.

25|$|No {{radiation}} {{was released}} to the environment, {{and no one was}} injured by the incident, but because of the large escape of radioactivity to the secondary containment the incident was given an International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale level 3 categorisation. Sellafield Limited was fined £500,000 for breaching health and safety law. In January 2007 Sellafield was given consent to restart Thorp.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} was rated 7 on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale (INES). This scale runs from 0, indicating an abnormal situation with no safety consequences, to 7, indicating an accident causing widespread contamination with serious {{health and environmental}} effects. Prior to Fukushima, the Chernobyl disaster was the only level 7 event on record, while the Three Mile Island accident was rated as level 5.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August, in {{a further}} incident, it was {{announced}} that 300 metric tons of heavily contaminated water had leaked from a storage tank, approximately the same amount of water as one eighth (1/8) of that found in an Olympic-size swimming pool. The 300 metric tons of water was radioactive enough to be hazardous to nearby staff, and the leak was assessed as Level 3 on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale.|$|E
50|$|The French nuclear {{regulatory}} authority ASN initially classified this {{disruption of the}} emergency cooling systems as stage 1 on the international scale of <b>nuclear</b> <b>events</b> (INES), but later assigned it the stage 2 classification. The operating company EDF then built the slider so that excess pressure can no longer lead to a blockage.|$|R
50|$|The {{emission}} and {{absorption of}} X-rays by gases had been observed previously, {{and it was}} expected that a similar phenomenon would be found for gamma rays, which are created by nuclear transitions (as opposed to X-rays, which are typically produced by electronic transitions). However, attempts to observe nuclear resonance produced by gamma-rays in gases failed due to energy being lost to recoil, preventing resonance (the Doppler effect also broadens the gamma-ray spectrum). Mössbauer was able to observe resonance in nuclei of solid iridium, which raised the question of why gamma-ray resonance was possible in solids, but not in gases. Mössbauer proposed that, for the case of atoms bound into a solid, under certain circumstances a fraction of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>events</b> could occur essentially without recoil. He attributed the observed resonance to this recoil-free fraction of <b>nuclear</b> <b>events.</b>|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Quantitative {{experimental}} {{analyses of}} the nuclear interior reveal a morphologically structured yet dynamic mix of membraneless compartments. Major <b>nuclear</b> <b>events</b> depend on the functional integrity and timely assembly of these intra-nuclear compartments. Yet, unknown drivers of protein mobility ensure {{that they are in}} the right place at the time when they are needed...|$|R
25|$|Under normal circumstances, nuclear {{reactors}} release {{small amounts of}} radioactive gases, which cause small radiation exposures to the public. Events classified on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale as incidents typically do not release any additional radioactive substances into the environment. Large releases of radioactivity from {{nuclear reactors}} are extremely rare. To the present day, there were two major civilian accidents – the Chernobyl accident and the Fukushima I nuclear accidents – which caused substantial contamination. The Chernobyl accident {{was the only one}} to cause immediate deaths.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{officials}} initially {{assessed the}} accident as Level 4 on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale (INES) despite {{the views of}} other international agencies {{that it should be}} higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over.|$|E
25|$|Between 1950 and 2000 {{there were}} 21 serious {{incidents}} or accidents involving off-site radiological releases that warranted a rating on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale, one at level 5, five at level 4 and fifteen at level 3. Additionally during the 1950s and 1960s there were protracted periods of known, deliberate discharges {{to the atmosphere}} of plutonium and irradiated uranium oxide particulates. These frequent incidents, together with the large 2005 Thorp plant leak which was not detected for nine months, have led some to doubt {{the effectiveness of the}} managerial processes and safety culture on the site over the years.|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{plasticity}} {{depends on}} plasma membrane Ca 2 + influx, resulting in activity-dependent gene transcription. Calmodulin (CaM) activated by Ca 2 + initiates the <b>nuclear</b> <b>events,</b> but how CaM {{makes its way}} to the nucleus has remained elusive.

25|$|The Chernobyl steam {{explosion}} was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. A {{steam explosion}} and graphite fire released {{large quantities of}} radioactive contamination into the atmosphere, which spread over much of Western USSR and Europe. It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, {{and is one of}} only two classified as a level 7 event on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster). The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18billion rubles, crippling the Soviet economy.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, 18,000 litres (4,755 gallons) {{of uranium}} {{solution}} containing natural uranium were accidentally released from Tricastin Nuclear Power Centre. Due to cleaning and repair work the containment {{system for a}} uranium solution holding tank was not functional when the tank filled. The inflow exceeded the tank's capacity and 30 cubic metres of uranium solution leaked, with 18 cubic metres spilled on the ground. Testing found elevated uranium levels in the nearby Gaffière and Lauzon rivers. The liquid that escaped to the ground contained about 75kg of natural uranium, which is toxic as a heavy metal, but only slightly radioactive. Estimates for the releases were initially higher, up to 360kg of natural uranium, but revised downward later. French authorities banned the use {{of water from the}} Gaffière and Lauzon for drinking and watering of crops for 2 weeks. Swimming, water sports and fishing were also banned. This incident has been classified as Level 1 (anomaly) on the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale. Shortly after the first incident, approximately 100 employees were exposed to minor doses of radiation (1/40 of the annual limit) due to a piping failure.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 April 1986, a reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, {{resulting}} in the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear reactor accident in history. This was the only accident to receive the highest possible rating of 7 by the International <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Event</b> Scale, indicating a [...] "major accident", until the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011. At {{the time of the}} accident, 7 million people lived in the contaminated territories, including 2.2 million in Ukraine.|$|E
50|$|The radio-biological hazard of {{worldwide}} fallout {{is a long-term}} one {{because of the potential}} accumulation of long-lived radioisotopes (such as strontium-90 and caesium-137) in the body as a result of ingestion of foods containing the radioactive materials. Because they are dispersed, levels of these isotopes are small for individual <b>nuclear</b> <b>events.</b> Local fallout is more concentrated and of far more immediate concern.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Apoptosis is {{a genetically}} {{programmed}} phenomenon that aids in maintaining homeostasis in multicellular organisms. The characteristic morphological features of apoptosis are highly conservative and {{are dependent on}} the cell type and the apoptotic inducer. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>events</b> occurring during apoptosis include changes {{at the molecular level}} (i. e. DNA cleavage, modifications of nuclear polypeptides, and proteolysis of several proteins important for cell maintenance), and, consequently, alterations at the morphological level (i. e. chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic body formation). These events are still not fully understood. It is very probable that a progressive decrease in pH could also be an essential factor for the induction of nuclease and protease activities, and an important element of the optimal conditions for their function. This review details the current state of knowledge on apoptotic <b>nuclear</b> <b>events,</b> with particular focus on the proteins involved in the execution of apoptosis in cell nuclei, and on the differences in substrate cleavage profiles for different types of cell undergoing cell death...|$|R
