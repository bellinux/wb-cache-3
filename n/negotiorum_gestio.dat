5000|$|<b>Negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> (Latin for [...] "management of business") {{is a form}} of {{spontaneous}} voluntary agency in which an intervenor or intermeddler, the gestor, acts on behalf and for the benefit of a principal (dominus negotii), but without the latter's prior consent. The gestor is only entitled to reimbursement for expenses and not to remuneration, the underlying principle being that <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> is intended as an act of generosity and friendship and not to allow the gestor to profit from his intermeddling. This form of intervention is classified as a quasi-contract and found in civil-law jurisdictions and in mixed systems (e.g. Scots, South African, and Philippine laws).|$|E
50|$|The Law of Salvage {{finds its}} origins in the Roman {{practice}} of <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio,</b> which dictated that one who preserved or improved upon the property of another, was owed compensation from the owner, even if the service was not requested by the latter. The law {{did not apply to}} maritime regulations, but were the basis for following ordinances, such as the Marine Ordinance of Trani, which stated that a “finder” was to be rewarded, whether the owner claimed the goods or not. The laws have evolved since <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio,</b> and today, in the United States, a salvor who voluntarily brings the goods back into port may legally lay claim to them, or deliver them to a marshal, in return for a reward.|$|E

From 11 January 2009, the Rome II Regulation creates a harmonised set of rules within the European Union to govern choice of law in civil and commercial matters (subject to certain exclusions) concerning non-contractual obligations, including specific rules for tort/delict and specific categories of tort/delict, unjust enrichment, <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> and culpa in contrahendo. Additionally, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, the parties may choose the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation. Analogous rules were established for contractual obligations by the Rome Convention of 1980. The Rome Convention has, in turn, {{been replaced by the}} Rome I Regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Reg. (EC) No. 593/2008).

40|$|This paper assesses whether English law recognizes {{a concept}} of <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio.</b> Claimants {{intervening}} in other' affairs and seeking restitution or reimbursement of expenses are often labeled ‘officious’, and disallowed relief. That, however, gives a misleading impression of English law. English law does recognize {{a concept of}} <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio,</b> which while very different to that found in German law, has parallels to versions found in other Civilian systems.

The author begins with the short history of the Restatements of the Law movement (1). He attempts to describe both the formal structure of the treatise (2) {{and the meaning of}} its keywords such as “unjust enrichment” and “restitution” (3). In the following sections the premises of restitution claims are presented: the absence of basis (4), the defendant’s enrichment at the plaintiff’s expense (5). The paper covers such separate doctrines included in the Restatement’s provisions as the unrequested intervention (<b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio)</b> either (6). The author researches also the remedies that could be applied in restitution cases (7), issues on the concurrence of claims (8) and the limitation (9).

40|$|By and large, {{it remains}} true that Scots law distinguishes {{contract}} and unjustified enrichment, and modern {{work in the}} two fields continues to reflect this. Although the third edition of Professor Walker's work on contract (1995) retains its final chapter on "obligations arising from unjust enrichment", {{the editors of the}} tenth edition (also 1995) of Gloag and Henderson, the standard introductory work on Scots law, have retitled as "Unjustified Enrichment" the chapter known in previous editions as "Quasi-Contract", and it has been moved from its previous position within the treatment of the general law of contract to a much later and completely separate treatment alongside salvage. William Stewart's Law of Restitution in Scotland (1992), the first book-length treatment of the subject, scrupulously leaves contract law out of consideration. Volume 15 of the Stair Memorial Encyclopedia, which deals with the Scots law of obligations and was published in 1996, distinguishes the voluntary obligations of contract and promise from obligations imposed by force of law and obligations arising from a wrongful act, and includes unjustified enrichment and <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> in the second category...|$|E
40|$|In Anglo-American law, {{a person}} {{intervening}} {{in the affairs}} of another will be responsible to the other party for any damage done in consequence of such intermeddling, but will derive no rights as a result thereof. Only when the intervention in another 2 ̆ 7 s affairs is dutiful, as Woodward calls it, that is, is required by a sense of duty, though not by law, will the intervener by entitled to compensation if he has conferred a benefit for which the recipient ought to pay. Quite a different attitude with reference to the intervention in other 2 ̆ 7 s affairs, without mandate, is maintained by the civil law. Its doctrine of <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> goes back in origin, it appears, to the praetorian edict in Rome, which regulated the rights of parties who had carried on litigation on behalf of absent friends. In the course of time the rights and duties created by this edict were extended to 2 ̆ 7 other kinds of intervention {{in the affairs of}} others. Justinian says concerning the purpose of <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> in Institutes 3, 27, I : 2 ̆ 2 Thus, if one man has managed the business of another during the latter 2 ̆ 7 s absence, each can sue the other by the action on uncommissioned agency; the direct action being available to him whose business was managed, the contrary action to him who managed it. It is clear that these actions cannot properly be said to originate in a contract, for their peculiarity is that they lie only where one man has come forward and managed the business of another without having received any commission so to do, and that other is thereby laid under a legal obligation even though he knows nothing of what has taken place. The reason of this is the general convenience; otherwise people. might be summoned away by some sudden event of pressing importance, and without commissioning any one to look after and manage their affairs, the result of which would be that during their absence those affairs would be entirely neglected; and of course no one would be likely to attend to them if he were to have no action for the recovery of any outlay he might have incurred in so doing. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. <b>Negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> (NG) denotes {{an action}} {{where a person}} well intendedly acts on behalf of another without obtaining the latter’s prior consent. In broad terms, NG-like actions have played a {{considerable}} role in health care provision. In some settings, health care delivery with only little or presumed patients’ consent has been the rule rather than the exception. However, bioethical principles regarding patient autonomy and obtainment of the patient’s informed consent (IC) before intervention are now increasingly materialized in the law of many countries. Aim. To study legal consequences of NG in family medicine and IC handling options. Methods. Case law examination. Results. A disciplinary board case is described concerning a family doctor conducting unlawful NG by not coming up to legal IC requirements. Discussion and Conclusion. The practical and legal implications of IC and possible role of novel Shared Decision-Making approaches in coming up to regulation and bioethical demands are discussed.

40|$|Non-Contractual Obligations in Private International Law This thesis {{deals with}} non-contractual {{obligations}} in private international law. The most important {{law in this}} area is the Rome II Regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations that applies since 11 January 2009. The Regulation creates a common regime of conflict of law rules for most civil and commercial non-contractual obligations. The general rule is the law of the place of injury (lex loci damni). The rule is subject to two exceptions, the common habitual residence exception and a general escape clause based on the closer connection principle. Special rules are laid down for some non-contractual obligations, such as product liability, unfair competition and acts restricting free competition, environmental damages, infringement of intellectual property rights, unjust enrichment, <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> and culpa in contrahendo. However, in most cases, the parties may agree on the law applicable to the non- contractual obligations between them. Post-tort agreements may be made between all parties whereas pre-tort agreements are allowed only where all the parties are pursuing commercial activity. Where the Rome II Regulation does not apply the courts will look to the relevant national legislation, which is the Private [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although legal {{informatics}} is on {{the periphery}} of jurisprudence, it can make {{a significant impact on the}} centre in respect of legal dogmatics. We believe that the impact from legal informatics can be reached through situational legal visualisation and situational terms, for example, by correcting the boundaries of legal terms. The latter is the subject matter of legal theory and hence contributes to the centre of jurisprudence. This paper makes analogy between Begriffsjurisprudenz in the nineteenth century and legal ontologies of the present, and stresses a situational treatment of law in addition to a normative one. Therefore both situational contents and institutional contents are important when representing legal semantics within legal informatics. However, the differences between legal norms, texts and documents have to be taken into account. Legal norms are interpretative products whereas legal documents are tangible products and are represented according to documentary rules. The themes of granularity and metadata remain aside from the norm-institution relationship but emerge in the law-legal informatics relationship. The granularity question, “What is the smallest entity?”, can have different answers in legal documentation: the whole text of a law, an article, a paragraph, or a word. An example of a situational visualisation to discuss is a four-minute film about the familiar “Menzi-Muck timber ” case in which the Swiss Federal Court defined demarcation criteria between favour, gratuitous contract and <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio...</b>|$|E
40|$|The year 2001 {{marks the}} 80 th anniversary of Cardozo J 2 ̆ 7 s {{judgment}} in Wagner v International Railway Co 232 NY 176 (1921). This article examines theoretical and procedural {{problems associated with}} the concept of duty of care as a foundation for the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s liability in negligence to altruistic rescuers, and suggests that Cardozo J 2 ̆ 7 s judgment did not establish the principle that defendants owe rescuers a duty of care in negligence. It is argued that subsequent judgments failed to provide the duty of care owed to rescuers under tortious negligence with proper jurisprudential foundations. Conceptual difficulties inherent in a jurisprudential principle that would provide physically injured rescuers with a legal right to a duty of care from the defendant under the tort of negligence were compounded once compensation for negligently occasioned pure emotional distress became available. This article analyses various theories of recovery for pure psychiatric injury and the classification of rescuers into primary and secondary victims. It proposes a solution {{in the form of a}} separate cause of action on the case for liability to injured rescuers, partly based on the principle of necessity that governs the Roman action for <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio.</b> Cases from the United States, England and Australia are used to illustrate the similarities and differences in the development of and approaches to, the law of rescue. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} unjust {{enrichment}} {{has often been}} raised in recent years with reference to litigation concerning contracts with public authorities. Many times, parties to such contracts have invoked this principle to obtain compensation for services provided under contracts later declared irregular or void. The courts have then attempted to apply {{in the context of}} administrative law the conditions laid down by civil law doctrine for unjust enrichment. The transposition to administrative law of the civil concept of unjust enrichment does not, however, appear to have been adequate. To begin with, the principle of unjust enrichment is difficult to dissociate from the quasi-contract of <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> in administrative law. Further, the material and legal conditions of unjust enrichment cannot be applied as a whole to administrative law. In this field, unjust enrichment appears as a true quasi-contract {{in the sense that it}} requires the assent of the person enriched. Furthermore, the enrichment must have resulted in a real benefit in the general interest of the administration. These special conditions require a different approach toward the notion of unjust enrichment in administrative law. This approach may be elaborated from the Common Law notion of quantum meruit or from the theory of unjust enrichment in French administrative law. A new concept of unjust enrichment in Quebec administrative law would lead to finding, in the field of quasi-contracts, a solution which would provide for the protection of both public finances and the individual interests of co-contractants...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} enforcement of monetary claims in cases of intellectual property rights infringement. It focuses on the Act n. 221 / 2006 Sb. on {{the enforcement of}} intellectual property and on the directive 2004 / 48 /EC of the European parliament and of the Council. The main aim is to evaluate the extent of monetary claims especially with regard on possible overlap or mutual consumption of the claims. The second aim is the analysis of English terminology {{in relation to the}} nearest Czech equivalents. The dissertation uses methods of logic induction and abstraction and the international multilateral comparative method, where the use of language plays a crucial role. The exact method of modelling combined with mathematical game theory is used. The dissertation progressively explains terms and relevant enactments. It introduces existing ambiguities. It tries to clarify them by analysing the EU legislation, the implementations in different member states, the statutory and common law in the USA. Consecutively it focuses on unjust enrichment in English law, then in the USA and in the continental system, where this institute is set negatively [...] as the unjustified enrichment. Within the whole thesis the analysis takes place in relation to intellectual property rights infringement. In the penultimate chapter, TRIPS and ACTA are compared with the directive 2004 / 48 /EC to provide further explanations. The dissertation concludes that a parallel award of damages and infringer's profits theoretically is possible, when it is not a single flow of value which is concerned by the infringement. The dissertation negatively replies to the question if damages and infringer's profits may be awarded concurrently in two separate lump-sum amounts according to § 5 (2) or (3) of the Act n. 221 / 2006 Sb. The reason is that the rate of the royalty is applied to sales of the infringer. These sales relate to the unjust enrichment of the infringer. If damages were again calculated by applying the same rate to the same sales, that would be double recovery. But theoretically this possibility cannot be excluded. A real-world example is very hard to find, even in the non-lump-sum form. Collateral sales awarded with lost profit in US law may serve as one. From the EU documents it seems, that infringer's profits is equalled to unjust enrichment and that is translated as unjustified enrichment. But English theory distinguishes restitution of unjust enrichment and gain-based recovery for wrong, the latter encompassing the award of infringer's profits in the form of damages. The broader Czech notion of unjustified enrichment is not to be equalled to unjust enrichment in the pure English notion, because the former encompasses also intentional wrongs. With regard to the restitution of infringer's profits based on unjust enrichment, the intent plays a role. The broader notion of unjust enrichment relevant to intellectual property rights infringement is called interceptive unjust enrichment, where enrichment "from the property of the plaintiff" is at stake and it is also possible to claim profits gained by the infringement. Focus is on the enrichment "from the property", not on the wrong. The dissertation examines the terms "account of profits", apportionment of profits", "disgorgement" and impure <b>negotiorum</b> <b>gestio</b> with regard to intellectual property infringement. In several countries reasonable royalty is regarded as good measure of net gain from the infringement of intellectual property. When the infringement was not innocent or wilful, it's possible to claim not only the objective enrichment but also the subjective enrichment [...] profits of the infringer. In Czech law, that is represented by the emoluments from the enrichment. The aim of the last chapter is to evaluate, {{in the context of the}} operation of other relevant elements of legal environment, the preventive function of the double royalty claim introduced by the Act n. 221 / 2006 Sb. By construing a game theory model and using simulation, the thesis concludes that in lower royalty intervals, where attorney's costs are a high burden, the effect of the double royalty is insignificant. Where "more significant infringements" are at stake, and the royalty passes a given frontier, the application of the double royalty heightens the preventive function of the Act. Those "more significant infringements" have two intervals [...] with the highest effect of the double royalty and with the "stabilized effect of the double royalty". But overall, in cases of "more significant infringements", the application of the double represents a heightening of the preventive power by a third and fifth respectively, and this is true only in the case, where the prospective infringers would try to calculate the effect of their infringement before infringing...|$|E
