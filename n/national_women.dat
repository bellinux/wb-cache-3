2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the violence, JFF was tasked to document the rapes. After JFF reported that the violence had been organized, [...] General Wiranto publicly apologized for the army's failure to prevent the violence and acknowledged that elements in the military were involved. [...] In addition to government-mandated JFF, a special rapporteur was established by the United Nations to validate JFF findings and interview some of the victims. Both have officially reported that the sexual abuse on May 1998 did occur. The rapporteur noted that the difficulty of interviewing rape victims and lack of testimonials have been used to discredit the fact-finding effort and in one instance to twist it to portray that the incident was fabricated to raise resentment against Indonesian Muslims. In 2008 <b>National</b> <b>Women</b> Commission working together with the UN rapporteur issued recommendations to the government to adopt violence elimination, victim protection and recovery, gender awareness measures. These measures have been accepted and implemented into policies. However general public still refuses to acknowledge the rapes and legal proceeding against the perpetrators has stalled.|$|E
2500|$|From 1863 to 1870, Langston {{worked for}} {{equality}} {{under the law}} for blacks in Kansas: suffrage, the right to sit on juries and testify in court, and to have black children educated in common schools. In 1863, he helped lead a state convention of African Americans, who petitioned the state legislature to gain suffrage. Continuing {{years of trying to}} gain support for this goal, Langston gained support by Republican Governor Samuel J. Crawford for a referendum in 1867 on the question of black suffrage. He always stressed that he sought legal justice as a human being, not a black human being. The referendum bill passed by the legislature, however, asked voters to decide not only on black suffrage, but on women suffrage, and a third question of disenfranchising persons who had supported the Confederacy during the war. <b>National</b> <b>women</b> suffrage advocates came to Kansas to promote their cause. Opponents suggested that recently emancipated black men should not receive suffrage before educated women; both franchise measures were defeated. More votes were cast against women suffrage than black suffrage ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1890, two rival organizations, the <b>National</b> <b>Woman</b> Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association, merged to {{form the}} <b>National</b> American <b>Woman</b> Suffrage Association (NAWSA). As NAWSA began gaining support for its cause, its members {{realized}} that the exclusion of African-American women would gain greater support, resulting in {{the adoption of a}} more narrow view of women's suffrage than had been previously asserted. NAWSA focused on enfranchisement solely for white women. African-American women began experiencing the [...] "Anti-Black" [...] women's suffrage movement. The <b>National</b> <b>Woman</b> Suffrage Association considered the Northeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs to be a liability to the association due to Southern white women's attitudes toward black women getting the vote. Southern whites feared African-Americans gaining more political advantage and thus power; African-American women voters would help to achieve this change.|$|R
