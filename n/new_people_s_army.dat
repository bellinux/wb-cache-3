40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{identify}} if, {{in the course}} of the United States and NATO s democratic institution building efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United States and NATO are offering a viable model of how military professionals interact with a healthy democratic society. Because the understanding of how military professionals should interact with society as a whole is often flawed in the United States and other developed democratic states, this study will research how well the United States and NATO are presenting a realistic model to professional soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This study begins with a broad look at civil-military relations theory and examines select historical examples of professional soldiers exceeding their purview in developed countries such as the United States and Britain. The Yugoslav <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Army</b> <b>s</b> political history is surveyed to examine the political involvement of professional soldiers in politics in the former state of Yugoslavia. Lastly, this study will examine contemporary Bosnia-Herzegovina and the West's democratic institution-building efforts...|$|R

40|$|Includes erratumThe broad {{class of}} {{extended}} real-valued lower semicontinuous (lsc) functions on IRn captures nearly all functions of practical importance in equation solving, variational problems, fitting, and estimation. The paper develops piecewise polynomial functions, called epi-splines, that approximate any lsc function to an arbitrary level of accuracy. Epi-splines provide {{the foundation for}} the solution of a rich class of function identification problems that incorporate general constraints on the function to be identified including those derived from information about smoothness, shape, proximity to other functions, and so on. As such extrinsic information as well as observed function and subgradient values often evolve in applications, we establish conditions under which the computed epi-splines converge to the function we seek to identify. Numerical examples in response surface building and probability density estimation illustrate the framework.

40|$|Tensions between China and Japan over disputed {{maritime}} {{boundaries in}} the East China Sea have dramatically escalated {{in the past}} decade. This thesis examines how disputed delimitation in the East China Sea has impacted the development, interests, and policies of China <b>s</b> <b>People</b> <b>s</b> Liberation <b>Army</b> Navy. The key questions addressed in this paper are; how is China s interpretation of delimitation in the East China Sea unique? Why is maritime delimitation, particularly in the East China Sea, {{so important to the}} PLA Navy? And what policies is the PLA Navy promoting in support of China s East China Sea maritime delimitation claims and why? In brief, this paper will demonstrate and conclude that China has made a unique and controversially large maritime territory claim, based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea s 76 th article on natural prolongation of a nation s maritime shelf. The PLA Navy views maintaining and securing China s delimitated maritime territory as crucial to securing undersea natural resources and vital shipping lanes, thus securing China s economic power. The PLA Navy understands that a strong, blue-water navy is critical to a country s economic success and subsequent presence as an international political power. The key policies being promoted by the navy are the assertion and defense of maritime boundaries, especially rights to offshore resources with China s EEZ; securing sea lanes and freedom of navigation at sea; and being a presence in sovereignty disputes over offshore islands as well as Taiwan. All of these issues are critical to the PLA Navy s goals of preserving China s economic and political power...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} univariate density estimation {{in situations}} when the sample (hard information) is supplemented by “soft” {{information about the}} random phenomenon. These situations arise broadly in operations research and management science where practical and computational reasons severely limit the sample size, but problem structure and past experiences could be brought in. In particular, density estimation is needed for generation of input densities to simulation and stochastic optimization models, in analysis of simulation output, and when instantiating probability models. We adopt a constrained maximum likelihood estimator that incorporates any, possibly random, soft information through an arbitrary collection of constraints. We illustrate the breadth of possibilities by discussing soft information about shape, support, continuity, smoothness, slope, location of modes, symmetry, density values, neighborhood of known density, moments, and distribution functions. The maximization takes place over spaces of extended real-valued semicontinuous functions and therefore allows us to consider essentially any conceivable density as well as convenient exponential transformations. The infinite dimensionality of the optimization problem is overcome by approximating splines tailored to these spaces. To facilitate the treatment of small samples, the construction of these splines is decoupled from the sample. We discuss existence and uniqueness of the estimator, examine consistency under increasing hard and soft information, and give rates of convergence. Numerical examples illustrate the value of soft information, the ability to generate a family of diverse densities, {{and the effect of}} misspecification of soft information.
