40|$|Enquiry {{into the}} {{occupational}} {{history of a}} patient presenting with stupor, hyperpyrexia and profuse sweating, and dying at a Winnipeg hospital {{a few hours later}} in coma, finally led to the identification of pentachlorophenol-a substance widely used as a wood preservative-as the cause of death of this worker and the cause of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>intoxication</b> in four other workers engaged by wood-processing plants. In these latter four cases the prominent clinical symptoms were sweating, weight loss and gastrointestinal complaints. A review of the literature revealed that pentachlorophenol exerts its toxicity following cutaneous absorption or inhalation by interference with oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in excessive release of heat. This substance has been the cause of several deaths in other countries. Observance of simple precautionary measures that ensure adequate ventilation and skin protection should suffice in making this industrially useful product safe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract AH- 7921 is a {{structurally}} unique synthetic {{opioid analgesic}} that has recently entered the drug arena in Europe, the USA, and Japan. Although it was synthesized and patented in the mid- 1970 s, {{it was first}} identified in a seized sample purchased via the Internet in July 2012 and formally {{brought to the attention}} of the European Union early warning system in August 2012 by the United Kingdom. Several in vitro experiments and animal model studies established the morphine-like analgesic action of AH- 7921 as a l-opioid receptor agonist that has been found to be several times more potent than codeine and at least as potent as morphine. This novel psychoactive sub-stance has already led to eight <b>non-fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> an...|$|R
40|$|The {{first case}} of fatal {{intoxication}} due to ingestion of gamma- hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and intravenous use of heroin i s reported. A 42 - year-old man, {{known to have}} been a heroin addict and to have taken other psychoactive substances, who had been in treatment with GHB for several months, was found dead. Anatomohistopathologic examination showed generalized visceral congestion, edema and pulmonary anthracosis, chronic bronchitis and chronic active hepatitis. Toxicological findings included fluid and tissue distributions of GHB, morphine and 6 -monoacetylmorphine. GHB and morphine concentrations were respectively 11. 5 and 0. 77 μ/mL (blood), 84. 3 and 0. 3 μg/mL (vitreous humor), 258. 3 and 1. 35 μg/mL (urine), 57. 0 and 14. 3 μg/mL (bile), 40. 0 and 0. 43 μg/g (brain), 43. 0 and 0. 60 μg/g (liver), 47. 0 and 0. 68 μg/g (kidney). Blood and urine levels of 6 -monoacetylmorphine were 28. 5 and 12. 1 ng/mL respectively. The presumed mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of GHB are briefly reviewed, with reference to its therapeutic use and to reports of <b>non-fatal</b> GHB <b>intoxication...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{abuse of}} novel psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS) {{has been increasing}} dramatically worldwide since late 2000 s. By the end of 2015, more than 560 NPS had been reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Although the most popular compounds are synthetic cannabinoids and psychostimulatory derivatives of cathinone (so-called β-keto-amphetamines), novel synthetic opioids have recently emerged on the recreational drug market. They include fentanyl (a potent narcotic analgesic) and its analogs (e. g., acetylfentanyl, acryloylfentanyl, carfentanil, α-methylfentanyl, 3 -methylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, 4 -fluorobutyrylfentanyl, 4 -methoxybutyrylfentanyl, 4 -chloroisobutyrylfentanyl, 4 -fluoroisobutyrylfentanyl, tetrahydrofuranylfentanyl, cyclopentylfentanyl, and ocfentanil) and compounds with different chemical structures, such as AH- 7921, MT- 45, and U- 47700. This survey {{provides an overview of}} the pharmacological properties, pattern of use, and desired and unwanted effects of the above-listed novel opioids. Special emphasis is given to cases of <b>non-fatal</b> and lethal <b>intoxication</b> involving these compounds...|$|R
