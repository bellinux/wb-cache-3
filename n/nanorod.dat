25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or <b>nanorod,</b> induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E

Wet chemical synthesis of gold <b>nanorods</b> requires {{the use of}} cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as shape-directing surfactant, which form a bilayer on the surfaces of gold <b>nanorods.</b> CTAB bilayer stabilizes the <b>nanorods</b> against aggregation and has the ability to sequester organic molecules from aqueous bulk.

50|$|One form of {{propulsion}} nanosubmarines {{could use}} is electrochemical. One {{example of a}} motor is a <b>nanorod</b> which is platinum {{on one side and}} gold on the other. When submerged in hydrogen peroxide the platinum oxidizes the H2O2 into 2H+ and O2. This process occurs because platinum takes two electrons from the molecule. On {{the other side of the}} rod, the gold reduces hydrogen peroxide into water, in doing so an electron is pulled from the gold. This causes a steady electron flow from the platinum side of the rod towards the gold side. Since the rod is so small, Newton's third law of physics applies. For any action there is a reaction, when the electrons are pulled across the surface of the rod, so too is the rod pulled in the opposite direction.|$|E
5000|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) <b>nanorod,</b> {{also known}} as nanowire, has a direct bandgap energy of 3.37 eV, {{which is similar to}} that of GaN, and it has an {{excitation}} binding energy of 60 meV. The optical bandgap of ZnO <b>nanorod</b> can be tuned by changing the morphology, composition, size etc. Recent years, ZnO nanorods have been intensely used to fabricate nano-scale electronic devices, including field effect transistor, ultraviolet photodetector, Schottky diode, and ultra-bright light-emitting diode (LED). Various methods have been developed to fabricate the single crystalline, wurtzite ZnO nanorods. Among those methods, growing from vapor phase is the most developed approach. In a typical growth process, ZnO vapor is condensed onto a solid substrate. ZnO vapor can be generated by three methods: thermal evaporation, chemical reduction, and Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS) method. In the thermal evaporation method, commercial ZnO powder is mixed with SnO2 and evaporated by heating the mixture at elevated temperature. In the chemical reduction method, zinc vapor, generated by the reduction of ZnO, is transferred to the growth zone, followed by reoxidation to ZnO. The VLS process, originally proposed in 1964, is the most commonly used process to synthesize single crystalline ZnO nanorods. In a typical process, catalytic droplets are deposited on the substrate and the gas mixtures, including Zn vapor and a mixture of CO/CO2, react at the catalyst-substrate interface, followed by nucleation and growth. Typical metal catalysts involve gold, copper, nickel, and tin. ZnO nanowires are grown epitaxially on the substrate and assemble into monolayer arrays. Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) has also been recently developed. No catalyst is involved in this process and the growth temperature is at 400 ~500 °C, i.e. considerably milder conditions compared to the traditional vapor growth method. Moreover, metal oxide nanorods (ZnO, CuO, Fe2O3, V2O5, others) can be simply made by heating initial metal in air in a Thermal oxidation process. For example, to make a dense [...] "carpet" [...] of CuO nanorods it was found to be enough to heat Cu foil in air at 420 °C.|$|E
