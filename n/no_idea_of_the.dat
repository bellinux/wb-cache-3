5|$|In 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film {{acquired}} the film {{rights of the}} Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film {{in order to keep}} the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled The Fantastic Four, had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.|$|E
25|$|His Japanese voice {{actor is}} Chihiro Suzuki who was chosen over Yasunori Matsumoto who also wanted the role. Suzuki had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's setting or how Luke looked {{since there were}} no images. He was told to use Shibuya as an image. Luke's English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal. Lowenthal noted he could relate to the {{character}} because of his selfish nature and comically noted he lacked Luke's development.|$|E
25|$|Hanna and {{his wife}} Ann had five children. None of his family members {{were known to be}} {{involved}} in paramilitary activities. His brother Gordon, also a UDR member, and other family members told Joe Tiernan that they were aware of Billy Hanna's membership of the UVF but had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extent due to their own non-involvement and had not believed he was directly involved in violence until after his death.|$|E
30|$|Although at {{this stage}} we have <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{possible}} practical applications of fractal technology, we nonetheless believe that <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> preparing, without <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> advanced lithography, fractal structures at the mesoscopic scale opens a virgin field <b>of</b> applications. <b>The</b> above considerations are certainly highly speculative, but not so speculative as those contained in van Gulick’s paper in topochemistry [28], outlining applications currently not achievable at that time, but later demonstrated to be possible.|$|R

25|$|Robespierre visited Marie-Thérèse on 11 May, but no one, {{according}} to the legend, entered the dauphin's room for six months until Barras visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras's account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alleged walling in. It is nevertheless certain that {{during the first half}} of 1794 Louis-Charles was very strictly secluded; he had no special guardian, but was under the charge of guards who changed from day to day.|$|E
25|$|Under cross examination, Montagnier {{stated that}} it is {{possible}} to preserve the virus and then reactivate it if it has been held in plasma. It could be kept active for several days, depending on how it is stored. He testified that he was not aware of the existence of the technical capacity in Libya for monitoring this kind of storage, either during the epidemic or currently. Montagnier testified that during his first visit, the health authorities in Libya and the management of the Benghazi hospital showed serious concern over the infection, and that at the time they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cause of the epidemic's spread.|$|E
25|$|Soult marched {{south on}} 30 January 1809, aiming for Portugal. After being {{repelled}} in his initial attempt {{to cross the}} Minho River in mid-February, his forces marched to Ourense and crossed the bridge there. Soult's cavalry crushed a Spanish brigade at La Trepa on 6 March and the II Corps entered Portugal on the 9th. At the Battle of Braga on 20 March, the French routed a Portuguese army consisting of a few regulars and 22,000 militia. The First Battle of Porto on the 29th was another lopsided French victory marked by terrible Portuguese loss of life. But despite being established in Porto, Soult found his communications cut by regular and irregular Portuguese forces under General Francisco Silveira and he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whereabouts of Lapisse.|$|E
6000|$|... "We want no French to {{read that}} signal, sir," [...] put in Greenly; [...] "the frigates {{themselves}} telling us what it means. Monsieur de Vervillin has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> letting <b>the</b> Plantagenet take any thing he has, alive." ...|$|R

25|$|Now without {{income and}} any {{prospect}} {{of returning to}} Yugoslavia, Peter II and Alexandra resolved to leave Claridge's Hotel {{and moved to a}} mansion in the Borough of Runnymede. Abandoned by the British government, they settled for a time in France, between Paris and Monte Carlo, then in Switzerland at St. Moritz. Increasingly penniless, they ended up leaving Europe and in 1949, they settled in New York City, where the former King hoped to complete a financial project. Still penniless, the couple was forced to sell Alexandra's necklace of emeralds and others pieces of her jewelry to pay their accumulated debts. In addition to these difficulties was {{the fact that they were}} unable to manage a budget. As she herself wrote in her autobiography, Alexandra had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of things and she quickly proved incapable of maintaining a home.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{noted in}} his diary (25 August) that GHQ had moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin and that I Corps was being heavily engaged by night – making no mention of what II Corps were up to. When 4th Division arrived (25 August) Snow’s orders were to help prepare a {{defensive}} position on the Cambrai-Le Cateau position, as GHQ had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seriousness of the situation facing II Corps. 4th Division was eventually {{able to participate in}} the Battle of Le Cateau. The news that Smith-Dorrien planned to stand and fight at Le Cateau reached GHQ at 5am on 26 August – French was woken from his sleep, and insisting that Murray not be woken, sent Smith-Dorrien an ambiguous message that he had “a free hand as to the method” by which he fell back, which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to fight.|$|E
25|$|Since those {{involved}} with the production had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure. Nine other puppets—including Santa and young Rudolph—were given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded. In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic. Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project. The figures have been shown at conventions since then.|$|E

60|$|And {{therefore}} I am apt {{to doubt}} that, how far soever human industry may advance useful and experimental philosophy in physical things, SCIENTIFICAL {{will still be}} out of our reach: because we want perfect and adequate <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> those very bodies which are nearest to us, and most under our command. Those which we have ranked into classes under names, and we think ourselves best acquainted with, we have but very imperfect and incomplete <b>ideas</b> <b>of.</b> Distinct <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> several sorts <b>of</b> bodies that fall under <b>the</b> examination <b>of</b> our senses perhaps we may have: but adequate ideas, I suspect, we have not of any one amongst them. And though <b>the</b> former <b>of</b> these will serve us for common use and discourse, yet whilst we want the latter, we are not capable of scientifical knowledge; nor shall {{ever be able to}} discover general, instructive, unquestionable truths concerning them. CERTAINTY and DEMONSTRATION are things we must not, in these matters, pretend to. By the colour, figure, taste, and smell, and other sensible qualities, we have as clear and distinct <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> sage and hemlock, as we have of a circle and a triangle: but having <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular primary qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minute parts <b>of</b> either of these plants, nor of other bodies which we would apply them to, we cannot tell what effects they will produce; nor when we see those effects can we so much as guess, much less know, their manner of production. Thus, having <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular mechanical affections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minute parts <b>of</b> bodies that are within our view and reach, we are ignorant of their constitutions, powers, and operations: and of bodies more remote we are yet more ignorant, not knowing so much as their very outward shapes, or the sensible and grosser parts of their constitutions.|$|R
25|$|The abbey {{was large}} and {{important}} among Augustinian houses and seems to have reached a zenith under Henry III. However, it was also from this time that it sometimes overstepped or abused its privileges. In 1221, for example, a jury at Shrewsbury complained that a servant of the abbot, Anian from Preston Gubbals, had been caught red-handed with loot from a robbery but had been extracted from gaol so that the abbot could try him in his own court. The jurors had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the case. However, relations with royal authority were generally good. In 1242 the king sent the abbot, then Richard of Shrewsbury, a gratuity of 20 marks. Three years later Henry stayed at the abbey {{on his way to}} Chester and the abbot gave 40 shillings towards the marriage of the infant Princess Margaret. Around the same time, a jury commissioned by John Biset, Justice in Eyre, decided the abbot need not expeditate his dogs (i.e. remove their claws), as his lands were originally of the royal demesne.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Evie {{looks for}} the Piece of Eden, {{managing}} to steal an Assassin journal from Thorne. Analyzing the journal, Evie discovers that {{it refers to the}} Shroud of Eden, a Piece of Eden that can heal any injury, including old age, and makes the wearer immortal. She follows the trail of clues underneath the mansion of , where she finds a map detailing the locations of all of the Assassin vaults hidden in London. Her search leads her to famous landmarks such as the Monument to the Great Fire of London and St. Paul's Cathedral. She obtains the key needed to access the Shroud's vault, but it is stolen by Thorne. Evie then heads to the Tower of London, where the vault is located and assassinates Thorne. Thorne explains the Shroud is not in the Tower and claims that the Assassins have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true power of the Shroud before dying. Green believes the real vault is hidden in Buckingham Palace, and enlists the aid of the Maharajah Duleep Singh to find the schematics for the building. Unfortunately, the Templars manage to seize the schematics first. In addition to her hunt for the Shroud, Evie also helps correct the unintended consequences Jacob's assassinations have caused such as medicine shortages and currency inflation.|$|E
500|$|The Usher {{introduces}} the proceedings by exhorting {{the jury to}} listen to the broken-hearted Plaintiff's case but telling them that they [...] "needn't mind" [...] what the [...] "ruffianly defendant" [...] has to say. [...] He adds, however, that [...] "From bias free of every kind, this trial must be tried!" [...] The Defendant (Edwin) arrives, and the jurymen greet him with hostility, even though, as he points out, they have as yet <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merits of his case. [...] He tells them, with surprising candour, that he jilted the Plaintiff because she became a [...] "bore intense" [...] to him, and he then quickly took up with another woman. [...] The jurymen recall their own wayward youth, but they are now respectable gentlemen and no longer have any sympathy for the Defendant.|$|E

500|$|Portal {{was first}} {{released}} {{as part of}} The Orange Box for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on October 9, 2007, and for the PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007. The Windows version {{of the game is}} also available for download separately through Valve's content delivery system, Steam, and was released as a standalone retail product on April 9, 2008. In addition to Portal, the Box also included Half-Life 2 and its two add-on episodes, as well as Team Fortress 2. Portals inclusion within the Box was considered an experiment by Valve; having <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> success of Portal, the Box provided it a [...] "safety net" [...] via means of these other games. Portal was kept to a modest length in case the game did not go over well with players. Since then, a standalone version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows users.|$|E
500|$|In July 1945, {{after the}} Red Cross {{confirmed}} {{the deaths of}} the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw {{for the first time the}} more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, [...] "For me it was a revelation... I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depth of her thoughts and feelings... She had kept all these feelings to herself". Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Bruce Eder, in {{a review}} for the AllMusic website, wrote the Beach Boys [...] "brush up against {{the dark side of}} the '60s, in the form of 'Never Learn Not to Love'". In his {{assessment}} of the song, Richie Unterberger commented [...] "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] is far more notorious for its relation to Manson, not the music itself which he describes as [...] "average". Author Carl Larkin, in his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, wrote the track [...] "had the ironic distinction of putting Charles Manson in the charts". Journalist Nathan Jolly called the song [...] "softer but still eerie", also noting how fans of the Beach Boys who listened to the song over the years [...] "had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inherent evil of its actual composer". Throughout the years, [...] "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] has appeared on several other Beach Boys compilations and bootlegs.|$|E

500|$|While Chahi had a {{clear idea}} of how to {{implement}} his game engine, he mostly improvised when creating the actual content of the game, allowing the game to develop [...] "layer by layer without knowing where it was going." [...] He planned on creating a science fiction game that was similar to Karateka and Impossible Mission. Because he wanted to create a dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technical limitations he would face while building out the story, he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game. Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through GFA BASIC coupled with the game's engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure {{she would not have}} gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday Mail a 2004 {{newspaper}} report {{notes that}} [...] "no worries" [...] {{has begun to}} be used in American English. Writing in a 2004 article for The Advertiser, Samela Harris comments: [...] "The Americans have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> etymology of 'no worries'. So, while they may cheerily adopt our 'no worries' mantra, 'no worries' will never catch on as an attitude." [...] According to Tom Dalzell, author of two books on slang usage in the United States, linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country. Usage of the term by Steve Irwin on The Crocodile Hunter, as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have been put forth as theories explaining the pervasiveness of the expression in the United States. Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds In the Garden Of Words that expressions including [...] "no worries", [...] "absolutely", and [...] "bottom line" [...] have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings. The phrase has had some usage in Canadian English.|$|E
