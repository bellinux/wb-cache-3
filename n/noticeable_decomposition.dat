50|$|Preca died in {{the evening}} of 26 July 1962; his funeral on 28 July {{was one of the}} largest {{funerals}} ever held in Malta and Bishop Emanuel Galea presided over it at the Saint Cajetan church. The Prime Minister George Borg Olivier was present at the funeral. His remains were exhumed on 7 July 2000 and were found to have been in an exceptional state of preservation despite the presence of <b>noticeable</b> <b>decomposition.</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{significantly}} improved on our earlier results with a copper-impregnated alumina, obtaining reproducible {{results for the}} impregnation procedure and linear behavior with solution concentration of the precursor. The copper acetylacetonate precursor is adsorbed molecularly onto the alumina surface, with no <b>noticeable</b> <b>decomposition.</b> The adsorbed complex appears to form layers on the alumina surface, similar to results found using the same complex with a silica substrate. The materials start out as light blue powders, and after oxidation are light green. Using infrared spectroscopy, we have examined the in situ adsorption and oxidation of SO{sub 2 } on the oxidized sorbent, which is dispersed copper oxide supported on aluminum oxide, and have observed that the initial species formed correspond to aluminum sulfate and aluminum sulfate. The sulfate is formed at temperatures much lower than similar experiments studying SO{sub 2 } adsorption on alumina and sodium-doped alumina. As a result of oxidation, the adsorbed sulfur species, which begin as aluminum sulfate and sulfate, are converted to copper sulfate...|$|E
40|$|Striga hermonthica and Striga asiatica are obligate root parasites {{that cause}} serious {{problems}} {{in the production of}} staple cereal crops in Africa. Because of the high levels of infestation, there is an urgent need to control these weeds. A potentially useful control option is depletion of the soil seed bank by suicidal germination, which involves germination of the seeds in the absence of host plants. Suicidal germination is often mentioned in the literature, but not considered realistic, because of the alleged untimely decomposition of the stimulants in the soil, despite the fact that some encouraging results were reported around 1980. The alleged instability has prevented active research in this direction for the past 20 – 25 years. Five newly designed synthetic germination stimulants were investigated as candidates for suicidal germination. An important issue is the persistence of these stimulants in soil. Packets with Striga spp. seeds were put in pots with soil and then treated with aqueous solutions of the stimulants. All five compounds induced germination under these conditions, with percentages varying between 18 % and 98 % depending on stimulant and species. There were no <b>noticeable</b> signs of <b>decomposition</b> of the stimulants. The best performing stimulant is derived from 1 -tetralone. We conclude that synthetic strigolactones analogues have excellent prospects for use in combating parasitic weeds. Further testing will be needed to evaluate whether such prospects can be realised in the field...|$|R
30|$|Compound I was {{dissolved}} in solution 1, 2, or 3 (3.0  mmol/L). Compound II was {{dissolved in}} each of all the reaction solutions (3.0  mmol/L) at 50  °C for 180  min without any <b>noticeable</b> <b>decomposition.</b> This prepared reaction solution (5.0  mL) was poured into a stainless steel vessel (10  mL), and the vessel was immersed in an oil bath at a target temperature. The reactions of compound I were conducted at 120, 130, or 140  °C. On the other hand, the reactions of compound II were run at 140, 150, or 160  °C in solutions 1, 2, and 3, but only at 160  °C in solutions 4, 5, 6, and 7. Six vessels were prepared for conducting the reaction at a temperature for 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120  min. After the reaction, the vessel was immediately immersed in an ice water bath, and then, the lid was opened. Acetic acid was added to neutralize the solution followed by addition of a CH 3 OH solution of an internal standard compound, 4 -chlorophenol. The lid was closed for thorough shaking.|$|E
30|$|The {{lignocellulosic}} {{biomass is a}} {{cheap and}} plentiful source of energy, chemicals and materials present in the complex recalcitrant matrix. The current needs for non-fossil sources of energy and a strong development of biorefinery concept obligate to process biomass as an abundant feedstock. The classical methods of biomass pre-treatment are an interesting methodology to valorise biomass; however, drawbacks of these methods limit their wide application. That is why the emerging methodologies such as the application of ILs is a real alternative. The numerous literature reports on this subject prove these needs and demonstrate the enormous potential of ILs. However, the complexity of both the biomass matrix and ILs themselves makes the process very challenging. That is why {{a large number of}} issues must to be considered in the designing of this kind of process. Unfortunately, majority of literature reviews do not tackle main problems, instead focusing only on some aspects. The number of potentially available ILs allows assuming that “designer solvent – IL” can be found for each particular problem. However, following the literature reports someone may have an impression that only acetate and chloride-based ionic liquids exist. Of course some types of ILs might be preferential for some particular application; nevertheless, this should not limit the study to rediscover already existing ILs and their use in the biomass processing. It is especially weird as there are already successful examples of IL use in the biomass component processing with ILs characterised by favourable physico-chemical properties such as hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, viscosity, melting point and others [98]. Another important aspect related to the use of ILs in the fractionation of biomass is the stability of ILs. ILs are considered to be generally extremely stable [10]. Although it must be understood that the IL thermal stability measurements usually performed using differential scanning calorimeter are mainly done for pure ILs in the continuously increasing temperature mode. So, it is clear that these experiments do not represent the conditions of the process with biomass. Pre-treatment of biomass in ILs is always a time consuming process that takes from minutes to dozen of hours and it takes place in the presence of contaminants present in biomass, namely water, acids and degradation products released from hemicellulose hydrolysis upon pre-treatment. Definitively, under these much harsher conditions, the stability of ILs might be completely different, especially for ILs containing a relatively strong base, such as [CH 3 COO] (pKa[*]=[*] 4.77) [99] that show the slow, but <b>noticeable</b> <b>decomposition</b> after prolonged time [25, 100].|$|E
