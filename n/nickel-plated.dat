5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a <b>nickel-plated</b> pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{the high}} price of nickel has led to some {{replacement}} of the metal in coins around the world. Coins still made with nickel alloys include one- and two-euro coins, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ U.S. coins, and 20p, 50p, £1 and £2 UK coins. Nickel-alloy in 5p and 10p UK coins was replaced with <b>nickel-plated</b> steel began in 2012, causing allergy problems for some people and public controversy.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is slowly}} {{oxidized}} by air {{at room temperature}} and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. <b>Nickel-plated</b> objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a <b>nickel-plated</b> revolver, {{although}} other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, <b>nickel-plated</b> faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|This {{weak point}} in the wiring also ran near a {{junction}} in an ethylene glycol/water cooling line that had been prone to leaks. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the silver anode was discovered at MSC on May 29, 1967 to be a hazard capable of causing a violent exothermic reaction, igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's pure oxygen atmosphere. Experiments at the Illinois Institute of Technology confirmed the hazard existed for silver-plated wires, but not for copper-only or <b>nickel-plated</b> copper. In July, ASPO directed both North American and Grumman to ensure no silver or silver-coated electrical contacts existed {{in the vicinity of}} possible glycol spills in the Apollo spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Slovakia {{has offered}} to mint the coins, and has {{provided}} prototypes. The coins of up to 5 kopeks are struck in copper-plated steel; the 10, 20, 50 kopeks coins are struck in brass-plated steel; the 1 ruble coin in a <b>nickel-plated</b> steel composition and 2 rubles coin in a bi-metallic format (with a brass-plated steel ring and a <b>nickel-plated</b> steel center plug). All coins show the National emblem of Belarus, the inscription 'БЕЛАРУСЬ' (Belarus) and the year of minting on their obverse. The reverse shows {{the value of the}} coin accompanied by different ornaments with their own meanings.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{attempts at}} hip replacement {{were carried out}} in Germany in 1891 by Themistocles Gluck (1853–1942), who used ivory to replace the femoral head (the ball on the femur), attaching it with <b>nickel-plated</b> screws, Plaster of Paris, and glue.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, 5p and 10p coins {{have been}} issued in <b>nickel-plated</b> steel, {{and much of the}} {{remaining}} cupronickel types withdrawn, in order to retrieve more expensive metals. The new coins are 11% thicker to maintain the same weight.|$|E
25|$|The coins {{that are}} {{currently}} in circulation are one ban, made of copper-plated steel; five bani, made of copper-plated steel; ten bani in <b>nickel-plated</b> steel; and fifty bani in aluminum-bronze. These were first introduced into circulation in 2005 with the fourth revaluation and are all currently valid.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, the Mint {{produced}} trade {{dollars for}} Canadian Tire which temporarily replaced their regular $1 coupons. The initiative {{called for the}} production of 2.5 million <b>nickel-plated</b> steel tokens, as well as 9,000 brass-plated steel tokens. As part of the limited-time offer, the trade dollars were distributed in 475 stores nationwide.|$|E
25|$|A pair of Cimarron Single Action revolvers {{were used}} by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1995 film The Quick and the Dead. They were <b>nickel-plated,</b> {{engraved}} and serial numbered as #C06477 and #C06073. Cimarron furnished the working prop guns for AMC's western series Hell on Wheels and the 2003 motion picture Open Range.|$|E
25|$|All coins below 1 markka {{had ceased}} to be {{produced}} by 1948. In 1952, a new coinage was introduced, with smaller iron (later <b>nickel-plated)</b> 1- and 5=markka coins alongside aluminium-bronze 10-, 20- and 50-markka coins and (from 1956) silver 100- and 200-markka denominations. This coinage continued to be issued until {{the introduction of the}} new markka in 1963.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents, and 1 dollar. The 1 cent coin was struck in bronze, with the others struck in cupro-nickel. In 1989, bronze-plated steel replaced bronze. A 2 dollar coin was introduced in 1997. In 2001, <b>nickel-plated</b> steel replaced cupro-nickel in the 10, 20 and 50 cents and 1 dollar coins, and a bimetallic 5 dollar coin was introduced. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced plans for new Z$5,000 and Z$10,000 coins in June 2005, although these were never actually struck.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 thebe and 1 pula. The 1 thebe was struck in aluminium, with the 5 thebe in bronze and the others in cupro-nickel. These coins were round except for the scalloped 1 pula. Bronze, dodecagonal 2 thebe coins {{were introduced}} in 1981 and discontinued after 1985. In 1991, bronze-plated steel replaced bronze in the 5 thebe, <b>nickel-plated</b> steel replaced cupro-nickel in the 10, 25 and 50 thebe and the 1 pula changed to a smaller, nickel-brass, equilateral-curve seven-sided coin. A similarly shaped, nickel-brass 2 pula was introduced in 1994. In 2004, the composition was changed to brass-plated steel and the size was slightly reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of the Army measures 80 × 120cm, white with the Army {{coat of arms}} in the centre, trimmed with gold fringe. The name of the service is inscribed in gold letters on a green scroll beneath the shield. Above the shield is a knight's helmet with red and sky blue mantling. The staff is topped by a <b>nickel-plated</b> lance-head finial, 32cm high. Below the lance-head, there is a cravat (laço militar) divided lengthwise, sky blue and red, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Southern Cross in white stars, red, and blue. Ten red streamers with campaign honours inscribed in sky blue letters are also attached below the lance-head. The staff is 212cm long, not including the lance-head, and 3.5cm in diameter. It is covered in sky blue velvet with a red spiral strip. The colour belt is 10cm in width, covered with sky blue velvet with red velvet stripes. The Navy's flag uses dark blue colours, the Air Force flag ultramarine blue.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{aluminium}} 1-, 2-, and 5-fen coins began {{being struck}} for circulation, and were first introduced in 1955. These depict the national emblem on the obverse (front) {{and the name}} and denomination framed by wheat stocks on the reverse (back). In 1980, brass 1-, 2-, and 5-jiao and cupro-nickel 1-yuan coins were added, although the 1 and 2 jiao were only produced until 1981, with the last 5 jiao and 1 yuan issued in 1985. All jiao coins depicted similar designs to the fen coins while the yuan depicted the Great Wall of China. In 1991, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of an aluminium 1 jiao, brass 5 jiao and nickel-clad-steel 1 yuan. These were smaller than the previous jiao and yuan coins and depicted flowers on the obverse and the national emblem on the reverse. Issuance of the aluminum 1- and 2-fen coins ceased in 1991, {{with that of the}} 5 fen halting in 1994. The small coins were still made for annual uncirculated mint sets in limited quantities, and from the beginning of 2005 the 1-fen coin got {{a new lease on life}} by being issued again every year since then up to present. New designs of the 1 and 5 jiao and 1 yuan were again introduced in between 1999 and 2002, with the 1 jiao being significantly reduced in size. In 2005, the metallic composition of the 1 jiao was changed from aluminum to more durable <b>nickel-plated</b> steel. The frequency of usage of coins varies between different parts of China, with coins typically being more popular in urban areas, and small notes being more popular in rural areas. Older fen and large jiao coins are uncommonly still seen in circulation but are still valid in exchange.|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, the Mint {{released}} its next Biennial report {{in response to}} the CMOCA. In it, the Mint declared that plated zinc products did not hold up to steam/wear tests and were rejected for US coins other than the penny. Materials considered [...] "feasible" [...] for the 5-cent coin were <b>nickel-plated</b> steel, multi-ply-plated steel, and potentially another copper/nickel alloy, this time with ~77% copper, ~20% nickel, and ~3% manganese. Further testing was recommended to explore even less expensive alloys that would not require changes to vending machines (as the steel-based materials would require).|$|E
500|$|Witness C. H. [...] "Ham" [...] Light saw Tom {{running or}} {{stumbling}} westward on Fremont Street towards Third Street, {{away from the}} gunfight, while Frank and Billy were still standing and shooting. Light testified that Tom fell {{at the foot of}} a telegraph pole on the corner of Fremont and 3rd Street and lay there, without moving, through the duration of the fight. Fallehy also saw Tom stagger across the street until he fell on his back. After shooting Tom, Holliday tossed the empty shotgun aside, pulled out his <b>nickel-plated</b> revolver, and continued to fire at Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton.|$|E
500|$|Jim had a {{collection}} of old, 78 rpm records that he would often play, or perform his musical [...] "party-pieces"—the hits of the time—on the piano. He used {{to point out the}} different instruments in songs on the radio to his sons, and took them to local brass band concerts. Jim also taught them a basic idea of harmony between instruments, and Paul credits Jim's tuition as being helpful when later singing harmonies with Lennon. After Mary's death, Jim bought Paul a <b>nickel-plated</b> trumpet as a birthday present. When skiffle music became popular, Paul swapped the trumpet for a £15 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar. Paul also played his father's Framus Spanish guitar when writing early songs with Lennon.|$|E
500|$|The {{initiator}} {{used in the}} implosion {{design of}} the Fat Man bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was code-named [...] "urchin". In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of the explosion, the initiator had to emit a large number of neutrons in a few microseconds while the plutonium core was fully compressed. At the heart of the urchin was a solid beryllium sphere [...] in diameter. This was gold-plated and coated with [...] of polonium. The gold kept the polonium's alpha particles from striking the beryllium. [...] This fitted inside two beryllium hemispheres with 15 parallel grooves cut into the inner surface. These grooves converted the shock wave of the implosion into jets that shattered the spheres and caused the beryllium and polonium to mix and emit neutrons. The hemispheres were <b>nickel-plated</b> and the outer surface was coated in gold and [...] of polonium. The [...] initiator, which was hot to the touch, fitted neatly inside the [...] hole {{in the center of the}} plutonium pit.|$|E
500|$|McCartney's {{father was}} a trumpet player and pianist, who had led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room, {{encouraged}} his sons to be musical and advised Paul to take piano lessons, but Paul preferred to learn by ear. He gave Paul a <b>nickel-plated</b> trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model17) acoustic guitar, since {{he wanted to be}} able to sing while playing. He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song, [...] "I Lost My Little Girl", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him, and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol; [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition.|$|E
500|$|As usual, the Earps {{carried their}} revolvers in their coat pockets {{or in their}} waistbands. Wyatt Earp was {{carrying}} a [...]44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a <b>nickel-plated</b> pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down {{the south side of}} Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, [...] "For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!" [...] Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, [...] "I have disarmed them." [...] Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys [...] "for the purpose of disarming them," [...] not that he'd actually disarmed them. One eye witness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, wrote in his testimony afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, [...] "those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but I will kill them on sight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Franklins {{were often}} rather odd-looking cars, {{although}} some were distinctly handsome with Renault-style hoods. Starting in 1925, at the demand of dealers, Franklins were redesigned {{to look like}} conventional cars sporting a massive <b>nickel-plated</b> [...] "dummy radiator" [...] which served as an air intake and was called a [...] "hoodfront." [...] This design by [...] enabled the Franklin to employ classic styling. The same year, Franklin introduced the boat-tail to car design.|$|E
2500|$|Other platings {{used are}} OSP (organic surface protectant), {{immersion}} silver (IAg), immersion tin, electroless nickel with immersion gold coating (ENIG), electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold (ENEPIG) and direct gold plating (over nickel). [...] Edge connectors, placed along one edge of some boards, are often <b>nickel-plated</b> then gold-plated. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.|$|E
2500|$|On May 21, 1874, First Daughter Nellie Grant married Algernon Charles Frederick Sartoris (August 1, 1851 – February 3, 1893), {{a wealthy}} English singer, son of Adelaide Kemble and nephew {{of the famous}} actress Fanny Kemble. [...] It was the first really grand White House wedding. [...] The East Room redecorated entirely for the occasion. [...] Andrew Jackson’s three chandeliers were {{replaced}} by much grander “French” models, boasting thousands of glass pieces showered over a <b>nickel-plated</b> framework, with gas flames shaded by cut and frosted glass shades.|$|E
2500|$|The Tony Award {{medallion}} {{was designed}} by art director Herman Rosse and {{is a mix of}} mostly brass and a little bronze, with a nickel plating on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the <b>nickel-plated</b> pewter swivel. The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks. [...] Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner's name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{towards the}} stern on the boiler deck was the ladies saloon, which {{included}} six rooms, painted {{in a different}} color from the dining room. [...] One of the rooms had been fitted up as a ladies toilet, in which the pumps kept “continuous jets of water playing, while the boat is in motion, so that no offensive effluvia taints these sumptuous cabins.” [...] During winter, this area was heated by a steam radiator covered a marble slab. [...] At night the room was lit by <b>nickel-plated</b> lamps.|$|E
2500|$|A samovar (...) is a {{traditional}} Kashmiri kettle used to brew, boil and serve Kashmiri salted tea (Noon Chai) and kahwa. Kashmiri samovars are made of copper with engraved or embossed calligraphic motifs. In fact in Kashmir, there were two variants of Samovar. The copper Samovar was used by Muslims and that of Brass was used by local Hindus called Kashmiri Pandit. The brass Samovars were <b>nickel-plated</b> inside. Inside a samovar there is a fire-container in which charcoal and live coals are placed. Around the fire-container there is a space for water to boil. Tea leaves, sugar, cardamom, and cinnamon are put into the water.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, a {{new series}} of coins was issued in {{denominations}} of 5, 15, & 25 bani and 1, & 3 lei struck in <b>nickel-plated</b> steel. Starting in 1966, the name on all coins was changed to [...] "Republica Socialista Romania" [...] following the ascent of Nicolae Ceaușescu, though all pre-1966 coins of these denominations remained valid. In 1975, the composition of 5 & 15 bani coins was changed to aluminum, and the 25 bani followed suit in 1982. In 1978, an aluminum 5 Lei coin was introduced. These denominations remained in use until 1991, particularly the 5 lei following the lifting of state mandated exchange rates and price controls.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{witnesses}} offered varying {{stories about}} Holliday's actions. Cowboys witnesses testified that Holliday first {{pulled out a}} <b>nickel-plated</b> pistol {{he was known to}} carry, while others reported he first fired a longer, bronze-colored gun, possibly the coach gun. Holliday killed Tom McLaury with a shotgun blast in the side of his chest. Holliday was grazed by a bullet possibly fired by Frank McLaury who was on Fremont Street at the time. He supposedly challenged Holliday, [...] yelling, [...] "I've got you now!" [...] Holliday is reported to have replied, [...] "Blaze away! You're a daisy if you have." [...] McLaury died of shots to his stomach and behind his ear. Holliday may have also wounded Billy Clanton.|$|E
