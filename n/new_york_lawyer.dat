500|$|Willkie did {{not enter}} the Republican primaries, placing his hope in a deadlocked convention. His {{campaign}} was composed mostly of political amateurs. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>lawyer</b> Orem Root, Jr. (grandnephew of former Secretary of State Elihu Root) formed a network of local Willkie Clubs, which attracted a large membership among Republicans discontented with their leadership and seeking a new figure who might beat Roosevelt. [...] He especially appealed to liberal, Eastern Establishment Republicans who saw none of the declared candidates to their liking. His rumpled suits, country-style haircut, and Indiana twang were reminiscent of ordinary midwesterners, which led to some derision as the efforts to nominate him became more obvious. Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes mocked Willkie as [...] "a simple, barefoot Wall Street lawyer". Alice Roosevelt Longworth stated that the Willkie campaign came [...] "from the grass roots of ten thousand country clubs".|$|E
500|$|The Feast of the Goat {{begins with}} the return of Urania to her {{hometown}} of Santo Domingo, a city which had been renamed Ciudad Trujillo during Trujillo's time in power. This storyline is largely introspective and deals with Urania's memories and her inner turmoil over the events preceding her departure from the Dominican Republic thirty-five years earlier. Urania escaped the crumbling Trujillo regime in 1961 by claiming she planned to study under a tutelage of nuns in Michigan. [...] In the following decades, she becomes a prominent and successful <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>lawyer.</b> She finally returns to the Dominican Republic in 1996, on a whim, and finds herself compelled to confront her father and elements of her past she has long ignored. As Urania speaks to her ailing father, Agustin Cabral, she recalls {{more and more of the}} anger and disgust that led to her thirty-five years of silence. Urania retells her father's descent into political disgrace, while revealing the betrayal that forms a crux between both Urania's storyline and that of Trujillo himself.|$|E
500|$|Hand {{continued}} to be disappointed in his progress at work. A move to the firm of Gould & Wilkie in January 1904 brought neither the challenges nor the financial rewards {{for which he had}} hoped. [...] "I was never any good as a lawyer," [...] he later admitted. [...] "I didn't have any success, any at all." [...] In 1907, deciding that at the age of 35 success as a Wall Street lawyer was out of reach, he lobbied for a potential new federal judgeship in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the federal court headquartered in Manhattan. He became involved briefly in local Republican politics to strengthen his political base. In the event, Congress did not create the new judgeship in 1907; but, when the post was finally created in 1909, Hand renewed his candidacy. With the help of the influential Charles C. Burlingham, a senior <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>lawyer</b> and close friend, he gained the backing of Attorney General George W. Wickersham, who urged President William Howard Taft to appoint Hand. One of the youngest federal judges ever appointed, Hand took his judicial oath at age 37 in April 1909.|$|E

500|$|Urania Cabral and {{her father}} Agustín Cabral appear in both the modern day and {{historical}} portions of the novel. [...] In the year 1996, Urania returns to the Dominican Republic {{for the first time}} since her departure at the age of 14. [...] She is a successful <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>lawyer</b> who has spent most of the past 35 years trying to overcome the traumas of her childhood, a goal she pursues through an academic fascination with Trujillo and Dominican history. [...] Urania is deeply troubled by the events of her past, and is compelled to confront her father Agustín about his role in those events. [...] Urania visits her father, finding him weakened by age and a severe stroke, so much so that he is barely able to respond physically to her presence, let alone speak. [...] Agustín listens helplessly as Urania recounts his past as [...] "Egghead Cabral", a high-ranking member of Trujillo's inner circle, and his drastic fall from grace. [...] Urania details Agustín's role in the events that led to her rape by the Dominican leader, and to her subsequent lifetime of celibacy and emotional trauma. Agustín's character in the modern day portion of the novel serves primarily as a sounding board for Urania's recollections of the Trujillo era and the events that surrounded both Agustín Cabral's disgrace and Urania's escape from the country. [...] His responses are minimal and non-vocal, despite the ardency of Urania's accusations and the enormity of his own actions during Trujillo's reign.|$|E
