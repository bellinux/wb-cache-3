2500|$|Depending {{on how a}} court construes negotiations, a {{representation}} could become a term of the contract, {{as well as one}} giving rise to the right to rescind. A misrepresentation that is a term, will entitle the misrepresentee to a simple breach of contract claim, with [...] "expectation damages" [...] for loss of potential profits (subject to remoteness and the duty to mitigate). If the misrepresentation is not a term, then damages may also be available, but only [...] "reliance damages" [...] for losses that have been incurred. Until 1963, the general rule was that only for fraud (i.e. an intentional or reckless misrepresentation) were damages available. For fraud, damages are available for all losses that flow directly from the misrepresentation. However, in its Tenth Report the Law Reform Committee recommended that damages should also be available for negligent misrepresentations. This led to the drafting of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, and just before the Act was passed, the House of Lords also decided in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd there should be a new claim for negligent misrepresentation at common law. While Hedley Byrne remains an important case for an independent action in tort, MA 1967 section 2(1) was instantly more generous than the common law. It allows damages if the claimant shows a defendant has made a false representation, and then the defendant cannot prove that they had reasonable grounds for making a statement and honestly believed it was true. So while the common law would put the burden of proof on a claimant to show a defendant made a negligent misstatement, MA 1967 s 2(1) shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. The measure of damages is also more generous under the Act than at common law, because just as the Law Reform Report was drafted, the House of Lords was introducing a limit on the quantum of damages for negligence to losses that are reasonably foreseeable. MA 1967 section 2(1), however, was drafted by reference to state the same damages were available as for fraud. So in Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson, the Court of Appeal held that even where {{a representation}} is negligent, and not fraud, the same quantum of damages is available as for fraud. This is controversial among academics who argue that fraud is more morally culpable than <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and should therefore deserve a more severe limit on compensation, though it is not entirely resolved what the proper circumstances for remoteness ought to be. Under section 2(2) the court has the discretion to substitute the right to rescind a contract for a small misrepresentation with an award of damages. Under section 3, a court has the power to strike down clauses excluding remedies for misrepresentation if they fail the reasonableness test in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|E

This thesis details the design, implementation and assessment of a sports-action hockey video game that aims to reduce the aggressive and <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{that can lead to}} concussions. The game, termed Heads Up Hockey, was designed to modify game playing behaviour by embedding an implicit teaching mechanism within the gameplay. Educational games often suffer from the problem of indirection, that is, the content the learner is intended to learn is indirectly related to the gameplay. With Heads Up Hockey, participants were expected to learn by simply playing to win, in contrast to playing to learn. The 21 participants in the experimental learning group significantly improved their mean score on a composite behaviour indicator (p = 0. 0002) compared with no significant change amongst the 21 control group participant...|$|R

40|$|Roman jurists {{stated that}} the {{reparation}} or compensation for tortious damage had already been envisaged by the Twelve Tables. In the classical age, the judge envisaged actiones utiles and actiones in factum as reparation for damage inflicted upon property either by failure to act or indirectly. In the Justinian Code the actio legis Aquiliae was considered the general reparation or compensation for any damage caused by <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviours.</b> In fact, the requirements for reparation and compensation have been considered and defined by courts {{as early as the}} lex Aquilia. Thanks to the Roman jurists, the actio legis Aquiliae has become a general form of compensation for any damage, based on the criterion of negligence viewed as the lack of due diligence. This structure was transposed in the fundamental text related to compensation for damage in the Canon law, namely the Si culpa tua. Canon 128 of the code in force has reintroduced in the Canon law a provision which lays down the general obligation of compensation for damage. In particular, the Sacred Roman Rota case law pointed {{to the fact that the}} damage affecting individuals’ interests had to be unfair, linked to the damaging behaviour by means of an efficient chain of causation and be caused by legal negligence. In its turn, the Canon law had its own impact, thus contributing to the evolution of the provisions on reparation and compensation laid down by the jus commune developed by the jusnaturalistic legal theory. In more recent legal literature, the Canon law reveals more clearly the trends which affect the interpretation and practical implementation of the Justinian legal sources, in line with the general guidelines and mindset of the time. With a view to fully understanding the fundamental aspects of the provisions regarding reparation and compensation for damage, in my thesis I have examined the origins of this institution which I found at first in the Roman law and subsequently in the Roman canon law, without losing sight of its concurrent development in the civil law systems...|$|R

Byng was brought home to be tried by court-martial for breach of the Articles of War, which had recently been revised to mandate capital punishment for officers who did not do their utmost against the enemy, either in battle or pursuit. The revision followed an event in 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession, when a young lieutenant named Baker Phillips was court-martialled and shot after his ship was captured by the French. His captain had done nothing to prepare the vessel for action and was killed almost immediately by a broadside. Taking command, the inexperienced junior officer was forced to surrender the ship when {{she could no longer}} be defended. The <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Phillips's captain was noted by the subsequent court martial and a recommendation for mercy was entered, but Phillips' sentence was approved by the Lords Justices of Appeal. This sentence angered some of parliament, who felt that an officer of higher rank would likely have been spared or else given a light punishment, and that Phillips had been executed because he was a powerless junior officer and thus a useful scapegoat. The Articles of War were amended to become one law for all: the death penalty for any officer of any rank who did not do his utmost against the enemy in battle or pursuit.|$|E

These networks are still vulnerable to attacks, for instance DOS attacks which affects the availability of the wireless network.

50|$|On May 31, 2006, Local 113 {{published}} an attack ad against the commission chair Howard Moscoe, Mayor Miller, and Rick Ducharme, chief-general {{manager of the}} TTC.

After Moscoe rebuked the ad with scathing criticisms of its accuracy, Lowe himself visited the former in his city hall office, illustrating his discontent over the allegations. Moscoe later retracted most of his comments. Some saw the attack ad as the essential variable that legitimized the wildcat strike, while others saw it as the union’s complacency over other contentious issues such as the state of janitorial and mechanical workers; an issue that was seen as less media friendly in comparison to the matter of operator safety. It had also been suggested that if the union moved forward with a similar Public Relations campaign before the wildcat strike, they would have received more sympathy from the public.

40|$|Several {{elements}} must {{be shown}} to be fulfilled for a court to hold that negligence has occurred, and a person is liable. One of these elements is 'causation', the idea that there must be a causal link between the claimant's loss and the <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the defendant. This article considers the application of the tests of factual and legal causation to cases of medical negligence. It is argued that in light of the recent development of a number of exceptional approaches to factual causation, each relating to a particular causal problem, the causal process must be identified in any given case so that the correct test for factual causation can be applied. This is illustrated by reference to MRSA claims. It is further argued that where the negligence consists of misdiagnosis or mistreatment of existing illness the causal problem is unique to medical negligence and demands a unique approach to causation. The 'scope of duty' test for legal causation is illustrated in a medical context and it is argued that where the negligence consists of a failure to warn the patient of the risks involved in treatment, although the harm is clearly within the scope of the doctor's duty, it is wrong to establish liability in the absence of factual causation.

40|$|A {{well known}} {{result in the}} {{economics}} of tort law {{is that in the}} case of a unilateral stochastic externality both a negligence rule and strict liability are in general able to achieve socially optimal precaution. It will be shown in this paper that this equivalence result does no longer hold if imperfect information and multidimensional pollution control activities are considered. It will turn out that a negligence rule may in fact have an adverse effect on the incentives of a potential polluter, causing an uncertain environmental damage, to take appropriate precaution. The change in incentives can be attributed to two effects: immunisation from potential liability and sharpening of incentives for observable precaution diverting effort from unobservable to observable precaution. A standard of negligence tends to distort the choice among different > strategies available in reduction of environmental risks, when pollution control efforts are imperfectly observable to differing degrees. This distortionary effect prevails to an even larger extent if there is no uncertainty with respect to the findings of negligence. Hence, in contrast to one-dimensional models of uncertain negligence, the model presented in this paper implies that when the set of possible strategies in reducing environmental risk is somewhat richer than just a onedimensional decision, uncertainty in verifying the <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviour</b> may actually improve incentives to take preventive pollution control measures compared to a certain standard of due care. Moreover, the polluter's response to changes in the policy parameters are no longer clear-cut in the way that is indicated by the standard model. Under some circumstances, an increase in the standard of negligence may lead to a decline in the level of precautionary pollution control. Therefore, the environmental policy maker has to be very careful when deciding on an optimal second best policy consisting of a divergence of the standard of negligence from the socially optimal level. ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{researcher}} {{has attempted to}} ascertain what counts as legitimate restrictions by the employer on the free speech rights of Canadian public school teachers {{from the perspectives of}} employment law and constitutional law. In the employment context, school boards may restrict: dishonest speech which undermines trust, uncooperative speech which interferes with effectiveness and efficiency or which is abusive, disloyal speech which unjustifiably harms school boards' legitimate business interests, and disobedient speech which defies employers' authority. In other circumstances, however, employment law recognizes and protects teacher expression in spite of teachers' employment duties. Thus, employers are not allowed to interdict: speech solely because it is idiosyncratic or unconventional, appropriate banter with students, teachers who criticize their employers for illegal and <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and direct and forthright speech in the collective bargaining context. Under employment law, it is still unclear whether teachers can speak out responsibly on matters of public interest without violating their duty of loyalty or whether teachers can exercise some degree of academic freedom without undermining their duty of obedience. In both cases, {{the researcher}} argues for increased protection. First, as professionals, teachers possess expertise and a relevant insiders' perspective which have the potential to inform debate on issues of public concern. Second, as educators, teachers are called to prepare our students for citizenship in our democracy by teaching them how to think critically. Under constitutional law, and generally speaking, the Charter is unlikely to alter the employment law analysis and corresponding protection of teachers' expressive rights for three main reasons. First, adjudicators are likely to adopt a reasonableness-based approach to s. 1 analysis based on the Supreme Court of Canada's landmark decision in Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15 (1996) [...] the leading judgment on teachers' free speech rights under the Charter. Second, when governments act as both employer and state agent, as opposed to state agent alone, adjudicators will be more inclined to accept employer arguments based on pragmatic and utilitarian considerations, like efficiency and effectiveness, as constituting reasonable grounds for restricting teachers' speech. Third, adjudicators will examine the nature of teacher expression to determine whether it advances the core values underlying s. 2 (b) expression: pursuit of truth, political participation, and self-fulfillment/autonomy. As a general rule, one can argue that dishonest, uncooperative, disloyal, and disobedient expression are unlikely to implicate core Charter values. Yet, the Charter does have the potential to enhance protection of teachers' free speech rights in two particular areas. First, the Charter may change the analysis when teachers speak out on issues of public concern in a reasonable and controlled way. Second, the Charter may make a difference when teachers attempt to exercise some measure of academic freedom in a professionally responsible manner. In the first scenario, political speech is at stake. In the second scenario, the search for truth (and to a diminished degree political participation self-fulfillment/autonomy) is involved. In both cases, fundamental core Charter values are at issue. Hence, adjudicators may require employers to demonstrate a higher standard of justification, in these specific circumstances, before they accept arguments limiting teachers' freedom of expression.

Non compliance of these rigid formalities in the past had the effect that a testator's last wishes were not respected and executed. As a result thereof, thousands of beneficiaries have not received the inheritance they would have been entitled to if the will of the testator was valid. For the above mentioned reason, section 2 (3) of the Wills Act relaxed the strict approach of the past. If any of the formalities relating to the drafting or {{execution of}} a will have not been complied with, the court is empowered to order the Master of the High Court to accept, for the purpose of the Administration of Estates Act 66 of 1965, a document drafted or executed by a person who has since died, as a will. Only non-compliance of the formalities for drafting or executing a valid will can be condoned under this section and the court has no power to grant an order relating to the competency of a testator to draft a will. The court, furthermore, has no discretion to dismiss an order under this section if the court is satisfied that the document was drafted or executed by a person who has since passed away and it is clear that the testator's intention was that the invalid document be his/her last will and testament. If the court dismisses such an application then there is a possibility that certain of the beneficiaries nominated in the invalid will, will be entitled to a smaller portion (if any) of the deceased's estate under the rules of intestate succession than the portion he/she would have been entitled to as a testamentary beneficiary. If the invalid will is a direct result of the drafter failing to foresee to the valid drafting or execution thereof, then the disappointed beneficiary has a delictual claim against the guilty/negligent drafter. This quantum of this claim will be calculated using the difference of the portion that the disappointed beneficiary receives as an intestate heir and the portion he/she would have been entitled to as a testamentary beneficiary. There is no real contractual bond between the drafter and the beneficiaries under a will and, therefore, a contractual claim will only arise in rare circumstances. A delictual claim in these circumstances will be based on the basic principles of the South African delictual law namely, act/ommissio, unlawfulness, guilt, causality and damage. These five elements have to be present for the disappointed beneficiary to have a successful claim. The disappointed beneficiary must ie. prove that the drafter of the will had a legal duty to comply with the formalities when he assisted the testator with the drafting and execution of the invalid will and that the economic loss that the disappointed beneficiary suffered is a direct result of the <b>negligent</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the drafter. A disappointed beneficiary should only follow the litigation route if an application under section 2 (3) was dismissed due to the costs and long waiting periods thereof. Practitioners assisting forthcoming testators should be aware that the action of a disappointed beneficiary has been acknowledged in the South African law. Practitioners should take extra care with each new instruction to avoid delictual liability of any kind. Master...|$|E
