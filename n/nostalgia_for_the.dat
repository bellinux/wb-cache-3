5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse {{is associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of the}} Beatles since 1966, and the public's <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' {{dissatisfaction with}} the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for {{protection}} were combined with <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> period of Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E

50|$|The {{party has}} praised and shown <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> {{military}} dictatorship of Axis ally Ion Antonescu, whom they consider a hero {{or even a}} saint, and the communist regime of Ceaușescu. The party rejected the 2006 Tismăneanu report on the communist dictatorship in Romania as a manipulation of history.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{focuses on}} <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> childhood, <b>the</b> {{pressure}} of adulthood, and family relationships, it speaks {{from the point}} of view of [...] "Blurryface", the album's titular character. The line, [...] "My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think" [...] is heard in the pre-chorus, alluding to marketing <b>the</b> duo did <b>for</b> <b>the</b> album.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Heian period, the {{aristocracy}} lost political and economical power to warrior clans, but retained the prestige as custodians of high culture and literature. <b>Nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Heian court past, considered then as classical Japanese past (as opposed to Chinese past), created a renaissance in the arts and led to a blossoming of waka in the early Kamakura period. Poets of middle and lower rank, such as Fujiwara no Shunzei, Saigyō Hōshi and Fujiwara no Teika, analyzed earlier works, wrote critical commentaries, and added new aesthetic values such as yūgen to waka poetry. Some of the best imperial anthologies and best poetic anthologies, such as Shunzei's Korai fūteishō, were created in the early Kamakura period. The audience was extended from {{the aristocracy}} to high ranking warriors and priests, who began to compose waka.|$|E
5|$|In 1085, when Alexios {{recovered}} the strategically important Adriatic {{port city of}} Dyrrhachium from the Normans who had occupied it, John Doukas was installed as the military governor (doux) of the local province. John remained there until 1092, when he was replaced by John Komnenos, {{the son of the}} emperor's brother, the sebastokrator Isaac. His tenure was apparently very successful. John repelled the Serbian incursions from Duklja and Raška, and even, according to Anna Komnene, captured the Dukljan king Constantine Bodin (r. 1081–1101), before restoring him to power as a client of the Byzantine Empire. Thus John managed to restore order in the region of Albania and Dalmatia, which had suffered greatly during the Byzantine–Norman wars of the previous years. Surviving correspondence from the archbishop Theophylact of Ohrid is a testimony to his success; after John's departure from the post, Theophylact expressed <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time of his governorship and asked for his advice.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1999, Monster Ballads, {{a series}} of {{compilation}} albums that feature popular power ballads, usually from the glam metal genre, capitalized on the nostalgia, with the first volume going platinum. The VH1 sponsored Rock Never Stops Tour, beginning in 1998, has seen many glam metal bands take to the stage again, including on the inaugural tour: Warrant, Slaughter, Quiet Riot, FireHouse, and L.A. Guns. Slaughter also {{took part in the}} 1999 version with Ted Nugent, Night Ranger, and Quiet Riot. Poison and Cinderella toured together in 2000 and 2002, and in 2005 Cinderella headlined the Rock Never Stops Tour, with support from Ratt, Quiet Riot, and FireHouse. In 2007 the four-day-long Rocklahoma festival held in Oklahoma included glam metal bands Poison, Ratt and Twisted Sister. Warrant and Cinderella co-headlined the festival in 2008. <b>Nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> genre was evidenced in the production of the glam metal themed musical Rock of Ages, which ran in Los Angeles in 2006 and in New York in 2008. It was made into a film released in 2012.|$|E
50|$|In 1806, Master Valentim {{added the}} final touch {{to the park}} — two granite pyramids with medallions made of Portuguese Lioz stone, one with the {{inscription}} Saudade do Rio (<b>Nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> Rio) and <b>the</b> other Ao Amor do Público (To the Love of the People).|$|R
50|$|The band {{wrote the}} song in under an hour. According to {{frontman}} Ian Watkins, it is a song about <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> when <b>the</b> band were growing up together in their home town of Pontypridd, South Wales, and was originally inspired by the Shinobi arcade game they used {{to play at the}} Park View Café in Pontypridd. The song's name is derived from the video games Shinobi and Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja.|$|R
2500|$|In his {{examinations}} of shamanism, Eliade emphasizes the shaman's attribute of regaining man's condition before the [...] "Fall" [...] out of sacred time: [...] "The most representative mystical {{experience of the}} archaic societies, that of shamanism, betrays <b>the</b> <b>Nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> Paradise, <b>the</b> desire to recover the state of freedom and beatitude before 'the Fall'." [...] This concern—which, by itself, is the concern of almost all religious behavior, according to Eliade—manifests itself in specific ways in shamanism.|$|R
25|$|Remnants of {{contemporary}} culture accordingly appear as valued antiquities or sometimes just as unrecognized survivals, lending a rare feeling of <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{present to the}} stories.|$|E
25|$|During the {{following}} years produced the novel Rudin ("Рудин"), {{the story of a}} man in his thirties, who is unable to put his talents and idealism to any use in the Russia of Nicholas I. Rudin is also full of <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> idealistic student circles of the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|In 1858 Turgenev {{wrote the}} novel A Nest of the Gentry ("Дворянское гнездо") also full of <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> irretrievable past and {{of love for}} the Russian countryside. It {{contains}} {{one of his most}} memorable female characters, Liza, whom Dostoyevsky paid tribute to in his Pushkin speech of 1880, alongside Tatiana and Tolstoy's Natasha Rostova.|$|E
50|$|Schehadé {{published}} short-run booklets, {{which were}} largely autobiographical fictions, {{returning to her}} past and expressing in fluid poetic language her <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> Lebanon and <b>the</b> days of her childhood. Several of these short texts were collected in 1999 under the title Les Livres d'Anne; included is a historical depiction of violence in Lebanon.|$|R
50|$|Retrogaming {{has existed}} {{since the early}} years of the video game industry, but was popularized with the {{popularity}} of the Internet and emulation technology. It is argued that the main reasons players are drawn to retrogames are <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> different eras, <b>the</b> idea that older games can be more challenging, and the simplicity of the games that requires less hours of gameplay.|$|R
50|$|Entre el clavel y la espada (‘Between the Carnation and the Sword’) (1939-40). This {{collection}} gathers {{the poems}} that Alberti wrote in France and Argentina {{at the start}} of his long exile. It marks a change in style, <b>the</b> feel <b>for</b> a need to regain his discipline as a poet. As a result, it resembles Marinero en tierra in its formal approach - sonnets, cancionero-style poems etc. A key theme that emerges in this collection is a deep and abiding <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> Spain, <b>the</b> land from which he has been exiled.|$|R
25|$|One {{could say}} that the anxious search for the origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to {{penetrate}} and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> primordial, for the original universal matrix. Matter, Substance, represents the absolute origin, the beginning of all things.|$|E
25|$|The {{game has}} been met with near {{universal}} disapproval, citing {{a lack of}} gameplay depth, character customization, no story, and very expensive in app purchases for basic gameplay functionality. Positives mentioned were the humorous flavor text and <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> games the assets are drawn from. On April 11, 2013 the game was released on the Android platform in Japan and on September 12, 2013 in North America.|$|E
25|$|As each {{museum is}} an {{independent}} entity, their content varies widely; some cover one state or region, while others cover the entire eight-state route, and many extend to related topics varying from the pre-highway transportation history of a state to the Dust Bowl exodus of the Great Depression, the mobilization of soldiers and equipment for World War II or <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> post-war highway and classic cars of that era.|$|E
5000|$|Howard was {{a popular}} {{songwriter}} and singer, who later had a successful career capitalizing on <b>the</b> <b>nostalgia</b> many had <b>for</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Gay 90's". The series was a hit on radio, before premiering on television.|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{conceived}} as a concept album about <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> childhood, <b>the</b> concept was eventually dropped, though the original theme is still evident particularly in the title track and the album's major hit [...] "Our House". This theme was also mentioned recently when interviewed as part of T in The Park highlights, where their lead vocalist Suggs claimed that all the band members were told to write about their childhood memories <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Rise & Fall (although {{he did say that}} their keyboardist Mike Barson got the wrong idea, and went off and wrote about New Delhi).|$|R
40|$|The song {{tells the}} story of the {{resettlement}} of the residents of Merasheen Island, Placentia Bay, expressing <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> life on <b>the</b> island. "Merasheen Reunion 1980 " p. 64, ed. Pomroy, Loyola, and Bill Wilson. The song referes to the resettlement of the people of Merasheen Island in the late 1960 's. It was composed by Ernie Wilson and was made popular by his sister, Chris Rose, and exceptionally fine singer...|$|R
25|$|Standards {{usually do}} not come with {{fairings}} or windscreens, or if they have them, they are relatively small. Standard is often a synonym for naked bike, a term that became popular in the 1990s {{in response to the}} proliferation of fully faired sport bikes. The standard seemed to have disappeared, fueling <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which were admired for their simplicity, quality, and versatility.|$|E
25|$|After a {{successful}} {{tour in the}} British Isles, Brower returned to the United States and teamed with Emmett and other blackface performers for a time. In the 1850s, he left minstrelsy {{to work in the}} Tom shows based on Uncle Tom's Cabin. He returned to minstrelsy briefly as the decade closed and <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> old minstrel show came into fashion. In 1867, Brower retired from show business and opened a saloon.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 he published, in French, Nous l'avons tant aimée, la révolution (In English: We Loved It So Much, the Revolution), a book full of <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1968 counter-culture, and {{announced}} his shift toward more centrist policies. In 1989 he became deputy mayor of Frankfurt, {{in charge of}} multicultural affairs. Immigrants made up some 30% of the city's population at that time. He also developed a more tolerant policy towards drug addicts.|$|E
25|$|The bathers in Thomas Eakins's The Swimming Hole each {{represent}} different {{stage in}} the artist's life. He prepared for this canvas by taking multiple photographs of his students frolicking at this location- and overall portrays a happy physical unselfconsciousness seen through the perspective of age- a <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> youth. By <b>the</b> 1880s this <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> youth was a veneer carefully disguising a latent homosexuality. In contrast there were poets and painters who would contrast free young beauty of bodies in the water with the approaching grind of maturity and responsibility. Henry Tuke loved to paint naked bathers in a soft idealised style deliberately avoiding overt sexuality.|$|R
50|$|Ropartz's {{style is}} {{influenced}} by the form of Wagner's music dramas and the structural innovations of César Franck. Ropartz makes frequent use of leitmotives and also incorporates elements of Breton folk melodies to represent <b>the</b> hero's nostagia <b>for</b> his homeland. <b>The</b> critic Michel Fleury argues that the music is built around four main themes, one of which represents Iceland, and in particular the bog which plays a role in the narrative; one represents the main female character and the emotion of love associated with her; another represents the male character and his <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> Brittany. <b>The</b> fourth theme represents stability, associated with the heroine's father.|$|R
50|$|Nadjari's idea is {{that the}} digital age is an {{archiving}} system that enables any other format to fit, not technically, but more to integrate with the story we want to tell. It is thus possible to use almost any recording device and have it fit to a narrative integration. Here the film was about family and <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> film of <b>the</b> 70's, Super-8 film was the best format to fuse the format with its content.|$|R
25|$|Poventud {{wrote his}} first {{composition}} at age 14 titled Ya No Soy Un Niño. (I'm Not a Child Anymore). His primary inspirations were his deceased mother, his new reality in New York, a growing romanticism, and the melancholy of diaspora - a <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> island {{and the people}} that he'd left behind. In 1956, still at the age of 14, Poventud was invited to sing in the wedding of Grace Kelly and Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.|$|E
25|$|There {{was great}} <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> LaSalle name, and {{at various points}} in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, General Motors issued Motorama cars and {{proposed}} new consumer automobiles under the name. The year 1955 saw two Motorama concept cars, the LaSalle II four-door hardtop and the LaSalle II Roadster. Ordered to be destroyed, both the four-door hardtop and the roadster were shipped to the Warhoops Salvage Yard in Sterling Heights, MI. and instead hidden {{in a corner of}} the facility.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the major}} themes {{explored}} in Wendy Rose’s works are themes relating to the Native American experience (both specifically her own and also more broadly applied to other cultures of marginalization): colonialism, imperialism, dependency, <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> old ways, reverence for grandparents, resentment for conditions of the present, plight of reservation and urban Indians, sense of hopelessness, {{the power of the}} trickster, feminism as synonymous with heritage, deadly compromise, symbolism of all that has been lost (such as land), tension between the desire to retrieve the past and the inevitability of change, arrogance of white people, problems of half-breeds (or mixed-bloods).|$|E
5000|$|His laconic {{style has}} been {{compared}} to that of F. Scott Fitzgerald or Graham Greene, and he often adopts an ironic perspective on his often tragic subject matter, such as in Teheran, een zwanezang, a love story set against the background of the Iranian Revolution. Especially important in his work is the Netherlands Indies and the concept of (tempo dulu) [...] "Times Gone By", a <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> life in <b>the</b> former Dutch colonies in the East.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the events of Redemption Ark took place, the Plague was seen as less of a threat, though it was still {{considered}} dangerous. The Conjoiners in particular, {{being one of the}} only factions to have been relatively unaffected by the Plague, were adept at dealing with its various strains. This is demonstrated in a scene in Redemption Ark in which Galiana's lighthugger is brought into the Mother Nest of Epsilon Eridani. Conjoiner quarantine techniques include large amounts of complexly interlocking ceramic armour (amongst other things), which the Plague apparently cannot infect or penetrate. Later, Clavain is shown to be unworried about infection, maintaining his Conjoiner implants even while aboard <b>the</b> Plague-infested <b>Nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> Infinity. Other Conjoiners hold similar sentiments, including Remontoire and his soldiers (who install advanced weaponry on <b>the</b> <b>Nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> Infinity). <b>The</b> Conjoiners and Ultranauts are the only factions who continue to use their implants {{during the time of the}} Plague, because their relative isolation from other human societies greatly simplifies quarantine.|$|R
40|$|Nostalgia, {{a sentimental}} longing for one’s past, is an emotion that arises from self-relevant and social memories. Nostalgia functions, in part, to foster self-continuity, that is, {{a sense of}} {{connection}} between one’s past and one’s present. This article examined, in six experiments, how nostalgia fosters self-continuity {{and the implications of}} that process <b>for</b> wellbeing. <b>Nostalgia</b> fosters self-continuity by augmenting social connectedness, that is, a sense of belongingness and acceptance (Experiments 1 - 4). Nostalgia-induced self-continuity, in turn, confers eudaimonic wellbeing, operationalized as subjective vitality (i. e., a feeling of aliveness and energy; Experiments 5 - 6). The findings clarify and expand <b>the</b> benefits of <b>nostalgia</b> <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> self-system and psychological adjustment...|$|R
