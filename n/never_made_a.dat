5|$|Fahey {{started his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} trainee with Arsenal before signing for Aston Villa in April 2000 for a fee of £250,000. He played for Villa's youth and reserve teams, but <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> first-team appearance.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{started his}} career as a schoolboy at Arsenal, and after being {{released}} by the club he signed an apprenticeship with Newcastle United in 1995. He spent five years with the club, during which time he was loaned out seven times. He <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> first-team appearance for Newcastle, but appeared on the substitutes' bench on six occasions and eventually became captain of the reserve team.|$|E
5|$|Forster {{earned his}} first {{professional}} contract with Newcastle United, signing for their Academy in 2005. Forster was Newcastle's third choice goalkeeper in the 2007–08 season while Tim Krul was on loan at Falkirk, and played {{regularly in the}} reserves. However, in the six years he was signed to the club, Fraser <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> first-team appearance for Newcastle, mainly {{due to the fact}} that he spent most of his time on loan to other clubs, often lasting entire seasons.|$|E

5|$|Relative {{to their}} high standards, UConn {{struggled}} {{during the first}} two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> Final Four, something that has become almost routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E
5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E

5|$|Born in Lifford, County Donegal, Given's footballing {{career began}} at local amateur side Lifford Celtic where he shot to notoriety for conceding seven goals on his debut. He was {{propelled}} into the limelight {{when he played}} in an FAI Junior Cup semi-final for Lifford Celtic. At 14, his performances for the club attracted attention from Celtic, and {{he was invited to}} train with their youth side during a pre-season tour of Ireland in 1991. Given signed for the club a year later. Despite being named to the substitutes bench for the Old Firm derby against Rangers on 1 January 1994, Given <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> first-team appearance.|$|E
5|$|Joining the National Association Football League in 1917, the top {{flight of}} American {{association}} football, Pepper captained Bethlehem Steel to title wins {{in both the}} 1918-19 and 1919-20 campaigns, {{as well as to}} extending their title of the American Cup, winning the 1918 event 1–0 over Babcock & Wilcox and the 1919 trophy in a 2–0 victory over Paterson F.C.; the 1918–19 National Challenge Cup final was won against the same team by the same margin. Despite signing for the club's 1920-21 season, Frederick <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> first-team roster, causing him to leave the club after six successful seasons in which Bethlehem held an impressive record of 149 wins, seven losses, 718 goals for with just 120 against.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 2004, NSB and SJ {{stated that}} they would {{discontinue}} Linx, and would operate the last train on 31 December 2004. The company had <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> profit, and the new low-cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40%. The {{only part of the}} service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad, which SJ intended to continue. NSB stated that if a new Oslo–Stockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg stated that the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1.7 million people, it would have been profitable.|$|E

5|$|On January 16, 1995, Paramount {{launched}} a new broadcast television network, the United Paramount Network (UPN), in a programming partnership with Chris-Craft Industries; Viacom (which acquired Paramount Pictures and its related holdings in 1994) would acquire 50% interest in the network in 1996 and acquire Chris-Craft's remaining stake in 2000. During its 11-year existence, UPN <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> profit; The New Yorker reported that the network had lost $800 million during its {{first five years of}} operation. UPN ceased operations in September 2006, when it merged with the WB Television Network to form The CW Television Network. Today, Paramount's television division is part of the CBS Corporation subsidiary CBS Television Studios.|$|E
5|$|Given {{started his}} career at Celtic, however he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> first-team {{appearance}} and he was released and signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994. Given was part of both the Sunderland team who won the Football League First Division title in 1995–96 and the Swindon Town team who won the Football League Second Division title that same season, while on loan from Blackburn Rovers. He was signed by Newcastle United in 1997 for a fee of £1.5million, {{and it was there}} that he began competing to be a first-choice Premier League goalkeeper. Given was part of the teams who came runners-up in the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup campaigns, and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season for 2001–02 and 2005–06. He played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup with Newcastle, and was involved in the club's title challenge in 2001–02. Although he submitted a transfer request during the 2000–01 campaign after losing his position in the starting line-up, it was denied, and Given went on to regain his place.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien went on {{to criticize}} the script scene by scene ("yet one more scene of screams and rather {{meaningless}} slashings"). He was not implacably opposed {{to the idea of}} a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968. United Artists <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S. Beagle. It covered only the first half of the story of The Lord of the Rings. In 1977, an animated musical television film of The Hobbit was made by Rankin-Bass, and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film The Return of the King, which covered some of the portions of The Lord of the Rings that Bakshi was unable to complete.|$|E

5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{at school}} in Leicestershire, Dublin played for several Leicestershire youth teams {{including}} Wigston Fields and Thurmaston Magpies.
