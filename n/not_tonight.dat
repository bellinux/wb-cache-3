500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club issued the episode a B+ grade, {{and felt that}} the episode was superior {{to those of the}} show's first season. He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'. There's every indication that it's on the way there in the premiere because it's finally started to wrestle with some of the knottier questions at its center." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether you care about Aniston or <b>not,</b> <b>tonight</b> is a good time to sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E

If he does not go this evening we shall wait until tomorrow, but at any rate, {{the first time that he}} goes out we shall have him." ...|$|E

60|$|A terrible obstinacy located {{itself in}} him. He saw the fine, rich-coloured, secretive {{face of the}} Hebrew woman, so loudly self-righteous, and so dangerous, so destructive, so lustful--and he waited for his blood to melt with passion for her. But <b>not</b> <b>tonight.</b> Tonight his {{innermost}} heart was hard and cold as ice. The very danger and lustfulness of her, which had so pricked his senses, now made him colder. He disliked her at her tricks. He saw her once too often. Her and all women. Bah, the love game! And the whiskey that was {{to help in the}} game! He had drowned himself once too often in whiskey and in love. Now he floated like a corpse in both, with a cold, hostile eye.|$|E
60|$|His next objective, then, was Armand's former lodging, {{and from}} six o'clock until close upon eight Sir Percy haunted {{the slopes of}} Montmartre, and more {{especially}} the neighbourhood of the Rue de la Croix Blanche, where Armand had lodged these former days. At the house itself he could not inquire as yet; obviously {{it would not have}} been safe; tomorrow, perhaps, when he knew more, but <b>not</b> <b>tonight.</b> His keen eyes had already spied at least two figures clothed in the rags of out-of-work labourers like himself, who had hung with suspicious persistence in this same neighbourhood, and who during the two hours that he had been in observation had never strayed out of sight of the house in the Rue de la Croix Blanche.|$|E

5000|$|Labor of Love {{was issued}} later in 1997 as his fifth album. Unlike his {{previous}} albums, {{this one was}} predominantly composed of ballads. It produced a No. 2 in [...] "Love of My Life", and although {{none of the other}} three singles ("Matches", [...] "Honky Tonk America" [...] and [...] "One Day Left to Live") reached higher than No. 22, the album was nonetheless certified platinum. His next album, Maybe <b>Not</b> <b>Tonight,</b> brought a Top 20 duet with Lorrie Morgan. Kershaw stated that he enjoyed working with Morgan on the song, telling Country Weekly magazine, [...] "I knew our vocals would match up… Plus, we have fun together. We're friends and we have been friends for a long time." [...] Maybe <b>Not</b> <b>Tonight</b> was commercially less successful than its predecessors, however, and it became the first album of Kershaw's career not to achieve an RIAA certification. Following [...] "Maybe Not Tonight" [...] were the singles [...] "When You Love Someone" [...] and [...] "Me and Maxine", both of which peaked in the thirties. [...] "Louisiana Hot Sauce", the final release from Maybe <b>Not</b> <b>Tonight,</b> was also the first single of his career not to enter the charts.|$|E
