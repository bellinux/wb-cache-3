2500|$|The Windows Search service {{provides}} the Notifications API component to allow applications to [...] "push" [...] changed items that need indexing to the Windows Search indexer. Applications use the component {{to supply the}} URIs of the items {{that need to be}} indexed, and the URIs are written to the Gather Queue, where they are read off by the indexer. Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, as well as Microsoft Office OneNote 2007 use this ability to index the items managed by them and use Windows Search queries to provide the in-application searching features. The internal USN Journal <b>Notifier</b> component of Windows Search also uses the Notifications API, monitoring the Change Journal in an NTFS volume to keep track of files that have changed on the volume. If the file is in a location indexed by Windows Search and does not have the FANCI (File Attribute Not Content Indexed) attribute set, the Windows Search service is notified of its path via the Notification API.|$|E

50|$|Traffic signal {{preemption}} systems sometimes {{include a}} method for communicating to the {{operator of the vehicle}} that requested the preemption (as well as other drivers) that a traffic signal is under control of a preemption device, by means of a <b>notifier.</b> This device is almost always an additional light located near the traffic signals. It may be a single light bulb visible to all, which flashes or stays on, or there may be a light aimed towards each direction from which traffic approaches the intersection. In the case of multiple <b>notifier</b> lights at a controllable intersection, they will either flash or stay on depending on the local configuration, to communicate to all drivers from which direction a preempting signal is being received. This informs regular drivers which direction may need to be cleared, and informs activating vehicle drivers if they have control of the light (especially important when more than one activating vehicle approaches the same intersection). A typical installation would provide a solid <b>notifier</b> to indicate that an activating vehicle is approaching from behind, while a flashing <b>notifier</b> would indicate the emergency vehicle is approaching laterally or oncoming. There are variations of notification methods in use, which may include one or more colored lights in varying configurations.|$|E
