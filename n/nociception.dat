5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of <b>nociception,</b> para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nociception</b> (also nocioception or nociperception, from Latin nocere 'to harm or hurt') is {{the sensory}} nervous system's {{response}} to certain harmful or potentially harmful stimuli. In <b>nociception,</b> intense chemical (e.g., chili powder in the eyes), mechanical (e.g., cutting, crushing), or thermal (heat and cold) stimulation of sensory nerve cells called nociceptors produces {{a signal that}} travels along a chain of nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain. <b>Nociception</b> triggers a variety of physiological and behavioral responses and usually results in a subjective experience of pain in sentient beings.|$|E
25|$|This {{overview}} discusses proprioception, thermoception, chemoception and <b>nociception</b> as {{they are}} all integrally connected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nociception</b> {{can also}} cause {{generalized}} autonomic responses before or without reaching consciousness to cause pallor, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, lightheadedness, nausea and fainting.|$|E

25|$|Until very recently, no one {{had ever}} {{documented}} the presence of nociceptors (the cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain) in insects, though recent findings of <b>nociception</b> in larval fruit flies challenges this and raises the possibility that some insects may be capable of feeling pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nociception</b> {{has been}} {{documented}} in non-mammalian animals, including fish and {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including leeches, nematode worms, sea slugs, and fruit flies. As in mammals, nociceptive neurons in these species are typically characterized by responding preferentially to high temperature (40° Celsius or more), low pH, capsaicin, and tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{functionally}} specialized for <b>nociception</b> {{have been}} documented in other invertebrates including the leech Hirudo medicinalis, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the molluscs Aplysia californica and Cepaea nemoralis. Changes in neuronal activity induced by noxious stimuli have been recorded in the nervous centres of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and larval Manduca sexta.|$|E
25|$|The nerve impulses of the <b>nociception</b> {{response}} may {{be conducted}} to the brain thereby registering the location, intensity, quality and unpleasantness of the stimulus. This subjective component of pain involves conscious awareness of both the sensation and the unpleasantness (the aversive, negative affect). The brain processes underlying conscious awareness of the unpleasantness (suffering), are not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Exteroceptive senses are {{senses that}} {{perceive}} the body's own position, motion, and state, known as proprioceptive senses. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, {{as well as}} thermoception (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak magnetoception (direction). Proprioceptive senses include <b>nociception</b> (pain); equilibrioception (balance); proprioception (a sense of the position and movement of the parts of one's own body).|$|E
25|$|A {{nociceptor}} {{is a type}} of receptor {{at the end of a}} sensory neuron's axon that {{responds to}} damaging or potentially damaging stimuli by sending possible threat signals to the spinal cord and the brain. If the brain thinks the threat is credible, it creates the sensation of pain to direct attention to the body part, so the threat can hopefully be mediated. This process is called <b>nociception.</b>|$|E
25|$|The nerves {{of young}} babies respond more readily to noxious stimuli, {{with a lower}} {{threshold}} to stimulation, than those of adults. A baby's threshold for sensitization is also substantially decreased, whilst the process involves a much larger area of sensitization with each trauma. The neural pathways that descend from the brain to the spinal cord are not well developed in the newborn, resulting {{in the ability of}} the central nervous system to inhibit <b>nociception</b> being more limited than in the adult.|$|E
25|$|The present {{understanding}} {{of pain in}} babies {{is largely due to}} the recognition that the fetal and newborn unmyelinated nerve fibres are capable of relaying information, albeit slower than would be the case with myelinated fibres. At birth a baby has developed the neural pathways for <b>nociception</b> and for experiencing pain, but the pain responses are an immature version of that of an adult. There are a number of differences in both nerve structure and in the quality and extent of nerve response which are considered to be pertinent to understanding neonatal pain.|$|E
25|$|At {{least a few}} insects have nociceptors, {{cells that}} detect and {{transmit}} sensations of pain. This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to {{the touch of a}} heated probe and an unheated one. The larvae reacted to the touch of the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated probe. Although <b>nociception</b> has been demonstrated in insects, there is not a consensus that insects feel pain consciously.|$|E
25|$|SGCs {{have the}} ability to release cytokines and other {{bioactive}} molecules that transmit pain neuronally. Neurotrophins and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are other cellular factors that work to sensitize neurons to pain. SGCs are present in the PNS in fewer numbers than other more well-known types of glial cells, like astrocytes, but have been determined to affect <b>nociception</b> because of some of their physiological and pharmacological properties. In fact, just like astrocytes, SGCs {{have the ability}} to sense and regulate neighboring neuronal activity. First, after a period of nerve cell injury, SGCs are known to up-regulate GFAP and to undergo cell division. They {{have the ability to}} release chemoattractants, which are analogous to those released by Schwann cells and contribute to the recruitment and proliferation of macrophages. Additionally, several research groups have found that SGC coupling increases after nerve damage, which has an effect on the perception of pain, likely for several reasons. Normally, the gap junctions between SGCs are used in order to redistribute potassium ions between adjacent cells. However, in coupling of SGCs, the number of gap junctions greatly increases. This may possibly be to deal with larger amounts of ATP and glutamate, which eventually leads to increased recycling of the glutamate. The increased levels of glutamate lead to over excitation and an increase in <b>nociception.</b>|$|E
25|$|P2Y receptors {{are also}} found on both neurons and glial cells. Their role is less clear {{than that of the}} P2X receptors, but it has been noted they have several {{conflicting}} functions. In some cases, these receptors act as analgesics, as P2Y1 has the ability to inhibit the action of P2X3. In other cases, the receptors contribute to <b>nociception</b> through the modulation of the extracellular concentration of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). These conflicting roles are being researched further so that they may serve as potential targets {{for the development of a}} variety of therapeutic drugs.|$|E
25|$|Humans have a {{multitude}} of sensors. Sight (vision), hearing (audition), taste (gustation), smell (olfaction), and touch (somatosensation) are the five traditionally recognized senses. The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense (proprioception), pain (<b>nociception),</b> balance (equilibrioception), vibration (mechanoreception), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, or sense of hunger and sense of thirst). However, what constitutes a sense {{is a matter of}} some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders between responses to related stimuli lie.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nociception</b> (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage {{or damage}} to tissue. The {{three types of}} pain receptors are {{cutaneous}} (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research {{in the first half}} of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from chronic pain {{experience}} prolonged pain at sites {{that may have been}} previously injured, yet are otherwise currently healthy. This phenomenon is related to neuroplasticity due to a maladaptive reorganization of the nervous system, both peripherally and centrally. During the period of tissue damage, noxious stimuli and inflammation cause an elevation of nociceptive input from the periphery to the central nervous system. Prolonged <b>nociception</b> from the periphery then elicits a neuroplastic response at the cortical level to change its somatotopic organization for the painful site, inducing central sensitization. For instance, individuals experiencing complex regional pain syndrome demonstrate a diminished cortical somatotopic representation of the hand contralaterally as well as a decreased spacing between the hand and the mouth. Additionally, chronic pain has been reported to significantly reduce the volume of grey matter in the brain globally, and more specifically at the prefrontal cortex and right thalamus. However, following treatment, these abnormalities in cortical reorganization and grey matter volume are resolved, as well as their symptoms. Similar results have been reported for phantom limb pain, chronic low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|Opiates {{modulate}} <b>nociception</b> in vertebrates. In vertebrates, morphine is an analgesic {{and therefore}} ameliorates {{the sensation of}} pain. [...] Naloxone is an opioid-receptor antagonist and therefore blocks the effects of morphine. [...] Opioid modulation of <b>nociception</b> has been demonstrated in several invertebrate species.|$|E
2500|$|In vertebrates, {{nociceptive}} responses {{involve the}} transmission of a signal along a chain of nerve fibres {{from the site of}} a noxious stimulus at the periphery, to the spinal cord. This process evokes a reflex arc response such as flinching or immediate withdrawal of a limb, generated at the spinal cord and not involving the brain. [...] <b>Nociception</b> is found, in one form or another, across all major animal taxa. <b>Nociception</b> can be observed using modern imaging techniques and both physiological and behavioural responses to <b>nociception</b> can be detected. [...] Many crustacean species, including the rockpool prawn (Palaemon elegans), exhibit the caridoid escape reaction – an immediate, nociceptive, reflex tail-flick response to noxious stimuli (see here).|$|E
2500|$|The {{gate control}} theory of pain, {{proposed}} by Patrick David Wall and Ronald Melzack, postulates that <b>nociception</b> (pain) is [...] "gated" [...] by non-nociception stimuli such as vibration. Thus, rubbing a bumped knee seems to relieve pain by preventing its transmission to the brain. Pain is also [...] "gated" [...] by signals that descend {{from the brain}} to the spinal cord to suppress (and in other cases enhance) incoming <b>nociception</b> (pain) information.|$|E
2500|$|First, <b>nociception</b> is required. This is {{the ability}} to detect noxious stimuli which evoke a reflex {{response}} that rapidly moves the entire animal, or the affected part of its body, away from the source of the stimulus. The concept of <b>nociception</b> does not imply any adverse, subjective [...] "feeling" [...] – it is a reflex action. An example in humans would be the rapid withdrawal of a finger that has touched something hot – the withdrawal occurs before any sensation of pain is actually experienced.|$|E
2500|$|In vertebrates, opioid {{peptides}} (i.e., enkephalins) {{have been}} shown to be involved in <b>nociception.</b> [...] Leu-enkephalin and Met-enkephalin are present in the thoracic ganglia of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nociception</b> {{has been}} {{documented}} in non-mammalian animals, including fish [...] and {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including leeches, nematode worms, sea slugs, and fruit flies. Although these neurons may have different pathways and relationships to the central nervous system than mammalian nociceptors, nociceptive neurons in non-mammals often fire in response to similar stimuli as mammals, such as high temperature (40 degrees C or more), low pH, capsaicin, and tissue damage.|$|E
2500|$|Pain {{that is well}} managed {{during and}} {{immediately}} after surgery improves the health of patients (by decreasing physiologic stress) {{and the potential for}} chronic pain. [...] <b>Nociception</b> (pain sensation) is not hard-wired into the body. [...] Instead, it is a dynamic process wherein persistent painful stimuli can sensitize the system and either make pain management difficult or promote the development of chronic pain. For this reason, preemptive acute pain management may reduce both acute and chronic pain and is tailored to the surgery, the environment in which it is given (in-patient/out-patient) and the individual patient.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{major cause}} of chronic wounds, diabetes, is {{increasing}} in prevalence. [...] Diabetics have a 15% higher risk for amputation {{than the general population}} due to chronic ulcers. [...] Diabetes causes neuropathy, which inhibits <b>nociception</b> and the perception of pain. [...] Thus patients may not initially notice small wounds to legs and feet, and may therefore fail to prevent infection or repeated injury. [...] Further, diabetes causes immune compromise and damage to small blood vessels, preventing adequate oxygenation of tissue, which can cause chronic wounds. Pressure also plays a role in the formation of diabetic ulcers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adaptive}} value of <b>nociception</b> is obvious; an organism detecting a noxious stimulus immediately withdraws the limb, appendage or entire {{body from the}} noxious stimulus and thereby avoids further (potential) injury. [...] However, a characteristic of pain (in mammals at least) is that pain can result in hyperalgesia (a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli) and allodynia (a heightened sensitivity to non-noxious stimuli). [...] When this heightened sensitisation occurs, the {{adaptive value}} is less clear. [...] First, the pain arising from the heightened sensitisation can be disproportionate to the actual tissue damage caused. [...] Second, the heightened sensitisation may also become chronic, persisting well beyond the tissues healing. [...] This can mean that rather than the actual tissue damage causing pain, it is the pain due to the heightened sensitisation that becomes the concern. [...] This means the sensitisation process is sometimes termed maladaptive. [...] It is often suggested hyperalgesia and allodynia assist organisms to protect themselves during healing, but experimental evidence to support this has been lacking.|$|E
2500|$|After {{persistent}} {{peripheral tissue}} damage {{there is a}} release of several factors from the injured tissue {{as well as in}} the spinal dorsal horn. These factors increase the responsiveness of the dorsal horn pain-projection neurons to ensuing stimuli, termed [...] "spinal sensitization," [...] thus amplifying the pain impulse to the brain. Release of glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mediates NMDAR activation (originally silent because it is plugged by Mg2+), thus aiding in depolarization of the postsynaptic pain-transmitting neurons (PTN). In addition, activation of IP3 signaling and MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) such as ERK and JNK, bring about an increase in the synthesis of inflammatory factors that alter glutamate transporter function. ERK also further activates AMPARs and NMDARs in neurons. <b>Nociception</b> is further sensitized by the association of ATP and substance P with their respective receptors (P2X3) and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), as well as activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and release of BDNF. Persistent presence of glutamate in the synapse eventually results in dysregulation of GLT1 and GLAST, crucial transporters of glutamate into astrocytes. Ongoing excitation can also induce ERK and JNK activation, resulting in release of several inflammatory factors.|$|E
2500|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is {{a poison}} {{produced}} by organisms {{belonging to the}} Tetradontidae order, which includes the puffer fish, ocean sunfish, and porcupine fish. Within the puffer fish, which is a common delicacy especially in Japan, TTX {{is found in the}} liver, gonads, ovaries, intestines, and skin. TTX can be fatal if consumed, and has become a common form of poisoning in many countries. Common symptoms of TTX consumption include paraesthesia (often restricted to the mouth and limbs), muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting and often manifest within 30 minutes of ingestion. The primary mechanism by which TTX is toxic is through the inhibition of sodium channel function, which reduces the functional capacity of neuron communication. This inhibition largely affects a susceptible subset of sodium channels known as TTX-sensitive (TTX-s), which also happens to be largely responsible for the sodium current that drives the depolarization phase of neuron action potentials. [...] TTX-resistant (TTX-r) is another form of sodium channel which has limited sensitivity to TTX, and is largely found in small diameter axons such as those found in <b>nociception</b> neurons. When significant levels of TTX is ingested, it will bind sodium channels on neurons and reduce their membrane permeability to sodium. This results in an increased effective threshold of required excitatory signals in order to induce an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. The effect of this increased signaling threshold is a reduced excitability of postsynaptic neurons, and subsequent loss of motor and sensory function which can result in paralysis and death. Though assisted ventilation may increase the chance of survival after TTX exposure, there is currently no antitoxin. The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Neostigmine or the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist Atropine (which will inhibit parasympathetic activity), however, can increase sympathetic nerve activity enough to improve the chance of survival after TTX exposure.|$|E
5000|$|The column {{can also}} be {{separated}} by nociceptive and non-nociceptive senses. Laminae I and II are important in <b>nociception,</b> laminae III and IV are not involved <b>nociception,</b> and lamina V is involved in both <b>nociception</b> and non-nociception.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common {{applications}} of <b>nociception</b> assays is to test the effectiveness of new pain medications and drugs of the like. One can then perform comparative tests to measure the differences in the effects of the drug on varying populations, such as men versus women, or young versus old. These tests can also identify certain harmful diseases or abnormalities in subjects if they display atypical <b>nociception</b> test responses. Additionally, <b>nociception</b> tests can be used to test the heritability of <b>nociception</b> itself. One can also use <b>nociception</b> assays to assess the physiology of the [...] "pain" [...] pathways. The role capsaicin receptors play in the pain pathways has been measured by comparing results from <b>nociception</b> assays in mice with and without the receptor. In addition, they are useful in other tests to make sure control subjects have normal <b>nociception</b> responses.|$|E
