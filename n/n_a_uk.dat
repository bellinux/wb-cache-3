40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a research methodology and interim findings concerning the investigation, through ethnographic case-based research, of the impact within a construction project of the partial implementation of a value stream approach. It is intended that by undertaking research of this nature, a contribution can be made to the understanding of the cultural aspects of both lean construction and associated construction process theory. The research was undertaken within the wider context of the Movement for Innovation in the UK and in particular as one of a number of demonstration project trialling the ideas expressed by the Construction Industry Task Force in 1998 (DETR 1998). It traces the development of a model for identifying and implementing the value stream approach during project implementation, mapping planned construction processes and subsequently comparing planned with actual for the purposes of developing a target baseline for continuous process improvement. Through a pilot study to test the model, a qualitative analysis methodology is used and some propositions put forward relating to culture, the value stream framework and process mapping. It is intended to develop these through a major ethnographic case study.

A neotype series is designated for A. investigata Friauf & Edney. The phylogenetic relationships between 24 species of the Corydiid cockroach genus Arenivaga were investigated using morphological and molecular data. The molecular dataset included the following markers: the nuclear gene histone III (H 3), the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene 12 S (12 S), and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (CO 1). The phylogenetic relationships of these 24 species were then explored using three optimality criteria: parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. The putative sister genus Eremoblatta and more distantly related Blatta orientalis were used as outgroups. A partitioned Bremer analysis was performed to provide some insight into which portions of the data provided the most evolutionary insight into this unusual group of insects. All analyses confirm the genus is monophyletic. Several relationships within the genus are recovered with strong support. Both the parsimony and likelihood estimations fail to provide good resolution along {{the backbone of the}} generic tree, whereas the Bayesian estimation resolves most nodes. Most of the strongly supported relationships are reinforced by both geographical distribution and genital morphology. The relative contributions of 23 ecological variables to the niche of the genus Arenivaga were examined. This analysis revealed that more than 95 % of their ecological niche could be described by eight variables: soil, isothermality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the driest quarter, annual precipitation, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation of the wettest quarter and ground cover. These eight variables with respect to their relative contributions to the niche of the genus as a whole as well as the individual niches of 27 species in the genus were then examined. This revealed the similarity of niche composition of most of the species, as well as how varied the niches were of several species. A species dendrogram built from similarity of contribution of the eight variables to niche composition was compared to a phylogeny of the genus, but few similarities in topology were found. This analysis revealed that soil is the most important contributor to these species’ niches, followed by precipitation of the driest month, and finally, precipitation of the wettest quarter. It also confirmed that the majority of Arenivaga species have niches comprised of similar, but not identical, proportions of as few as four, and as many as eight ecological variables. Currently {{there is no evidence to}} support niche conservatism between closely related species, indicating that adapting to new and variable niches is one of the drivers of speciation in this genus.
