Some of these features are also seen in the other neurological syndromes associated with neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Cervical cancer <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> {{involves}} {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for cervical cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E

H.Frankfort suggests that The Burney Relief shows a modification of the normal canon that {{is due to the}} fact that the lions are turned towards the worshipper: the lions might appear inappropriately threatening if their mouths were open.|$|E

5|$|The first {{installment}} in the franchise, , {{was released on}} September 11, 1987. The following entries have <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> been unrelated to each other except in carrying over thematic and gameplay elements. The Megami Tensei games, and the later Shin Megami Tensei titles form {{the core of the}} series, while other subseries such as Persona and Devil Summoner are spin-offs marketed as part of the franchise. There are also stand-alone spin-off titles.|$|E

Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output in 2014.|$|E
5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
40|$|By {{restricting the}} {{variables}} running over various (possibly different) subfields, we introduce {{the notion of}} a partial zeta function. We prove that the partial zeta function is rational in an interesting case, generalizing Dwork's well known rationality theorem. In general, the partial zeta function is probably not rational. But a theorem of Faltings says that the partial zeta function is <b>always</b> <b>nearly</b> rational...|$|R

Both types are almost <b>always</b> <b>nearly</b> hemispherical bowls.|$|R
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endâ€“stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} forms of {{deterioration}} in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of silver chloride due to long-term immersion in salt water, {{as well as}} reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly {{from the surface of}} the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> a constituent of silver alloys.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E

50|$|A dentist tells {{one of his}} {{patients}} {{the story of how}} he became a dentist in spite of wanting to be a dustman: one of his neighbors, despite being <b>nearly</b> toothless, <b>always</b> had his bin full of toothpaste which he tested on locked-up animals. This toothpaste is supposed to make sure people never have to clean their teeth again, but has a horrible taste. The old man gets a taste of his own medicine and transforms into a giant tooth, which the patients thinks becomes the dentist's sign. The story ends with the dentist telling a similar story to another child of how he became a dentist in spite of wanting to be a ballerina, revealing that the story is made up.|$|R
5000|$|The north {{celestial}} pole currently is within a degree of the bright star Polaris (named from the Latin stella polaris, meaning [...] "pole star"). This makes Polaris useful for navigation in the northern hemisphere: {{not only is it}} always above the north point of the horizon, but its altitude angle is <b>always</b> (<b>nearly)</b> equal to the observer's geographic latitude. Polaris can, of course, only be seen from locations in the northern hemisphere.|$|R
5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland {{had spent}} about $200million to nearly {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} slough. It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near {{the middle and upper}} slough with sanitary sewers. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed {{that by the end of}} this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli, the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower slough. Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E

40|$|We have {{designed}} {{a new type}} of composite materials which not only has a Youngâ€™s modulus much larger than the Voigt limit, but also is <b>always</b> <b>nearly</b> isotropic. Moreover, its Poissonâ€™s ratio can be designed at a desired value, e. g. positive, or negative, or zero. We have also demonstrated that structural hierarchy can help to enhance the stiffness of this type of composite materials. The results obtained in this paper provide a very useful insight into the development of new functional materials and structures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{generally}} {{admitted that the}} extraordinary transmission of metallic grating with very narrow slits is mainly due to the excitation of surface plasmons on {{the upper and lower}} interfaces of the grating. We show that the surface plasmon contribution is not the prime effect and that waveguide mode resonance and diffraction are responsible for the extraordinary transmission. Additionally and surprisingly, we reveal that the transmittance of subwavelength metallic gratings is <b>always</b> <b>nearly</b> zero for frequencies corresponding to surface plasmon excitation. This finding implies that surface plasmons play a negative role in the transmission...|$|R
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5â€“10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3â€“4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> fatal.|$|E
5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2â€“7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|The nesting season starts early, {{with some}} birds {{incubating}} eggs by early April. American crows build bulky stick nests, <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> in trees but sometimes also in large bushes and, very rarely, on the ground. They will nest {{in a wide}} variety of trees, including large conifers, although oaks are most often used. Three to six eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The young are usually fledged by about 36 days after hatching. Predation primarily occurs at the nest site and eggs and nestlings are frequently eaten by snakes, raccoons, ravens and domestic cats. Adults are less frequently predated but face potential attack from great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons and eagles. They may be attacked by predators such as coyotes or bobcats at carrion when incautious although this is even rarer.|$|E

The first approach, using an inductive fibred variety point of view, shows that the partial zeta function is rational in an interesting case, generalizing Dwork's rationality theorem. The second approach, due to Faltings, shows that the partial zeta function is <b>always</b> <b>nearly</b> rational...|$|R
5|$|With {{his father}} usually not home (and {{eventually}} meeting his death) {{because of a}} military career, Van Rensselaer's mother sent him to apprentice with his uncle, Wolfert van Bijler, a jeweler and diamond merchant. At the time, the gem trade was a prosperous enterprise to join, being a well-developed craft. In those days, the diamond trade was <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> combined with the trade in pearls, other articles of luxury, and rarities of every description. Dutch jewelers found a ready market for their valuable wares at the Dutch imperial court and the smaller German courts. This realm of work promoted Van Rensselaer {{to a life of}} economic success.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and <b>nearly</b> <b>always</b> until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} reason astronomers {{thought it}} was synchronously locked was that, whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, it was <b>always</b> <b>nearly</b> {{at the same point}} in its 3:2 resonance, hence showing the same face. This is because, coincidentally, Mercury's rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to Earth. Due to Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, a solar day (the length between two meridian transits of the Sun) lasts about 176 Earth days. A sidereal day (the period of rotation) lasts about 58.7 Earth days.|$|R
40|$|In many {{applications}} in mobile robotics, {{it is important}} for a robot to explore its environment in order to construct a representation of space useful for guiding movement. We refer to such a representation as a map, and the process of constructing a map from a set of measurements as map learning. In this paper, we develop a framework for describing map-learning problems in which the measurements taken by the robot are subject to known errors. We investigate two approaches to learning maps under such conditions: one based on Valiant's probably approximately correct learning model, and a second based on Rivest & Sloan's reliable and probably <b>nearly</b> almost <b>always</b> useful learning model. Both methods deal with the problem of accumulated error in combining local measurements to make global inferences. In the first approach, the effects of accumulated error are eliminated by the use of reliable and probably useful methods for discerning the local properties of space.

Of course the river could never build the land any higher, in any part, than it rises itself in the highest inundations. Indeed, land formed by river deposits is almost <b>always</b> <b>nearly</b> level, and the surface of it is but little raised above the ordinary level of the stream, and never above that of the highest inundations.|$|R
