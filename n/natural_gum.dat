5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly <b>natural</b> <b>gum.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the granulation and tablet properties of <b>natural</b> <b>gums</b> with the extensively investigated hydrophilic matrices hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as suitable hydrophilic matrix systems. Methods: The granules were prepared by wet granulation method and granulation properties like angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, Carr’s compressibility index, Hausner’s ratio and drug content were compared. Various sustained release matrices of prepared granules were prepared using HPMC (F 1), Guar gum (F 2), Xanthan Gum (F 3), Locust bean gum (F 4) and chitosan (F 5). The matrix tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, content of active ingredient, friability, hardness, thickness and in vitro dissolution using USP XXIV dissolution apparatus. Results: All the formulations showed compliance with pharmacopoeial standards. A significant difference in release pattern was observed between the formulation F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4 and F 5. F 1, F 3 and F 5 release almost ~ 9 % compare to initial burst effect of ~ 31 % for F 4 and F 2 after 1 h of dissolution period. At the end of 8 h of dissolution period it was found that 71. 36 %, 85. 91 %, 96. 98 %, 68. 76 % and 45. 5 % of drug release for F 2, F 4, F 5, F 3 and F 1, respectively. Conclusions: Thus, <b>natural</b> <b>gums</b> show granulation and tablet properties that are similar to those of the extensively investigated hydrophilic matrices, HPMC.
