25|$|The Hopi was an {{air-to-surface missile}} {{developed}} by the United States Navy's Naval Ordnance Test Station.

25|$|The Bombardment Aircraft Rocket, {{also known}} as BOAR, the Bureau of Ordnance Aircraft Rocket, and officially as the 30.5-Inch Rocket, Mark 1, Mod 0, was an unguided air-to-surface rocket {{developed}} by the United States Navy's Naval Ordnance Test Station during the 1950s. Intended to provide a standoff <b>nuclear</b> <b>capability</b> for carrier-based aircraft, the rocket entered operational service in 1956, remaining in service until 1963.|$|E

25|$|Since Pakistan and India {{each had}} {{weapons of mass}} destruction, many in the {{international}} community were concerned that if the Kargil conflict intensified, it could lead to nuclear war. Both countries had tested their <b>nuclear</b> <b>capability</b> in 1998 (India conducted its first test in 1974 while it was Pakistan's first-ever nuclear test). Many pundits believed the tests to be an indication of the escalating stakes in the scenario in South Asia. When the Kargil conflict started just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations desired to end it before it intensified.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before Maxwell's death, {{a former}} {{employee}} of Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate intelligence agency, Ari Ben-Menashe, had approached a number of news organisations in Britain and the United States with the allegation that Maxwell and the Daily Mirror's foreign editor, Nicholas Davies, were both long-time agents for Mossad. Ben-Menashe also claimed that in 1986 Maxwell had told the Israeli Embassy in London that Mordechai Vanunu had given information about Israel's <b>nuclear</b> <b>capability</b> to the Sunday Times, then to the Daily Mirror. Vanunu was subsequently kidnapped by Mossad and smuggled to Israel, convicted of treason and imprisoned for 18 years.|$|E
25|$|The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear submarine, {{revolutionized}} naval warfare. Conventional submarines {{need two}} engines: a diesel engine {{to travel on}} the surface and an electric engine to travel submerged, where oxygen for a diesel engine is not available. By relying on <b>nuclear</b> <b>capability,</b> the USS Nautilus could travel uninterrupted for thousands of miles below the surface with a single fuel charge. Beginning in 1951, Admiral Hyman Rickover can be credited for the design of the world's first nuclear submarine who led and oversaw a group of scientists and engineers at the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission. After sea trials were conducted and testing was completed, the USS Nautilus became fully operational in January 1955.|$|E

France was the third nation, after the former USSR and the United States, to launch its own space satellite and remains the biggest contributor to the European Space Agency (ESA). The European Airbus, formed from the French group Aérospatiale along with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), designs and develops civil and military aircraft as well as communications systems, missiles, space rockets, helicopters, satellites, and related systems. France also hosts major international research instruments such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility or the Institut Laue–Langevin and remains a major member of CERN. It also owns Minatec, Europe's leading nanotechnology research center.|$|E
25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that <b>nuclear</b> <b>capability</b> in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{placed the}} Nassau Agreement before Cabinet on 3 January 1963. He {{made the case}} for Britain {{retaining}} nuclear weapons. He asserted {{that it would not be}} in the best interest of the Western Alliance for all knowledge of the technology to reside with the United States; that possession of an independent <b>nuclear</b> <b>capability</b> gave Britain the ability to respond to threats from the Soviet Union even when the United States was not inclined to support Britain; and that possession of nuclear weapons gave Britain a voice in nuclear disarmament talks. However, concerns were expressed that the dependence on the United States would necessarily diminish Britain's influence on world affairs. Thorneycroft addressed the view that Britain should provide a nuclear deterrent from its own resources. He pointed out that Polaris represented $800 million in research and development costs that the United Kingdom would save. Nonetheless, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd, was still concerned at the cost.|$|E

500|$|The B-1B {{no longer}} carries nuclear weapons; its <b>nuclear</b> <b>capability</b> was {{disabled}} by 1995 with {{the removal of}} nuclear arming and fuzing hardware. [...] Under provisions of the New START treaty with Russia, further conversion were performed. These included modification of aircraft hardpoints to prevent nuclear weapon pylons from being attached, removal of weapons bay wiring bundles for arming nuclear weapons, and destruction of nuclear weapon pylons. The conversion process was completed in 2011, and Russian officials inspect the aircraft every year to verify compliance.|$|E

It took a year for Teller to convince the CIA that Israel had obtained nuclear capability; the information then went through CIA Director Richard Helms to the president at that time, Lyndon B. Johnson. [...] Teller also persuaded them to end the American attempts to inspect the Negev Nuclear Research Center in Dimona.
