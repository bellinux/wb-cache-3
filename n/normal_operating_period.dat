The modern wind turbine system has a complex and repairable components due to sophistication and centralized control. The failure characteristics of the onshore wind turbines depend on the terrain conditions. In the main mountain pass and hill area, there is a heavy uncertainty in the wind that is due to the frequent change in the direction of wind and the change in the velocity. It causes a rapid failure in the individual sub assemblies. There is a substantial need for improving the reliability in the stages of design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance. Normally the infant mortality failures are more in the onshore wind turbine and the failure rate is constant during <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>period.</b> It is a surprise that the failure rate has rapidly increased during <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>period</b> of the wind turbines placed exactly in the mountain pass and hilly area due to the high uncertainty in the wind. This paper deals with reliability analysis of major components of wind turbine system and its sub system such as rotor system, gear box, brake system, generator, hydraulic system and yaw system. This paper also investigates the reliability of wind turbines and its sub assemblies placed at Aramboly pass in India by using Weibull software as reliability tool for a grid connected 250 kW wind turbine. This analysis yields some surprising results about some sub assembly like yaw system, brake system and generator which are most unreliable...|$|E

The first one is how to make use of resource to fulfill the tasks as much as possible. The other one is how to Using the least amount of resources to complete a certain task. The planning model about resource utilization in the factory is built through the investigation and analysis. It uses limited resources to complete the production task at most. In the actual problems of the university financial management and daily life, multi-target optimization is necessary. Analytic hierarchy process is used to built Hierarchical evaluation model and make decision of how to select school for graduate education. The organization and planning problem Basic situation. A factory plan to product 3 types of Air-conditioner, A,B and C. Assembly work finishes At the same Factory Made. The assembly plant labors of 3 types products are 5, 8 and 12 hours in turn. The production line’s <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>period</b> is 260 hours. And the costs of the products are successfully 450, 600 and 850 RMB as is shown in Fig. 1 - 1. As the lack of capital chain, the total cost of the factory is 20000 yuan. How do they plan and organize operations to Realiz...|$|E
40|$|This {{handbook}} presents {{high quality}} reliability data for offshore equipment collected during phase VI to IX (project period 2000 – 2009) of the OREDA project. The {{intention of the}} handbook is to provide both quantitative and qualitative information {{as a basis for}} Performance Forecasting or RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety) analyses. Volume 1 is about Topside Equipment. Compared to earlier editions, there are only minor changes in the reliability data presentation. To obtain a reasonable population for presenting reliability data for topside equipment in the 2015 edition, some data from phases VI and VII already issued in the previous 2009 handbook (5 th edition) have also been included. The 2015 topside volume is divided into two parts. Part I describes the OREDA project, different data collection phases and the estimation procedures used to generate the data tables presented in Part II of the handbook. Topside data are in general not covering the whole lifetime of equipment, but typically a time window of 2 – 4 years of operation. Infant mortality failures are as a rule not collected for topside equipment; hence, the data collected are from the <b>normal</b> steady-state <b>operating</b> time <b>period...</b>|$|R
