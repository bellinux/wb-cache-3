40|$|A novel {{two-phase}} {{ceramic composite}} (cercer) material {{consisting of a}} solid solution of barium cerate and -zirconate doped with yttrium (BaCe 0. 2 Zr 0. 7 Y 0. 1 O 3 -delta : BCZY 27), together with niobium-doped strontium titanate (Sr 0. 95 Ti 0. 9 Nb 0. 1 O 3 -delta : STN 95), has been synthesized by solid-state reaction and sintered conventionally (CS) at 1350 - 1500 A degrees C, {{as well as by}} spark plasma sintering (SPS) at 1300 - 1350 A degrees C. CS samples were porous and exhibited high degrees of inter-phase reaction. <b>Nickel</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>sintering</b> aids did not improve CS sample density. In contrast, samples made by SPS were significantly denser (> 95 %) and showed less reaction between phases. A pseudo-optimum SPS profile was developed, accounting for the effects of thermal expansion mismatch between BCZY 27 and STN 95. X-ray diffraction indicated secondary phases exist, but there was no indication of their presence at grain boundaries based on thorough study of these regions with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selective area electron diffraction. We thus suggest that these phases are present as independent grains in the bulk. It is believed these secondary phases inhibit electronic conductivity in the composite...|$|R

To match the required sintering conditions for commercial ceramic products as a development of waste-to-resource strategy, the investigation focused on the nickel incorporation behavior of γ-alumina in moderate to low temperature sintering environments (1250 - 750 °C) under a 3 h sintering process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement were used to show the quantitative distribution of phases. The results demonstrated that γ-alumina interacted intensively with <b>nickel</b> <b>oxide</b> at <b>sintering</b> temperatures above 1000 °C. Furthermore, the densification effect of the sintering process is also illustrated, as this is crucial for developing the needed mechanical strength for practical applications.

For the uncooled infrared radiation detector industry, the current standard sensor materials are either very expensive, but very sensitive (vanadium oxide), or the other extreme of low cost, and low quality (amorphous silicon). Thus, a need arises for a medium-grade, medium-cost microbolometer sensitive material.
