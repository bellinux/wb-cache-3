This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her {{to the use of}} X-rays as a mutagen. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage. From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused variegation in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizer</b> region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the nucleolus. In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs. During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of conditions resulting in bobbed phenotypes on nucleolar RNA synthesis {{and the formation}} of constrictions at <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizers</b> was examined in larval tissues of Droso-phila melanogaster. By means of [3 H]uridine incorporation and autoradiographic analysis, a mutation at the bobbed locus was shown to limit the rate of nucleolar RNA synthesis in salivary glands of XO larvae. The formation of constrictions at the organizer sites of a 4 -nucleolus-organizer stock was monitored in dividing neuroblast cells stained with acridine orange. Loss of the ribosomal cistrons had been reported by other workers when such stocks were maintained for several generations. In the first generation in our work, constrictions were visible at only 2 of the 4 <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizers.</b> This situation persisted until the fifth generation, when con-strictions appeared at all 4 of the organizer sites. An increase in the rate of nucleolar RNA synthesis in the salivary glands was temporally correlated with the appearance of the extra constrictions. We interpret these observations to mean that 2 of the organizers of the 4 -nucleolus-organizer stock were caused to function through the loss of ribosomal RNA cistrons; thus the functional status of an organizer would appear to be subject to control...|$|R
50|$|Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a DNA {{sequence}} that codes for ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are assemblies of proteins and rRNA molecules that translate mRNA molecules to produce proteins. As {{shown in the}} figure, rDNA of eukaryotes consists of a tandem repeat of a unit segment, an operon, composed of NTS, ETS, 18S, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, and 28S tracts. rDNA has another gene, coding for 5S rRNA, located in the genome in most eukaryotes. 5S rDNA is also present in tandem repeats as in Drosophila. In the nucleus, the rDNA region of the chromosome is visualized as a nucleolus which forms expanded chromosomal loops with rDNA. These rDNA regions are also called <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizer</b> regions, as they give rise to the nucleolus. In the human genome there are 5 chromosomes with <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizer</b> regions: the acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22. In Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts the rRNA is composed of different (smaller) units, the large (23S) ribosomal RNA, 16S ribosomal RNA and 5S rRNA. The 16S rRNA is widely used for phylogenetic studies.|$|E

5000|$|Ribosomal DNA {{transcription}} {{is confined}} to the nucleolus, where about 400 copies of the 42.9-kb rDNA gene are present, arranged as tandem repeats in <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizer</b> regions. Each copy contains a ~13.3 kb sequence encoding the 18S, the 5.8S, and the 28S RNA molecules, interlaced with two internal transcribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2, and flanked upstream by a 5' external transcribed spacer and a downstream 3' external transcribed spacer. These components are transcribed together to form the 45S pre-rRNA. The 45S pre-rRNA is then post-transcriptionally cleaved by C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs, removing the two spacers and resulting in the three rRNAs by a complex series of steps.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{distribution}} and expression of <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizers</b> and ribosomal genes in man. Using filter hybridisation techniques, an inter-individual variation in the number of ribosomal cistrons has been found. This number is negatively correlated with the number of active <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizers</b> (NORs) as determined by the ammoniacal silver staining (Ag-AS) technique. The Ag-AS technique in mammalian systems stains a protein component of the NORs that is, or has been active. Silver staining through the mitotic cycle reflects the nucleolar changes, and corresponding changes in activity of the NORs. Further studies using both the light and electron microscopes, reveal that each individual has a characteristic silver staining pattern that does not change with time. Evidence is presented that the activity of NORs in trisomy 21 patients may be disturbed, and this may be correlated with an increased frequency of satellite associations and an increased nucleolar coefficient in such patients. In situ hybridisation studies indicate that not necessarily only the largest NORs are active. While the specificity for active ribosomal cistrons in mammalian systems is high, this specificity is lost in some non-mammalian systems. Lampbrush chromosomes of Triturus cristatus carnifex did not have silver-positive chromosomal NORs, but extrachromosomal nucleoli were consistently silver-positive. In addition, a number of other sites proved to be silver-positive. One of these sites may be the location of the 5 S RNA genes, but the function of the other loci is unknown. In Plethodon cinereus cinereus lampbrush chromosomes, there are many silver-positive extrachromosomal nucleoli, but a maximum of three silver-positive chromosomal structures A similar situation was found in polytene chromosomes of Chironomus thummi thummi, where the nucleolus and approximately 16 chromosomal bands were silver-positive.

The small percentage of cells with 10, 9 and 8 nucleoli is attributed to the rapid association of 3 of the homologous acrocentrics (perhaps of group D). Two of the satellite (SAT) pairs probably associate later after mitosis. The process of fusion is dynamic, resulting in one interphase nucleolus- {{a manifestation of the}} association of all SAT chromosomes.

40|$|Coiled bodies (CBs) are nuclear organelles whose {{morphological}} {{structure and}} molecular composition have been conserved from plants to animals. Furthermore, CBs are often found to co-localize with specific DNA loci in both mammalian somatic nuclei and amphibian oocytes. Much as rDNA sequences are called <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizers,</b> we term these coiled body-associated sequences 'coiled body organizers' (CBORs). The only sequences {{that have been}} shown to be CBORs in human cells are the U 1, U 2 and histone gene loci. We wanted to determine whether other snRNA genes might also act as CBORs. In this paper we show that human U 3 genes (the RNU 3 locus) preferentially associate with CBs in interphase cells. In addition, we have analyzed the genomic organization of the RNU 3 locus by constructing a BAC and P 1 clone contig. We found that, unlike the RNU 1 and RNU 2 loci, U 3 genes are not tandemly repeated. Rather, U 3 genes are clustered on human chromosome 17 p 11. 2, with evidence for large inverted duplications within the cluster. Thus all of the CBORs identified to date are composed of either tandemly repeated or tightly clustered genes.

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster males, X-Y meiotic {{chromosome}} pairing is mediated by the <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizers</b> (NOs) which {{are located in the}} X heterochromatin (Xh) and near the Y centromere. Deficiencies for Xh disrupt X-Y meiotic pairing and cause high frequencies of X-Y nondisjunction. Insertion of cloned rRNA genes on an Xh(-) chromosome partially restores normal X-Y pairing and disjunction. To map the sequences within an inserted, X-linked rRNA gene responsible for stimulating X-Y pairing, partial deletions were generated by P element-mediated destabilization of the insert. Complete deletions of the rRNA transcription unit did not interfere with the ability to stimulate X-Y pairing as long as most of the intergenic spacer (IGS) remained. Within groups of deletions that lacked the entire transcription unit and differed only in length of residual IGS material, pairing ability was proportional to the dose of 240 -bp intergenic spacer repeats. Deletions of the complete rRNA transcription unit or of the 28 S sequences alone blocked nucleolus formation, as determined by binding of an antinucleolar antibody, yet did not interfere with pairing ability, suggesting that X-Y pairing may not be mechanistically related to nucleolus formation. A model for achiasmatic pairing in Drosophila males based upon the combined action of topoisomerase I and a strand transferase is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{acetylation}} of nucleosomal histones H 3 and H 4 {{generally is}} believed to be correlated with potential transcriptional activity of eukaryotic chromatin domains. Here, we report that the extent of H 4 acetylation within euchromatin and heterochromatic domains is linked with DNA replication rather than with transcriptional activity, whereas H 3 acetylation remains fairly constant throughout the cell cycle. Compared with euchromatin, plant <b>nucleolus</b> <b>organizers</b> were more strongly acetylated at H 4 during mitosis but less acetylated during S phase, when the nucleolus appeared to be (at least transiently) devoid of nucleosomes. Deposition-related acetylation of lysines 5 and 12 of H 4 seems to be conserved in animals and plants and extended to K 16 in plants. A possibly species-specific above-average acetylation at lysines 9 / 18 and 14 of H 3 appeared in 4 �, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) –stained heterochromatin fractions. These results were obtained by combining immunodetection of all acetylatable isoforms of H 3 and H 4 on mitotic chromosomes and nuclei in G 1, early S, mid-S, late S, and G 2 phases of the field bean with identification of specific chromatin domains by fluorescence in situ hybridization or DAPI staining.

Intraspecific variation between different populations of A. sylvaticus has been reported. Chromosomal polymorphism due to B chromosomes has been detected in all the populations studied. Four classes of B chromosome have been identified in nine populations of A. sylvaticus from the mainland of Britain. They are distinguished by shape and size and according to their euchromatic or heterochromatic composition. Inter- and intra-individual variation (mosaicism) as well as interpopulational variation of the number and the nature of B chromosomes has been studied. Polymorphism resulting by a deletion, that is the loss of chromosomes or parts of chromosomes, has been found in the X chromosome of two females from different populations; one of them had XO and the other Xx. Intraspecific karyotype homology, as judged by G- and C-banding has been demonstrated between populations of the bank vole Clethrionomys qlareolus (Schreber) from different localities on the British mainland and from Skomer Island. In conclusion, the results of this investigation clearly indicate that studying karyotype evolution and variation between species, G- and C-banding and nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) are essential tools without which erroneous conclusions may be reached. <p...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA clone {{encoding}} an immunoreactive autoantigen (Ngp- 1) {{was isolated}} by screening Agtl I human ductal breast tumor expression libraries with autologous patient serum. The complete 2. 3 -kb nucleotide {{sequence of the}} cDNA was found to contain an open reading frame that could encode a protein of 731 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence contains {{a high concentration of}} charged amino acids in the carboxy terminal quarter of the molecule, three guanosine 5 ’-triphosphate (GTP) -binding protein motifs, and a consensus nuclear localization signal. The arrangement and spacing of the GTP-binding protein motifs indicate that Ngp-I belongs to a newly described subfamily of GTPases. Except for the consensus motifs, neither nucleotide sequence, nor the predicted amino acid sequence of the Ngp- 1 cDNA showed the slightest homology to any vertebrate gene product sequence listed in the databases. Northern blot analysis showed the 2. 3 -kb transcript to be ubiquitously expressed at relatively low levels in all human tissues tested, with the highest level of expression in the testes. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections with affinity-purified antiserumraised against a recombinant Ngp-I protein revealed that the antigen was exclusively localized to the <b>nucleolus</b> and nucleolar <b>organizer</b> regions in all cell types analyzed...|$|R
