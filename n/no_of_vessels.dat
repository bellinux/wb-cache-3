40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relation between marine casualty and dry bulk cargo freight rate according to the existence of spurious accident phenomenon in the dry cargo vessel accidents. According to the conventional expectation, the volume of marine accidents is a random process since it is accidently occurred and not a man-made outcome. Under this circumstance, it is expected that the volume of marine accidents should be statistically uncorrelated with the freight market rates and positively correlated with the fleet size. However, the existence statistics on dry cargo marine accidents indicate high level of negative correlation with freight markets (- 0. 95 for <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> and - 0. 79 for the volume of accidents in dwt) and also high level of negative correlation with the fleet size (- 0. 81 for the volume of accidents in dwt). The asymmetric interaction between the widely accepted facts and the statistical foundations is the main concern of this paper which is named the “Fallacy of Random Marine Accidents (FRMA) ”. The possible reasons of the FRMA phenomenon are considered to be based on the man-made marine accidents because of the financial collapse or as the well known term the credit default risk...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} automated alignment algorithms for the registration of optic disc images obtained by 2 different modalities: fundus photography and scanning laser tomography. Materials and Methods: Images obtained with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II and paired photographic optic disc images of 135 eyes were analyzed. Three state-of-the-art automated registration techniques Regional Mutual Information, rigid Feature Neighbourhood Mutual Information (FNMI), and nonrigid FNMI (NRFNMI) were used to align these image pairs. Alignment of each composite picture was assessed on a 5 -point grading scale: “Fail” (<b>no</b> alignment <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> with <b>no</b> vessel contact), “Weak” (vessels have slight contact), “Good” (vessels with 50...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although various {{particulate}} {{materials have}} been devel-oped as embolization agents, their biocompatibility remains unclear. We used an animal model {{to examine the}} possibility of using FDA-approved microcrystalline cellulose spheres (CEL-PHERE) as solid embolic material for the permanent occlusion <b>of</b> blood <b>vessels.</b> METHODS: Angiographic and histologic studies in 12 canine renal arterial systems were conducted to evaluate the performance of CELPHERE beads at 1 hour, and at 4 and 12 weeks after embolization. RESULTS: The CELPHERE beads traveled to vessels with diameters approximating their own. Larger vessels were occluded by aggregations of beads. There was <b>no</b> disruption <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> walls and <b>no</b> evidence <b>of</b> perivascular hemorrhage or inflammatory changes. CONCLUSION: Because CELPHERE beads are easy to handle, highly biocompatible, and have few adverse effects, they are suitable for intravascular applications. When embolization is deemed appropriate for the treatment of vascular malformations and neo-plasms, the embolic agent must be selected wit...|$|R

The heart showed ventricular septal defect. However, no other cardiovascular anomalies were associated in this case. There were three vessels that were taking off from the aorta consisted of the right brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid-artery and left subclavian artery.

40|$|Congenital retinal macrovessel is {{generally}} the presence <b>of</b> unilateral aberrant <b>vessel</b> crossing over the horizontal raphe through the macula.

In our case, visual acuity of the right eye was counting fingers at 3 meters. He had four diopter oblique astigmatism, esotropia, and dissociated vertical deviation. Fundoscopy revealed a aberrant vein crossing the foveola. Spectral OCT examination showed hiperreflectivity <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> and fluorescein angiography showed <b>no</b> leakage <b>of</b> the <b>vessel.</b> Although in the literature it is specified that the aberrant vein crossing the fovea is a factor of lowering visual acuity, in our case we thought, low visual acuity is due to deep amblyopia.
