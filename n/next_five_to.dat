In doing so, {{he became}} the first player to record four {{consecutive}} centuries in a ranking tournament, with breaks of 103, 104, 138 and 128 in frames 7 to 10. Higgins scored 494 points without reply, which was then a record (Ding Junhui managed 495 points against Stephen Hendry in the Premier League in 2007). Higgins and O'Sullivan also contested the Masters finals in 2005 and 2006. Higgins was beaten 3–10 in 2005.

500|$|Throughout the 1991 season it {{was clear}} that the team's defense, which had led the league in points allowed in 1990, was declining. This {{deterioration}} continued in 1992, when the team finished 26th in the league in points allowed. The Giants started 1-3 with Simms at the helm, rallied behind Hostetler to take four of their <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>to</b> get to 5-4, but lost their next five after Taylor and then Hostetler joined Simms on the injured list. [...] Six losses out of their last seven games meant a 6–10 record, their first double digit loss season since 1983. The team's pass rush, in particular, struggled after Taylor missed the last six games with a torn Achilles tendon. Handley, who had become unpopular with both players and fans, was fired after the end of the regular season.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, in June 2004, Anna Vissi {{stated that}} she [...] "would go to Eurovision {{if she was}} asked to". The network kept the {{internal}} format, seeking high-profile acts. A few months later on November 27, 2004, {{it was reported that}} Despina Vandi was [...] "ready to sign the necessary contracts" [...] though nothing was officially announced by ERT. The rumored contract, brokered between Vandi's record label Heaven Music and ERT would have included a term that required all of Vandi's songs to be written by popular Greek songwriter Phoebus. The next day, November 28, 2004, ERT's Eurovision spokeswoman Daphne Bokota stated that Despina Vandi and ERT were close to a deal, but had concluded that she was too expensive to send to the contest. She also said that Vandi was worried about participating in the Eurovision Song Contest while her international career was going well. [...] "Here at ERT, we don't understand [...] Greek artists are so insecure to participate", she stated. Bokota ended by saying that they would announce the artist within the <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>to</b> ten days and that a possible backup was Helena Paparizou. Around the same time, another name, Annette Artani also became a popular rumour. The Greek-American songwriter was still participating in Fame Story at the time and rumours expected her {{to pull out of the}} competition. On December 5, 2004, Anna Vissi was reportedly also in negotiations with ERT and on December 8, 2004, Daphne Bokota once again spoke on the issue saying that there would be a delay in the decision because of some sort of [...] "obstacle" [...] within the broadcaster. On January 15, 2005, ERT held a meeting with Franz Ferdinand which was reported by Star Channel to be the front runner, but ERT soon excluded them as they had [...] "no idea how Eurovision works and thus they proposed to compose a remake of a past song of theirs", a violation of contest rules; they were also requesting more money.|$|E
