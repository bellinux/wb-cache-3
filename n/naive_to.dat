5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was <b>naïve</b> <b>to</b> think that way.|$|E
25|$|Frustrated by the Japanese response, Phan {{turned to}} Liang, who {{explained}} to Phan it was <b>naïve</b> <b>to</b> expect financial {{assistance from the}} Japanese. The Vietnamese people would have to look only within Vietnam for support and financial backing. Liang told Phan that he could best serve the cause by writing and distributing pamphlets advocating for the revolution to rally support from the Vietnamese and others abroad. Phan took Liang's advice very seriously and immediately began to publish materials to obtain support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E
25|$|Flumazenil is very {{effective}} at reversing the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. One {{study found that}} only 10% of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for flumazenil. In this select population who are <b>naive</b> <b>to</b> and overdose solely on a benzodiazepine, it can be considered. Due to its short half life, the duration of action of flumazenil is usually less than 1 hour, and multiple doses may be needed. When flumazenil is indicated the risks can be reduced or avoided by slow dose titration of flumazenil. Due to risks and its many contraindications, flumazenil should be administered only after discussion with a medical toxicologist.|$|E

25|$|For a {{long time}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made to}} detect a link between Australian and Papuan languages, the latter being represented by those spoken on the coastal areas of New Guinea facing the Torres Strait and the Arafura Sea. In 1986 William A. Foley noted lexical similarities between Robert M. W. Dixon's 1980 reconstruction of proto-Australian and the East New Guinea Highlands languages. He believed that it was <b>naïve</b> <b>to</b> expect to find a single Papuan or Australian language family when New Guinea and Australia had been a single landmass (called the Sahul continent) for most of their human history, having been separated by the Torres Strait only 8000 years ago, and that a deep reconstruction would likely include languages from both. Dixon, in the meantime, later abandoned his proto-Australian proposal.|$|E
25|$|One other study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, {{showed that}} {{treatment}} is durable. It {{was the first}} study to show that, in a 17-year span, controlling A1c with CSII can reduce risk of cardiovascular events by 42%. But still little was published related to benefits of clinical use of combined CSII and blood glucose monitoring devices, especially CGM. Up until 2006 there were no clinical trials that reported outcomes comparing the use of insulin pumps in conjunction with glucose monitoring devices. It was not until 2007 that clinical trials began: 1) Study to Compare Efficacy of the MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System Vs. MDI in Subjects <b>Naive</b> <b>to</b> Insulin Pump Therapy; 2) Feasibility Study of Effective Methods for Training Pump Naive Subjects To Use The Paradigm System And Evaluate Effectiveness. and 3) Use of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.|$|E

[...] University of Melbourne evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that [...] "I think that it was a little bit <b>naive</b> <b>to</b> think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive...

Schram explained that her [...] "very kind and very sweet" [...] character finds herself in an [...] "unfortunate situation of having lost someone in her life. The Cinderella that you'll see is a portrayal of someone that's desperate {{to get out of}} the situation that she's in.

In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West and would like to serve their own interests." [...] His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that [...] "Africa is ripe for revolution" [...] was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d'Affairs persona non grata in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.|$|E

In his second essay, [...] "The Spiritual Morphology of Poetry," [...] he proposed four progressive classes of poetry, from <b>naive</b> <b>to</b> transcendent, and assigned famous poets from Keats to Whitman to these categories. The third essay, [...] "The Philosophy of 'Breaking Through'," [...] explores transcendence throughout the arts and describes his own moments of 'breaking through', such as his first hearing of Madame Butterfly.|$|E

In homage to Cyrano, {{he referred to}} the hybrid agent formed by combining the words of one individual with the body of another as a [...] "cyranoid". In his studies, interactants repeatedly failed to detect that their interlocutors were merely speech shadowing for third parties, implicitly and explicitly attributing to them communicative autonomy. Milgram referred to this phenomenon as the [...] "cyranic illusion".
