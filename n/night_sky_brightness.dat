50|$|The Bortle {{scale is}} a nine-level numeric scale that {{measures}} the <b>night</b> <b>sky's</b> <b>brightness</b> {{of a particular}} location. It quantifies the astronomical observability of celestial objects and the interference caused by light pollution. John E.

The scale ranges from Class 1, the darkest skies available on Earth, through Class 9, inner-city skies. It gives several criteria for each level beyond naked-eye limiting magnitude (NELM). The accuracy and utility of the scale have been questioned in recent research.|$|R
40|$|Astronomical {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy is made difficult by {{the extremely}} bright and variable <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> background. The <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> surface <b>brightness</b> {{is more than}} a thousand times brighter at 1. 6 m than at 0. 4 m. Furthermore the <b>brightness</b> of the <b>sky</b> changes by factors of 10 % on time-scales of minutes. Background-subtraction is therefore frustrated by high Poisson noise from the extreme brightness, and by systematic noise from the variability. Between 1. 0 and 1. 8 m almost all of this background results from the rotational and vibrational de-excitiation of hydroxyl molecules located at 90 km in the atmosphere. The hydroxyl emission lines are intrinsically very bright, but very narrow. Between the OH lines the sky should be very dark; it is expected that the interline continuum is dominated by the zodiacal scattered light. Therefore selectively filtering the OH lines would enable deep near-infrared observations. 1 page(s...|$|R

The measurements of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> presented here were carried out at Fowler's Gap, a research station in New South Wales, Australia, which is a potential site for the proposed TenTen Cherenkov telescope system and the planned wide-angle Cherenkov detector system HiSCORE. A portable instrument was developed and measurements of the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> were taken in February and August 2010. Brightness levels were measured for a range of different sky regions and in various spectral bands. The <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> in the relevant wavelength regime for photomultipliers was found to be at the same level as measured in similar campaigns at the established Cherenkov telescope sites of Khomas, Namibia, and at La Palma. The brightness of dark regions in the sky is about 2 x 10 ^ 12 photons/(s sr m^ 2) between 300 nm and 650 nm, and up to four times brighter in bright regions of the sky towards the galactic plane. The brightness in V band is 21. 6 magnitudes per arcsec^ 2 in the dark regions. All brightness levels are averaged over the field of view of the instrument of about 1. 3 x 10 ^(- 3) sr. The spectrum of the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> was found to be dominated by longer wavelengths, which allows to apply filters to separate the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> from the blue Cherenkov light.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the light {{pollution}} produced {{in the city of}} Perth, Western Australia, we have used a hand-held sky brightness meter to measure the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> across the city. The data acquired facilitated the creation of a contour map of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> across the 2400 km(2) area of the city - the first such map to be produced for a city. Importantly, this map was created using a methodology borrowed from the field of geophysics - the well proven and rigorous techniques of geostatistical analysis and modelling. A major finding of this study is the effect of land use on <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness.</b> By overlaying the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> map on to a suitably processed Landsat satellite image of Perth we found that locations near commercial and/or light industrial areas have a brighter night sky, whereas locations used for agriculture or having high vegetation coverage have a fainter night sky than surrounding areas. Urban areas have intermediate amounts of vegetation and are intermediate in brightness compared with the above-mentioned land uses. Regions with a higher density of major highways also appear to contribute to increased <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness.</b> When corrected for the effects of direct illumination from high buildings, we found that the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> in the central business district (CBD) is very close to that expected for a city of Perth's population from modelling work and observations obtained in earlier studies. Given that our <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> measurements in Perth over 2009 and 2010 are commensurate with that measured in Canadian cities over 30 years earlier implies that the various lighting systems employed in Perth (and probably most other cities) have not been optimised to minimize light pollution over that time. We also found that <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> diminished with distance with an exponent of approximately - 0. 25 +/- 0. 02 from 3. 5 to 10 km from the Perth CBD, a region characterized by urban and commercial land use.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the advances in near-infrared astronomy made possible {{through the use}} of fibre Bragg gratings to selectively remove hydroxyl emission lines from the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> spectrum. Fibre Bragg gratings should remove OH lines at high resolution (R= 10, 000), with high suppression (30 dB) whilst maintaining high throughput (~ 90 per cent) between the lines. Devices currently under construction should remove 150 lines in each of the J and H bands, effectively making the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> surface <b>brightness</b> ~ 4 magnitudes fainter. This background reduction is greater than the improvement adapative optics makes over natural seeing; photonic OH suppression is at least as important as adaptive optics for the future of cosmology. We present a model of the NIR sky spectrum, and show that the interline continuum is very faint (~ 80 ph/s/m^s/arcsec/micron on the ecliptic plane). We show that OH suppression by high dispersion, i. e. `resolving out' the skylines, cannot obtain the required level of sensitivity to reach the interline continuum due to scattering of light. The OH lines must be suppressed prior to dispersion. We have simulated observations employing fibre Bragg gratings of first light objects, high redshift galaxies and cool, low-mass stars. The simulations are of complete end-to-end systems from object to detector. The results demonstrate that fibre Bragg grating OH suppression will significantly advance our knowledge in many areas of astrophysics, and in particular will enable rest-frame ultra-violet observations of the Universe at the time of first light and reionisation.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{measurements}} of the near-infrared (NIR), specifically the J-band, sky background in the Canadian High Arctic. There has been considerable recent interest {{in the development of}} an astronomical observatory in Ellesmere Island; initial site testing has shown promise for a world-class site. Encouragement for our study came from sky background measurements on the high Antarctic glacial plateau in winter that showed markedly lower NIR emission when compared to good mid-latitude astronomical sites due to reduced emission from OH airglow lines. This is possibly a Polar effect and may also be present in the High Arctic. To test this hypothesis, we carried out an experiment which measured the the J-band <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> in the High Arctic during winter. We constructed a zenith-pointing, J-band photometer, and installed it at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) near Eureka, Nunavut (latitude: 80 degrees N). We present the design of our photometer and our results from our short PEARL observing campaign in February 2012. Taken over a period of four days, our measurements indicate that the J-band <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> varies between 15. 5 - 15. 9 mag arcsec^ 2, with a measurement uncertainty of 0. 15 mag dominated entirely by systematic errors present in our radiometric calibration. On our best night, we measured a fairly consistent <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> of 15. 8 +/- 0. 15 mag arcsec^ 2. This is not corrected for atmospheric extinction, which is typically < 0. 1 mag in the J-band on a good <b>night.</b> The measured <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> is comparable to an excellent mid-latitude site, but is not as dark as claimed by the Antarctic measurements.

40|$|A {{recurring}} {{question arises}} {{when trying to}} characterize, by means of measurements or theoretical calculations, the zenithal <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> throughout a large territory: how many samples per square kilometer are needed? The optimum sampling distance should allow reconstructing, with sufficient accuracy, the continuous zenithal brightness map across the whole region, whilst {{at the same time}} avoiding unnecessary and redundant oversampling. This paper attempts to provide some tentative answers to this issue, using two complementary tools: the luminance structure function and the Nyquist-Shannon spatial sampling theorem. The anaysis of several regions of the world, based on the data from the New world atlas of artificial <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> (Falchi et al 2016, Sci.

The data were collected in more than 130 winter nights from 2009 to 2011. We find that the atmospheric extinction coefficients for the g, r and i bands are 0. 70, 0. 55 and 0. 38 mag/airmass, respectively, based on observations taken in several photometric nights. The <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> determined from images of good quality has median val-ues of 21. 7, 20. 8 and 20. 0 mag/arcsec 2 and reaches 22. 1, 21. 2 and 20. 4 mag/arcsec 2 under the best observing conditions for the g, r and i bands, respectively. The relatively large extinction coefficients compared with other good astronomical observing sites are mainly due to the relatively low elevation (i. e. 180 m) and high humidity of the Station.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} map of the {{artificial}} <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> in Europe in V band with a resolution of approximately 1 km. The aim is to understand the state of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> pollution in Europe, to quantify the present situation and to allow future monitoring of trends. The artificial <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> in each site at a given position on the sky is obtained by integration of the contributions produced by every surface area in the surroundings of the site. Each contribution is computed taking into account based on detailed models the propagation in the atmosphere of the upward light flux emitted by the area and measured by the Operational Linescan System of DMSP satellites. The modelling technique, introduced and developed by Garstang and also applied by Cinzano, takes into account the extinction along light paths, a double scattering of light from atmospheric molecules and aerosols, Earth curvature and allows to associate the predictions to the aerosol content of the atmosphere. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{apply the}} <b>sky</b> <b>brightness</b> {{modelling}} technique introduced and developed by Roy Garstang to high-resolution DMSP-OLS satellite measurements of upward artificial light flux and to GTOPO 30 digital elevation data {{in order to}} predict the brightness distribution of the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> at a given site in the primary astronomical photometric bands {{for a range of}} atmospheric aerosol contents. This method, based on global data and accounting for elevation, Earth curvature and mountain screening, allows the evaluation of sky glow conditions over the entire sky for any site in the World, to evaluate its evolution, to disentangle the contribution of individual sources in the surrounding territory, and to identify main contributing sources. <b>Sky</b> <b>brightness,</b> naked eye stellar visibility and telescope limiting magnitude are produced as 3 -dimensional arrays whose axes are the position on the sky and the atmospheric clarity. We compared our results to available measurements. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS, 17 june 200...|$|R
