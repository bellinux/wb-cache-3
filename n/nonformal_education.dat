This study draws upon the concept of civil society to investigate how <b>nonformal</b> adult <b>education</b> offered through voluntary organizations discourages or encourages the development of civil society in Hungary. Since the demise of Soviet-style socialism in 1989 - 1990, the number of voluntary organizations in Hungary has exploded as has the intense interest on rebuilding civil society. The research traces the historical, political-philosophical development of the idea of civil society as well as discusses its tradition in Hungary. It is demonstrated that in Hungary voluntary organizations reserve an important place within the civil society. Further, the traditional and current role of voluntary organizations as providers of <b>nonformal</b> adult <b>education</b> in Hungary is also established. Thus, the link between civil society, voluntary organizations, and <b>nonformal</b> adult <b>education</b> is achieved. The relationship is dynamic; each exerts influence on the others. The data revealed that a class of individuals in Hungary identifies themselves as "intellectuals" especially qualified to lead <b>nonformal</b> adult <b>education</b> and voluntary organization activities. They are not workers or peasants; rather, they claim a heightened cultural position from which they are able to more successfully navigate the complexities of everyday life. Indeed, life during the current economic, social, and political transformation in Hungary is wrought with uncertainties and opportunities. The role of these intellectuals is fully explored in light of the data which revealed a trend towards the professionalization of voluntary organization leaders and nonformal adult educators. Further, participants of this study promulgated "market thinking," i. e., uncritical support of the developing market economy. This they accomplish by a concentrated focus on the "needs" of their constituencies rather than in consideration of the individual within the larger social context. As such, intellectuals support the status quo. The argument is made that nonformal adult educators and voluntary organization leaders adopt a more critical practice informed by transformative adult education and democratic communication. It is also recommended that the role of intellectuals be reconceptualized to include individuals from all classes of society charged with calling into question the status quo...|$|R

The issues that were studied were already from the early period broad - it could be as well political and social issues as literature or even school topics. The population as a whole were generally literate as early as the 17th century, and therefore literacy training was not an important concern as a topic for study circles.

40|$|In modern times, eating has an {{important}} role in the life of an individual. Starting in our youth, each individual begins learning how to cook from family and friends, choosing meals at the supermarkets, and enjoying a wide variety of food at celebrations. From choosing what kind of foods we will eat, to how we will prepare it, and which ingredients we will use, takes certain knowledge that can be used to desribe the term nutrition literacy. In the master's thesis, we determined the level of nutrition literacy of adults according to gender, age and level of education. We looked at the link between <b>nonformal</b> nutrition <b>education</b> and the level of nutrition literacy of adults. The survey involved 210 individuals, aged 18 to 65 years, both sexes, from different parts of Slovenia, and with different levels of education. We have found out that people who participate in nutritional education often, have a higher level of nutrition literacy, than those who participate less often. The highest level of nutrition literacy achieved was females, aged 51 to 65 years old, with a high level of education. The lowest level of nutrition literacy was reached by males, aged 18 to 30, with a lower level of education. If we compare the participation of adults in <b>nonformal</b> nutrition <b>education</b> and their level of nutrition literacy, we can say that women, aged 51 to 65, are more often involved in cooking workshops or attend nutrition lessons, and they have also higher level of nutrition literacy. Such education is attended by people with high and middle level of education, who have also higher level of nutrition literacy. Because of the link between nutritional education and a higher level of nutrition literacy, a large number of adult educational lessons and workshops should be organised. It is important that there would be sufficient quality education, which would be accessable to the general population. They would offer a theoretical less and practical workshop, which is necessary in order to acheive a higher level of nutrition literacy. ...|$|R

The UAF Cooperative Extension Service resides within the UAF Office of the Provost. UAF's public service and community engagement role is filled in part by Extension educators, faculty and staff located across the state of Alaska. The mission to bring research to the public is pursued in a collaborative fashion, with Extension working to connect Alaskans to the university as well as bringing the issues and challenges of the public to the university. Projects are often client-driven with Extension faculty responding to community needs. In particular, Alaska requires unique attention for its specific cultural, geographic and climatological differences {{from the rest of}} the United States. Alaska is known for its mineral deposits and shorelines, and renewable resources like fish and wood, as well as nonrenewable resources like petroleum. Alaska still imports the majority of the food consumed in the state. These are all issues that UAF Cooperative Extension works to examine and address. In a 2012 Plan of Work, UAF Extension describes its commitment to using <b>nonformal</b> <b>education</b> services to build Alaskan communities through programming in agriculture and horticulture, sustainability, natural resources, community development, youth development, global food security, food safety, childhood obesity, climate change, ecosystem management, and sustainable energy. UAF Extension also maintains its commitment to engagement by consulting with multiple advisory councils that include community members from a variety of backgrounds. Farmers, gardeners, miners, foresters, village leaders, parents, teachers and youth representatives meet regularly with Extension leadership to help inform decision making.|$|E
