The coil-pack ignition system introduced in the EF was rolled back to the distributor-style ignition from the ED Falcon due to reliability problems. A divided air induction pipe which led to the throttle was replaced with a single, wider pipe. Engine output remained unchanged at 157 kilowatts (211 hp) and 357 <b>newton</b> <b>metres</b> (263 ft·lbf). In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170 kilowatts (228 hp) to 185 (248 hp). Torque figures were also upped from 398 <b>newton</b> <b>metres</b> (294 ft·lbf) to 402 (296 ft·lbf).|$|R

50|$|A {{result of}} this {{similarity}} is that the SI unit for torque is the <b>newton</b> <b>metre,</b> which works out algebraically {{to have the same}} dimensions as the Joule. But they are not interchangeable. The CGPM has given the unit of energy the name Joule, but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the <b>newton</b> <b>metre</b> (N&sdot;m) - a compound name derived from its constituent parts. The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.|$|E

5000|$|Although joule and watt-second mean {{exactly the}} same thing (they {{represent}} the same amount of the same physical quantity, viz. energy), the <b>newton</b> <b>metre</b> is not equivalent to the joule (despite having the same dimensions) as it represents torque rather than energy.

5000|$|The joule (...) symbol: J), is a {{derived unit}} {{of energy in the}} International System of Units. It is equal to the energy {{transferred}} to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 <b>newton</b> <b>metre</b> or N&sdot;m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-1889).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{its small}} size, {{the system can}} deliver 8 000-10 000 <b>newton</b> <b>metres</b> of torque, so a {{separate}} planetary gear set is generally not required. Due to the large number (40) of piston movements per rotation, the torque is also smooth. If the pistons are all withdrawn into the hub, the rollers are not {{in contact with the}} cam ring, and the wheel can freewheel.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of solid mechanics, torsion is the {{twisting}} of an object due to an applied torque. Torsion is expressed in newton per squared meter (Pa) or pound per squared inch (psi) while torque is expressed in <b>newton</b> <b>metres</b> (N·m) or foot-pound force (ft·lbf). In sections perpendicular to the torque axis, the resultant shear stress in this section is perpendicular to the radius.|$|R

50|$|It is {{also used}} less {{commonly}} as a unit of work, or energy, in which case it {{is equivalent to the}} more common and standard SI unit of energy, the joule. In this usage the metre term represents the distance travelled or displacement {{in the direction of the}} force, and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum as it does when used to express torque. This usage is generally discouraged, since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque or a quantity of energy. However, since torque represents energy transferred or expended per angle of revolution, one <b>newton</b> <b>metre</b> of torque is equivalent to one joule per radian.|$|E

40|$|This short paper {{looks at}} the {{function}} costing of low-power, three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors. Function costing is the estimation {{of the costs of}} engineering systems from the quantified functions performed by their elements. For the motors considered, the cost is largely proportional to the full-load output torque, with only a small variation attributable to the pole number. However, two-pole motors are an exception; they cost up to 70 % more per unit torque. An explanation of this result is proposed. At the date of the prices used (February 1992), the approximate price of the sampled motors with four or more poles is 61 + 5. 30 per <b>newton</b> <b>metre</b> of output torque, and that of the two-pole motors is 49 + 9. 60 per <b>newton</b> <b>metre...</b>|$|E
