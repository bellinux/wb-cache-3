40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Most recent implementations of the Atkinson cycle are not ideal {{from the point of}} view of thermal conversion efficiency (TCE). For example, Toyota has put a gasoline engine in its Prius II which should achieve high efficiency by using a modified Atkinson cycle based on variable intake valve timing management. Firstly, this implementation of the Atkinson cycle is not the ideal solution because some of the air is first sucked from the intake manifold into the cylinder and subsequently returned back there. Consequently, the oscillating air stream reduces the thermal conversion efficiency of this cycle to a considerable extent Secondly, this implementation of the Atkinson cycle only reaches low levels of indicated mean pressure (IMEP) and, thirdly, it is not suitable for part load engine operating <b>points</b> (<b>BOP)</b> because of the lower TCE. For these reasons, this implementation of the Atkinson cycle is only suitable for hybrid vehicles, where the engine - because it is not directly linked mechanically to the wheels - works only in its best EOP. This paper analyzes the losses in TCE of internal combustion engine (ICE) - especially for the Atkinson cycles - in detail, and a proposal is made for their reduction for aspirated and especially for high pressure supercharged engines. ksb 201...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{scenario}} of energy crises, energy conservation in the electrical machines {{is very important}} in the industries. In order to conserve energy, one needs to monitor the performance of an induction motor on-site and in-situ. The instruments available for this purpose are very meager and very expensive. This paper deals with the design and development of induction motor performance analyser on-line, on-site, and in-situ. The system measures only few electrical input parameters like input voltage, line current, power factor, frequency, powers, and motor shaft speed. These measured data are coupled to name plate details and compute the operating efficiency of induction motor. This system employs the method of computing motor losses with the help of equivalent circuit parameters. The equivalent circuit parameters of the concerned motor are estimated using the developed algorithm at any load conditions and stored in the system memory. The developed instrument is a reliable, accurate, compact, rugged, and cost-effective one. This portable instrument {{could be used as a}} handy tool to study the performance of both slip ring and cage induction motors. During the analysis, the data can be stored in SD Memory card and one can perform various analyses like load vs. efficiency, torque vs. speed characteristics, etc. With the help of the developed instrument, one can operate the motor around its Best Operating <b>Point</b> (<b>BOP).</b> Continuous monitoring of the motor efficiency could lead to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of motors. LCA helps in taking decisions on motor replacement or retaining or refurbishment...|$|R

To this same species there is an evident affinity {{in the form of the}} mandibles and of the caudal appendages, and in the anterior rami of the cirri being longer than the posterior rami. <b>Notwithstanding</b> these <b>points</b> of affinity, I consider that P. fissa is more closely related in its whole organisation, as more particularly shown in the arrangement of the spines on the cirri and in the presence of terga, to P. crassa than to P. eburnea.

40|$|How do judges manage {{cases in}} which {{offenders}} belonging to a minority group invoke their cultural background to obtain special legal treatment? What are the outcomes of their judgments and what arguments posited to justify them? This paper attempts to answer these questions, by drawing {{on the results of}} socio-legal research aimed at identifying and analysing judicial reasoning (and decisions) in cases from 1993 to 2013 where âcultural argumentsâ were pleaded by the offender or raised by the judge (i. e. as a motive, justification, excuse, or mitigating or aggravating circumstance), in Italian and English courtrooms. The research reveals a different approach towards diversity management in the Italian and English courtrooms. Embracing strategies of âcultural reductionismâ and âcultural denialâ, respectively, Italian judges reveal a limited awareness of the complex issues surrounding cultural diversity, while English judges show uneasiness and disorientation in managing the âcultural factorâ. The different approaches <b>notwithstanding,</b> results <b>point</b> an interesting convergence: in the absence of policies and tools for managing cultural diversity in the courtroom, Italian and English judges try avoid directly addressing the âcultural questionâ...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{theories of}} interpretation, {{it is necessary}} to focus on institutional considerationsâto ask how actual judges would use any proposed approach, and to investigate the possibility that an otherwise appealing approach will have unfortunate dynamic effects on private and public institutions. <b>Notwithstanding</b> this <b>point,</b> blindness to institutional considerations is pervasive. It {{can be found in the}} work of early commentators on interpretation, including that of Jeremy Bentham; in the influential work of H. L. A. Hart, Ronald Dworkin, and Henry Hart and Albert Sacks; and in much contemporary writing. This blindness to institutional considerations creates serious problems for the underlying theories. The problems are illustrated with discussions of many disputed issues, including the virtues and vices of formalism; the current debate over whether administrative agencies should have greater interpretive freedom than courts; and the roles of text, philosophy, translation, and tradition in constitutional law. In many cases, an understanding of institutional capacities and dynamic effects should enable diverse people, with different views about ideal legal interpretation, to agree on what actual legal interpretation should entail...|$|R

40|$|At {{any point}} in time, a cleared parcel of forest land (CPFL) used for swidden {{agriculture}} exists in either the fallow or in the non-fallow state. Further, the practice of swidden agriculture requires one to operate {{in an environment of}} uncertainty. These two <b>points</b> <b>notwithstanding,</b> there are virtually no probabilistic models of swidden agriculture that explicitly account for the above dichotomy. Hence, in this paper, we use a stochastic model and a long run perspective to shed light on two hitherto unstudied questions concerning a CPFL used for swidden agriculture. First, we use renewal theory to determine the long run fraction of time that our CPFL is in either the fallow or in the non-fallow state. Second, we use the hyperexponential distribution to compute the stationary probability that the excess variable associated with the stochastic process representing our CPFL exceeds a given value.

40|$|Purpose â This study aims {{to provide}} a modern {{perspective}} {{on the role of}} dividends in smaller developed countries such as Ireland by examining views regarding the determinants of payout levels, the role of taxation and the relevance of conventional signalling theory. Design/methodology/approach â The study employs semi-structured interviews with the financial directors of 20 leading Irish companies. Findings â The results suggest support for the notion that dividend policy affects share valuations. However, views regarding this issue â and the role of taxation and signalling theory â vary markedly between quoted and unquoted firms as well as depending on firms' dividend histories. Research limitations/implications â The study suffers from the problem that in interview-based research the participants are necessarily a self-selecting group. <b>Notwithstanding</b> this <b>point,</b> the evidence suggests that the views of managers in a nation with a small, but highly developed, stock market are in line with those in countries with much larger exchanges. Further research could usefully extend the analysis and establish whether similar views exist in other countries with relatively small stock markets, but where the exchange is in an âemergingâ rather than âdevelopedâ state. Originality/value â The contribution of the paper comes from the uniqueness of the Irish setting: the Irish market is relatively small but, unlike many similarly sized markets, it is highly-developed, with long-term historical links to the London Stock Exchange. The results, therefore, provide evidence {{about the extent to which}} earlier findings based on the world's largest developed markets also prevail in those that are more modestly sized.
