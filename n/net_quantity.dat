40|$|Background: Providing cooked food {{to about}} hundred million {{children}} under mid-day meal scheme has been accomplished. Focus has now shifted to delivery of nutrition since the National Food Security Act specifies statutory quantities of protein and calories. Aims & Objectives : Delivery of nutrition requires comprehensive overhaul to include interventions in area of storage, preparation and practices, stoves, human resource development and community participation. Methodology : Based on a baseline survey of 70 schools through random selection in two blocks of Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh these concerns were investigated in details for specific interventions. Results : Nutrition : Both Faizabad and MHRD’s all India data establish that <b>net</b> <b>quantities</b> consumed {{by a child}} (quantity served minus plate waste) cannot provide prescribed nutrition. It reiterated the fact that mid-day meal is first and major meal for most rural children. Experiments conducted to standardize quantities, consistencies and splitting meal into snack plus meal improved nutritional delivery. Hygiene and food safety : In both blocks food was delivered at high temperature enabling food safety standards to be met with improved hygiene and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Human Resource : A pictorial training manual was prepared to train master trainers as well as cooks. Location specific training using local idiom and practices were used and campaign was conducted to enhance community participation in 45 villages. Fuel efficiency : Low cost smokeless chullahs (stoves) designed locally resulted in fuel savings. High efficiency cook stoves were also tested, however their cost limits reproduction. Conclusion: Accomplishing comprehensive improvement within existing cost of conversion per child is a challenge particularly {{since there are no}} economies of scale in rural areas. The methodologies created in the pilot for hygiene and food safety, awareness and capacity building through campaigns and training, locally designed smokeless chullahs can be scaled up for improving delivery of nutrition under the scheme. </p...|$|R
40|$|Four {{methods for}} {{measuring}} quantities of 12 plant-available nutrients were compared using three sandy soils {{in a series}} of three experiments. Three of the methods use different ion-exchange resin forms-bags, capsules, and membranes-and the fourth was conventional chemical extraction. The first experiment compared nutrient extraction data from a medium of sand saturated with a nutrient solution. The second and third experiments used Nakai and Sheppard series soils from Canyonlands National Park, which are relatively high in soil carbonates. The second experiment compared nutrient extraction data provided by the four methods from soils equilibrated at two temperatures, 2 ̆ 2 warm 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 cold. 2 ̆ 2 The third experiment extracted nutrients from the same soils in a field equilibration. Our results show that the four extraction techniques are not comparable. This conclusion is due to differences among the methods in the <b>net</b> <b>quantities</b> of nutrients extracted from equivalent soil volumes, in the proportional representation of nutrients within similar soils and treatments, in the measurement of nutrients that were added in known quantities, and even in the order of nutrients ranked by net abundance. We attribute the disparities in nutrient measurement among the different resin forms to interacting effects of the inherent differences in resin exchange capacity, differences among nutrients in their resin affinities, and possibly the relatively short equilibration time for laboratory trials. One constraint for measuring carbonate-related nutrients in high-carbonate soils is the conventional ammonium acetate extraction method, which we suspect of dissolving fine CaCO 3 particles that are more abundant in Nakai series soils, resulting in erroneously high Ca 2 + estimates. For study of plant-available nutrients, it is important to identify the nutrients of foremost interest and understand differences in their resin sorption dynamics to determine the most appropriate extraction method...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In {{freshwater}} the crayfish, Pacifasticus leniusculus, maintains sodium {{balance by}} absorbing sodium against a large concentration gradient. The site of uptake is the gills. The rate of uptake is regulated {{and can be}} increased by depleting the animals of sodium Neither the mechanism of sodium transport or the regulatory mechanism is understood for any invertebrate. Sodium balance in vertebrates {{is known to be}} at least partially regulated by hormones. It is conceivable that the crayfish regulates sodium balance in an analogous fashion. The eyestalks were studied as a possible source of such hormones. The immediate effects of eyestalk removal on an average crayfish of twenty grams are (1) a net uptake of sodium amounting to about 96 μeg in three days, (2) a negligible uptake of water and (3) a significant decrease in the sodium and chloride concentrations in the blood. The first two effects can be attributed to handling stress, for they also occurred in sham operated animals and animals handled to the same extent as animals without eyestalks. The third effect was characteristic of animals without eyestalks. It is concluded that the eyestalks may exert some control over the exchanges of sodium and chloride between the blood and some yet unidentified "salt-pool" in the animal. Crayfish lose sodium when transferred from pond water to flowing or frequently changed distilled water. The initial rate of loss is approximately 0. 07 μeq/g/hr. However, after a latent period of 72 hours, this is reduced by one half. This "depletion response" is not affected by eyestalk removal. Salt-depletion activates the sodium transport system so that when salt-depleted crayfish are returned to dilute solutions of NaCl they take up <b>net</b> <b>quantities</b> of sodium at a rapid rate (maximum 0. 3 μeq/g/hr), and thus restore their sodium balance. This "uptake response" is also not influenced by eyestalk removal. These data suggest that the eyestalks are not important in regulating the exchange of sodium between the internal and external medium. Sections of the eyestalks from crayfish which had been salt depleted and salt loaded were examined for neurosecretion and compared with sections from control animals. No differences were observed...|$|R
