5|$|He {{nonetheless}} persevered, {{staging a}} three-week, 17-city {{tour of the}} nation's ghettos and disadvantaged areas that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> advisors thought politically worthwhile. He sought to engage militants in dialogue, found himself exposed to the harsh realities and language of ghetto areas, and had an unusual encounter with hippies and The Diggers in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury.|$|E
5|$|His {{works have}} been {{translated}} into Belorussian, Bulgarian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian. Almost <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works have {{been translated into}} English; the only exception is the short story Wyjątkowo trudny teren ("Particularly Difficult Territory") that Zajdel wrote for the English language Tales from the Planet Earth anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.|$|E
5|$|In late August 2005, Favre's family {{suffered}} another setback: Hurricane Katrina {{blew through}} Mississippi, destroying his family's home there; however, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{family members were}} injured. Brett and Deanna's property in Hattiesburg, Mississippi was also extensively damaged by the storm. Favre elected to continue {{to play in the}} 2005 season.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, Piłsudski's {{government}} depended more on his {{charismatic authority}} than on rational-legal authority. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> followers could {{claim to be}} his legitimate heir, and after his death the Sanation structure would quickly fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1963, at {{his flat}} {{opposite}} the Jardin du Luxembourg, Poulenc suffered a fatal heart attack. His funeral {{was at the}} nearby church of Saint-Sulpice. In compliance with his wishes, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music was performed; Marcel Dupré played works by Bach on the grand organ of the church. Poulenc was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery, alongside his family.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{was married}} twice. In 1925, he married Mabel Fawell; <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Yorkshire {{teammates}} {{were aware that}} he was getting married. In 1952, he married Doris Garforth; on this occasion, many of his former cricketing colleagues attended. After a long illness, Waddington died in a Scarborough nursing home on 28 October 1959 aged 66. He was cremated in Bradford.|$|E

5|$|Wood's {{recordings}} did {{not remain}} in the catalogues long after his death. The Record Guide, 1956, lists <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> records. A few of his recordings have subsequently been reissued on compact disc, including the Decca and Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|Abovian was {{far ahead}} of his time and {{virtually}} <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works was published during his lifetime. Only after the establishment of the Armenian SSR was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited. Abovian is {{regarded as one of the}} foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but Armenian history at large. Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E

5|$|Although Cryer gained fame {{with his}} early film roles, {{it took several}} years to find success on television; <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> star vehicles, {{including}} The Famous Teddy Z, Partners, and The Trouble with Normal, lasted more than 22 episodes. In 2003, Cryer was cast as Alan Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009 and 2012. Cryer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Amongst his British contemporaries Chambers ranks {{top with}} two 9.97s finishes; {{the first in}} 1999 in Seville, Spain and the second in 2001 in Edmonton, Canada. Compatriot Mark Lewis Francis also scored a {{personal}} best of 9.97s at the Edmonton World Championships. Great Britain teammate Jason Gardener's personal best of 9.98s falls just short of Chambers'. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> British contemporaries have broken the ten second barrier {{on more than one}} occasion; Chambers has done so five times.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E

50|$|Sun Beau {{was sent}} to stud duty at his owner's Remlik Farm near Urbanna, Virginia. He sired few stakes winners, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> which {{achieved}} <b>his</b> level <b>of</b> success. The last <b>of</b> <b>his</b> progeny was born in 1944. He died in 1943.|$|R

5|$|Fifteen years later, {{after his}} wife dies, van Kempen and Ervine return to the Indies. He has been hired as a {{supervisor}} at another plantation, not far from his old place of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays {{at home with their}} mother.|$|E
5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} {{research}} suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and {{could be considered the}} dynasty's founder. Because <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, he was {{appointed}} {{to sit on the}} University Council of Victoria's third university La Trobe on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards and American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> suggestions had made an impact.|$|E
50|$|St Andrew's Church {{is a rare}} {{example of}} the Brisbane work of the renowned and fine architect, George D. Payne and has special {{associations}} with him. Though Payne practised in Brisbane for many years after construction <b>of</b> St Andrew's, <b>none</b> other <b>of</b> <b>his</b> buildings are <b>of</b> comparable prominence.|$|R

50|$|He retired at the {{relatively}} young age <b>of</b> twenty-five.

5|$|Kafka {{finished}} <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> full-length {{novels and}} burned around 90 {{percent of his}} work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described {{in a letter to}} Bauer as frightening, and whom he considered closer than his own family.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1952, Overton led {{a bombing}} raid over Pyongyang {{to destroy a}} series of targets near the Pyongyang Air Base. The targets had been un{{successful}}ly bombed earlier by a similar strike force, but Overton's group was successful in destroying {{almost all of the}} targets while <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> aircraft took major damage from the 48 antiaircraft and 100 automatic weapons, and without harming the many nearby UN prisoner of war concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his {{professional}} career, Rivera learned English, beginning in 1991 with the Greensboro Hornets, when he realized <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammates spoke his native Spanish. He is now a proponent of Latino players learning English and of American press members learning Spanish, in order to bridge the cultural gap. Rivera became a naturalized citizen of the United States in October 2015, and was recognized as an Outstanding American by Choice during the ceremony.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} stories told <b>of</b> <b>his</b> quick and vitriolic wit, which {{apparently}} was demonstrated {{from an early}} age.

50|$|Nothing {{is known}} about his dynastic connections. His few coins are rather {{singular}} and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them bear <b>his</b> likeness, a rare occurrence in Indo-Greek coinage.

50|$|Jok was {{a fixture}} in the Triple-A International League, where he {{appeared}} in 1,149 games for seven teams representing five different cities between 1950 and 1961, Jok's final pro season. Strangely, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them were <b>his</b> hometown Buffalo Bisons.|$|R
