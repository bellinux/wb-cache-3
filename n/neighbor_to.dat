5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 25, 1950, ten {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's <b>neighbor</b> <b>to</b> the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.|$|E
5|$|The NCR Corporation used Babbitt as {{housing for}} its workers. In 1906, {{the area was}} annexed {{by the city of}} Dayton and {{continued}} on as a middle-class neighborhood. The University of Dayton, Babbitt's <b>neighbor</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, began to buy available houses in the neighborhood in the 1950s as an experiment in off-campus housing. By the 1970s, the student population of the area was growing rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, the Pagan Empire, {{along with}} the Khmer Empire, {{was one of the}} two main empires in {{mainland}} Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan's <b>neighbor</b> <b>to</b> the northeast was not China but the independent Dali Kingdom and its predecessor Nanzhao, both with Dali as their capital city. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west and at other times with China's Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself.|$|E

5|$|On August 18 {{authorities}} began evacuating {{people from}} parts of Quintana Roo, moving 2,500people from Holbox Island and a further 80,000 tourists from {{elsewhere in the}} state. Air-evacuations of tourists were stopped when Dean's outer rainbands closed almost a dozen Cancún and Cozumel airports {{on the evening of}} August 20. The Campeche airport closed shortly thereafter. The state government set up 530storm shelters in schools and other public buildings, prepared to hold 73,000people.

Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the South Koreans who could muster just 38,000 men to the front-line to oppose them. The majority of the South Korean forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the capital Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw further southwards.|$|E

5|$|As Brazil {{had been}} pacified {{after the end}} of the last {{rebellion}} (the Praieira revolt), Brazil's government turned its attention to the growing tensions with its <b>neighbor</b> <b>to</b> the south, the Argentine Confederation. Paulino Soares, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to forge alliances with Uruguay and Paraguay, nations which also saw a threat in the ambitions of Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation. An army commanded by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. More than a year had passed since Honório Hermeto returned from Pernambuco, when he was named by Paulino Soares as special minister plenipotentiary in the Plata region. On 12 October 1851, Honório Hermeto and an Uruguayan envoy signed a treaty in Rio de Janeiro setting the international border between Brazil and Uruguay. The agreement required Uruguay to abandon some claims to disputed areas in exchange for Brazilian aid in the war against Argentina.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} the refugee crisis could not {{continue}} indefinitely was emphasized in January 1996 when Burundi closed the two camps within its borders and told the refugees that they should return to Rwanda.

Burundi, then {{in the midst of}} a civil war, had been stressed by the demands of the refugees but was also influenced by a desire not to antagonize the new government of its <b>neighbor</b> <b>to</b> the north.|$|E

25|$|Finland {{retained}} a democratic constitution and free economy during the Cold War era. Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included obligations and restraints on Finland, {{as well as}} territorial concessions. Both treaties have been abrogated by Finland since the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, while leaving the borders untouched. Even though being a <b>neighbor</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union sometimes resulted in overcautious concern in foreign policy ("Finlandization"), Finland developed closer co-operation with the other Nordic countries and declared itself neutral in superpower politics.|$|E

Though the Ottoman Empire was partially occupied by the Allies, they did not withdraw their forces from the pre-war Russo-Turkish boundary until February 1919 and maintained many troops mobilized along this frontier.|$|E
