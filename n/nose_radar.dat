5000|$|The largest {{military}} operator was the French Navy, which operated 25 different Languedoc aircraft {{over the}} years. The first aircraft were delivered in 1949 {{and used as}} long-range transports between Paris, Marseilles and Lyons and North Africa; later aircraft would be used as flying classrooms for non-pilot aircrew training. The flying classrooms were modified with both a <b>nose</b> <b>radar</b> set and a ventral [...] "dustbin" [...] radar. The aircraft was withdrawn from Naval service in 1959.|$|E
50|$|In early 1944, it {{was decided}} to focus on {{reconnaissance}} versions of the A and E models The airframe was modified with the removal of the bomb aimer and the forward gun, and additional fuel cells were added to extend the range to 3,400 km (2,110 mi). The Ju 188 D-1 was otherwise similar to the A-1, and the Ju 188 D-2 fitted <b>nose</b> <b>radar</b> for naval reconnaissance. Similar conversions of the E models were the Ju 188 F-1 and Ju 188 F-2.|$|E
5000|$|An unbuilt air-launched, land attack {{version of}} Sea Eagle, using a similar <b>nose</b> <b>radar</b> and semi-armour-piercing warhead, {{was known as}} P4T. A later {{proposed}} land attack variant which {{would have had a}}n imaging infrared or millimetre wave radar seeker-head and a data link to allow the launch platform to update the missile in flight was studied around 1990; this version was dubbed [...] "Golden Eagle" [...] and would have had a penetrator warhead to allow attacks on land-based hardened targets.|$|E
50|$|A {{reconnaissance}} version, the RF-5E Tigereye, with {{a sensor}} package in the <b>nose</b> displacing the <b>radar</b> and one cannon, was also offered.|$|R
50|$|Republic of China Air Force: Received 115 F-5A and B from 1965, 48 were {{transferred}} to South Vietnam before 1975. From 1973 to 1986, Taiwan produced 308 F-5E/Fs under license. Later batches of locally AIDC licensed production of Tiger IIs were fitted with flare/chaff dispensers, plus handling qualities upgrades with enlarged LEX and F-20's shark <b>nose,</b> and <b>radar</b> warning receivers(RWR).|$|R
50|$|Only one {{production}} variant was built, {{the standard}} An-22. Prototypes, {{such as the}} one first featured at the 1965 Paris Air Show had fully glazed noses that lacked the <b>nose</b> mounted <b>radar</b> of production models. Those aircraft had the radar mounted below the right wheel well fairing, forward of the wheels. Antonov designated a variant with a modified electrical system and an additional augmented flight control system the An-22A but the designation was not used by the military.|$|R
5000|$|Rjstgy {{near the}} <b>nose,</b> <b>radar</b> mounted under the {{fuselage}} and nose are evident. -129 Ranks UAV drone control with endurance is 24 hours, is placed. Although the saga {{is known as}} a UAV combat capabilities, but it has not predicate any mention of weapons. The unveiling ceremony of hardpoints under each wing could be seen in each of them mounted a 107mm rockets. The UAV is capable of carrying up to about 45 to 60 kg. The UAV mounted heavy anti-armor missiles and air-to-air missiles there.|$|E
25|$|Second series, with {{upgraded}} engines, improved avionics, seating up to 84 passengers. All Tu-134A variants {{have been}} built with the distinctive glass <b>nose</b> and chin <b>radar</b> dome, but some were modified to the B standard with the radar moved to the nose radome.|$|R
50|$|Two {{aircraft}} {{were designated}} as Type 31D and were manufactured as dedicated anti-satellite models with ballast in the <b>nose</b> instead of <b>radars,</b> flat fuselage undersurface (i.e. no recessed weapon system bays) and had large winglets {{above and below}} the wing-tips. Equipped with Vympel ASAT missiles.|$|R
50|$|It {{was clear}} that the B-36 needed nose guns. Adding these {{required}} a substantial rearrangement of the cockpit. In late 1944, a mockup of the new nose was approved. Though too late for the first prototype, it would be fitted to the second XB-36. Unfortunately, the new <b>nose</b> with its <b>radar</b> and radio equipment added significant weight.|$|R
50|$|The Z-8A {{version was}} {{developed}} as an army transport variant and received certification in February 1999. In 2001, {{a pair of}} Z-8As were delivered to the Army for evaluation, however, it ultimately decided to procure additional Mi-17V5s instead. Only a single batch of about six Z-8A were delivered to the Army in November 2002; these still retained the <b>nose</b> weather <b>radar</b> and side floats. Starting in 2007, the Peoples Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) also acquired dozens of upgraded Z-8Ks and Z-8KAs for conducting SAR missions; these were equipped with a FLIR turret and a searchlight underneath the cabin, plus a hoist and a flare dispenser.|$|R
40|$|The {{topics are}} covered in {{viewgraph}} form and include the following: (1) a summary of radar flight data collected; (2) a video of combined aft cockpit, <b>nose</b> camera, and <b>radar</b> hazard displays; (3) a comparison of airborne radar F-factor measurements with in situ and Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) F-factors for some sample events; and (4) a summary of wind shear detection performance...|$|R
50|$|The HY-2 is {{identical}} to the HY-1 but with a further stretched body. The missile features a round <b>nose</b> accommodating the <b>radar</b> seeker, a pair of mid-mounted delta wings on the middle section of missile body, and three tail control surfaces. The missile is powered by a liquid-fuel rocket motor, with a solid rocket booster attached under the missile fuselage.|$|R
50|$|While other OKB's were {{designing}} {{the next generation}} of all-weather interceptors, OKB-301 was tasked with fitting the new Sokol (Falcon) radar into the La-200. The result was Aircraft 200B, with a new fuselage <b>nose</b> housing the <b>radar</b> behind a large radome with three air intakes surrounding the radome. By mid 1953 the radar was working adequately but Aircraft 200B's performance was no longer good enough and further work was abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|By November 1949 {{the second}} {{aircraft}} was virtually complete, but the Air Force {{was concerned about}} the design's poor thrust-to-weight ratio and decided to implement a weight-reduction program, as well as upgrading the engines to the more powerful J-33-A-21 fitted with an afterburner. Other major changes included the replacement of the nose gun turret by the Hughes-designed six-gun <b>nose,</b> AN/ARG-33 <b>radar,</b> and E-1 fire-control system, permanent wing-tip fuel tanks, and the ability to lower the complete engine for better maintenance access. The new nose added [...] to the length of the aircraft. It was redesignated YF-89A to better reflect its role as a pre-production testbed to evaluate equipment and changes planned for the F-89A production aircraft. The aircraft was essentially complete by February 1950.|$|R
50|$|Using 13 surplus de Havilland Herons airframes, Saunders {{designed}} the conversion and utilized some engineering input from Aviation Traders (Engineering). The remanufactured design {{was based on}} a stretched fuselage to accommodate 23 passengers, a lengthened <b>nose</b> to fit <b>radar,</b> reshaped vertical tail (also increased in size) and two Pratt and Whitney PT6A turboprops replacing the original four Gipsy Queen piston engines, along with other minor changes. All of the aircraft's systems, including the brakes, were pneumatic {{with the exception of the}} windshield wipers, which were hydraulic.|$|R
5000|$|Under Project Sabre II and the Chinese Super-7 project, the F-7 {{airframe}} was redesigned with angled air intakes on {{the sides}} of the fuselage so a solid radome <b>nose</b> could house <b>radar</b> and other avionics from Northrop's F-20 [...] "Tigershark" [...] fighter. The Chinese WP-7 turbojet engine was to be replaced with a modern turbofan engine, either the GE F404 or PW1120, to improve performance. The resulting aircraft, designated F-7M Sabre-II, would have looked much like the Guizhou JL-9 (or FTC-2000) jet trainer / fighter aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The Nimrod {{design was}} based on that of the Comet 4 civil {{airliner}} which had {{reached the end of}} its commercial life (the first two prototype Nimrods, XV148 & XV147 were built from two final unfinished Comet 4C airframes). The Comet's turbojet engines were replaced by Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans for better fuel efficiency, particularly at the low altitudes required for maritime patrol. Major fuselage changes were made, including an internal weapons bay, an extended <b>nose</b> for <b>radar,</b> a new tail with electronic warfare (ESM) sensors mounted in a bulky fairing, and a MAD (magnetic anomaly detector) boom. After the first flight in May 1967, the RAF ordered a total of 46 Nimrod MR1s. The first example (XV230) entered service in October 1969. A total of five squadrons using the type were established; four were permanently based in the UK and a fifth was initially based in Malta.|$|R
50|$|The Voodoo had a low/mid-mounted wing, swept to 35°. The two engines, {{specified}} as Westinghouse J34 turbojets were in {{the lower}} fuselage, fed by air intakes in the wing roots and jetpipes beneath the rear fuselage. This made room in the long fuselage for the fuel tanks required for the required long range. The Voodoo's short <b>nose</b> had no <b>radar,</b> being intended to house an armament of six 20 mm (.79 in) M39 cannon, while the fighter's single pilot sat in a pressurized cockpit and was provided with an ejection seat.|$|R
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the <b>radar</b> <b>nose</b> profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|R
2500|$|Before landing, {{the pilot}} {{would open the}} BLC vents as well as {{lower the flaps to}} achieve slow, stable flight. [...] A {{consequence}} of the blown wing was that the engines were required to run at high power for low-speed flight; in order to generate sufficient compressor gas for blowing. [...] Blackburn's solution to this situation was the adoption of a large air brake; this also allowed an overshooting aircraft to pull away more quickly during a failed landing attempt. [...] The <b>nose</b> cone and <b>radar</b> antenna could also be swung around by 180degrees to reduce the length of the aircraft in the carrier hangar. [...] This feature was particularly important due to the small size of the aircraft carriers that the Buccaneer typically operated from.|$|R
5000|$|... 61-2779 was {{the second}} {{aircraft}} of the production fleet (61-2778 was first; which was stretched to a [...] "B" [...] model). Named [...] "Against the Wind" [...] by her Crew Chief, WG-13 Paul Laemers (an avid Bob Seger fan from Detroit). 779 was heavily modified to become the Advanced Radar Test Bed (ARTB). Structural modifications included a 'universal nose' which could be interchanged with B-1, F-15, and F-16 <b>nose</b> radomes and <b>radar</b> system housings to support in-flight instrumented radar testing. Racks of interface electronics, computers, data recorders, and operator stations filled the cargo compartment. 61-2779 had the roll up crew entry door that was common to the C-141 fleet. After her retirement, 61-2779 was put on static display at Edwards AFB, CA.|$|R
5000|$|The sets {{tended to}} {{overload}} the Mosquito's electrical system and occasionally exploded. Mickey-equipped Mosquitos {{had the highest}} loss, abort, and mission failure rates of any version of the otherwise successful Mosquito reconnaissance aircraft, and were severely curtailed after February 19, 1945. Three were lost to enemy action and one was shot down by friendly fire from a Ninth Air Force P-47. In Europe several P-38 fighters were also converted to carrying H2X <b>radar</b> in the <b>nose,</b> along with an operator/navigator in a cramped compartment in the <b>nose</b> behind the <b>radar</b> dish, provided with small side windows and an access/exit hatch in the floor (much like the earlier P-38 [...] "Droop Snoot" [...] bomber-leader variants, but with a radome instead of a glazed nose). These missions were to obtain radar maps of German targets but plans to produce the variant in quantity never materialized.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} the aircraft's unorthodox {{aerodynamic}} features, the Javelin had a fairly conventional structure and materials, being mainly composed of an aluminium alloy, with some use of steel edging. The fuselage was composed of four sections, the <b>nose</b> (containing the <b>radar</b> radome), the front fuselage, centre fuselage and rear fuselage; the nose and rear fuselage were removable for servicing and easy replacement. The engines were {{on either side of}} the centre fuselage section, the internal space in the centre containing the service bay that housed much of the aircraft's electrical, hydraulic, and avionics subsystems. The engine air intakes were placed on the forward fuselage, running directly from beneath the cockpit rearwards into the delta wing. Electricity was provided by a pair of 6,000 watt, 24-volt generators driven by the auxiliary gearbox; inverters provided AC power for equipment such as some flight instruments and the radar.|$|R
