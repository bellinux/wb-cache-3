After the war, the library again increased by the donations of the students; by 1959 2278 volumes had been collected. The library became fully functioning when the structure of faculty came into use in 1972.

It formed part of a special issue including an article from Tony Blair, then prime minister of the UK, but has not been repeated.

25|$|On October 31, 1855, W. B. Astor donated {{land for}} the {{expansion}} of the Library. Work on an extension began at once. The designer of the addition was Griffith Thomas. The new building was opened to the public on September 1, 1859, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>volumes</b> in the library being estimated at about 110,000. Washington Irving, president of the board of trustees, died November 28, 1859; he was succeeded as president by W. B. Astor. Cogswell resigned as superintendent in 1861, and Francis Schroeder, former pupil of his at Round Hill and American minister to Sweden in 1850, was appointed in his place. Cogswell still retained his place as a trustee. In 1862 W. B. Astor established an annuity fund of $5,000, yielding $300, payable to Cogswell in return for the bibliographical collection he had presented to the library. In 1864, Cogswell left New York to make his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and resigned as a trustee.|$|E
25|$|The Cornell University Library is the 11th largest {{academic}} {{library in}} the United States, ranked by <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>volumes</b> held. Organized into 20 divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5million printed volumes in open stacks, 8.2million microfilms and microfiches, {{and a total}} of 440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the University Archives. It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates to borrow books from its libraries. In 2006, The Princeton Review ranked it as the 11th best college library, and it climbed to 6th best in 2009. The library plays an active role in furthering online archiving of scientific and historical documents. arXiv, an e-print archive created at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Paul Ginsparg, is operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the library's services. The archive has changed the way many physicists and mathematicians communicate, making the e-print a viable and popular means of announcing new research.|$|E
25|$|Michael Hartnett (19411999) {{was unusual}} amongst Irish poets {{in that he}} was equally fluent in both Irish and English. As well as {{original}} work in both languages, including haiku in English, he published translations in English of bardic poetry and of the Tao Te Ching. In his 1975 book A Farewell to English he declared his intention to write only in Irish in the future, describing English as 'the perfect language to sell pigs in'. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>volumes</b> in Irish followed: Adharca Broic (1978), An Phurgóid (1983) and Do Nuala: Foighne Chrainn (1984). In 1984 he returned to Dublin {{to live in the}} suburb of Inchicore. The following year marked his return to English with the publication of Inchicore Haiku, a book that deals with the turbulent events in his personal life over the previous few years. This was followed by a number of books in English including A Necklace of Wrens (1987), Poems to Younger Women (1989) and The Killing of Dreams (1992). He died in Dublin in 1999, aged 58.|$|E

25|$|Finance {{remained}} the dominant {{influence on the}} production of the volumes, rather than literary or academic concerns about the work of the Historical Section. The subcommittee met six times in 1923 and on 9 August, Hankey managed to obtain a permanent Cabinet Subcommittee of Control of the Official Histories, chaired by the President of the Board of Education and meeting annually. There were twelve meetings between 1924 and 1946, with representatives from the Treasury, War Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry and the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Daniel and Edmonds usually attended; other official historians and members of the Colonial and India offices were present for particular discussions; where the committee failed to agree, a ruling was made by the Cabinet. Edmonds submitted an annual report, other historians added summaries of their work, progress reports, staff and personnel matters and publications by foreign official historians. Meetings considered costs and the progress of publication, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>volumes,</b> their scope and size. On rare occasions the committee made a ruling on content, after complaints by a department; in 1928, the War Office strenuously objected to some of the content of the first Gallipoli volume by C. F. Aspinall-Oglander.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fifteen}} years {{following}} 1880, there was continuous but uneven growth of resources as signified by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>volumes</b> on the shelves, an increase from 193,308 in 1880 to 227,652 in 1885, to 248,856 in 1890, and to 294,325 {{at the end}} of 1895. Purchases reached their low level in 1888 when 876 volumes were bought, and their high level in 1894 when 6,886 volumes were bought, the sums spent for books and binding being $6,245.06 and $24,074 respectively. Appreciation of the library as shown by statistics of readers grew slowly but steadily, the average number for the decade 1880–1889 being 59,000 readers per year, and for the next six years rising to 70,000. About the same result is indicated by the figures of volumes consulted, the number rising from 146,136 in 1880 to 167,584 in 1890 and to 225,477 in 1895. Also during 1880, the hour for opening was moved at 9 a.m. Closing time stayed at 5 p.m. except during the short days of the winter months when it took place at 4 or 4:30p.m. Alexander Hamilton, president of the board, died in 1889, and Hamilton Fish was chosen to succeed him as president. After two years, in 1891, Thomas M. Markoe was chosen to the office, which he held until the 1895 consolidation.|$|E
500|$|Martin is firm about {{ending the}} {{series with the}} seventh novel [...] "until I decide not to be firm". With his stated goal of telling the story from {{beginning}} to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>volumes.</b> He knows the ending in broad strokes {{as well as the}} future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing A Dream of Spring together with The Winds of Winter, and in early 2016, {{he said he did not}} believe A Dream of Spring would be published before the last season of the HBO show.|$|E

500|$|A trip to Inisheer in the Aran Islands in 1893 re-awoke for Lady Gregory an {{interest}} in the Irish language and in the folklore of the area in which she lived. She organised Irish lessons at the school at Coole, and began collecting tales from the area around her home, especially from the residents of Gort workhouse. One of the tutors she employed was Norma Borthwick, who would visit Coole numerous times. This activity led to the publication of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>volumes</b> of folk material, including A Book of Saints and Wonders (1906), The Kiltartan History Book (1909) and The Kiltartan Wonder Book (1910). She also produced a number of collections of [...] "Kiltartanese" [...] versions of Irish myths, including Cuchulain of Muirthemne (1902) and Gods and Fighting Men (1904). ("Kiltartanese" [...] is Lady Gregory's term for English with Gaelic syntax, based on the dialect spoken in Kiltartan.) In his introduction to the former, Yeats wrote [...] "I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time."
