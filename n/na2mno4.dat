50|$|Sodium {{permanganate}} {{cannot be}} prepared analogously to {{the route to}} KMnO4 because the required intermediate manganate salt, <b>Na2MnO4,</b> does not form. Thus less direct routes are used including conversion from KMnO4.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium {{manganate}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula <b>Na2MnO4.</b> This deep green solid is a rarely encountered analogue of the related salt K2MnO4. Sodium manganate is rarely encountered because it cannot be readily prepared from the oxidation of manganese dioxide and sodium hydroxide. Instead this oxidation {{stops at the}} level of Na3MnO4, and this Mn(V) salt is unstable in solution. [...] Sodium manganate can be produced by reduction of sodium permanganate under basic conditions: ...|$|E
