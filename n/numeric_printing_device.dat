40|$|The {{evaluation}} of printer profile accuracy {{is affected by}} many factors and the <b>printing</b> <b>device</b> represents only one such factor. This paper examines the effect of profiling target layout and patch size on printer profile accuracy. Two digital color <b>printing</b> <b>devices</b> were evaluated using a single color measurement system. The evaluation avoids temporal variation associated with the color <b>printing</b> <b>device</b> on purpose. It was found out that (1) the spatial color uniformity of the device bears a larger impact on its colorimetric accuracy than factors such as target layout and patch size; (2) {{the use of the}} random target over the visual target helps minimize spatial non-uniformity in the shadow region of the color gamut; and (3) there is no significant difference in colorimetric accuracy when reducing the patch size of the random target from 6 mm to 4 mm using the color measurement instrument in this experiment...|$|R
