Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Perceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied {{in school}} and, {{at the age}} of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a {{derelict}} house in Montego Bay with transgender friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died {{in the early hours of}} the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> at all.|$|E

5|$|Later on, {{the baby}} is stolen {{by a group of}} brownies. While chasing them, Willow and Meegosh are trapped, but rescued by the Fairy Queen Cherlindrea. Cherlindrea {{identifies}} the baby as Elora Danan, the future princess of Tir Asleen and Bavmorda's bane, and assigns Willow the task of helping the baby fulfill her destiny. Willow sends Meegosh home, and two of the brownies, Franjean and Rool, are instructed to guide Willow to the sorceress Fin Raziel. The three of them later encounter Madmartigan at a tavern, where he is disguised as a woman to hide from Lug, a cuckolded husband, who then flirts with the disguised Madmartigan. Sorsha arrives and reveals his identity, and in the ensuing brawl started by the furious Lug upon the realization that Madmartigan is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> Willow, Madmartigan, and the brownies escape. Madmartigan guides them to a lake where Raziel lives, but departs again as they cross it.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{poems in}} the sequence recommend the benefits of marriage and children. With the famous Sonnet 18 ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day") the tone changes dramatically towards romantic intimacy. Sonnet 20 explicitly laments {{that the young man}} is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> Most of the subsequent sonnets describe {{the ups and downs of}} the relationship, culminating with an affair between the poet and the Dark Lady. The relationship seems to end when the Fair Youth succumbs to the Lady's charms (Sonnet 144).|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} faced early on {{for these women}} were that of a more racial stature. An officer of the Canadian Women's Army Corps had to write to her superiors regarding whether or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> of “Indian nationality” would be objected for enlistment. Because of Canada’s large population of immigrants, German women also enlisted creating great animosity between recruits. The biggest difficulty was however the French-Canadian population. In a document dated 25 November 1941, it was declared that enlisted women should ‘unofficially’ speak English. However, seeing {{the large number of}} capable women that this left out, a School of English was stabled for recruits in mid-1942.|$|E
500|$|The obverse of the Isabella quarter {{depicts a}} crowned and richly clothed bust of that Spanish queen.

[...] The reverse depicts a kneeling woman with distaff and spindle. [...] Vermeule traces that imagery to {{the figure of a}} young female servant, carved upon the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia in the 5th century B.C. [...] Nevertheless, a contemporary account in the American Journal of Numismatics compared the reverse to an anti-slavery token with a kneeling woman and the legend [...] "Am I <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> and a sister". [...] The art historian, writing in 1971, noted that [...] "nowadays the coin seems charming for its quaintness and its Victorian flavor, a mixture of cold Hellenism and Renaissance romance. [...] Perhaps one of its greatest joys is that none of the customary inscriptions, mottoes and such, appear on it." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 28 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Rich Juzwiak of Stylus Magazine gave the album an A rating, stating [...] "Her adventurous and, yes, massive, persona {{is allowed to}} wander wherever it wants on The Cookbook, be it avant or common." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote, [...] "The Cookbook is a convincing return to form.... Sounding as unique and startling and formidable as ever, Missy Elliott is clearly <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> to be messed with." [...] John Bush of AllMusic noted that [...] "Elliott forces a few rhymes, plays to type with her themes, and uses those outside producers to follow trends in hip-hop.... What's different here is how relaxed Elliott is, how willing she seems to simply go with what comes naturally and sounds best." [...] Q stated [...] "If not Elliott's most inventive album, The Cookbook is certainly her most colourful and entertaining".|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E
500|$|Samus' reveal in the {{original}} Metroid, which UGO.com called {{the original}} [...] "jaw-dropping moment" [...] in gaming, was named as the greatest twist in video games by Game Informer in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo's history by GameDaily in 2008. The Irish Times found it refreshing {{to learn that the}} series' protagonist, who is [...] "well disguised under the suit of heavy armour", is female, but Rupert Goodwins of The Independent wrote that the [...] "Transformer-like suit she wears could just as easily contain a large centipede; it's hardly a breakthrough for feminism." [...] According to the 2007 book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century: Literate Connections, Samus was perhaps the most nonsexualized female video game character ever, a belief shared by Steve Rabin in Introduction to Game Development, which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo's most popular video game mascots. In 2002, Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that [...] "unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal. Samus is tough, silent, heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high-tech Power Armor." [...] That same year, however, an article in the Toronto Star retorted that the [...] "sexual politics" [...] surrounding Samus and the Metroid series needed to stop, arguing that the original [...] "big crazy shock to the gaming public" [...] was [...] "some seriously misspent energy" [...] as she [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> {{for the benefit of the}} sweaty/excited crowd, and neither is she a standard-bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights. She is a supremely talented action figure, and in the closeups on her helmet you can kind of see that she wears mascara, but that is all." [...] UGO.com included Samus' one-piece bathing swimsuit on the list of the best alternate costumes and IGN chose [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] by Aerosmith as Samus' theme song because she [...] "spends her time running around in a manly battle suit blasting first and taking names later." [...] Featuring her in their 2004 list of [...] "top ten forces of good" [...] (one section on their list of top 50 [...] "retro" [...] game characters), Retro Gamer opined she has remained [...] "a distinct female character, not relying on cheap thrills to capture the attention of gamers, which is more than can be said for some." ...|$|E
