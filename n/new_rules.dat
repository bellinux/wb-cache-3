40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> for the current account have been called into {{question}} recently both theoretically and empirically. This note sup-ports {{the validity of the}} <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> (and the extended <b>new</b> <b>rule)</b> to analyze the behavior of current accounts. First, even if the <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> does not strictly hold in a two-country world, it is easily extended to a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model just adding an extra term along what the new view dictates. Moreover, the extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> exhibits a two-way asset trade, which is consistent with the empirical evidence. Second, the cross-sectional empirical evidence is related to the <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> or the extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> since the steady state may not even exist and, even if it does, it implies that growth rates in both countries are equal de-spite it may not be, and in fact, it is not the case. In addition, some argument is needed to support that the empirical evidence is being gener-ated by the steady state, given the pace of 8 ̆ 5 nancial integration. Finally, the cross-section (between) regression of the <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> or the extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> remains valid to analyze the behavior of current accounts since the accounting-based approximateregression proposed is not, in fact, a good approximation to the true regression.

40|$|ABSTRACT—People often perseverate, or repeat {{habitual}} behaviors {{when they}} are no longer appropriate. For ex-ample, after sorting cards by one rule, children will reli-ably perseverate with this rule even {{when they are}} clearly and repeatedly instructed to switch to a <b>new</b> <b>rule.</b> Such perseveration may result from limitations in working memory abilities for holding instructions actively in mind. If so, children may switch more readily to a <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> fol-lowing experiences that are less demanding on working memory, such as guided practice with the <b>new</b> <b>rule.</b> In a study testing this prediction, 3 -year-old children received direct instructions to switch to a <b>new</b> <b>rule,</b> guided practice with the <b>new</b> <b>rule,</b> or both. Providing children with guided practice wasmuchmore effective than telling themwhat to do. These findings support theories of perseveration base...|$|R

5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} <b>new</b> <b>rules</b> {{to strengthen}} {{the authority of the}} tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several <b>new</b> <b>rules.</b> Some {{of them were}} already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{transitory}} income shocks (fluctuations in output, for example) on the current account in a two-country world. According to the standard intertemporal approach (or “the traditional rule”) to the current account, the variation in the current account {{is equal to the}} amount of saving generated by a transitory income shock in all countries. In contrast, Kraay and Ventura (2000, p. 1137) brilliantly argue that “the current account response is equal to the saving generated by the shock multiplied by the country’s share of foreign assets in total assets”, which they have termed “the new rule”. Here we propose an extension of the <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> to a two-country world. Then we study the empirical relevance of the extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> in contrast to either the traditional <b>rule</b> or the <b>new</b> <b>rule.</b> We find that the extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> adds important insights, even though the empirical validation is not completely satisfactory. intertemporal approach, current account, traditional <b>rule,</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|R
