40|$|Network {{planning}} and management are challenging issues in a two-tier <b>network.</b> <b>Tailoring</b> to cognitive radio networks (CRNs), network operations and transmissions become more challenging due to the dynamic spectrum availability. This paper proposes an adaptive network management system that provides switching between different CRN management structures {{in response to the}} spectrum availability and changes in the service time required for the radio access. The considered network management system includes conventional macrocell-only structure, and centralized/distributed structures overlaid with femtocells. Furthermore, analytical expressions of per-tier successful connection probability and throughput are provided to characterize the network performance for different network managements. Spectrum access in dynamic radio environments is formulated according to the quality of service (QoS) constraint that is related to the connection probability and outage probability. Results show that the proposed intelligent network management system improves the maximum capacity and reduces the number of blocked connections by adapting between various network managements in response to free spectrum transmission slots. A road map for the deployment and management of cognitive macro/femto networks is also presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a novel design of an artificial neural <b>network</b> <b>tailored</b> for wafer-scale integration. The presented VLSI implementation includes continuous-time analog neurons {{with up to}} 16 k inputs. A novel interconnection and routing scheme allows the mapping of a multitude of network models derived from biology on the VLSI neural network while maintaining a high resource usage. A single 20 cm wafer contains about 60 million synapses. The implemented neurons are highly accelerated compared to biological real time. The power consumption of the dense interconnection network providing the necessary communication bandwidth is a critical aspect of the system integration. A novel asynchronous lowvoltage signaling scheme is presented that makes the wafer-scale approach feasible by limiting the total power consumption while simultaneously providing a flexible, programmable network topology.

Network simulations of a dense sensor network with a flat architecture and using off the shelf protocols such as Wi-fi and Zigbee reveals the serious performance degradtion due to power consumption and packet losses caused by simultaneous collisions. By performing computational simulations of several fire scenarios, we show that spatio-temporal collisions exist in the sensed data. These can be leveraged in communication protocols for more efficient transmissions. While we do not propose algorithms for achieving this, our study highlights the need to consider statistical properties of the fire data in the communication protocols...|$|R

The VLSI architecture implements a highly constrained neural <b>network</b> <b>tailored</b> for this specific application: the multi-layer perceptron with strictly local connections.

The VLSI architecture receives as input the image (taken on-line on the plant) of a mechanical part and it will find out if at least one structural surface defect is present. The VLSI architecture was optimized, {{through a set of}} transformations on the high-level VHDL specifications of the neural network algorithm, to reach real-time operating conditions.

40|$|Industrial {{clusters}} {{are believed}} to {{play a significant role}} in the promotion and development of small enterprises. One channel through which industrial clusters enhance enterprise performance is by reducing transaction costs in marketing through traders. Using survey data on clustered micro and small garment producers in Nairobi, this article demonstrates, through a series of regression analyses that take into account endogeneity problem, that tailors, who are family-based shop operators in three industrial clusters in Nairobi, are less likely to use outside workshops to produce standardized garment products and have a lower employment growth rate than mini-manufacturers, who operate factory-like workshops outside the cluster. It is also shown that the well educated and highly socially <b>networked</b> <b>tailors</b> who are capable of producing a certain product quality standard are likely to link up with traders to become mini-manufacturers over time. This suggests that transactions with traders enable mini-manufacturers to outperform tailors, thereby contributing to the transformation of the mode of industrial production in developing economies.

40|$|Conservation {{practice}} reportedly {{suffers from}} low use of technical information. Understanding {{of factors that}} affect the influence of technical information on management decision-making is limited. We sought to identify leverage points for improved technical information dissemination in the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service, Australia, given the significant recent investments in monitoring and evaluation that had been made. We did so by exploring the inter-relationships between factors affecting the influence of different information types on management decisions. Results indicate that managers have a high inclination toward adaptive behavior, given they operate in an information poor environment. The most influential types of information were those that enabled interaction between information provider and recipient (e. g., staff experience and expertise). An analysis of the concordance in individuals’ responses for different information types showed that neither accessibility nor organizational expectation of use was aligned with influence on decision-making. Alignment of responses also varied by work area. Raising expectations of information use or increasing access to particular types of information is therefore unlikely to result {{in an increase in}} influence on management decision-making. Rather than focussing on matching accessibility and expected use of particular information types, our results indicate that technical information uptake is best supported through existing peer <b>networks</b> <b>tailored</b> to specific work areas...|$|R
