However, few studies have thus far been conducted on <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> in South Korea that consider noise sensitivity and noise level simultaneously. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the correlations between noise sensitivity or noise level and <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> on a large scale in South Korea. This study estimated the level of noise exposure based on a noise map created in 2014; identified and surveyed 1836 subjects using a questionnaire; and assessed the impact of transportation noise and noise sensitivity on <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> The result showed that noise exposure level and noise sensitivity simultaneously affect <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> and noise sensitivity has a relatively larger impact on <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> In conclusion, when study subjects were exposed to a similar level of noise, the level of <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> differed depending on the noise sensitivity of the individual...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Installation of wind {{turbines}} in residential areas {{due to their}} unique sound characteristics may cause <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> <b>Noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> can {{increase the risk of}} health problems and sleep disturbance. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the effect of wind turbine <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> on sleep disturbance among the Manjil wind farm workers. Material and Method: All the Manjil wind farm workers have been divided into three groups according to their noise exposure levels, including maintenance, security, and administrative workers. The equivalent A weighted noise levels were measured for each of the study working groups, using ISO 9612 standard method. Information related to the <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and sleep disturbance were determined by ISO 15666 standard and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, respectively. Data were analyzed using R software. Result: Findings of ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis statistical tests showed that <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and sleep disturbance were statistically different among workers with various occupational, age, and work experience groups. Also, <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and sleep disturbance had a significant association in a way that regardless of the effects of other variables, it can be stated that for every one unit increase in <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> 0. 26 units will be added to the amount of sleep disturbance. Conclusion: In this study, workers with more wind turbine <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> had more sleep disturbance. Therefore, in addition to the direct effects of noise on sleep disturbance, it can indirectly exacerbate sleep disturbances...|$|E

Fair sound management reduces annoyance, however {{only when}} the sound pressure level is high, concludes Eveline Maris based on two laboratory experiments. Being exposed to man-made sound is more than mere exposure: it is a social experience, too: You expose Me. This social hypothesis of <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> has been confirmed in two laboratory experiments. Participants were exposed to aircraft noise (sound pressure level (SPL) : 50 or 70 dB A) and treated either in a neutral, fair, or unfair manner. The results show that besides SPL, also {{the fairness of the}} procedure determines the level of <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> The first experiment shows an interaction effect of procedural fairness and SPL: annoyance ratings are significantly lower in the fair than in the neutral condition, but the effect is found only when SPL is 70 dB. The second experiment shows a main effect of procedural unfairness on noise annoyance: annoyance ratings are significantly higher in the unfair than in the neutral conditions, regardless of SPL.

Many areas exposed to road traffic noise are also exposed to rail and air traffic <b>noise.</b> The resulting <b>annoyance</b> may depend on individual/neighborhood socio-demographic factors. Nevertheless, few studies have taken into account the confounding or modifying factors in the relationship between transportation <b>noise</b> and <b>annoyance</b> due to road traffic. In this study, we address these issues by combining Geographic Information Systems and epidemiologic methods. Street network buffers with a radius of 500 m were defined around the place of residence of the 7290 participants of the RECORD Cohort in Ile-de-France. Estimated outdoor traffic noise levels (road, rail, and air separately) were assessed at each place of residence and in each of these buffers. Higher levels of exposure to noise were documented in low educated neighborhoods. Multilevel logistic regression models documented positive associations between road traffic <b>noise</b> and <b>annoyance</b> due to road traffic, after adjusting for individual / neighborhood socioeconomic conditions. There was no evidence that the association was of different magnitude when noise was measured at the place of residence or in the residential neighborhood. However, the strength of the association between neighborhood <b>noise</b> exposure and <b>annoyance</b> increased when considering a higher percentile in the distribution of noise in each neighborhood. Road traffic noise estimated at the place of residence and road traffic noise in the residential neighborhood (75 th percentile) were independently associated with annoyance, when adjusted for each other. Interactions of effects indicated that the relationship between road traffic noise exposure in the residential neighborhood and annoyance was stronger in affluent and high educated neighborhoods. Overall, our findings suggest that it is useful to take into account (i) the exposure to transportation noise in the residential neighborhood rather than only at the residence, (ii) different percentiles of noise exposure in the residential neighborhood, and (iii) the socioeconomic characteristics of the residential neighborhood to explain variations in annoyance due to road traffic in the neighborhood...|$|R

Second, we investigated the cross-sectional association of <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> from eight sources (e. g. road traffic, aircraft, neighbours) and somatic symptoms, and it's confounding by hostility and vulnerability to stress. Methods: Data were obtained from LifeLines, a general population cohort from the Netherlands. Road traffic noise was estimated using the Common Noise Assessment Methods in Europe (CNOSSOS-EU) noise model. <b>Noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> hostility, vulnerability to stress, and somatic symptoms were assessed with validated questionnaires. Results: Poisson regression models adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic variables indicated no association of noise exposure and somatic symptoms (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1. 001; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 000 - 1. 001; n= 56, 937). Interactions of noise exposure and hostility and vulnerability to stress were not statistically significant. Small positive associations were found for <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> from each of the eight sources and somatic symptoms, when adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic variables (e. g. for road traffic <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> IRR 1. 014, 95 % CI 1. 011 - 1. 018; n = 6177).

40|$|Because the {{acoustic}} environments of construction sites include multiple noise sources from various construction machines, {{it is necessary}} to consider the influence of combined <b>noise</b> on <b>annoyance.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of {{the acoustic}} characteristics of combined construction <b>noise</b> on <b>annoyance.</b> Six construction machines, including machines for foundation work (pile drivers, earth augers, and payloaders) and demolition work (breakers, bulldozers, and excavators) were selected as noise sources in construction sites, and auditory experiments were designed to quantify the annoyance caused by the machines individual and combined noise. The results show that both individual and combined noise correlate well with the equivalent sound level (L-Aeq), but that the annoyance caused by combined noise is significantly higher than the annoyance caused by individual noise when L-Aeq increases over 65 dBA. Among the psychoacoustic measures, loudness is the most important in determining the annoyance caused by individual noise, whereas both loudness and roughness significantly impact the annoyance caused by combined construction noise. Ranges of an optimum stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio between two construction machine noises are suggested to minimize the annoyance caused by combined noise. Optimum stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio ranges usually include 0 dBA when reference construction noise levels (e. g., pile driver or breaker) are lower than 60 dBA, whereas the stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio should be greater than 5 dBA as construction noise levels exceed 65 dBA.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has stressed {{the relevance of}} nonacoustical factors {{in the perception of}} aircraft noise. However, it is largely empirically driven and lacks a sound theoretical basis. In this paper, a theoretical model which explains <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> based on the psychological stress theory is empirically tested. The model is estimated by applying structural equation modeling based on data from residents living in the vicinity of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in The Netherlands. The model provides a good model fit and indicates that concern about the negative health effects of noise and pollution, perceived disturbance, and perceived control and coping capacity are the most important variables that explain <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> Furthermore, the model provides evidence for the existence of two reciprocal relationships between (1) perceived disturbance and <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and (2) perceived control and coping capacity and <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> Lastly, the model yielded two unexpected results. Firstly, the variables noise sensitivity and fear related to the noise source were unable to explain additional variance in the endogenous variables of the model and were therefore excluded from the model. And secondly, the size of the total effect of noise exposure on <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> was relatively small. The paper concludes with some recommended directions for further research.

Results: Compared to the no <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> group, ORs (95 % CI) of the severe annoyance groups were 1. 58 (1. 12 – 2. 23) and 1. 76 (1. 29 – 2. 40) in men and 1. 49 (1. 05 – 2. 11) and 1. 41 (1. 01 – 1. 97) in women for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, respectively. The ORs (95 % CI) for severe <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> in those with less than five hours of sleep were 2. 95 (1. 46 – 5. 96) and 2. 05 (1. 01 – 4. 16) in men and women, respectively, compared with those with no <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and a sleep time of more than five hours. Conclusion: Our study shows that occupational <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> is significantly related to mental health, includin...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of noise}} as an {{environmental}} pollutant {{and its impact on}} health are being increasingly recognized. Beyond its effects on the auditory system, <b>noise</b> causes <b>annoyance</b> and disturbs sleep, and it impairs cognitive performance. Furthermore, evidence from epidemiologic studies demonstrates that environmental noise is associated with an increased incidence of arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Both observational and experimental studies indicate that in particular night-time noise can cause disruptions of sleep structure, vegetative arousals (e. g. increases of blood pressure and heart rate) and increases in stress hormone levels and oxidative stress, which in turn may result in endothelial dysfunction and arterial hypertension. This review focuses on the cardiovascular consequences of environmental noise exposure and stresses the importance of noise mitigation strategies for public health...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{characteristics}} of blade slap <b>noise</b> on <b>annoyance</b> response were studied. These characteristics or parameters were the {{sound pressure level}} of the continuous noise used to simulate helicopter broadband noise, the ratio of impulse peak to broadband noise or crest factor, the number of pressure excursions comprising an impulse event, {{the rise and fall}} time of the individual impulses, and the repetition frequency of the impulses. Analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between subjective response and various physical measures for the range of parameters studied. A small but significant improvement in the predictive ability of PNL was provided by an A-weighted crest factor correlation. No significant improvement in predictive ability was provided by a rate correction...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} cultural factors on the evaluation of acoustic quality of residential areas, {{within the context of}} general environmental conditions. A comparative study was carried out between the UK and Taiwan, through questionnaire surveys at three stages, namely in selected residential areas, with respondents in their place of work/study, and using a web-based survey, respectively. This study reveals the importance of considering cultural factors, as well as their living experiences. This is reflected by the {{significant differences between the two}} cultures in a number of aspects, including choosing and evaluating living environment, <b>noise</b> noticeability, <b>annoyance</b> and sleep disturbance, activities, and sound preference. It is interesting to note the factor 'quiet' is an important consideration compared to other factors, in both the UK and Taiwan. © 2013...|$|R
