40|$|The {{optimized}} Schwarz {{methods were}} recently introduced {{to enhance the}} convergence of the classical Schwarz iteration, by replacing the Dirichlet transmission conditions with different conditions obtained through an optimization of the convergence rate. This is formulated as a min-max problem. These new methods are well-studied for elliptic second order symmetric equations. The purpose of this work is to compute optimized Robin transmission conditions for the advection-diffusion equation in two dimensions, by finding {{the solution of the}} min-max problem. The asymptotic expansion, for small mesh size h, of the resulting convergence rate is found: it shows a weak dependence on h, if the overlap is 0 (h) or <b>no</b> <b>overlap</b> <b>is</b> <b>used.</b> Numerical experiments illustrate the improved convergence of these optimized methods compared to other Schwarz methods, and also justify the continuous Fourier analysis performed on a simple model problem only. The theoretical asymptotic performance is also verified numerically...|$|E
40|$|In {{southern}} West Siberia, {{as many as}} four Leptidea Billberg, 1820 {{species are}} present sympatrically: L. amurensis (Ménétriés, 1859), L. morsei (Ménétriés, 1859), L. sinapis (Linnaeus, 1758) and L. juvernica Williams, 1946. The two latter were recently recognised as nearly sibling species on morphological and molecular characters. Specimens intermediate as to their subtle diagnostic characters occurring in West Siberia and elsewhere were interpreted as resulted from limited introgression. This supposition was tested via populational morphological and molecular analysis of spring brood specimens of all the four species taken from a limited (4. 5 × 0. 2 km) area in the suburbs of Novosibirsk. The samples were analysed with respect to the genitalic morphology, external characters, three nuclear (CAD, H 1 gene and ITS 2) and one mitochondrial (COI) molecular markers, infection of the intracellular maternally inherited bacterial symbiont Wolbachia Hertig, 1836 and its wsp gene coding for a hypervariable surface protein. Interspecific variation of the nuclear CAD and ITS 2 sequences and the mitochondrial COI gene in L. sinapis and L. juvernica turned out concordant. The absence of molecular evidence of introgression suggests genetic integrity of these two species and allows their reliable identification by molecular characters. The genitalic (lengths of the saccus and valva) and external characters (wing pattern) of males overlap in L. sinapis and L. juvernica, as identified by molecular markers and thus are not so helpful in actual species identification. Only the ductus bursae length showed <b>no</b> <b>overlap</b> and can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for identification of females. The histone H 1 gene appeared five times less variable over the four studied species than COI, and found to be identical in species L. sinapis and L. juvernica. Wolbachia infection was found in all studied species. We identified three wsp variants of Wolbachia: 1) wsp- 10 allele in L. amurensis, L. sinapis, L. juvernica; 2) a very similar wsp- 687 allele in L. sinapis; and 3) wsp- 688, highly divergent to the previous ones, in L. morsei...|$|R

Consequently, it results in more areas (compared to the number of domains), some of which are just artifacts of the spatial parcellation process.

Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{in complex}} phenotypes, including psychiatric disorders, have yielded many replicated findings, yet individual markers {{account for only}} a small fraction of the inherited differences in risk.

GWAS results in bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SZ), and Parkinson's disease (PD) <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to assign weights to individual alleles, based on odds ratios. These weights <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to calculate allele scores for individual cases and controls in independent samples, summing across many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). How well allele scores discriminated between cases and controls and between cases with different disorders was tested by logistic regression. Results. Large sets of SNPs were needed to achieve even modest discrimination between cases and controls. The most informative SNPs <b>were</b> <b>overlapping</b> in BD, SZ, and MDD, with correlated effect sizes. Little or <b>no</b> <b>overlap</b> <b>was</b> seen between allele scores for psychiatric disorders and those for PD. Conclusions.

We used mRNA sequencing to analyze genome-wide gene expression patterns in brain frontal cortex in three pairs of domesticated and wild species (dogs and wolves, pigs and wild boars, and domesticated and wild rabbits). We compared the expression differences with those between domesticated guinea pigs and a distant wild relative (Cavia aperea) {{as well as between}} two lines of rats selected for tameness or aggression towards humans.

We perform an expansion of I on the overlap and the activity-overlap, around their values for neurons almost independent on the patterns. From this expansion we obtain an expression for a Hamiltonian which optimizes the retrieval properties of this system. This Hamiltonian has the form of a disordered Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. The dynamics corresponding to this Hamiltonian is found. As a special characteristic of such network, we see that information can survive even if <b>no</b> <b>overlap</b> <b>is</b> present.
