500|$|Though issue 8 {{was printed}} and issue 9 drawn, Marvel put {{a hold on}} {{releasing}} the issues due to the storyline's controversial nature. [...] Both writers state that ideas to [...] "soft-pedal" [...] the issue were fetched to them, including eliminating Karma's lesbian kiss, having it off-panel, or Northstar never actually stating his sexual orientation. The writers compromised, depicting the same-sex kiss on-panel and silhouetted. [...] Marvel eventually decided to scrap the issues, intending to release issue 10 as issue 8. The writers objected, noting that issue 10 featured the school still dealing with Anole's suicide and would leave Josh's change in character unexplained. Weir and DeFilippis convinced editors {{to allow them to}} write a new story last minute from the artwork of the old storyline and changed the dialogue while removing all references to the suicide and changing the reasons for Josh's reformation. [...] Weir and DeFilippis later stated that they were happier with losing this plot, as they did not like the direction it would have taken Julian as a character, noting that, [...] "he Julian who developed since then is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who'd have a problem with Victor being gay. In fact, he'd wipe the walls with anyone who did." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{felt that}} creating another {{game in the}} series with the same style of gameplay had limited potential. In an attempt to imbue the game with {{the feel of a}} horror film where the protagonist is a regular person and the antagonist is powerful, they avoided the common survival horror gameplay feature of a player character who is skilled in the use of weapons. Instead they generated an unarmed player character; and examined the survival horror gameplay staple of difficult combat and sluggish opponents, inspired by zombie films and modelled after the video games Alone in the Dark (1992) and Resident Evil (1996). They also analyzed around 50 chase sequences from various films, including horror films, and the structure of slasher films, in which a powerful and intelligent antagonist pursues the protagonists. The developers drew inspiration from common childhood nightmares about running away from an unknown threat, and decided to incorporate an intelligent enemy capable of trailing and outrunning the protagonist. The chase sequences were designed to evoke a brief sense of tension and fright for the player, although the developers did not want to prolong the tension with the constant presence of monsters, and were concerned that this would become overwhelming and spoil the player's immersion in the game and interest in the story. The constant presence of monsters was also thought to be irrelevant to Shattered Memories; director Mark Simmons said, [...] "this Harry Mason is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who is constantly under attack from monsters. It's not a story of surviving a zombie apocalypse." [...] Additionally, to make information-gathering in the game realistic and corresponding to modern life standards, the developers substituted text in scattered documents, a common element in survival horror games, for the player's interaction with the in-game environment and use of the cell phone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next few}} weeks saw Ambrose and Wyatt taunting and attacking each other in both {{backstage}} and in-ring segments, with Wyatt claiming that he could [...] "fix" [...] Ambrose, leading to a match at Survivor Series on November 23. Ambrose lost the match by disqualification after utilizing steel chairs, including a table. This led to a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match between the two at [...] on December 14, during which a television monitor blew up in Ambrose's face, allowing Wyatt to win the match. The feud concluded when Wyatt beat Ambrose in the first ambulance match held on the January 5, 2015 episode of Raw.

[...] "For me it wasn't a foul, if anything it was a foul by (Henry) because he came from behind and collided with me," [...] Puyol said, [...] "but referees can get things wrong."

In , manager Charlie Manuel wanted Branyan to succeed Fryman full-time, though he was primarily used as a utility player throughout the season. Manuel stated that Branyan should be an everyday player saying, [...] "He's definitely <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> you want sitting on the bench, because of the timing in his swing."
