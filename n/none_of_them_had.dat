5|$|With a large {{construction}} programme, engineers made up 29.3% of Michaelmas Task Force. An Engineer Section headquarters was organised on 24 December 1943, {{only nine}} days before landing, consisting of five officers and five enlisted men. Later a jeep and a driver were {{borrowed from the}} 114th Engineer Battalion to provide transportation. The officers did not know each other and therefore were unaware of each other's capabilities. As it turned out, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> experience with amphibious operations, and only one had experience in airbase construction, although {{this was to be}} their most important task.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E
5|$|During his search, Sudhana visited {{no fewer}} than thirty teachers, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> {{satisfied}} him completely. He was then instructed by Manjusri to meet the monk Megasri, where {{he was given the}} first doctrine. As his journey continues, Sudhana meets (in the following order) Supratisthita, the physician Megha (Spirit of Knowledge), the banker Muktaka, the monk Saradhvaja, the upasika Asa (Spirit of Supreme Enlightenment), Bhismottaranirghosa, the Brahmin Jayosmayatna, Princess Maitrayani, the monk Sudarsana, a boy called Indriyesvara, the upasika Prabhuta, the banker Ratnachuda, King Anala, the god Siva Mahadeva, Queen Maya, Bodhisattva Maitreya and then back to Manjusri. Each meeting has given Sudhana a specific doctrine, knowledge and wisdom. These meetings are shown in the third gallery.|$|E

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|Following White's retirement, the Oak Room {{continued}} to operate under Reid, albeit {{with a new}} menu where the prices were reduced by between a third to a half. The majority of the staff remained with Reid, with Jeff Galvin installed as the new head chef, until he left to run the restaurant L'Escargot in May 2000. MPW Criterion was wound up on 11 September 2001; by which time planning was already underway to close the Oak Room, which took place on 15 February 2002. By this time, there were 15 other kitchen staff, and a further 15 front of house staff. There was some added difficulty for calculating the redundancy packages for the staff since <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> written contracts, and were only calculated from the period when the restaurant was owned by the MPW Criterion company; this reduced Reid's total service from nine years to four.|$|E
5|$|From 1936 on, several admirers {{tried unsuccessfully}} to persuade Sorabji to record Opus clavicembalisticum. Given that Sorabji had not {{recorded}} any of his works, and that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been published since 1931, his friends and admirers began {{to be concerned about}} the fate of his output. The most ambitious attempt to ensure the preservation of his music and writings was initiated by Frank Holliday (1912–1997), who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades. In the early 1950s Holliday organised the presentation of a letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music. Sorabji received the letter in 1953, but made no recordings then, in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas (just over £127). Holliday's perseverance and closeness to Sorabji did, however, eventually change Sorabji's attitude, and several recordings were made in Sorabji's house between 1962 and 1968. Holliday also helped with the WNCN broadcast of Sorabji's music in 1970 (which took place without Sorabji's consent). Their friendship ended in 1979 as a result of disagreements about some of Sorabji's decisions.|$|E

5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware {{that most of them}} were beginners at writing for feature films. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E
5|$|While the King was in California on January 31, the Straits Times of Singapore {{published}} {{a story that}} Kalākaua already had a representative in Germany finalizing {{the sale of the}} Kingdom of Hawaii. In April, Secretary of State James G. Blaine was made aware of various rumors that Kalākaua wanted to sell the kingdom to a nation other than the United States, and repeated them to Garfield, who in turn shared them in a letter to one of his friends. In an attempt to protect the interests of the United States, Blaine made it clear to British diplomat Edward Thornton that priority on annexation belonged to the United States. Thornton filed a report with his government, sending a copy to Honolulu's British consul Wodehouse who shared it with Queen Dowager Emma, Princess Likelike, her husband Archibald Scott Cleghorn, Liliuokalani, and her husband John Owen Dominis. Although troubled by the rumors and by Blaine's stance on annexation, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> any knowledge of the situation and so forwarded the report to Kalākaua.|$|E

25|$|After {{arriving}} at Halifax and completing her work up, Collingwood joined Halifax Force in January 1941. She {{worked with them}} until 23 May when she transferred to Newfoundland Escort Force (NEF). Beginning in June she spent {{the next six months}} escorting convoys from St. John's to Iceland. The first NEF convoy to face battle, HX 113, had three corvettes as part of the escort. However <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> adequate communications equipment as they were only able to communicate through signals and not radio. This led to six losses and the escorts were only able to stop the attacks due to a reinforcement of Royal Navy escorts out of Iceland.|$|E

25|$|Since {{only one}} window in McEwen's car was open, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been shattered, Seedman knew the shot {{had to have}} been fired from Sheepshead Bay or the nearby area, and that due to the {{distance}} and the car's speed, it was probably not intentional. He ordered detectives and uniformed officers to search the dunes and marshes for a possible shell casing. After 2,400 people were interviewed and several other leads came to nothing, he pointed at a spot on the map and told his detectives to look for people who owned boats. That led to the shooter—a local gas station owner who had been on his boat that morning taking target practice at a floating beer can. One of his bullets had ricocheted off the water's surface and killed McEwen. A grand jury ruled it an accident, and no homicide charges were brought, although the shooter was fined $100 for violating firearms laws with the rifle.|$|E
25|$|Franklin's party reached Fort Enterprise on 12 October 1821, {{two days}} after Back. They found it deserted and unstocked. The promised {{supplies}} of dried meat had not appeared, {{and there was nothing}} to eat except bones from the previous winter, a few rotting skins which had been used as bedding, and a little tripe de roche. A note from Back explained that he had found the fort in this state, and that he was heading towards Fort Providence to look for Akaitcho and his first nation members. The party despaired. Two voyageurs, Augustus and Benoit, set off upriver in the hope of meeting some first nation people. The rest of the group remained, too weak to go any further. Two of the voyageurs lay down crying and waited to die, and even the normally optimistic Franklin wrote of how quickly his strength was evaporating. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> eaten meat for four weeks.|$|E
25|$|When {{the use of}} paratroops was {{contemplated}} for Operation Torch, Williams was given the task of organizing and commanding the 51st Troop Carrier Wing. The headquarters of the 51st Troop Carrier Wing arrived in Scotland on 1 September 1942 and {{was assigned to the}} Eighth Air Force. Williams was given all three of the troop carrier groups in the theater: the 60th Troop Carrier Group, the 62nd Troop Carrier Group and the 64th Troop Carrier Group. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> their full complement of 52 C-47 aircraft and many of the personnel of their air and ground crews were fresh out of training schools. Nonetheless, they constituted the entire Allied troop carrier force in the North African Theater of Operations operating in support of US and British airborne operations in North Africa. Williams reached North Africa by air on 15 November 1942. On 28 November Williams personally led forty-forty aircraft of the 62nd and 64th Troop Carrier Groups carrying 530 paratroops of the British 2nd Parachute Battalion. The battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Dutton Frost rode with Williams in the lead aircraft. Williams picked his landmarks carefully and successfully navigated his way to Depienne Airfield, dropping the paratroops nearby. All his aircraft returned safely. Frost and his paratroops were not so lucky; half of them were killed or captured fighting their way back to Allied line.|$|E

25|$|Though all the {{communities}} had had partial success with gaining interest from African-Americans none {{had had to}} deal strongly with opposition in such matters and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> {{made a point of}} focusing on it as a priority. A national policy among Bahá'ís had started to form from work of Gregory meeting with Bahá'ís at Fisk University in 1934, a spiritual assembly in Nashville was elected in 1935, and a regional conference was proposed in 1936 to include a visit from the National Assembly. The development encountered the question of a high-profile series of integrated meetings. Indeed, one of the hotel's hosting one of the six resulting meetings objected and the Bahá'ís appeared to relent. W. E. B. DuBois noticed and initially was misinformed {{of the nature of the}} resolution to which then secretary of the national assembly Horace Holley responded that the facts were not as DuBois understood them and that it was the hotel that had relented at the last minute - however a policy had been stated that, short of out of control reactions, integrated meetings should be held but in the case of over-reactions segregated meetings could be held with a longer term goal of fully integrated ones theoretically. But in this case the situation was avoided by the change in judgement of the hotel. All of the shifting options became mute when in 1938 a final policy was voiced - published under the title Advent of Divine Justice by Shoghi Effendi with a frank and prolonged discussion of the problem of race prejudice underscoring the short-term requirement and long term goal of complete integration and freedom from racial prejudice. All meetings were to be integrated and individuals to seek to adjust their habits in the matter. In addition, a matter of policy began that in tie votes in elections minorities were to be automatically given approval of the position. One result was the formation of a Race Unity Committee in 1940 with Louis Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a White descendent of abolitionists. A situation in the Atlanta Bahá'í community was resolved with integration even to the point of letting White people leave the religion if they couldn't accept the standard. Correspondence among South Carolinian communities buzzed with the development.|$|E
