5|$|A complex {{formation}} {{involving a}} tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One-E on May 24. It slowly strengthened {{into the first}} tropical storm of the season two days later. Alma then turned north, moving <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a subtropical ridge over Mexico. Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter {{under the influence of}} wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly fell apart, and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E
30|$|Annealing {{furnaces}} {{are used}} to heat steel in order to change its chemical structure. In this paper we model an electric radiant furnace. One of the major defects in steel strips processed in such furnaces is a wave-like pattern <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> strip, apparently due to extra heating <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> <b>The</b> aim of the paper is to model this effect and provide a way to calculate <b>the</b> elevated temperatures <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> We analyse two processes that are suspected to contribute to uneven heating. The modelling involves an asymptotic analysis {{of the effect of}} heat flux at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> and a detailed analysis of the integral equations associated with radiant heat transfer in the furnace.|$|R

5|$|Little {{was known}} about their {{behaviour}} until the field studies of Birutė Galdikas, who became a leading authority on the apes. When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive bark and thatch hut, at a site she dubbed Camp Leakey, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the Java Sea. Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} {{accepted}} portrayal of Mussie's age, its gender, or even {{whether it is a}} single, long-lived creature or a species. Some residents claim that a single, very old Mussie—or a member of its species—first arrived in the area, then covered by the ocean, about 10,000 years ago. In this tale, glaciers and, later, solid landmasses built up around it, forming the lake, and Mussie was trapped. Mussie's diet, according to self-proclaimed observer Donnie Humphries, consists at least partially of cattails found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the lake.|$|E

5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume it to have been what he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E
5|$|While most insects {{have three}} simple eyes, or ocelli, only two ocelli {{are present in}} all species of Lepidoptera, except a few moths, {{one on each side}} of the head <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the {{compound}} eye. On some species, sense organs called chaetosemata are found near the ocelli. The ocelli are not homologous to the simple eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as stemmata. The ocelli of Lepidoptera are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. The utility of ocelli is not understood at present.|$|E
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E

The road heads slightly west south of Blythwood Road, then crosses Blythwood Ravine, which contains the small Burke Brook. After climbing into Lawrence Park, the road meets Lawrence Avenue East. This intersection, featuring a multi-stage traffic light, directs driver to the east before continuing north. From here to the northern terminus, it is classified as a collector road and is a wide residential street with several stop signs.

5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Test. After 16 days of cricket in 20 {{calendar}} days, Barnes was rested as Australia completed a 10-wicket win. Barnes returned for the following game against Gloucestershire. The tourists elected to bat first and Barnesplaying many square cutsmade 44 in an opening partnership of 102 with Morris, who went on to top-score with 290. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest score for the tour, laying the groundwork for a victory by an innings and 363 runs. When Australia was fielding, Barnes was not at his characteristic close-range position, but spent much of the time at third man or fine leg <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the playing arena. At times, Barnes wandered about aimlessly between various positions, but Hassett, captaining in place of the resting Bradman, did not attempt to command him.|$|E
5|$|By 1537 {{the area}} {{immediately}} {{north of the}} new colony of Guatemala was being {{referred to as the}} Tierra de Guerra ("Land of War"). Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as Verapaz ("True Peace"). The Land of War described an area that was undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities. The Land of War, from the 16th century through {{to the start of the}} 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to Nito on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from Rabinal and Salamá, and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent to developing, deep {{convection}} began {{developing and}} increasing around the center. On September 11, an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit temperature cross-section analysis indicated the system developed a warm thermal core; as a result, it was re-classified as Tropical Depression Ten. Convection continued increasing, and it intensified to tropical storm status by 1200UTC. Operationally, {{it was considered}} a tropical depression, and significant strengthening was not expected. However, reports from Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of tropical storm force winds, {{and as a result}} the National Hurricane Center named the cyclone Florence. The storm continued quickly intensifying, and with the Hurricane Hunters reporting flight-level winds of over 85mph (140km/h), it was estimated Florence attained hurricane status late on September 11, or just six hours after the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on the storm. The strongest winds were confined to a very small area <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the convection. Initially, the hurricane was tracking west-southwestward, steered by a mid-level ridge to its northwest.|$|E
