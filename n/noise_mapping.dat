40|$|Monitoring ocean {{acoustic}} noise {{has been the}} subject of considerable recent study, motivated by the desire to assess the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine life. A combination of measuring ocean sound using an acoustic sensor network and modelling sources of sound and sound propagation has been proposed as an approach to estimating the acoustic <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> within a region of interest. However, strategies for developing a monitoring network are not well established. In this paper, considerations for designing a network are investigated using a simulated scenario based on the measurement of sound from ships in a shipping lane. Using models for the sources of the sound and for sound propagation, a <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> is calculated and measurements of the <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> by a sensor network within the region of interest are simulated. A compressive sensing algorithm, which exploits the sparsity of the representation of the <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> in terms of the sources, is used to estimate the locations and levels of the sources and thence the entire <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> within the region of interest. It is shown that although the spatial resolution to which the sound sources can be identified is generally limited, estimates of aggregated measures of the <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> can be obtained that are more reliable compared with those provided by other approaches...|$|R

50|$|The main noise {{indicators}} for <b>noise</b> <b>mapping</b> are long-term averaged sound levels, determined {{over all the}} correspondent periods of a year. All of these indicators may be {{defined in terms of}} A-weighted decibels (dBA, dB(A)).The result can be determined by computation or measurement methods. Computation methods are widely preferred, because of the large amount of yearly averaged locations required.Using either approach, a grid of receivers must be defined in order to measure or calculate noise levels. When results are obtained, using GIS tools, spatial interpolation must be applied in order to give a continuous graphical representation of sound levels. According to the END five dBA ranges are used for this contour (isoline) representation.The maps may be useful for planning stages, or for prior evaluation of action plans, determination of most polluted areas.With a strategic noise map, furthermore, an evaluation is possible to show the amount of people exposed within dBA ranges.

University College London (UCL) and London 21 {{sustainability}} network's Mapping for Change initiative has encouraged voluntary groups, local authorities and development agencies to build map-based projects to support political, social and environmental aims. They even provide a <b>noise</b> <b>mapping</b> toolkit on the Mapping for Change website itself, designed to help local communities gather evidence of intrusive and unwanted environmental nuisances and hazards. The Royal Docks community in London has used such a toolkit to help present their concerns to the Greater London Authority Environment Committee over plans to expand London City Airport. Armed with sound meters, survey sheets and access to an online mapping platform, residents were able to monitor noise levels; from overhead planes and passing motor vehicles, to birdsong and ambient river sounds. Their data was then visualized in various formats to help advance their argument. Royal Docks’ residents are continually plagued by planes taking-off and landing at London City Airport, and plans to expand the number of flights a year by 50% (up to 120,000) were opposed by local communities {{on the basis that}} it would decrease their quality of life.|$|E

This framework considers the randomness and complexity of machinery operation and noise emission levels. Also, it assesses the impact of noise on the workers and the surrounding environment. For data validation, three case studies were conducted to check the accuracy of the prediction data and to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach. The results showed high accuracy of prediction results together with a majority of absolute differences of less than 2 dBA; also, the predicted noise doses were mostly in the range of measurement. Therefore, the random walk approach was effective in dealing with environmental noises.

40|$|More {{and more}} robotic {{applications}} are equipping robots with microphones {{to improve the}} sensory information available to them. However, in most applications the auditory task is very low-level, only processing data and providing auditory event information to higher-level navigation routines. If the robot, and therefore the microphone, ends up in a bad acoustic location, then the results from that sensor will remain noisy and potentially useless for accomplishing the required task. To solve this problem, {{there are at least}} two possible solutions. The first is to provide bigger and more complex filters, which is the traditional signal processing approach. An alternative solution is to move the robot in concert with providing better audition. In this work, the second approach is followed by introducing <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> as a tool for acoustically sensitive navigation. A <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> is a guide to noise in the environment, pinpointing locations which would most likely interfere with auditory sensing. A traditional <b>noise</b> <b>map,</b> in an acoustic sense, is a graphical display of the average sound pressure level at any given location. An area with high sound pressure level corresponds to high ambient noise that could interfere with an auditory application. Such maps can be either created by hand, or by allowing the robot to first explore the environment. Converted into a potential field, a <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> then becomes a useful tool for reducing the interference from ambient noise.
