5|$|The Smashing Pumpkins started demoing in February 1997 and {{recorded}} 30 songs for the album which, at one point, looked {{set to be}} a double album. The band subsequently cut the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> on the album to 14.|$|E
5|$|Hermética disbanded {{at the end}} of 1994, a {{few days}} before their second concert in Obras. Ricardo Iorio, who {{performed}} lead vocals on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks,</b> formed a new band Almafuerte and served as its vocalist. The remaining ex-members of Hermética hired a new bassist and created the band Malón. Both bands began a mutual rivalry after their respective establishment.|$|E
5|$|Something/Anything? is {{a double}} album by Todd Rundgren, {{released}} in February 1972. It was Rundgren's third solo release, and was recorded in late 1971 in Los Angeles, New York City and Bearsville Studios, Woodstock. Three quarters of the album was recorded {{in the studio with}} Rundgren playing all instruments and singing all vocals, as well as being the producer. The final quarter contained a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> recorded live in the studio without any overdubs, save for a short snippet of archive recordings from the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by David Wise. The soundtrack was first released in Japan on 1 April 1998, with 42 tracks, a German version of the album was released in Europe with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks.</b> For its United States release only 16 tracks were featured. The disc itself was specially shaped {{in the form of}} Diddy Kong's head, which was unplayable in certain CD players.|$|E
5|$|The track lengths for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> on {{all three}} discs are {{different}} than the Original Sound Version release. On the first disc, tracks 24-27 are new arranged version tracks that were included as the music from those tracks corresponded to the video animated sequences that were added originally on the PlayStation version. The same applied to tracks 25-27 on the second disc and tracks 18-24 on the third disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} LP {{was released}} by United Artists Jazz in 1963 in mono and stereo versions. United Artists was bought by EMI in 1979, and subsidiary Blue Note Records reissued the album on CD in 1987. This contained more recordings from the same session: four previously unreleased works written for the session, plus two alternative takes. The order presented in this edition was that in which the songs were recorded. The sound quality of the original recording was improved for the 2002 Blue Note CD release by engineer Ron McMaster, using the original tapes and 24-bit remastering, adding clarity to the drums in particular. For this release, the first seven songs were arranged in their original order, with the other four songs and four alternative takes placed afterward, increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> to 15.|$|E

5|$|On {{release of}} Guitar Hero 5, 35 {{of the songs}} from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Guitar Hero 5 for a small fee (approximately $0.10 per song), and are treated as {{downloadable}} content for the game playable in all game modes; the World Tour export was available on release, while the Smash Hits export was available a few days afterwards. Furthermore, 61 of the 65 tracks from Band Hero are importable into Guitar Hero 5. All transferred songs are also playable in Band Hero. However, Guitar Hero 5 is not backwards-compatible with World Tour. The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual {{to be able to}} redownload available songs in a pack (on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) or individual songs (on the Wii) that have been updated to include the new features. Players on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack. Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues—not technical issues—according to Bright. Tim Riley, the head of music licensing at Activision, stated that the company will continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into Guitar Hero 5, but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games. While reviewers appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, they felt that the small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> that were available at launch was at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process before the game's release.|$|E

25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Norwegian State Railways in 1883, Hamar Station became the administrative site for Hamar District. This would by 1924 reach an area consisting of the Dovre Line from Eidsvoll Station to Dombås Station, the Rauma Line, and the Røros Line north to Tynset Station. From 1880 to 1931 Hamar Station received a high amount of activity from its role as transshipment point between the narrow-gauge Røros Line and the standard gauge Eidsvoll–Sel Line. With increasing traffic the station area grew gradually, with an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks,</b> built without any long-term plan. By 1916 there were 96 switches, resulting in low speeds, inefficient and unreliable operation. Despite the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks,</b> shunting often had to be done on the main line. The track arrangements were not cleaned up until the gauge conversion on the Røros Line was completed in 1931. The following year a new interlocking system was installed.|$|E
30|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> GPS + GLONASS {{satellites}} <b>tracked</b> by {{the receivers}} {{is an important}} factor affecting the availability of G 2 services. Between 10 and 18 GNSS satellites may be typically tracked by the receivers. The impact of the solar radio burst on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracked</b> GNSS satellites is shown in Fig.  2 b. The filled coloured circles, representing the receiver locations, indicate the reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tracked</b> GNSS satellites from the nominal values. It can be observed from Fig.  2 b that at 4 receiver locations, the reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracked</b> GNSS satellites is between 9 and 12 and at 14 locations, the reduction is between 5 and 8. This indicates that the positioning accuracy at these 18 receiver locations would be significantly degraded or positioning would not even be possible.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{highways}} or {{road networks}} where capacity is disaggregated into unlinked trips over individual route segments, railway capacity is fundamentally considered a network system.

Maintenance must acknowledge the vast array of a route's performance (type of train service, origination/destination, seasonal impacts), line's capacity (length, terrain, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks,</b> types of train control), trains throughput (max speeds, acceleration/deceleration rates), and service features with shared passenger-freight tracks (sidings, terminal capacities, switching routes, and design type).|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of Mic Club: The Curriculum, it was {{announced}} that Williams decided to join the United States Army. Before commencing his work with the military, however, he recorded a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> which he intended to be released on his next album, entitled Rip the Jacker. Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind was given the task of producing the entire record, equipped solely with Canibus' pre-recorded vocals. Due to his military obligations, Canibus himself only managed to review the album after having acquired a copy.|$|E

A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> were recorded featuring Connolly on vocals. However, these efforts were deemed unsatisfactory, and Brian's were then erased from the ensuing album. Brian then left the band.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{secondary}} schools now base track levels on course difficulty, with tracks such as basic, honors, or college-prep. [...] Public schools might <b>track</b> in terms <b>of</b> high, average, or lower ability. As noted by Oakes and Martin, [...] "school policies determine three structural qualities <b>of</b> the <b>tracking</b> system: extensiveness (the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> subjects <b>tracked</b> {{and the type}} of distinct curricula offered); specificity (the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>track</b> levels offered); and flexibility (whether students move from one track to another)". [...] Although, in theory, track assignment is based on academic ability, other factors often influence placement.|$|R
