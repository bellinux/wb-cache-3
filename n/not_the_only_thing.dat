In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E

25|$|After {{winning the}} {{leadership}} race, Turner wanted a reconciliation with Chrétien {{in order to}} lead a united party into the coming general election, and asked Chrétien for what terms could a reconciliation be forged. Chrétien, angry about losing the leadership race, asked for terms that he knew that Turner could never give him, demanding that he be appointed Quebec lieutenant with control of patronage and organization in Quebec, a position that Turner had already promised to give to André Ouellet in exchange for backing him in the leadership race. Chrétien's demand to be appointed Quebec lieutenant proved to be impossible to meet as it would force Turner to break his promise to Ouellet, and so Turner compromised by creating a troika to run Liberal operations in Quebec comprising Chrétien, Ouellet and Lalonde. The troika was a sham, and during the 1984 general election, the {{three members of the}} troika spent more time feuding with one another than in combating the Conservatives. Chrétien's demand for the Quebec lieutenancy was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that divided him from Turner. As almost immediately, Chrétien and Turner clashed over the issue of an early election. Chrétien advised Turner not to ask the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament, but rather keep Parliament in session for the fall of 1984 in order to give the government a record to run on for a winter election in early 1985 (an election had to be called no later than February 1985 as the last election was in February 1980). Turner for his part believed that a boost in the polls after he became Prime Minister in late June 1984 justified asking for Parliament to be dissolved for an election in September 1984, so Chrétien's advice was disregarded. Relations between the two were strained, especially after the Liberals were severely defeated in the 1984 election. He was one of only 17 Liberal MPs elected from Quebec (the party had won 74 out of 75 seats in 1980). He was also one of only four MPs from the province elected from a riding outside Montreal.|$|E

500|$|The critic {{writing for}} The Times thought that Bond was [...] "backed up by sound writing" [...] by Fleming. Although the plot was grandiose, the critic noted that: [...] "it sounds – and is – fantastic; {{the skill of}} Mr. Fleming is to be {{measured}} {{by the fact that}} it is made not to seem so." [...] For The Times Literary Supplement, Michael Robson considered that [...] "a new Bond has emerged from these pages: an agent more relaxed, less promiscuous, less stagily muscular than of yore." [...] Bond was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that was more relaxed, according to Robson, as [...] "the story, too, is more relaxed." [...] Robson saw this as a positive development, but it did mean that although [...] "there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us, ...the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan". The Evening Standard looked at why Bond was a success and listed [...] "the things that make Bond attractive: the sex, the sadism, the vulgarity of money for its own sake, the cult of power, the lack of standards". The Sunday Times called Goldfinger [...] "Guilt-edged Bond", whilst the Manchester Evening News thought that [...] "Only Fleming could have got away with it...outrageously improbable, wickedly funny, wildly exciting".|$|E

2500|$|Antennae, {{sometimes}} called [...] "feelers", are flexible appendages {{located on the}} insect's head which are used for sensing the environment. Insects are able to feel with their antennae because of the fine hairs (setae) that cover them. However, touch is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that antennae can detect; numerous tiny sensory structures on the antennae allow insects to sense smells, temperature, humidity, pressure, and even potentially sense themselves in space. Some insects, including bees and some groups of flies can also detect sound with their antennae.|$|E
2500|$|PMD {{also had}} a square-bore 4-barrel at the time, but this was rated at a lower power than the Tri-Power. This {{carburetor}} was later replaced by the Quadrajet, a spread bore. 'Spread-bore' refers to the difference in sizes between the primaries and secondaries, using smaller primaries paired with larger secondaries for increased airflow at wider throttle with fuel delivery changes akin to the two-plus-four benefit of Tri-Power but with a single carburetor. It must be understood that the Q jet was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that gave the top GTO 400" [...] engine and the 428 H-O engines the same H.P. as the 389 and 421. Aside of the displacement advantage the new engine had redesigned cylinder heads with different valve angles and larger ports. The different valve angles allowed for larger diameter intake and exhaust valves. There have been many test when a Tri-Power set-up was added to a 400" [...] or 428" [...] engine that they made even more H.P. than a Q-Jet.|$|E

2500|$|But {{this was}} <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that changed. The {{constitutional}} conflict about {{the supremacy of}} {{the sovereignty of the}} Generality over provincial sovereignty, that seemed to be settled by the coup of William II, became [...] "unsettled" [...] again after his death. De Witt of course met opposition from [...] other provinces from time to time, and sometimes Holland was even outvoted in the States General. This posed an unenviable dilemma for De Witt. Although decisions were supposed to be unanimous in the States General, this would in practice be unworkable. The principle of majority voting was therefore accepted by all provinces. On the other hand, Holland could not allow the other provinces to go against its wishes, as the major contributor to the Generality's budget. De Witt was therefore only prepared to accept a majority decision if Holland was in the majority. But how to justify this? The solution was to push the old doctrine of the supremacy of provincial sovereignty (as long as it was Holland's sovereignty), first formulated by François Vranck in 1587. And this became the basic constitutional theory of the Republic during the Stadtholderless Era, at least of De Witt'sStates Party.|$|E
