25|$|Daepyeong {{became a}} large central {{settlement}} in the Early Middle Mumun (c. 850-700 BC). The focus of the settlement was a large nucleated group of 144 pit-houses in Eoeun. Another <b>nucleated</b> <b>settlement</b> of 115 pit-houses developed in Okbang {{at about the same}} time. Archaeological evidence from the Middle Mumun indicates that prominent individuals in Eoeun and Okbang probably competed for dominance in the local area. For example, greenstone production and distribution began in Eoeun and was traded to Okbang and areas outside of Daepyeong. Many ditches and ditch-enclosures appeared in Eoeun and Okbang beginning in the Early Middle Mumun. Perhaps this was due to conflict between Okbang and Eoeun, or the whole of Daepyeong with distant outside settlements. Eventually, 8 substantial ditch-and-palisades were constructed at Okbang. Interestingly, this sub-period sees a pattern in which greenstone artifacts that are made in Eoeun are consumed by those who are buried in the ditch-and-palisade precinct of Okbang.|$|E
500|$|Patcham's first church {{served a}} large rural area {{north of the}} fishing village of Brighthelmston—the ancient {{predecessor}} of Brighton. [...] A <b>nucleated</b> <b>settlement</b> developed around this building, which was reconstructed during the Norman era. [...] A wide-ranging series of alterations were carried out by Victorian church restorers to improve the building's structural condition and provide more space to cater for the growing population. [...] As Patcham developed into a suburb in the 20th century, more churches opened {{in the area and}} were administered from All Saints Church. [...] The building's plain exterior contrasts with its well-preserved and, in parts, ancient interior whose features include wall paintings and stone memorials. [...] The churchyard has a set of Grade II-listed tombs.|$|E

2500|$|Local {{historian}} T. Walter Hall (in 1931), following Sidney Addy (1893), {{suggested that}} the district's original settlement was at Hallam Head, above the River Rivelin, {{and that it had}} been destroyed during the Harrying of the North. [...] As evidence, he noted that the location lies by the ancient Long Causeway route and that the name of the neighbouring Burnt Stones Common referenced its destruction. A compilation of early maps of the area surrounding Hallam Head assembled by Hallam (2015) from a number of sources provides compelling evidence that a pre-Conquest <b>nucleated</b> <b>settlement,</b> almost assuredly the Domesday village of Hallam, was located immediately south of the old Roman road (Redmires Road) approximately 4.5 km west of Sheffield. The geographic centre coincides with the junction of Tom Lane and Carsick Hill Road; two ancient byways found mentioned in medieval charters from the 13th century. [...] Hallam provides corroborating charter evidence that leads to the identification of the location Hallam Head, the site for the village of Hallam identified by T. Walter Hall in 1931, being situated near the upper end, or head of the village. [...] A series of three communal fields designated Hallam fields (Hallam Field, Great Hallam Field and Common Fields of Hallam) are mentioned frequently in surrenders from 1550 onward in the context of common pasture. [...] The apparent pattern of a <b>nucleated</b> <b>settlement</b> and associated three-field system would be analogous to ‘town planning’ without a town, had the village of Hallam not existed. The arguments presented by T. Walter Hall and Hallam are rejected by David Hey, who notes that {{there is no evidence of}} any settlement larger than a hamlet ever having existed at the site, and that evidence suggests that the Harrying of the North did not affect the Sheffield area. The simple fact that the village of Hallam and Waltheof's aula had been destroyed and no longer existed, and that the taxable value of the manors in the area had been significantly devalued by the time of the Domesday Survey would contradict Hay's position. [...] Addy himself preferred a location just outside the village of Stannington, where there is evidence of a large manor house surrounded by a moat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of other significant relics of occupation outside the present village area suggests that when significant <b>nucleated</b> <b>settlement</b> did occur it initially happened elsewhere. In particular, the {{existence of}} the church to the south of the modern village strongly suggests that the initial focus of settlement (as opposed to isolated farmsteads) was here. The church, together with the churchyard, occupies a neck of land bounded by two becks flowing in steep-sided ravines which contain several natural strong-running springs. One of these at NY 649/292 is so voluminous and reliable that in recent years it has been capped as a farm supply. In a copse at NY 657/292 there is yet another spring. This is known as Keld Well and is believed by Page to have had religious significance as a place of pilgrimage. [...] A second possibility for a site of settlement is the curious wiggle in Low Street {{at the point where the}} road from Newbiggin crosses to enter the outskirts of the present village. This might well be the fossil record of some sort of hamlet.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of Roman occupation, the pattern of {{settlement}} in the Mureș valley demonstrates a continual shift towards <b>nucleated</b> <b>settlements</b> {{when compared to the}} pre-Roman Iron Age settlement pattern. In central Dacia, somewhere between 10 and 28 villages have been identified as aggregated settlements whose primary function was agricultural. The settlement layouts broadly fall between two principal types. The first are those constructed in a traditional fashion, such as Radeşti, Vinţu de Jos, and Obreja. These show generally sunken houses in the Dacian manner, with some dwellings having evolved to becoming surface timber buildings. The second settlement layout followed Roman settlement patterns.|$|R
