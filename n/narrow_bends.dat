2500|$|Union Generals Nathaniel Banks and A. J. Smith, {{along with}} gunboat squadrons {{under the command}} of [...] Admiral Porter were to meet at Alexandria, on March 17 and make their way up the Red River some 350 miles to Shreveport. (Porter had {{replaced}} Davis as commander of the Mississippi Squadron in October 1862, becoming Acting Rear Admiral.) Of major concern to Porter for his squadron of gunboats was the shallow depth of the river with its many <b>narrow</b> <b>bends,</b> which would soon prove to be a major impediment for the advancing gunboats. During most of the year the river was navigable only by small, shallow draft, vessels, making Porter very reluctant to take his squadron past Alexandria, however, Banks persuaded him by pointing out that if the expedition to Shreveport failed, blame would fall on him. While preparations were being made Phelps was relieved of the Tennessee Division. While everyone was waiting for February's river level to rise, Phelps returned to his home in Chardron to manage its sale, as his parents were not well. In late February he boarded the Silver Cloud assisting General Frederick Steele who requested his help on the White River buildup for the Red River Campaign. Phelps found himself tending to the various vessels that struck snags and sank and had to be raised. Porter was upset with Phelps for giving in and going along with Steele who he regarded as incompetent for river navigation. After leaving Steele, Phelps arrived at Memphis on February 23, and began getting the Eastport ready for the Red River Campaign.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{detailed}} analysis of the wave-mode structure in a bend and its incorporation into a stable algorithm for calculation of the scattering matrix of the bend is presented. The calculations are based on the modal approach. The stability and precision of the algorithm is numerically and analytically analysed. The algorithm enables precise numerical calculations of scattering across the bend. The reflection is a purely quantum phenomenon and is discussed in more detail over a larger energy interval. The behaviour of the reflection is explained partially by a one-dimensional scattering model and heuristic calculations of the scattering matrix for <b>narrow</b> <b>bends.</b> In the same spirit we explain the numerical results for the Wigner-Smith delay time in the bend...|$|E

Our analysis identifies the cost driving factors {{in order to determine}} estimates of marginal costs, as required by the infrastructure provision principles of the European Union. The analysis identifies the variables "track length" and "transported gross-tons" as the principal cost determinants. Furthermore, we observe that total costs as well as marginal costs increase with (i) a high proportion of the track occupied by train stations, (ii) the number of switches within a track, (iii) <b>narrow</b> <b>bends,</b> and (iv) considerable slopes. Moreover average as well as marginal costs for secondary lines are significantly higher than for main lines. (author's abstract) Series: Department of Economics Working Paper Serie...|$|E

Comparisons were made {{only within the}} individual experiments. The cells moved in an irregular pattern with numerous <b>narrow</b> <b>bends</b> and circles. They never changed their leading end. The average speed (without pauses) was relatively constant between o. 2 and 0. 5 mum/s. The maximum speed was about 1. 5 to 2. 0 mum/s. The movements were interrupted by resting periods of different lengths and frequency. Temperature, viscosity, pH, {{and the presence of}} yeast extract in the medium influenced the motility significantly; changes in glucose, calcium ions, and serum content were less effective. The movements were affected by iodoacetate, p-mercuribenzoate, and mitomycin C at inhibitory or subinhibitory concentrations. Sodium fluoride, sodium cyanide, dinitrophenol, chloramphenicol, puromycin, cholchicin, and cytochalasin B at minimal inhibitory concentrations did not affect motility. The movements were effectively inhibited by anti-M. pneumoniae antiserum. Studies with absorbed antiserum suggested that the surface components involved in motility are heat labile. The gliding of M. pneumoniae cells required an intact energy metabolism and the proteins involved seemed to have a low turnover...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we focus on}} the {{integration}} of optical fibres in textiles to create wearable sensing systems. In the introduction (Chapter 3) we describe the basics of light guiding in optical fibres and methods of lateral light coupling. Subsequently, a literature review and motivation are presented. Afterwards two main parts can be differentiated. In the first one (Chapters 4, 5) a new method of continuous extrusion of optical fibres and their medical sensing application using photoplethysmography (PPG) is described. In the second part (Chapters 6 and 7) we present an optical fibre based force sensor, and demonstrate its application in respiratory monitoring. Commercially available optical fibres are not suitable for integration into textiles for two main reasons. These are: low flexibility in bending the fiber and relatively high price. Thus, a new type of Polymeric Optical Fibres (POFs) was developed in Empa St. Gallen. These fibres have enhanced strength and flexibility (0. 027 GPa for in-house produced POF vs 2. 6 - 3. 5 GPa for commercial POF). additionally, these optical fibres where produced by means of melt spinning, which increased significantly the production speed (400 m/min) and thus otentially reduce the price of these POFs. Cyclo-olefin polymer (COP) (Zeonor n= 1. 5) was used as a core material and THV fluoropolymer (THVP, n= 1. 35) as a cladding. These produced POFs features propagation loss at the level of 9 dB/m at 652 nm. These optical fibres were embroidered into textiles such that out-coupling and in-coupling of light at <b>narrow</b> <b>bends</b> in the fiber was possible and the efficiency was improved by one order of magnitude (0. 07...|$|E

40|$|Following the {{development}} of the turning rapid diffuser using CFD analyses in 2006, another analysis is carried out for a turning rapid contraction as required in the design process for wind tunnels. This is similar to the benchmark problem investigated at the 1994 annual meeting of the World User Association in Applied Computational Fluid Dynamics for the turbulent flow in an axi-symmetric 180 ° <b>narrowing</b> <b>bend.</b> However, the present investigation is three dimensional with rectangular cross-sections. A parametric investigation using ANSYS CFX 10 has found that the flow is mostly attached to the sidewalls of the contraction, which does not use any guide vanes. Therefore the use of turning rapid contraction concept in the design of close circuit wind tunnels would be more cost effective, in terms of flow quality and fan power requirements, than the use of traditional turning vanes in the wind tunnel circuit bends.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a quantum particle bound by an accelerating delta-functional potential is investigated. Three cases are considered, using the reference frame moving {{along with the}} δ-function, in which the acceleration is converted into the additional linear potential. (i) A stationary regime, which corresponds to a resonance state, with a minimum degree of delocalization, supported by the accelerating potential trap. (ii) A pulling scenario: an initially bound particle follows the accelerating delta-functional trap, within a finite time. (iii) The pushing scenario: the particle, which was initially localized {{to the right of}} the repulsive delta-function, is shoved to the right by the accelerating potential. For the two latter scenarios, the life time of the trapped particle, and the largest velocity to which it can be accelerated while staying trapped, are found. Analytical approximations are developed for the cases of small and large accelerations in the pulling regime, and also for a small acceleration in the stationary situation, and in the regime of pushing. The same regimes may be realized by Airy-like planar optical beams guided by a <b>narrow</b> <b>bending</b> potential channel or crest. Physical estimates are given for an atom steered by a stylus of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), and for the optical beam guided by a bending stripe. Comment: 7 Figures, J. Phys.

Flow conditions at the rotor disc over a <b>narrow</b> <b>bend</b> {{on the side of the}} advancing blade were investigated in this way. The range of speeds covered was from 44 m. p. h. to 60 m. p. h, corresponding to a range of tip speed ratios 0. 138 to 0. 188.

5000|$|Many leaves rely on {{hydrostatic}} support arranged {{around a}} skeleton of vascular tissue for their strength, which depends on maintaining leaf water status. Both the mechanics and {{architecture of the}} leaf reflect the need for transportation and support. Read and Stokes (2006) consider two basic models, the [...] "hydrostatic" [...] and [...] "I-beam leaf" [...] form (see Fig 1). Hydrostatic leaves such as in Prostanthera lasianthos are large and thin, and may involve the need for multiple leaves rather single large leaves because {{of the amount of}} veins needed to support the periphery of large leaves. But large leaf size favours efficiency in photosynthesis and water conservation, involving further trade offs. On the other hand I-beam leaves such as Banksia marginata involve specialised structures to stiffen them. These I-beams are formed from bundle sheath extensions of sclerenchyma meeting stiffened sub-epidermal layers. This shifts the balance from reliance on hydrostatic pressure to structural support, an obvious advantage where water is relatively scarce. Long <b>narrow</b> leaves <b>bend</b> more easily than ovate leaf blades of the same area. Monocots typically have such linear leaves that maximise surface area while minimising self-shading. In these a high proportion of longitudinal main veins provide additional support.|$|R
