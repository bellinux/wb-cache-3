5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E

25|$|Marmont and Mortier {{informed}} Joseph Bonaparte at Paris {{of their}} predicament; they were badly outnumbered {{and the capital}} was threatened. Raking up every available soldier from the Paris depots, Joseph immediately sent 1,300 foot soldiers and 100 lancers to the two marshals. Soon afterward, the 3,600-man 3rd Provisional Guard Infantry Division under Paul-Jean-Baptiste Poret de Morvan was organized and sent, together with 800 cavalry and 48 artillery pieces. After Blücher's army left his front, Napoleon was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> its intentions or direction. The French emperor left Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's corps at Méry-sur-Seine and Marshal Michel Ney's corps at Arcis-sur-Aube to watch to the north. On 26 February Napoleon reinforced Ney with Nicolas-François Roussel d'Hurbal's cavalry division and Pierre Boyer's infantry brigade. Even so, Napoleon did not believe Blücher was driving toward Paris.|$|E

Years later, Cử blamed Diệm's treatment of opposition parties as the motivation for his attack. He believed that Diệm had prioritised remaining in power over fighting the VC and that, for six years, Cử had been denied promotion because of Diệm's obsession with hindering political opponents. Cử criticised the Americans for having supported Diệm, saying: [...] "the Americans had slammed the door on those of us who really wanted the fight against the communists".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene was}} {{inspired}} by real-life Super Bowl commercials in which, according to Scully, [...] "you don't know what the product is" [...] because there is [...] "so much going on" [...] in Super Bowl commercials.

500|$|In 1930 Richardson, {{with some}} misgivings, {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} join The Old Vic company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the Thames, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor Lilian Baylis since 1912. Its profile had been raised considerably by Baylis's producer, Harcourt Williams, who in 1929 persuaded the young West End star John Gielgud to lead the drama company. For the following season Williams wanted Richardson to join, {{with a view to}} succeeding Gielgud from 1931 to 1932. Richardson agreed, though he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> his own suitability for a mainly Shakespearean repertoire, and was not enthusiastic about working with Gielgud: [...] "I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn't like him." ...|$|E

[...] Velayutham further asserts that the film's only positive aspect is [...] "it does not expose the body of women in the way it is customary" [...] and that Manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances [...] "if only she had a 'proper' mother!" ...|$|E

500|$|A Green Lantern and Hal Jordan's mentor. Strong {{affirmed that}} the film will follow the origin story, [...] "the film closely follows the early comics. Sinestro starts out as Hal Jordan’s mentor, {{slightly}} suspicious and <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> him because obviously Hal is the first human being who’s made into a Green Lantern. He's certainly very strict and unsure of the wisdom of Hal becoming a Green Lantern". Strong said, the character [...] "is a military guy but isn't immediately bad. It's {{the kind of person}} that lends himself to becoming bad over the course of the comics being written, but initially he’s quite a heroic figure." [...] He also revealed that the outfit and other aspects of the character very closely follow the character's early days, [...] "That widow's peak and thin mustache was for some reason originally based on David Niven... So I would like to do justice to the Sinestro that was conceived for the comic books".|$|E
500|$|The troops arrayed {{to oppose}} the British were {{primarily}} from regiments of the Continental Army, although there were {{a large number of}} militia units from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania in the field as well. [...] A significant number of the Continentals had participated in the Siege of Boston, after which they had moved to join troops already in New York preparing its defenses. [...] Some troops had participated in the expeditions against Quebec begun in fall 1775. [...] That attempt ended in June 1776 after a disastrous retreat to Fort Ticonderoga prompted by the arrival of a large British force at Quebec City, and some of those troops were then rushed south to assist in New York. [...] The American defense of Long Island became complicated when Major General Nathanael Greene fell ill on August 15. [...] He had directed the defense work on Long Island, and was thus the general most familiar with the terrain. [...] Washington replaced him on August 20 with Major General John Sullivan, lately returned from Ticonderoga. [...] After sending reinforcements onto Long Island on August 25, Washington replaced Sullivan with the ranking major general, Israel Putnam. [...] David Hackett Fischer observes that the American command situation was [...] "o tangled [...] that units were uncertain about their commanders and <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the positions they were to defend." ...|$|E
500|$|The two hippies, Seth and Munchie, were {{portrayed by}} comic actors Martin Mull and George Carlin respectively. For a while, the staff were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> who would play Munchie. Although {{they had decided}} on Mull to play Seth, the staff were [...] "kind of stuck" [...] on who would play Munchie. Carlin was {{suggested}} by Ron Hauge, one of the Simpsons writers, who [...] "really wanted to meet [...] " [...] but ended up {{not going to the}} recording session. Scully stated that Mull and Carlin were [...] "some of the funniest guys that ever lived", and that recording their lines was [...] "a lot of fun". Although it does not occur with most other guest stars in the series, Mull and Carlin recorded their lines together. While the designs of Seth and Munchie were not modeled after anyone in particular, their hair-styles were slightly based on those of Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen, owners of the ice cream company Ben & Jerry's. Comedian Bob Hope was portrayed by series regular cast member Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among many other characters in the series. Jill St. John and Phyllis Diller were both voiced by American voice actress Tress MacNeille. The psychedelic version of The Simpsons main theme that plays during the end credits was performed by Yo La Tengo, an American alternative rock band who are friends of Cary's.|$|E

500|$|According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, King Janaka of Videha Kingdom held a Rajasuya Yagna {{and invited}} all the learned sages, kings and princess of India to participate. The yagna lasted for many days. Large {{quantities}} of sandalwood, ghee (clarified butter) and barley (cereal grain) were {{offered to the}} Yagna fire creating an atmosphere of spiritual sanctity and aroma. Janaka himself being a scholar {{was impressed with the}} large gathering of learned sages. He thought of selecting a scholar from the assembled group of elite scholars, the most accomplished of them all who had maximum knowledge about Brahman. For this purpose, he evolved a plan and offered a prize of 1,000 cows with each cow dangled with 10 grams of gold on its horns. The galaxy of scholars, apart from others, included the renowned sage Yajnavalkya and Gargi Vachaknavi. Yajnavalkya, who was aware that he was the most spiritually knowledgeable among the assembled gathering, as he had mastered the art of Kundalini Yoga, ordered his disciple Samsrava to drive away the cow herd to his house. This infuriated the scholars as they felt that he was taking way the prize without contesting in a debate. Some of the local pundits (scholars) did not volunteer for debate with him as they were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> their knowledge. However, there were eight renowned sages who challenged him for a debate, which included Gargi, the only lady in [...] the assembled gathering of the learned.|$|E
500|$|Mario Bros. {{was created}} by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead {{developers}} for the video game Donkey Kong. In Donkey Kong, Mario dies if he falls too far. Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto {{that he should be}} able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of,</b> thinking that it would make it [...] "not much of a game." [...] He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario [...] "jumping and bouncing around", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below. Because of Mario's appearance in Donkey Kong with overalls, a hat, and a thick moustache, Shigeru Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter, and designed this game to reflect that. Another contributing factor was the game's setting: it was a large network of giant pipes, so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him.|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was cast}} in the role in February 2015, which {{was the result of}} a talent holding deal between Chopra and ABC Studios. The deal {{required}} ABC studios to either develop a project starring her or cast her in an existing show for the 2015 network television season. For quite some time, the casting executive at ABC, Keli Lee, had been trying to convince Chopra to do television in the United States, something that Chopra was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of.</b> However, when Chopra was first considering the possibility of doing a television series in America, Lee learned that another studio was also trying to sign her, to which she reacted by saying, [...] "No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India." [...] Later, Lee traveled to India and was finally able to convince her to accept the offer. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Chopra revealed the only condition she put forward to Lee for doing a show was that she wanted them to find her a series that would put her in the same position that she currently enjoyed in India. She said [...] "There were TV shows and movies that were offered [...] before this one as well. But I wanted a part that put me on the same platform as [...] India. I wanted to play a leading part. I didn't want to settle for anything less." ...|$|E
