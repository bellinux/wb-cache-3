Amnesty's Piers Bannister informed press that [...] "We {{do know that}} there's {{a high level of}} homophobia in Jamaica, so there was a possibility that it was a hate crime. Many hate crime victims are robbed afterward. We're <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> wasn't a robbery; we just want a full investigation." [...] Schleifer publicly stated that it is [...] "really important to investigate [...] thoroughly. Because there are really strong indications that {{it might have been a}} homophobic attack".|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Kerry King {{was asked}} if Slayer will release a {{follow-up}} to Repentless. He replied, [...] "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open." ...|$|E

In November 1961, en route to Bangkok to repay a visit to Pearl Harbor by the commander in chief of Thailand's Navy, Sides stopped overnight in Saigon with his wife.

2500|$|The rest of {{the second}} chapter and the entire third chapter {{discusses}} exemptions from the Shema, as there are cases where an individual {{is not required to}} say it. The second chapter also contains a series of parables regarding Rabban Gamliel to help the reader understand why exemptions may be acceptable. A recently married man is exempt from saying the Shema as he may be anxious about his wedding. (...) However, if he is able to properly dedicate himself to God in prayer, he should recite it regardless of the exemption. (...) A person who is currently mourning the death of a relative is exempt from saying the Shema and from wearing tefillin. (...) Funeral attendees who can see the mourner should not recite the Shema so that the mourner does not feel uncomfortable for <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it.</b> Women, slaves and children are exempt from the recital of the Shema and from wearing tefillin, but are not exempt from the Amidah, affixing a mezuzah ("doorpost") and Birkat Hamazon.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} {{the conflict between}} Parcells and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft {{took control of the}} team after Parcells was hired, {{and the two of them}} had different ideas on how to run the organization. Six days before the Super Bowl, in an article by Will McDonough, the Boston Globe reported Parcells would leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl to become the coach of the New York Jets. The book Patriot Reign alleges the Patriots have cell phone records showing Parcells was in constant contact with the Jets during the week. Then-Patriots defensive coordinator (and now head coach) Bill Belichick is quoted as saying Parcells' plans to leave for the Jets were a distraction, [...] "Yeah, I'd say it was a little bit of a distraction all the way around. I can tell you first-hand, there was a lot of stuff going on prior to the game. I mean, him talking to other teams. He was trying to make up his mind about what he was going to do. Which, honestly, I felt [...] totally inappropriate. How many chances do you get to play for the Super Bowl? Tell them to get back to you in a couple of days. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> was disrespectful to me, but it was in terms of the overall commitment to the team." [...] Parcells even refused to travel back with the rest of the Patriots after the game, and was eventually hired by the rival Jets.|$|E
