40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R

40|$|In many {{developed}} countries, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer {{cases is}} compulsory. Developing countries including India {{accounts for more}} than half of new cancer cases in the world, however <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer is not yet mandatory. The primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> is to effect prevention and control and better utilization of resources. It is also a valuable source for incidence, prevalence, mortality and morbidity <b>of</b> the disease. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer will lead to improved awareness of common etiologic agents, better understanding of common preventable causes and better utilization of health resources with better monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of health programs such as cancer screening and cancer treatment programs, which ultimately might improve survival. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be done by the doctor or the hospital. Akin to the integrated disease surveillance project where more than 90 % of the districts report weekly data through E-mail/portal, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be implemented if it is incorporated into the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke scheme.
