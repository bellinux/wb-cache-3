A Sprite is awoken by her companion, an elk, and accidentally wakes the Firebird, a fiery {{spirit of}} {{destruction}} {{in a nearby}} volcano who destroys the forest and seemingly the Sprite. The Sprite survives and the elk encourages her to restore the forest to its <b>normal</b> <b>state.</b> Introduced by Angela Lansbury.|$|E
5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E
5|$|In the game's present, Nagi's {{descendant}} and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, Susano, {{refuses to}} believe in Nagi's legend and frees Orochi, who escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from Nippon. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and asks her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu begins to restore the land to its <b>normal</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

5|$|Paint-like gels (which are {{dispensed}} from {{pipes and}} can be transported through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them. Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface, and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals. Only one type of gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time only. Some surfaces, such as grilles, cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or wash away gels, returning the surface or object to its <b>normal</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> to be with other cats.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its <b>normal</b> <b>state,</b> with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E

40|$|We {{report in}} this paper the {{temperature}} and mangetic field dependence of the conductance in the polycrystalline film of titanium nitride, before and after heating at ambient conditions. The {{difference between the two}} films is the room temperature sheet resistance which remains within 15 percent and both the films show superconducting transition at lower temperatures. The zero field and the high field data, respectively, corresponds to the superconducting and the <b>normal</b> <b>states.</b> Both the films display Atshuler-Aronov zero bias anamoly in their <b>normal</b> <b>states,</b> and the superconducting gap openeing up at low fields. However the heated film has a smaller gap owing to more pronounced zero bias suppression of the density of <b>states.</b> The <b>normal</b> <b>states</b> in both the films are similar to the quasi- 2 d-disordered metal and its behavior is studied with temperature. Our data suggests that the zero bias anamoly suppresses the superconducting gap with increase in the disorder. Comment: 5 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools {{do not have to}} operate with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. Teachers do not have to have current practicing certificates. They do not have to have a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They do not have to follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|E
