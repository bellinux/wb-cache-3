40|$|In 2011, Member States and the European Parliament {{brought into}} force a Directive on the {{application}} of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare within the EU. Austria voted against this Directive even though its national legislation was already {{in line with the}} rulings of the European Court of Justice which had triggered the <b>negotiations</b> on the <b>Directive.</b> Why then, {{in the absence of any}} legal constraints on adapting to it, did Austria vote against the Directive? The article argues that it was the federal structure of financing hospital infrastructure and the subnational level’s influence on national position building which led to the rejection of the Directive. The article retraces the process of position building by analyzing the interaction between the national and the subnational levels and concludes that Austria’s position mirrors the national struggle between both levels of government over control of the hospital sector.

40|$|At the 1999 Tampere Council Summit, the Heads of the European Union (EU) Member States {{agreed to}} create common {{standards}} for refugees and persons {{in need of}} subsidiary protection by 2012. In 2004, {{as part of the}} Common European Asylum System, a first version of the Qualification Directive was adopted. In its effort to further approximate the rights of refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the Commission opened a recast process on the Qualification Directive in 2009. The <b>negotiations</b> of both <b>directives</b> have been followed actively by pro-migrant groups. Their intensified political involvement and presence in Brussels did not remain unnoticed by political scientists. However, previous studies mainly focused on the analysis of the factors that affect the emergence of such groups and the variety of their missions. This article, in turn, firstly, identifies those pro-migrant groups active in lobbying on both Qualification Directives; secondly, explores their lobbying strategies; and thirdly, assesses to what extent political opportunity structures affected the lobbying choice of the pro-migrant groups. Analysing the lobbying efforts of the pro-migrant groups on the original Qualification Directive and its post-Lisbon recast allows for an evaluation of whether the groups have benefited from the modified decision-making procedures. The study is based on a documentary analysis of the strategy papers and recommendations of the groups, as well as on 28 in-depth expert interviews with EU officials and interest representatives...|$|R
40|$|One-to-one writing conferences, {{which allow}} maximized {{individualized}} interaction between student-writers and teacher-readers, are widely adopted teaching practices in composition classrooms. One {{of the most}} frequently mentioned benefits of writing conferences is that individual sessions between a teacher and student allows and promotes individual learning. Considering the various needs each student-writer has, conferences can serve as a helpful resource in teaching writing. Especially, L 2 writers, who are likely to have more diverse concerns and needs in their learning process, are considered to be in need of individual conferences even more. ^ This study is focused on the following three questions: one, whether writing conferences results in successful revision, if so, two, what characteristics of conference discourse lead to successful revision, and three, how students change, and possibly improve in their engagement in the conference and draft revision. Participants of the study were three L 2 writers enrolled in a first year composition course and the instructor of the course. Data included transcripts of conference sessions along with pre- and post-conference student drafts. Fifteen conference sessions, five per each student, were analyzed focusing on features such as topic initiation, type and frequency of questions, <b>negotiations,</b> and <b>directives.</b> Student drafts that were written before and after each session were then examined thoroughly to determine whether revision took place successfully according to the revision direction that was discussed during conference. ^ Findings show that although varying in degree, students succeed in revision after engaging in writing conferences. Results also suggest that features associated with successful revision are type and frequency of questions, type of directives, and frequency of negotiations. However, {{it is important to note}} that the features did not vary much within each student, but rather, across students. That is, conference discourse with the three students, whose success rates differed greatly, showed different patterns of features. Firstly, the instructor tended to ask more information seeking questions rather than known information ones with the student whose rate of successful revision was highest, while it was the opposite with the student with the lowest record. Also, the instructor used negotiations mostly frequently with low students, mainly to clarify meaning. Lastly, with the high student, directives were more likely to be suggestions rather than interaction-internal directives (IIDs). In addition, although not evident in the frequency of features, students showed improvement in their draft revision over time. ^ Possible reasons for unsuccessful revision, along with how individualized learning is practiced by conference discourse will also be discussed. In addition, based on the findings, pedagogical implications are examined. ...|$|R
40|$|At the 1999 Tampere Council Summit, the Heads of the European Union {{member states}} agreed to {{harmonise}} national migration policies and protection standards by 2012. The Long-term Residents Directive and the Qualification Directive {{as well as}} their extension and recast form core elements of the common European asylum and migration policy. The <b>negotiations</b> of these <b>directives</b> have been followed actively by pro-migrant groups. Their intensified political involvement and presence in Brussels did not remain unnoticed by political scientists. However, previous studies mainly focused on the analysis of the factors that affect the mobilisation and claim-making of such groups as well as the key features that they need to make themselves heard in Brussels. This study adds to the existing literature by assessing the actual influence that the pro-migrant groups exerted on the four directives. To do so, in an extensive document analysis, the political objectives of the pro-migrant groups on the different directives were compared with the standpoints of the EU institutions. In addition, 50 in-depth expert interviews were conducted in which interest representatives and EU officials were asked to comment on and assess the influence of the pro-migrant groups on said directives. What is more, following the resource dependence theory, it was tested to what extent the ability to provide expert knowledge, political support, and legitimacy decided lobbying success and failure. The sample of the case studies finally allowed scrutinising whether the decision-making procedure – negotiation procedure and ordinary legislative procedure – has had an effect on the influence of the pro-migrant groups. The preference attainment analysis and the attributed influence assessment reveal that on all four directives the pro-migrant groups exerted more influence during the drafting stage than during the further negotiations. With a view to the effect of the decision-making procedure on the influence of the interest groups, no clear conclusions can be drawn from the cross-case study analysis. While no such effect was found when comparing the results of the original Long-term Residence Directive and its extension, after the introduction of the ordinary legislative procedure, the influence of the groups on the recast Qualification Directive has increased. Finally, regarding resource dependence, the empirical data confirms the dependence of the EU institutions on expert knowledge as assumed in the theoretical framework. For the Commission’s and the Parliament’s reliance on support and legitimacy, however, no empirical evidence could be found...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} fifteen years, the energy policy of the European Union (EU) has changed significantly. It has become more {{cooperative}} and integrated across the borders of EU Member States and less preoccupied with the state-centred discourse of energy-supply security. The European Commission, in particular, has policised EU energy policy by re-framing it as a complex patchwork of many energy-related policy interventions. This shift {{took place in the}} aftermath of several critical events that affected Europe’s energy supply and jeopardised its energy security. Energy policisation occurred, in other words, when it was reasonable for EU Member States to securitise rather than integrate their energy policies. The core research question of this thesis addresses this apparent paradox: to what extent has EU energy policy become more integrated, and why has this change occurred when it was least expected? This study argues that the shift towards energy policisation has been discursive. The European Commission has been able to harness unprecedented windows of opportunity created by recent crises to re-frame energy policy according to its overarching understanding of EU integration and public policy-making. The Commission has promoted—for over forty years—a vision of energy policy that spans energy security, market competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and energy efficiency. Based on a bibliometric test, this thesis identifies the type of discursive ‘vehicles’ used by the Commission to diffuse its policy ideas and create consensus about its policy agenda. This thesis also argues that the Commission has been able to use diverse discursive tactics to challenge the prevailing energy policy narrative of the Member States and drive the policy-making process towards more integration. The two case studies analyse two instances of instrumental energy policisation. The case of the wind-power offshore grid projects developed in the North Sea during the last decade shows how the Commission managed to socialise other energy policy stakeholders into its own policy agenda and urge national governments to adopt a more integrated perspective on the issue at stake. The case of the Energy Efficiency <b>Directive</b> <b>negotiations,</b> ended successfully in late 2012, shows that the Commission has also been able to challenge the governments’ state-centred discourse more ‘frontally’. The Commission re-told the story of EU-wide energy cooperation as being so necessary as to force Member States to back away from their resolve, approve the Directive, and accept the binding constraints it contains. Ultimately, this thesis tells a story of continuity and change in EU energy policy. There has been continuity in the decades-long Commission’s advocacy for a more complex and integrated EU energy policy and in its guiding belief that public policy in Europe is, under all circumstances, best made at the EU rather than at the national level. There has been change in the sudden and unpredictable effect that crisis and shocks have had on the preferences of policy actors. By telling a story of variation in EU energy policy and successful discursive re-framing by the Commission, this thesis contributes to the on-going debate on the impact of non-material factors such as ideas, meaning, goals, and visions on the outcomes of policy-making. By combining bibliometric, process-tracing, and discourse analysis techniques, this thesis has sought to provide a more reliable and replicable operationalisation of ideational elements and has expanded the prospective agenda for more cross-policy research in EU studies and public policy analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of the Directive 2009 / 28 /EC on {{the promotion of the}} use of energy from renewable sources was an important step for the successive contribution to the global Climate Change Regime as well as the diversification of energy supply, thus ensuring energy security and reducing dependence on external suppliers. However, although the Directive sets out legally binding targets for each Member State by 2020 as well as interim targets, it does not provide any legally binding instruments, i. e., renewableenergy support scheme(s), to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. Since the overall EU target as well as national targets are fairly ambitious, it poses a question, why the Directive does not include specific legally binding instrument(s) for achieving these targets, whereas the so-called flexibility mechanisms, provided in the Directive, are limited only to non-obligatory cooperation between Member States. It is important to mention that, during the negotiation process on the Directive,the harmonization of Member States' renewable energy policies through the EU-level mechanism of Guarantees of Origin was widely debated. Therefore, the intergovernmental <b>negotiation</b> on the <b>Directive's</b> provisions on renewable energy support scheme which should allow Member States to achieve their national targets as well as the overall EU target shall be submitted as the object of this article, while the purpose is to analyze the case of negotiating the EU-level renewable energy support scheme and to investigate the intergovernmental factors such as asymmetrical bargaining power of Member States aswell as specific domestic factors' influence for the negotiation's results, applying liberal intergovernmentalistapproach as the theoretical framework for analysis. The main tasks of the article are:__ to introduce the basic provisions of liberal intergovernmentalism and to formulate principal theoretical assumptions for further empirical analysis;__ to present a compact overview of the support schemes for renewables, applied in the EU;__ to define the role of the European Commission in the negotiation process, to determine the positions of the Member States on a common support scheme for renewable energy, to analyze the process of interest bargaining through coalition-forming and to detect the essential results of the negotiation. The main methods applied in this article include an analysis of the documents and the Member States' position papers, conducting a case study of the negotiation process on the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin as the common EU-wide support scheme for renewables in the Directive 2009 / 28 /EC on thepromotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The article consists of three parts. The basic provisions of liberal intergovernmentalism as well as the principal theoretical assumptions are examined {{in the first part of}} the article as the theoretical framework for further empirical analysis. Renewable energy support schemes, applied in the EU, are presented in the second part and the case study of the intergovernmental negotiation on the pan-European support scheme for renewables based on the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin is carried out in the third part. The findings show that the majority of the Member States demonstrated strong opposition to the European Commission's proposal for harmonizing their renewable energy policies through specific pan-European support scheme, i. e., the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin. The Commission's initiative was rejected by posing an argument that the instruments for reaching the renewable energy targets must be selected according to the principal of subsidiarity with respect to each Member State's national specificsas only under these circumstances renewable energy support schemes could function in the most sufficient and effective manner. Therefore, the Commission's initial proposal had to be significantly modified thus abandoning the idea of the EU-level support scheme for renewables. The findings also verify theoretical assumptions based on liberal intergovernmentalism which postulate that the negotiation's results mainly depend on asymmetric bargaining power and the most powerful Member States' preferences determined by their national specifics, support schemes and other domestic factors...|$|R
