Eritrea is one of Africa's <b>newest</b> <b>and</b> least populous countries, and Zersenay's achievements on the world athletics stage have {{made him one of}} the country's most identifiable sportsmen. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner who has competed at the World Cross Country Championships and the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{have three}} main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, {{designated}} their alternate uniforms, are the <b>newest</b> <b>and</b> {{were introduced in}} 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Myst saga, Cyan developed , which was released on November 14, 2003. Uru allows players to customize their avatars, and renders graphics in real-time. The multiplayer component of Uru was initially cancelled, but GameTap eventually revived it as , which was in turn cancelled. The game was later resurrected as an open source title. The <b>newest</b> <b>and</b> current iteration of online Uru was made open source and various fan ages have been created. The Miller brothers collaborated with David Wingrove and wrote several novels based on the Myst universe, which were published by Hyperion. The novels, entitled Myst: The Book of Atrus, Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, and Myst: The Book of D'ni, fill in the games' backstory and were packaged together as The Myst Reader.|$|E

5|$|Reinhard Scheer (30 September 1863 – 26 November 1928) was an Admiral in the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). Scheer {{joined the}} navy in 1879 {{as an officer}} cadet; he progressed through the ranks, {{commanding}} cruisers and battleships, as well as major staff positions on land. At the outbreak of World War I, Scheer was {{the commander of the}} II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. He then took command of the III Battle Squadron, which consisted of the <b>newest</b> <b>and</b> most powerful battleships in the navy. In January 1916, he was promoted to Admiral and given control of the High Seas Fleet. Scheer led the German fleet at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916, one of the largest naval battles in history.|$|E
5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the <b>newest</b> <b>and</b> more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E

Its roots lay in University of Milan, where a group of physics majors wanted to share notes—then decided that it was for everyone and not just their internal friend group.

Recorded on photographic film, the only suitable medium then available, the results were considered astounding for {{the latter half of the}} 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Jääkarhu left Rotterdam on 3 March 1926. When the new {{icebreaker}} {{arrived in}} Finland on 7 March, she was welcomed {{by a number}} of icebound ships outside Utö. After Sampo had arrived from Hanko with the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Tyko Reinikka, other representatives of the state, and members of the press, the <b>newest</b> <b>and</b> largest state-owned icebreaker demonstrated her power by easily overcoming the notorious pack ice fields surrounding the island and escorting a convoy of three merchant ships to the open seas. After spending her first winter escorting ships in the Gulf of Finland, Jääkarhu arrived in Helsinki on 27 April 1926. In July she was drydocked in Liepāja, Latvia, where her bottom was repainted.|$|E
25|$|When the Continuation War {{ended with}} the Moscow Armistice on 19 September 1944, Finland had to hand over its best ice-strengthened tonnage to the Soviet Union as war reparations.

The power plant and propulsion system represented unfamiliar technology at the time when all Soviet icebreakers were still powered by reciprocating steam engines. In addition, the damages Sisu had sustained in the mine explosion in 1943 had not been fully repaired. While minor repairs were carried out during the post-war summer layups, no major repairs were not done until 1954 when additional funding was granted for this purpose and the icebreaker was drydocked at Hietalahti shipyard.|$|E
