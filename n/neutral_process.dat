We compare correlations between plant species diversity and genetic diversity (GD) calculated with and without loci potentially under selection (outlier loci). The study system includes 2188 specimens from five species (three common aquatic macroinvertebrate and two dominant plant species) that were genotyped for 396 amplified fragment length polymorphism loci. We also appraise the importance of <b>neutral</b> <b>processes</b> on SGDCs by investigating the influence of habitat fragmentation features. Significant positive SGDCs were detected for all five species (mean SGDC= 0. 52 +/- 0. 05).

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{divisions}} of polyploidy, allopolyplody and autopolyploidy. Allopolyploids arise {{as a result of}} the hybridization of two related species, while autopolyploids arise from the duplication of a species' genome as a result of hybridization of two conspecific parents, or somatic doubling in reproductive tissue of a parent. Allopolyploid species are believed to be much more prevalent in nature, possibly because allopolyploids inherit different genomes, resulting in increased heterozygosity, and therefore higher fitness. These different genomes result in an increased likelihood of large genomic reorganizations, which can be either deleterious, or advantageous. Autopolyploidy, however, is generally considered to be a <b>neutral</b> <b>process,</b> though it has been hypothesized that autopolyploidy may serve as a useful mechanism for inducing speciation, and therefore assisting in the ability of an organism to quickly colonize in new habitats without undergoing the time-intensive and costly period of genomic reorganization experienced by allopolyploid species. One common source of autopolyploidy in plants stems from [...] "perfect flowers", which are capable of self-pollination, or [...] "selfing". This, along with errors in meiosis that lead to aneuploidy, can create an environment where autopolyploidy is very likely. This fact can be exploited in a laboratory setting by using colchicine to inhibit chromosome segregation during meiosis, creating synthetic autopolyploid plants.|$|E

When populations are separated by geographic distances and landscape barriers, they frequently experience restricted gene flow, which can enable phenotypic divergence between populations through selection or drift. Their variety in warning coloration is used for their visibility, toxicity and resistance to predators. When divergent phenotypes are mostly restricted to separate islands, the biogeography of color polymorphism suggests a major role for <b>neutral</b> <b>process.</b> However, Summers et al. (1997) provide evidences that neutral divergence alone is unlikely to have caused the {{variation in}} color patterns. As shown by Lande, rapid evolution in sexually selecting species {{is led by the}} interaction of random genetic drift with natural and sexual selection such as random genetic drift in female mating preferences.

Based on Tazzyman and Iwasa’s study that involved collections of samples from main islands in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, its results proved that female preference on male calls led to call divergence and therefore divergence was driven by sexual selection. Mate choice plays a critical role in generating and maintaining biodiversity. Furthermore, spatial variation in predators or habitat features could exert divergent natural selection on coloration in response to its subjection to predator selection. It is still unclear to what extent sexual selection has driven the evolution of color morphs rather than reinforcing the reproductive isolation of morphs. In an aposematic organism such as Oophaga pumilio, we cannot attribute a phylogenetic signal of selection to female mate choice alone but is quite possible that genetic drift would interact with female color preferences to trigger divergence ...|$|E

However, {{the relative importance of}} niche and <b>neutral</b> <b>processes</b> remains understudied in temperate forests. To determine the balance of niche and <b>neutral</b> <b>processes</b> in climatically limited subalpine temperate forests, we established the Utah Forest Dynamics Plot, a 13. 64 -ha plot comprising 27, 845 stems ≥ 1 cm diameter at breast height (1. 37 m) representing 17 species at 3100 m elevation on the Colorado Plateau. We examined the fit of niche- and neutral-based models to the species abundance distribution (SAD), and tested three underlying assumptions of neutral theory. The neutral model was a poor fit to the SAD, but we did not find the alternative model to provide a better fit. Using spatial analyses, we tested the neutral assumptions of functional equivalence, ecological equivalence, and habitat generality. Half of species analyzed were characterized by non-neutral recruitment processes, and the two most abundant species exhibited asymmetric competitive and facilitative interactions with each other. The assumption of habitat generality was strongly contradicted, with all common species having habitat preferences.

Here, we investigate the relative importance of niche-based and <b>neutral</b> <b>processes</b> in determining the composition and diversity of cichlid communities inhabiting various environmental conditions in the littoral zone of Lake Tanganyika, Zambia.

Contrary to our expectations, our results show that stochastic processes, and not niche-based processes, were responsible for the majority of cichlid community assembly. We also found that the relative importance of niche-based and <b>neutral</b> <b>processes</b> was constant across environments. However, we found significant relationships between environmental variation, community trait means, and community composition. These relationships were caused by niche-based processes, as they disappeared in simulated, purely neutrally assembled communities.

We compared genetic diversity and structure of 20 neutral microsatellite loci with 6 microsatellite loci linked to immune system genes for 13 populations of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) across gradients of population connectivity and habitat quality and tested for evidence of selection. We observed high correlations in mean genetic diversity of 6 adaptive-linked and 20 neutral loci among 13 study populations. Adaptive-linked loci were more diverse, as predicted under expectations of balancing selection for loci associated with pathogen and parasite response, but overall differences in mean diversity of adaptive-linked and neutral loci were small. The strength {{and distribution of}} genetic structure for adaptive-linked and neutral loci were nearly identical, although adaptive-linked genetic structure was slightly weaker. Tests for selection suggested that <b>neutral</b> <b>processes</b> strongly influenced both sets of loci, but differences in genetic diversity and structure were consistent with a weak influence of balancing selection on the adaptive loci. Multivariate regression models indicated that population connectivity strongly predicted both adaptive-linked and neutral diversity, while habitat quality, population size, and habitat area only weakly influenced diversity.
