Electric propulsion power options include two solar array power levels (15 / 22 kW), up to twelve electric thrustors of 30 cm diameter and 2. 7 kW each, five to eight power conditioning units, and a maximum mercury propellant capacity of 1530 kg. In performance, the stage with a dry weight of 700 to 900 kg can deliver a <b>net</b> <b>mass</b> of 756 <b>kg</b> into Saturn orbit, 329 kg into a tight Mercury orbit, and 334 kg within 0. 1 AU of the sun. The stage can also deliver a round trip payload of 3350 kg to geosynchronous orbit and return from an intermediate elliptical orbit using the Shuttle/Tug. Thus, a versatile stage is developed which competes effectively in performance with existing integrated spacecraft and promises considerable savings in total program costs...|$|R

Proceedings, International Symposium on Snow Science Sep 03 - 07, 2007 Moscow, RUSSIAThe {{spatial and temporal}} variability of seasonal snow cover in glacierized catchments {{has important implications for}} the <b>net</b> <b>mass</b> balance of alpine glaciers. This study examines the relationship between changing snowpack volume, the resulting winter balance and the <b>net</b> <b>mass</b> balance of Storglaci?ren, northern Sweden. Using a conceptual model, the net seasonal snow input to the glacier is simulated daily for 16 years from 1990. From this the annual snow accumulation and winter balance are calculated. The model outputs are compared with snowlines delineated from classified aerial photographs, ASTER and Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery, and with measured Storglaci?ren winter balances. The results of the model indicate variability in the winter balance over the study period, though there is a slightly negative trend overall. The highest winter balances and seasonal snow volumes occurred in the early 1990 s and correspond with positive <b>net</b> <b>mass</b> balances. However, the slightly negative trend in winter balance and decreased net seasonal snow volumes suggested by the model, combined with the measured increasing trend in mass lost due to ablation, have resulted in decreasing glacier <b>net</b> <b>mass</b> balances and a corresponding rise in ELA over the study period.

5000|$|From the {{perspective}} of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a larger amount of ordinary (baryonic) matter implies a denser early universe, more efficient conversion of matter to helium-4, and less unburned deuterium remaining. If all of the dark matter in the universe were baryonic, then would be much less deuterium in the universe than is observed. This could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated, but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur. For instance, MACHOs, which include, for example, brown dwarfs (bodies of hydrogen and helium with masses less than 0.08 solar <b>mass</b> <b>kg),</b> never begin nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but they do burn deuterium.
