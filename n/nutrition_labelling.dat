40|$|Objectives: To {{figure out}} how {{consumers}} responded to <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling</b> through the frequency of using <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling,</b> understandability of <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling,</b> factors associated with the usage of <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling</b> {{and the impact of}} different <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling</b> formats. Methods: Relevant studies published between 1994 and 2012 were searched identified through Pubmed Database and China Journals Full-text Database which have investigated the responses of consumers to <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling.</b> Results: Seventeen studies were selected finally to be included in this review. Eight papers described that over half of the participants would check <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling</b> in supermarket. However, five of the papers provide evidence that consumers felt confused to read the <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling.</b> Over half of the consumers responded to check <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling</b> when shopping in supermarkets but the <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling</b> was hard to understand totally specially the item about calories. Front-of pack (FOP) <b>nutrition</b> <b>labeling</b> is a popular formats of label among consumers. Four papers have made comparison between different formats of FOP and two of them provide evidence that multiple traffic-light label earn most reputation among consumers.

40|$|The {{rates of}} obesity {{and the number}} of {{overweight}} adults are increasing in the U. S. (Cohen, 2008). This increase is due, in part, to food over consumption (Cohen, 2008). Although <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> are available for people to identify the amounts of nutrients in food, these labels are often difficult to understand (Cowburn 2 ̆ 6 Stockley, 2002). To understand how people interpret <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels,</b> we conducted two studies with a total of 383 participants. For the first study, we developed and pilot tested two outcome measures for the second study. For the second study we examined how people interpret <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> using a 2 (serving size) by 2 (labeling method) between-subjects design that resulted in four experimental conditions, where <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> were defined as follows: (1) single-serving standard <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels,</b> (2) single-serving traffic light <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels,</b> (3) multiple-serving standard <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels,</b> and (4) multiple-serving traffic light <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels.</b> The first study had 76 participants.

Using an incomplete demand system we estimate the impact of the <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> on sales of healthy (products that merit a <b>nutrition</b> <b>label)</b> and unhealthy (products that do not merit a <b>nutrition</b> <b>label)</b> microwave popcorn. Contrary to expectations, we find that <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> decrease sales of healthy popcorn and increase sales of unhealthy popcorn across all stores. We speculate that <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> on popcorn may signal unwanted product characteristics such as undesirable taste.

The goal is to understand how consumers seek information from the labels to make purchase when extensive experience with the food has been developed. Survey data from 400 random respondents in Beijing were analyzed using an empirical framework and a Mont Carlo integral econometrics model. We find that more than 50 % of the consumers in Beijing have heard of food <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> in general, 36.50 % carefully use label information {{even if they are}} familiar with the food, and nearly 70 % consider mandatory food <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> as beneficial.

40|$|Interpretive {{nutrition}} labels provide simplified nutrient-specific text and/or symbols on {{the front}} of pre-packaged foods, to encourage and enable consumers to make healthier choices. This type of labelling has been proposed as part of a comprehensive policy response to the global epidemic of non-communicable diseases. However, regulation of <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> falls under the remit of not just the health sector but also trade. Specific Trade Concerns have been raised at the World Trade Organization’s Technical Barriers to Trade Committee regarding interpretive <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> initiatives in Thailand, Chile, Indonesia, Peru and Ecuador. This paper presents an analysis of the discussions of these concerns. Although <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> was identified as a legitimate policy objective, queries were raised regarding the justification of the specific labelling measures proposed, and the scientific evidence for effectiveness of such measures. Concerns were also raised regarding the consistency of the measures with international standards. Drawing on policy learning theory, we identified four lessons for public health policy makers, including: strategic framing of <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> policy objectives; pro-active policy engagement between trade and health to identify potential trade issues; identifying ways to minimise potential ‘practical’ trade concerns; and engagement with the Codex Alimentarius Commission to develop international guidance on interpretative labelling.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{published}} and unpublished research into consumer understanding {{and use of}} <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> which is culturally applicable in Europe. DESIGN: A systematic review undertaken between July 2002 and February 2003. RESULTS: One hundred and three papers were identified that reported on consumer understanding or use of <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling,</b> most originating from North America or northern Europe. Only a few studies (9 %) were judged to be of high or medium-high quality. We found that reported use of nutrition labels is high but more objective measures suggest that actual use of <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> during food purchase may be much lower. Whether or not consumers can understand and use <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> depends on {{the purpose of the}} task. Available evidence suggests that consumers who do look at nutrition labels can understand some of the terms used but are confused by other types of information. Most appear able to retrieve simple information and make simple calculations and comparisons between products using numerical information, but their ability to interpret the nutrition label accurately reduces as the complexity of the task increases. The addition of interpretational aids like verbal descriptors and recommended reference values helps in product comparison and in putting products into a total diet context.

Since then a Nordic project {{has been working on}} <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> of foods. The project group has concluded that as there is no perfect model for nutritional information, a nutrition label is always a compromise between many demands. A nutrition label is a tool for delivering information, to be supported by educational and other efforts. Fortification of food products was not included in this work. The conclusions regarding <b>nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> are the following recommendations: I. <b>Nutrition</b> <b>labelling</b> should be mandatory on all pre-packed foods. II. Nutrition labels should be standardised. No asterisks, or footnotes. Legible text. III. Nutrients. Nutrition information should consist of the following mandatory list: Energy, Fat of which hard fat, Carbohydrates of which sugars, Fibre, Protein, Salt. IV. Mandatory formats should give information: 1. Per 100 g, and 2. Per portion (item or household measure explanation in brackets) 3. A simple guidance system - low / high or symbols - should be devised and tested. Recommended daily intake (RDI) should not be used as this concept is too complicated. These four recommendations have been presented to the two Nordic Committees responsible, namely those for Food Issues and Consumer Affairs.

This study examined how nutrition literacy affects college-age population’s reading <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels,</b> and how motivation of label reading associated with predictors of the label reading behavior. Method: An online, self-administered questionnaire was conducted among a randomized sample of 171 students from a Mid-Western university. The questionnaire was structured with key variables derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM); such as attitude to make food choices based on reading <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels.</b> Levels of <b>nutrition</b> literacy were measured by questions derived from a <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> survey. Data analysis was conducted with Pearson’s correlation and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Majority of the college student respondents in this study had adequate nutrition literacy. Though no significance was revealed from the correlation between nutrition literacy and the dependent variables due to the limit variance in nutrition literacy data, this study found that individual’s motivation to read <b>nutrition</b> <b>label</b> and attitude towards reading <b>nutrition</b> <b>label</b> are positively related. Results also showed that individuals with higher motivation to read <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> have better perceived behavioral control of reading <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels.</b> Conclusion: Participants in this study, as an emerging adulthood population with college-level education, revealed adequate nutrition literacy in general. It can also be concluded that improvement in attitude towards certain behavior relates to development in motivation and perception-based involvement...|$|R

Food sales data were analyzed {{before and after the}} <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> went into effect. While a number of previous studies have shown that consumers use <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> when purchasing foods, most of these studies have relied on self-reported data. Previous studies have also shown that consumers {{may not be able to}} apply the information on <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> when trying to purchase healthier foods. Therefore, this study sought to determine whether the <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> helped the Cornell community to purchase healthier foods. Foods sold in three dining locations throughout campus were categorized by their amount of calories, fat, sodium, percent calories from fat, and fiber. Food sales data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (version 16. 0) to test for how sales data changed from spring 2007 to spring 2008. The results indicated that there were significant effects of the <b>nutrition</b> <b>labels</b> on which foods were purchased between the two years. Specifically, there was a decrease in the percentage of foods sold with high calories, fat, percent calories from fat, and sodium. However, there was also a decrease in the percentage of sales due to high fiber foods. This study has public policy implications, as menu-labeling laws are becoming more popular across the nation...|$|R
