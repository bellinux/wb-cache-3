The limited fault current injection capability of the converters has been considered as a hindrance for the relay setting.

The relay coordination has been demonstrated through an implementation in the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) platform.

50|$|In flux braking the {{increased}} current means increased losses inside the motor. The braking power is therefore also increased although the braking power {{delivered to the}} frequency converter is not increased. The increased current generates increased losses in motor resistances. The higher the resistance value the higher the braking energy dissipation inside the motor. Typically, in low power motors(below 5 kW) the resistance value of the motor is relatively large in respect to the <b>nominal</b> <b>current</b> of the motor. The higher the power or the voltage of the motor the less the resistance value of the motor in respect to motor current.In other words, flux braking is most effective in a low power motor.|$|E
5000|$|When calculating average {{efficiency}} {{over a period}} of time, one needs to take an average of efficiencies weighted by the product of power input and time (of that segment of power input): [...] where [...] is the power input and [...] is the efficiency during time [...] If efficiency is low at very low power, then this low efficiency has a low weighting due to the low power (and the low amount of energy thus consumed). Conversely, high efficiencies (presumably at high power) get high weighting and thus count for more. This may result in a higher {{average efficiency}} than would be obtained by simply averaging efficiency over time. Another consideration is that the efficiency curves (that plot efficiency vs. current) tend to drop off rapidly at both low current and very high current for traction motor efficiency, and at low power for gear efficiency) so it is not a linear relationship. Investigations [...] for diesel locomotives show that the lower notches (except notch 0 which is [...] "motor off") of the controller (and especially notch 1 - the lowest power) are much less used than the higher notches. At very high currents, the resistive loss is high since it is proportional to the square of the current. While a locomotive may exceed the <b>nominal</b> <b>current,</b> if it goes too high the wheels will start slipping. [...] So the unanswered question is just how often is <b>nominal</b> <b>current</b> exceeded and for how long? The instructions for starting a train from a stop [...] suggest exceeding the current where the wheels would normally start to slip, but to avoid such slipping by putting sand on the rails (either automatically or by depressing a [...] "sand" [...] button just as the wheels start to slip).|$|E
50|$|The MIDI {{specification}} for {{the electrical}} interface {{is based on}} a fully isolated current loop. The MIDI out port nominally sources a +5 volt source through a 220 ohm resistor out through pin 4 on the MIDI out DIN connector, in on pin 4 of the receiving device's MIDI in DIN connector, through a 220 ohm protection resistor and the LED of an opto-isolator. The current then returns via pin 5 on the MIDI in port to the originating device's MIDI out port pin 5, again with a 220 ohm resistor in the path, giving a <b>nominal</b> <b>current</b> of about 5 milliamperes. Despite the cable's appearance, there is no conductive path between the two MIDI devices, only an optically isolated one. Properly designed MIDI devices are relatively immune to ground loops and similar interference. The data rate on this system is 31,250 bits per second, logic 0 being current on.|$|E

Since Jan 2009, {{a wide spectrum of}} refurbishment has been undertaken which, includes developing reliable designs and processes leading to the fabrication of leak tight low DC resistances in SST- 1 magnet winding packs, equipping each of the sixteen SST- 1 Toroidal Field (TF) magnets with a supercritical helium cooled bubble type thermal shields and testing each of the prepared TF magnets under representative conditions in cold with <b>nominal</b> <b>currents</b> along with manifolds and isolators in near representative conditions. Each of the sixteen SST- 1 TF magnets has been tested fully and successfully in a dedicated test stand in nineteen campaigns during June 10, 2010 and was concluded on Jan 24, 2011. These campaigns ensured that all the sixteen TF magnets could be charged to their <b>nominal</b> <b>currents</b> of 10000 A in either two-phase or supercritical cooling conditions with leak-tight inter-double pancake resistances being in the range of 150 pico ohms to 1200 pico ohms. The supercritical helium cooled thermal shields welded in the inner bore of the TF magnets have also performed as per the design specifications. Subsequently, the assemblies of the SST- 1 TF magnets and the Poloidal Field (PF) magnets in SST- 1 machine shell have begun. The SST- 1 TF magnets are being assembled in pairs (known as octants) together with a SST- 1 vacuum vessel module, sector of 80 K bubble type thermal shields and a pair of outer-inter-coil-structures. The octant assemblies have been completed. The nine superconducting Poloidal Field (PF) magnets will shortly be assembled being supported from the TF cases. The resistive central solenoid magnets, compensating coils and the newly designed in-vessel radial control coils will be subsequently assembled. The assembled magnets inside the cryostat are expected to be cooled down starting from Jan 2012 when a detailed engineering validation of the magnet system would be undertaken.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the new 1700 V SPT IGBT achieves the same desirable characteristics as {{the successful}} 1200 V SPT generation. The results presented here show that despite the low on-state and switching losses of 1700 V SPT IGBT, high levels of short circuit withstand capability and switching ruggedness have been realized. In addition, the unique Soft-Punch-Through structure achieves low levels of EMI. In parallel to the 1700 V SPT IGBT, a new fast and soft recovery 1700 V diode has been developed with very low reverse recovery losses and high ruggedness under all operating conditions.
