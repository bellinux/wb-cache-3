However, when potential operators are privately informed about both their abilities and their effort supply, a bunching contract arises in equilibrium for a general class of production technology.

40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{sustained}} problem of piracy that costs nearly $ 40 {{billion in annual}} revenue losses, the software industry has adopted a number of technical, legal, and economic strategies to curb piracy and stem the resulting losses. Our work complements and contributes to the existing literature by exploring the possible effect of another economic lever [...] product bundling [...] on the relationship governing piracy and seller profits. The traditional economic rationale of demand pooling from bundling that enables sellers to extract higher surplus and its particular attractiveness for information goods with negligible marginal and bundling costs carry over to our analysis. However, the presence of piracy injects several new facets to our analysis. Bundling creates a shared level of piracy of disparate products, and under certain conditions {{to the detriment of}} one of the products. We argue that by construction of the copyright laws, the act of bundling itself can have a deterrence effect. This deterrence effect, along with shared piracy of products and demand pooling are ingredients that together dictate the overall piracy, pricing, profit, and welfare outcomes. Our analysis reveals several interesting insights. Bundling can be profitable even when the very act of bundling increases the piracy level of one of the products in the bundle. Termed phantom piracy, this represents a situation where sellers trade off higher piracy for one product in favor of lower piracy for the other product while deriving overall higher profits. Extensive simulation analysis shows that the region of phantom piracy is vastly expanded when additional products are introduced to the bundle. Conversely, under certain conditions, a profit maximizing seller opts not to bundle even when bundling can serve to lower the overall level of piracy. Price discounts that are typically offered by bundling are sharply deepened when piracy enters the equation. When piracy is a phenomenon to contend with, product bundling always increases consumer surplus even in scenarios where the seller may <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> higher <b>profits.</b> Unlike other forms of price discrimination that are often viewed by consumers with a jaundiced eye as they attempt to extract additional surplus from the consumers, product bundling in the software context can be a win-win scenario for both the buyers and the sellers. software piracy, bundling, copyright, phantom piracy...|$|R

2500|$|Mandel {{replied to}} such criticisms in his 1978 essay [...] "Marxism and the crisis", where he argued this {{dichotomy}} {{does not make}} sense, because {{it is based on}} a false social ontology. Overproduction and overaccumulation were, he argued, inseparable phenomena, and surplus value could <b>not</b> be <b>realized</b> as <b>profit</b> income unless output was sold; consequently the average rate of profit and the rate of market expansion mutually determined each other. He maintained that falling profits were only one factor in the recurrent sequence from boom to slump. He argued that the basic reason why capitalist crises occurred is that capitalism is a system of production run by competing producers, based on private property. In this system, [...] "what is rational {{from the standpoint of the}} system as a whole is not rational from the standpoint of each great firm taken separately, and vice versa." [...] According to Mandel, that also explained why bourgeois macroeconomics and microeconomics contained quite different principles and concepts of economic behaviour (in contrast to Marx's economics, where macro and micro share the same concepts). Thus, in every branch of economic activity, capitalist business could never escape from recurrent problems of overinvestment and underinvestment, which periodically culminated in general crises. Following György Lukács, Mandel portrays capitalist rationality as a [...] "contradictory combination of partial rationality and overall irrationality." [...] It is not that competing businessmen are [...] "irrational", far from it, but that their own [...] "instrumental rationality" [...] and [...] "value rationality" [...] (in a Weberian sense) differ from the functional logic of capitalism as a system, and therefore the two run into serious conflicts at times - leading to crises.|$|R
