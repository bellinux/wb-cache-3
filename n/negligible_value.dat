40|$|Abstract. Two {{evolutionary}} {{scenarios are}} {{proposed for the}} formation of ex-treme helium stars: a post-AGB star suering from a late thermal pulse, or the merger of two white dwarfs. An identication of the evolutionary channel for individual objects has to rely on surface abundances.

40|$|We {{propose the}} use of stimulated Raman {{adiabatic}} passage (STIRAP) to offer a fast high fidelity method of performing SU(2) rotations on spinor Bose Einstein condensates (BEC). Past demonstrations of BEC optical control suffer from difficulties arising from collective enhancement of spontaneous emission and inefficient two-photon transitions originating from selection rules. We present here a novel scheme which allows for arbitrary coherent rotations of two-component BECs while overcoming these issues. Numerical tests of the method show that for BECs of ^ 87 Rb with up to 10 ^ 4 atoms and gate times of 1, decoherence due to spontaneous emission can be suppressed to <b>negligible</b> <b>values.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

5000|$|The ISO 4217 {{standard}} {{includes a}} crude mechanism for expressing {{the relationship between}} a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit. This mechanism is called the currency [...] "exponent" [...] and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the United States dollar) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the [...] "cent". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY (Japanese yen) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such <b>negligible</b> <b>value</b> that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10. Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 ouguiya (UM) equal to 5 khoums, and Madagascar has 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an exponent of 0, as with currencies whose minor units are unused due to <b>negligible</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} a method is {{presented}} for dentine shrinkage measurements. The relative shrinkage of sound dentine slabs is assessed using a Perthometer {{with respect to}} a steel reference. The relative shrinkage of lesions in dentine slabs can be estimated using combined Perthometer/microradiography measurements. The results show that the relative lesion shrinkage of lesions in thick slabs {{is quite different from the}} shrinkage of lesions in thin sections used for microradiography. The relative lesion shrinkage is, for periods up to 30 min, linear with the air drying period and increases strongly with the demineralization period. The previously published diol treatment is capable of reducing the relative lesion shrinkage in thick dentine slabs to <b>negligible</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

In the finite-time case, we use optimal control techniques to substantially decrease the irreversible work to <b>negligible</b> <b>values.</b> Our analysis can be implemented in present-day experiments with ultracold atoms and we show how to relate the work statistics to that of the population imbalance of the two modes.

40|$|An {{important}} contribution to the increased luminosity of the SLAC Linear Collider (SLC) in 1997 / 98 is due to improved performance of the linac. New tuning and stabilization strategies have reduced the emittance growth to nearly <b>negligible</b> <b>values</b> (< 10 % in x and < 30 % in y). A stronger lattice has less sensitivity to wakefields. A new orbit correction scheme and a different emittance tuning procedure reduce the emittance growth further. The stability is improved by counteracting diurnal changes and additionally checking klystron phases. The jitter of the beam is monitored by analyzing the FFT spectrum for sources and keeping it under control.
