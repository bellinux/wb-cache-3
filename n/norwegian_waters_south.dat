40|$|Effects of minimum landing size (LC) in {{the fishery}} of Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} herring have been investigated. The herring {{is assumed to}} be a unit stock, in which the growth of immatures differs according to the distribution area. Two immature stock components are distinguished. One distributed in <b>Norwegian</b> coastal <b>waters</b> <b>south</b> of 70 degrees north and one off Northern Norway and in the Barents Sea. Stock and yield per recruit for two corresponding stock components were calculated (ICES standard programmes) using input parameters as observed in the respective areas. The weight in catch by age of immatures is set equal to that observed in autumn catches (expected to be the main fishing season of immatures) whereas the weight in catch of adults is the average over the year. The weight by age in the stock equals observed weight of prespawners. The maturity ogive by component is calculated by using the length dependent maturing scale described by Toresen (1986). The assessment shows that if this stock is managed at Foal, there is little to gain in yield and stock per recruit by introducing a mifimum landing size above 20 cm in <b>Norwegian</b> coastal <b>waters</b> (<b>south</b> of 70 N), whereas some increase in yield may be obtained in the Barents Sea...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{diversity}} and distribution of Owenia species in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> are discussed. Owenia fusiformis and the Owenia genus {{has gone through a}} turbulent history, with authors describing several new species, while other researchers have disagreed, resulting in many described species being synonymized with O. fusiformis. <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> are no exception, and the majority of samples in natural history collections are still referred to as Owenia fusiformis. In this study both morphological and molecular methods will be used to solve the issue regarding the true identity of Owenia in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters.</b> Along with morphological character two genes, COI and ITS 1, was sequenced and analyzed. COI proved {{to be very difficult to}} extract and amplify successfully for one group of specimens, from which no successful sequences were obtained, while being relatively unproblematic in other groups, leading the question if the COI primers are accurate enough. ITS 1 was unproblematic to amplify and sequence, but due to highly variable sequences, a lot of effort was needed to analyze the dataset. Morphological characters proved to exhibit high degrees of the variation, resulting in most of the defined characters being useless in differentiating between the species. Still, enough useful morphologic characters, the best one being the methyl blue staining pattern, were defined, making it possible to distinguish between different species occurring in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters.</b> This being congruent with the molecular results, led to the conclusion that at least two different species of Owenia is present in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters,</b> Owenia borealis Koh, Bhaud & Jirkov, 2003 and Owenia polaris Koh, Bhaud & Jirkov, with results also suggesting there might be more. Type specimens of Owenia assimilis (Sars, 1851) were also examined, concluding with this probably being identical to O. borealis, although the possibility of the type material being more than one species, leads to this being an open question, in need of more research before an answer can be given. Specimens from the O. fusiformis type locality were also examined, concluding with the presence of the true O. fusiformis in <b>Norwegian</b> <b>waters</b> being highly unlikely...|$|R
