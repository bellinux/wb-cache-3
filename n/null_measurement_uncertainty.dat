40|$|Abstract − This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> assessment guideline applicable to laboratory assessors. <b>Measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is a relevant subject for all laboratories as well as for accreditation bodies since it consists in an elementary requirement for ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. Therefore, it is crucial to assure that all technical assessors have an adequate level of knowledge about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and know how to proper assess it. Researching the literature, it is possible to observe that all <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> guidelines are focused on the laboratory perspective, to help them implement GUM’s concepts. This work, on the other hand, was focused on {{the implementation of a}} new <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> guideline intended exclusively to help laboratory assessors improve their knowledge about this subject and better prepare them to carry out laboratory assessments. The guideline was implemented in Rede Metrológica RS (RMRS), a regional accreditation body from southern Brazil. Simultaneously to this <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> assessment guideline, it was also prepared a <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> check-list to help assessors conduct their laboratory assessments. As a result, an improvement on the level of knowledge about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> was observed among RMRS assessors. The improvement was possible to verify through the application of written exams about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> before and after the training on the new guideline. Exams showed the improvement of assessors’ knowledge, demonstrating the relevance of this innovative work...|$|R

In order to fulfil the assessment of measurement results by taking the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> into account an approach was developed while consideration {{of the state of the}} art and legislative aspects. A comprehensive evaluation of collaborative trials on contaminants in soil was conducted to estimate the order of magnitude of the expected <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in soil analysis. The results are parameter-specific uncertainties which have to be integrated in the assessment of compliance with legal limits. This approach does not replace the estimation of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> as required by DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 - 08. Thus, in addition <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> were calculated exemplarily with respect to different soils and concentration levels.

40|$|AbstractThe laser {{trackers}} play {{an important}} role in fabrication and assembly of aircraft, spacecraft and other large-scale products, and optimization of laser tracker configuration station is one of the core issues. When laser trackers are used on the shop floor, environment factors, especially non-uniform temperature can induce considerable <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Aiming to reduce <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of laser tracker, optimization of laser tracker configuration station for large-scale components in non-uniform temperature field using the Monte-Carlo method is proposed. Firstly, an improved mathematical model for <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of laser tracker is established. This mathematical model is more applicable to <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> evaluation of laser tracker because it takes main <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> sources (mechanism system and non-uniform temperature) into account. Secondly, the Monte-Carlo method is used to evaluate <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> of laser tracker in different configuration stations.

40|$|Abstract—Real-time systems usually {{incorporate}} {{a wide variety}} of challenges: A control engineer, for example, aims for the highest possible control quality achievable. Here, one key element is to minimise the <b>uncertainty</b> of the <b>measurements.</b> This, to put it simple, is the noise of sensor data, which has a negative effect on control. Although <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is well treated in control theory, it is usually ignored in common real-time architectures where temporal properties are the prevalent criteria. Consequently, the communication between control engineers and real-time specialists is rather one way, revolving around deadlines and sampling periods. However, on closer examination, many real-time properties are derived from the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> aspired by the control engineer. Conversely, temporal variations, virtually inevitable in practice, can be represented as <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> as well. Tackling the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> should therefore be an interdisciplinary task: The control system respects the actual run-time conditions instead of estimating them. Likewise, the real-time system considers <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> rather than blindly sticking to deadlines. In this paper we present an uncertainty-centric approach to leverage <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in real-time architectures, not only at design time but also at run-time. Using <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> as an explicit interface minimises the gap between real-time specialists and control engineers and facilitates a modular and flexible system design. Our preliminary results are promising and show the ease of use and the applicability to existing systems...|$|R

During the process of a dynamical measurement of the helical deviations, many factors, including the machine and the environment, lead to measurement errors. Although ISO as well as national standards stipulate the tolerances and assessment methods for helical deviations, these standards contribute little to the uncertainty calculations concerning such measurements. According to the Guide to the Expression of <b>Uncertainty</b> in <b>Measurement</b> (GUM), all measurement results must have a stated uncertainty associated to them. But in most cases of helical deviation <b>measurements,</b> no <b>uncertainty</b> value is given, simply because no <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> calculation procedure exists.

Therefore, the ISO 14253 standard requires, knowledge of the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and, {{that it is in}} reasonable relation with the specified tolerances. Hence, the determination of the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> which is a complex and also costly task, is of utmost importance. The <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is usually influenced by several contributions of various sources.
