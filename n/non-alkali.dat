50|$|To {{reclaim the}} soils {{completely}} one needs prohibitively {{high doses of}} amendments. Most efforts are therefore directed to improving the top layer only (say the first 10 cm of the soils), as the top layer is most sensitive to deterioration of the soil structure.

5000|$|The word [...] "barilla" [...] {{was also}} used {{directly}} to refer to soda ash from any plant source, including not only the saltworts grown in Spain, but also glassworts, mangroves, and seaweed.

50|$|Flat panel dicing using short laser pulses is an {{important}} application {{due to the fact}} that as the glass substrates become thinner it becomes more difficult to improve the process yield using conventional diamond blade dicing techniques. Using short pulses dicing speeds of over 400 mm/s has been successfully demonstrated on <b>non-alkali</b> glass and borosilicate glass, using a 50 kHz, 5W high-power femtosecond laser. The working principal developed by Kamata et al. is the following. The short pulse laser beam having a wavelength to which the work is transparent is directed to the front surface of the work toward the back surface and focused. A filament in the light beam traveling direction from the beam waist is formed by the auto-focusing action due to the laser beam propagation in the work is formed. The substance in the filament is decomposed by the laser beam and can be discharged from the back surface, and a cavity is formed in the channel. While forming the cavity, the laser beam is scanned, a machined surface is formed, and thereafter the work can be cut with a weak bending stress.|$|E

40|$|Question: Edaphically severe {{habitats}} commonly support edaphic endemics, specialized {{plant species}} {{that do not}} occur elsewhere. The endemism of native plant species in edaphically specialized habitats suggests either (a) that these native endemic species are uniquely specialized to survive and grow better under the conditions prevalent in these harsh areas, or (b) that these areas represent refuges from competition with other (often exotic) species. Location: Central Valley, California, USA. Methods:We surveyed the vegetation distribution in alkali sinks and carried out a reciprocal transplant greenhouse experiment crossed with a competition treatment to ex-amine the interplay between interspecific competition and edaphic factors in determining relative performance of an alkali endemic forb (Hemizonia pungens ssp. pungens) and its exotic grass competitor (Lolium multiflorum). Results: Lolium consistently performed better in <b>non-alkali</b> soil. In contrast, Hemizonia, {{in the absence of}} competition, performed significantly better on the <b>non-alkali</b> soils, but in competition with Lolium, performed equally well on alkali and <b>non-alkali</b> soils. Conclusions: These results suggest that Hemizonia does not inherently prefer harsh alkali soil, but is better able to tolerate alkali soil and may be excluded from more moderate soils by competition. Therefore, edaphic and biotic effects may interact to determine the spatial dis-tribution of this edaphic endemic. Our data suggest a mechanism by which competition between native and exotic species on impoverished soils leads to dominance of native species and creation of refugia for native species where exotic species are unable to thrive...|$|E

Data pertaining to an alkali and a <b>non-alkali</b> meteoric metal measured at Arecibo on two consecutive nights, 17 – 18 and 18 – 19 March 2004, are discussed. These two cases represent sporadic-E events that are accompanied by a strong enhancement in the neutral Na but relatively weaker in Fe. We discuss these two nights in the following sections.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of highly invaded ecosystems is that invasive species are often poor invaders of edaphically severe sites, which become refuges for native flora. To investigate the invasive potential of Lolium multiflorum (Hick.) into alkali sites in California, an ex-situ reciprocal transfer experiment was carried out using seeds from populations of L. multiflorum taken from three sites differing in alkalinity (and inundation), including alkali sink soils (pH 8. 5) and sink-edge soils (pH 7. 4) located within meters of each other, and non-sink soils (pH 5. 0) located several km away. Survivorship, plant height, leaf number and seed production were assessed. In addition, a native composite, Hemizonia pungens (Hick.), commonly found on alkali sinks was also sampled at the sink and sink-edge microsites. Lolium multiflorum plants grown from alkali sink and sink-edge seeds produced fewer leaves and seeds but taller plants than plants grown from <b>non-alkali</b> seeds, the latter perhaps an adaptation to inundation. <b>Non-alkali</b> genotypes fared poorly in sink soils for all traits, both in comparison to their growth on non-sink soils, and in comparison to the sink and sink edge genotypes. This suggests the existence of L. multiflorum ecotypes adapted to inundated alkali sinks, a genotypic difference that occurs on a broad spatial scale (kilometers) but not so obviously on the micro-site scale (meters) between sink and sink-edge populations. These data suggest that edaphic refuges from invasives may be temporary, as invaders with tolerance for these severe sites arrive or evolve...|$|E
30|$|This work investigates {{two cases}} based on {{consecutive}} nights of lidar and ISR {{data obtained from}} Arecibo. Earlier studies have associated Es layers with neutral distribution mainly through ion-molecule chemistry (Gardner et al., 1993; Collins et al., 2002; Raizada and Tepley, 2002; Zhou et al., 2008). The unique set of observations presented here illustrates the differences in neutral distribution and offers an excellent opportunity to understand the processes that can be responsible for such different behaviors observed for alkali and <b>non-alkali</b> metals. In this regard, {{it is important to}} compare the average/peak column abundances of Na and Fe in the main layer and also within Es.|$|E
30|$|We present {{case studies}} of the mesospheric alkali and <b>non-alkali</b> metals, Na and Fe, along with {{electron}} concentrations [Ne] obtained from measurements made at Arecibo on nights of 17 – 18 and 18 – 19 March 2004. The background mesospheric conditions as recorded by an airglow all-sky imager displayed ripple- and band-type structures on these nights. Both of the metals display detailed structures within their neutral sporadic layer but are more pronounced in Na than for Fe. A sporadic-E (Es) with electron concentrations [Ne] exceeding 3000  electrons cm− 3 {{is accompanied by a}} strong Na enhancement and a weak sporadic Fe (Fes) layer around 95 -km altitude. The concentration of Fe+ and Na+ is estimated to be close to 600 and 30  ions.cm− 3, respectively, within the sporadic-E layer. In order to investigate ion-neutral coupling, a correlative analysis was performed in two altitude regions. Similar features are seen between neutrals and electrons in the 96 – 100 -km altitude range, while within the altitude range of 80 – 90 km, an opposite behavior is seen. A comparative study between neutral layers below 90  km {{often referred to as the}} main or permanent layer and sporadic activity above 90  km reveals different characteristics for alkali and <b>non-alkali</b> metal. Fe concentrations in the main layer are higher than in Fes resulting in a density ratio of less than 1 determined from two layers of 3  km thickness centered at 97 and 87  km. For the case of Na, the ratio exceeds 1 during Es activity on both the nights.|$|E
40|$|Refractive {{index and}} {{chemical}} composition were determined for glass shards contained {{in more than}} 100 tephra layers in DSDP Leg 58 sediment cores collected in the Shikoku Basin, North Philippine Sea. The refractive index is consistent with chemical composition. Refractive index and total iron show a linear relationship. Tephra in Pleistocene and Pliocene sediments is mostly rhyolitic and dacitic (<b>non-alkali),</b> whereas tephra in the Miocene shows wide composition variations {{in the eastern part}} of the basin. Basaltic tephra is recognized in Miocene sediments at Sites 443 and 444, but not at Site 442, west of the other two sites.

The characteristics of fault structures appear to differ at this velocity boundary. A complicated fault system developed on the northern side, whereas a larger fault structure on the order of 10  km in length existed on the southern side (Fig.  4). The dynamic rupture process of the 2000 Western Tottori Earthquake was probably controlled by these pre-existing fault structures around the source region.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIllite {{minerals}} in {{soils and}} weathered rocks are usually interpreted as secondary clays {{derived from the}} transformation of primary rock-forming minerals with similar properties (e. g., muscovite), or as direct products of hydrothermal alteration after feldspar (i. e., sericite). With the help of detailed investigations involving X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray element mapping, this study testifies to the neoformation of illite inside plagioclase feldspar crystals after their partial dissolution in the weathering zone of Luvisols in semi-arid Northeast Brazil. Our results thus reveal that meteoric weathering can produce illite not only from mica, i. e., by a transformation process, but also within <b>non-alkali</b> feldspar by a neoformation process, at least under the semi-arid conditions that have long prevailed in the study area.
