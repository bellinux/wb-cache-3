40|$|The {{dispersion}} of heavy inertial particles in statistically stationary stably stratified turbulence is studied {{by means of}} direct numerical simulations. The following issues have been addressed: What distinguishes dispersion in such stratified flows from dispersion processes in statistically stationary homogeneous isotropic turbulence? How is the dispersion process affected by the Stokes number of the inertial particles (0. 1 ¿St=tp/tK ¿ 10, with tp the particle response time and tK the Kolmogorov time) ? What is the interplay between buoyancy and the Stokes number? And what is the effect, if any, of particle settling, <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag,</b> and lift forces (particularly relevant for stratified turbulence with its vertical shear layers) on particle dispersion? The long-time dispersion in isotropic turbulence {{is found to be}} maximum around St= 1, in agreement with the observation of preferential concentration for St˜ 1. In stably stratified turbulence such a maximum in the dispersion is only found for the horizontal direction. The horizontal and vertical dispersions in stably stratified turbulence show different behaviors due to the anisotropy of the flow, and in particular, vertical dispersion is strongly affected by the inertia of the particles. With increasing St the classical plateau found for vertical fluid particle dispersion becomes less pronounced and it even vanishes for Stokes numbers of O(10) and higher. Furthermore, the long-time vertical dispersion increases with increasing St. The effects of gravity, <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag,</b> and lift forces have been considered in more detail. It turned out that the settling enhancement of inertial particles, as observed in isotropic turbulence, is suppressed by stratification and by <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> effects. Moreover, <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> only affects the dispersion in the vertical direction in stably stratified turbulence.

This formulation of transport recognizes the mean gradients {{on the scale of}} the main transporting eddies and avoids problems with existing methods due to parameterization of fluxes in terms of local gradients between adjacent grid levels.

40|$|This work seeks, through {{numerical}} simulations {{as well as}} analysis, {{to derive}} from relatively simple models an intuitive understanding of the dynamics and behaviour of flow in lakes near the bottom boundary. The main body {{is divided into two}} equally important sections, the analysis and simulation of the effects of nonlinear (quadratic) bottom drag on the flow, and the simulation of the effects of topography on lake dynamics {{as it relates to the}} redistribution of sediment from the lakebed. The simulations all follow a structured scheme, beginning with relatively simple one-dimensional models to build intuition and proceeding to full two-dimensional simulations using the weakly nonhydrostatic shallow water equations. Thus this work seeks to build an understanding of the behaviour of the modified shallow water equations (a good representation of lake behaviour) and to analyze the effects of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> and bottom topography on these systems. The <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> chapters demonstrate that the addition of a nonlinear friction term, while very efficient at removing energy from the system, also causes interesting new behaviour. In the pendulum (a good one dimensional analogy to the shallow water equations) the presence of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> alters the parameter space enough to induce or destroy chaotic behaviour. A phenomenon worth considering in relation the shallow water equations. Additionally, the presence of drag causes as a cascade in spectral space, similar to the classical turbulent cascade.

The final section of the thesis deals with the presence and effects of bottom topography (namely protrusions from the lake bed) on wave velocities due to a basin-scale seiche. This section examines both the dynamics of the system, through deflection about topography and the modification of the wave due to nonlinearity and bathymetry, as well as the relationship between lake dynamics and sediment redistribution.

40|$|The {{exploration}} and production of oil at offshore locations is extending into ever increasing water depths. To exploit this resource in water depths in excess of 300 meters, {{a new class of}} offshore structures called compliant platforms are being developed. The compliant nature of these platforms introduces nonlinear behavior which can not be neglected as in conventional offshore platforms. Consequently, new analytical methods to estimate response statistics are needed. Stochastic linearization is perhaps the most frequently used analytical approximation for analyzing the response of nonlinear systems. Linearization, however, can not predict responses at frequencies outside the excitation frequencies. Therefore, some response statistics may be significantly unconservative. In addition for a gaussian excitation, the linearized solution leads to a gaussian probability distribution, whereas the true response is non-gaussian. In this study, a higher order method termed equivalent stochastic "quadratization" is proposed to circumvent these shortcomings. The nonlinearity is replaced by a polynomial expansion up to quadratic order. The Volterra series method is used to approximate the response of the resulting nonlinear system. The excitation is assumed to be gaussian, however, the response is described by a nongaussian probability distribution. The method is developed for analyzing the stationary response of single and multi-degree-of-freedom systems. A useful application of the proposed method is for analyzing the stochastic response of compliant offshore platforms due to <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> forces. The method is applied for analyzing a three-degree-of-freedom model of a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) subject to wave and current forces.

30|$|From Figs. 6 and 7, we can {{see that}} for {{constant}} values of the parameters α and δ an increase of ω results in an increase of the forward velocity. This is in accordance with Proposition 1 which states that the average forward velocity depends on a linear and a nonlinear function of the parameter omega. In addition, from Figs. 6 a and 7 a, we see that the increase of the forward velocity is almost linear for both lateral undulation and eel-like motion patterns. Hence, the influence of the nonlinear function of the parameter ω on the forward velocity is almost negligible compared to the linear relationship between these given in Proposition 1 for the control-oriented model. However, in Figs. 6 b and 7 b, we clearly see the influence of the effects of a nonlinear function of ω. Except for the high frequency case there is a good qualitative agreement between the simulation results of the complex and the control-oriented model. This is probably because the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> effects that are considered in the complex model are not taken into account in the control-oriented model, and the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>drag</b> seems to have a dominating effect at high frequencies.

40|$|The {{effect of}} partial {{reflections}} on surface pressure drag is investigated for hydrostatic gravity waves in two-layer flow with piecewise constant buoyancy frequency. The variation of normalized surface pressure drag with interface height is analyzed for axisymmetric mountains. The results are {{compared with the}} familiar solution for infinitely long ridges. The drag for the two-layer flow is normalized with the drag of one-layer flow, which has the buoyancy frequency of the lower layer. An analytical expression for the normalized drag of axisymmetric mountains is derived from linear theory of steady flow. Additionally, two-layer flow over finite-height axisymmetric mountains is simulated numerically for flow with higher stability in the upper layer. The temporal evolution of the surface pressure drag is examined {{in a series of}} experiments with different interface and mountain heights. The focus is on the linear regime and the nonlinear regime of nonbreaking gravity waves. The dispersion of gravity waves in flow over isolated mountains prevents that the entire wave spectrum is in resonance at the same interface height, which is the case in hydrostatic flow over infinitely long ridges. In consequence, the oscillation of the normalized drag with interface height is smaller for axisymmetric mountains than for infinitely long ridges. However, even for a reflection coefficient as low as 1 / 3 the drag of an axisymmetric mountain can be amplified by 50 % and reduced by 40 %.

40|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is {{in a state}} far from thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, the large scale equator-to-pole temperature gradient is maintained by tropical heating, polar cooling, and a midlatitude meridional eddy heat flux predominantly driven by baroclinically unstable weather systems. Based on basic thermodynamic principles, it can be shown that the meridional heat flux, in combination with the meridional temperature gradient, acts to maximize entropy production of the atmosphere. In fact, maximum entropy production (MEP) has been successfully used to explain the observed mean state of the atmosphere and other components of the climate system. However, one important feature of the large scale atmospheric circulation is its often non-Gaussian variability about the mean.

The rolling friction coefficient was calculated from the ratio of the difference between inertial force and drag force to the difference between weight and upward lift force (where all forces are absolute values). The friction coefficient μ of the carpet floor was the highest (μ= 0. 0143; mean weighted to velocity), followed by the linoleum floor (μ= 0. 0061) and the wooden one (μ= 0. 0042). μ of carpet and linoleum showed no clear trend in the velocity range of 0 – 4  m s− 1 and can be treated as a constant. μ of the wooden gym floor increased, then dropped and increased again with speed. A fit function based on a combined Bateman and parabolic function was applied to the wood data in order to separate the initial peak from the velocity dependency at higher speeds...|$|R
40|$|The Mono Tiltrotor (MTR) {{is a new}} {{vertical}} takeoff {{and landing}} (VTOL) rotorcraft concept. The premise of the MTR is a tilting coaxial rotor system for lifting and propulsion, along with aerodynamically deployable fixed-wings for long-range cruise. The symmetric and controlled self-deployment of these wings is a critical design feature of the MTR concept. A mathematical model was developed to predict the optimal wing hinge geometry to obtain satisfactory wing deployment. The wing hinge design was then used to design and build a functional model that was tested in the University of Maryland’s Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel. The measurements showed that with suitable design features, the symmetric and con-trolled deployment of the wings are possible using aerodynamic actuation alone. The mathematical model {{has also been shown}} to be capable of predicting the dy-namic, time-dependent behavior of the wings, as well as being able to predict the overall <b>nonlinear</b> lift, <b>drag,</b> and pitching moments on the MTR wing and tail con-figuration with good correlation to measured data. A finite element method (FEM) model of the payload support structure was also developed to analyze forces, bend-ing moments and displacements of the structure under load. Initial results show that significant bending moments will be present throughout the entire support struc-ture. This FEM model can be incorporated into a full dynamic model of the MTR to study its dynamic behavior during flight maneuvers while carrying a payload...|$|R
40|$|A {{discussion}} of a diverse set of aerodynamic opportunities to improve the aerodynamic performance of future supersonic aircraft has been presented and discussed. These ideas are offered to the community in a hope that future supersonic vehicle development activities will not be hindered by past efforts. A number of <b>nonlinear</b> flow based <b>drag</b> reduction technologies are presented and discussed. The subject technologies {{are related to the}} areas of interference flows, vehicle concepts, vortex flows, wing design, advanced control effectors, and planform design. The authors also discussed the importance of improving the aerodynamic design environment to allow creativity and knowledge greater influence. A review of all of the data presented show that pressure drag reductions on the order of 50 to 60 counts are achievable, compared to a conventional supersonic cruise vehicle, with the application of several of the discussed technologies. These drag reductions would correlate to a 30 to 40 % increase in cruise L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) for a commercial supersonic transport...|$|R
