This above–mentioned behaviour is expressed by two frequency–rank laws. The authors advance a method through which to obtain representative constants of the parameters of the two laws for either one language field or for a language as a whole. Key words: frequency-rank law, letter probability estimate, multiple confidence intervals. I...|$|R

FLOW is expected to help EFL writers achieve their <b>writing</b> <b>flow</b> without being interrupted by their insufficient lexical knowledge. 1...|$|R

In addition, to clarify the profound significance of little mathematical representations of brain activity. This visuo-neurological-mathematical appreciation for scribbling and drawing is important for a multiple literacy education.
