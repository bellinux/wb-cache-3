The structural characteristics and optical properties were studied by Raman, FTIR, and <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> reflection <b>spectroscopy.</b> It was shown that the position of main kesterite band (286 and 335  cm− 1 for CZTS) shifted to the high-frequency region by 2  cm− 1 and its full-width at half maximum decreased by almost two times (for the 286  cm− 1 mode). This results in the increase of the band intensity. Similar shift by 2  cm− 1 with respect to the main band of A symmetry appeared in the Raman scattering of CZTSe thin films. The analysis showed that the improvements resulted from the ordering of the crystal lattice and were stable during 1 -month period.

Porous silicon was fabricated via electrochemical etching of a p-type (100) silicon wafer in an ethanol – HF solution with applied current densities of 2. 5 mA/cm 2, 5 mA/cm 2 and 15 mA/cm 2 to form ~ 2 μm thick pSi layers.

A Fabry-Perot filter derived from the pSi single layers was also fabricated. <b>Normal</b> <b>incidence</b> reflectance <b>spectroscopy</b> was utilized to characterize the filter at different temperatures.

40|$|A {{simplified}} approach {{to investigate the}} out-of-plane response of plasmonic nanostructures using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is presented. One-dimensional self-assembled arrays of Ag nanoparticles (NP?s) were grown on stepped Al 2 O 3 (0001), in ultrahigh vacuum, using deposition at a glancing angle. The SE response was measured with the plane of incidence aligned along, and across, the surface steps. From the raw data, an anisotropic surface excess function (ASEF) can be extracted, whose properties depend only on the dielectric function of the NP layer. Three resonances are clearly seen in the ASEF: two in-plane resonances, which correspond to the resonances measured using <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> reflection anisotropy <b>spectroscopy,</b> and the out-of-plane resonance. A dipole model is used to simulate the optical response of the NP layer, where {{the presence of the}} out-of-plane resonance provides an important additional constraint in developing the model...|$|R

In this research, optimization of the optical setup and the photoresist initiation system {{leads to a}} significant improvement of the optical quality of the crystal, as characterized by <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> optical <b>spectroscopy.</b> Theoretical spectra are calculated and demonstrate close agreement with experimental values, indicating that this fabrication process achieves excellent optical quality. X-ray microscopy provides non-destructive inspection of the fabricated crystals at nano-scale resolution. A reconstructed crystal model is generated by computed tomography which allows for comparison to a predicted structure’s geometry and optical spectra. Using the polymer crystal as a template, electrodeposition is performed to completely infiltrate the crystal with Cu 2 O. After polymer removal the inverted Cu 2 O crystal exhibits a high peak reflectance at the predicted wavelength, indicating the structure is an exact inverse of the template. A conformal growth algorithm is developed for the commonly used chemical vapor deposition infiltration technique to explain growth results and verified experimentally with atomic layer deposition of oxide materials. Finally, a customized chemically amplified positive photoresist system and its processing steps are developed as a route to zero-shrinkage template material for high fidelity patterning of the designed interference patterns...|$|R

40|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) {{is one of}} the {{compounds}} that are widely used in science and technology, due to their unique physico-chemical properties. It is an n-type direct-gap semiconductor with band gap 3. 35 eV for E[up tack]Lc transitions and 3. 023 cV for E[parallel to]c transitions. Its optical anisotropy is studied by <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> transmitance difference <b>spectroscopy</b> (TDS). ZnO has rhombohedral lattice structure but it cannot be revealed by TDS. Instead, biaxial symmetry is obtained and it is believed to be due to the strains developed along two orthogonal directions within the lattice in the film. Resonance occurs at 3. 29 eV, very closed to the band gap. By using an ambient-film-substrate with Fresnel optics, the line shape of resonance changing with thickness is successfully simulated and the origin of the anisotropy is well explained. The intrinsic anisotropy of ZnO epilayer is not due to the off-plane anisotropy from the mis-oriented substrate but the anisotropic strains along two orthogonal directions, which leads to the shift in the band gap energy along those directions through the deformation potential. With the value of 2. 5 x 10 [to the power of negative five]eV shift in the band gap, the difference in the strains is calculated as 6. 54 x 10 [to the power of negative six]. These anisotropic strains are found to be dependent on the mis-orientation of the substrate and the film quality. The greater the mis-orientation, the greater the anisotropic strains are. In the meantime, better film quality will also enhance the anisotropic strains...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} novel understandings {{pertaining to}} the ordering and optical properties of crystalline colloidal array (CCA) materials and applied these understandings to develop novel non-close-packed inverted photonic crystal materials. CCA materials are highly charged electrostatically stabilized colloidal particles in water which readily form face centered cubic or body centered cubic lattice structures. Because their periodicity is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of light, CCA materials have the ability to Bragg diffract light in the UV, visible and NIR regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. We utilized time resolved <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> reflection <b>spectroscopy</b> to probe the degree and kinetics of CCA ordering during the CCA crystallization process. Bragg diffraction interference fringe intensity is used to qualitatively determine the overall CCA ordering between CCA samples which have incremental additions of added ionic impurity. We defined the physical mechanism for anomalous reflection peaks obtained in the specular reflection direction from photonic crystal materials. We utilize variable angle specular reflection spectroscopy to probe angular ranges about the normal to the (111) planes of an fcc CCA to monitor the dispersion of anomalous reflection peaks. We correlated these reflection peaks to the diffraction from higher order Miller index crystal planes through Bragg's Law. We explain the origin of these peaks {{as the result of a}} multiple diffraction process whereby light is first Bragg diffracted into a beam from a set of higher order Miller index planes and consecutively diffracted by the in plane (111) periodicity into the (111) specular reflection direction. We also uncovered a novel use for CCA and PCCA materials allowing us to fabricate a non-close-packed inverted photonic crystal material. Our novel fabrication method consists of an infiltration and condensation of a sol-gel precursor into the hydrogel matrix of a PCCA and then the subsequent removal of the PCCA material. We show that the original high ordering of the CCA is maintained through and in-depth study which examining the (111) in-plane ordering. Tuning the CCA particle number density, prior to the fabrication process provides the ability to readily tune the Bragg diffracted wavelength of the final inverted photonic crystal...|$|R

40|$|Multilayer {{coatings}} for <b>normal</b> <b>incidence</b> optics {{designed for}} the long wavelength region (25 nm < {lambda} < 50 nm) are particularly challenging due to the few number of layers that can be utilized in the reflection.
