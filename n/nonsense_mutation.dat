5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents were white, and the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with this horse. It is a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented skin and hair, which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat. Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

Amino acid sequencing identified the {{positions of}} the tyrosine residues inserted by supF, and thereby established that <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations</b> lacZ 2, lacZ 2246, and lacZU 131 are at sites corresponding to amino acids 23, 36, and 41 of beta-galactosidase, respectively.

25|$|Recently, two {{damaging}} de novo NAA15 mutations {{were reported}} by exome sequencing in parent-offspring trios with congenital heart disease. Patient 1 harbors a frameshift mutation (p.Lys335fs) and displays heterotaxy (dextrocardia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, left superior vena cava, hypoplastic TV, double outlet right ventricle, hypoplastic RV, D-transposition of the great arteries, pulmonic stenosis) and hydronephrosis, asplenia, malrotation and abnormal neuro-development, the second patient harbors a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> (p.S761X) and displays conotruncal defects (tetralogy of Fallot, single left coronary artery).|$|E
25|$|Paroxysmal kinesigenic {{dyskinesia}} {{has been}} shown to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 2011, the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16 was identified as the cause of the disease. The researchers looked at the genetics of eight families with strong histories of PKD. They employed whole genome sequencing, along with Sanger sequencing to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the rules}} that govern the genetic code and the various {{mechanisms}} present in a cell to ensure the correct transfer of genetic information {{during the process of}} DNA replication as well as during translation, mutations do occur; frameshift mutation is not the only type. There are at least two other types of recognized point mutations, specifically missense mutation and <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation.</b> A frameshift mutation can drastically change the coding capacity (genetic information) of the message. Small insertions or deletions (those less than 20 base pairs) make up 24% of mutations that manifest in currently recognized genetic disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{mutations}} {{found in}} EEC are missense mutations, meaning {{that there is}} a single amino acid change in the protein, as opposed to premature termination of protein synthesis, known as a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation.</b> The frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon that affected the α isotope, but does not affect the β and γ isotopes of p63. From this, it can be concluded that mutant p63α isotopes seem {{to play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of EEC syndrome. Interestingly, it seems that p63α is the predominant p63 isotope in epithelial basal cell layers, which are the cell type often associated with the anomalies found in patients with EEC syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{non-functional}} fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high {{protection from}} the most common norovirus GII.4. Functional FUT2 fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar {{to the end of}} the Histo-blood group ABO(H) precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands. The ABH antigen produced is thought to act as receptors for human norovirus. Homozygous carriers of any <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to the G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong although not absolute {{protection from the}} norovirus GII.4. Non-secretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes, as the precursor is formed by FUT1. Some norovirus genotypes (GI.3) can infect non-secretors.|$|E
25|$|The CLN3 gene was {{originally}} {{identified as the}} whi1-1 allele in a screen for small size mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for Cln3's role in size control, see below). This screen {{was inspired by a}} similar study in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which the Wee1 gene was identified as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression that maintained normal cell size. Thus, the WHI1 gene was at first thought to perform a size control function analogous to that of Wee1 in pombe. However, it was later found that WHI1 was in fact a positive regulator of Start, as its deletion caused cells to delay in G1 and grow larger than wild-type cells. The original WHI1-1 allele (changed from whi1-1 because it is a dominant allele) in fact contained a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> that removed a degradation-promoting PEST sequence from the Whi1 protein and thus accelerated G1 progression. WHI1 was furthermore found to be a cyclin homologue, and it was shown that simultaneous deletion of WHI1—renamed CLN3—and the previously identified G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2, caused permanent G1 arrest. This showed that the three G1 cyclins were responsible for controlling Start entry in budding yeast.|$|E

500|$|There are a {{very few}} Arabians {{registered}} as [...] "white" [...] having a white coat, pink skin and dark eyes from birth. These animals are believed to manifest {{a new form of}} dominant white, a result of a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> in DNA tracing to a single stallion foaled in 1996. This horse was originally thought to be a sabino, but actually was found to have a new form of dominant white mutation, now labeled W3. It is possible that white mutations have occurred in Arabians in the past or that mutations other than W3 exist but have not been verified by genetic testing.|$|E
500|$|W1 {{is found}} in Franches Montagnes horses descended from a white mare named Cigale born in 1957. Cigale's parents' coats were not {{extensively}} marked. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a type of mutation in which a single nucleotide is accidentally exchanged for another, {{is thought to have}} occurred with Cigale. This mutation (c.2151C>G) is thought to severely affect the function of KIT. It is a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation</b> located on Exon15 of KIT [...] Some horses with the W1 mutation are born pure white, but many have residual pigment along the topline, which they may then lose over time. Based on studies of KIT mutations in mice, the severity of this mutation suggests that it may be nonviable in the homozygous state. However, horses with the W1 mutation have been found to have normal blood parameters and do not suffer from anemia.|$|E

2500|$|The final known GEFS+ type 3 {{mutation}} is a <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutation,</b> Q351X, {{located in}} the intracellular [...] region linking {{the third and fourth}} membrane spanning segments. When this mutant subunit is expressed in cells with wild-type α and β subunits it produces non-functional receptors. Since wild-type α and β subunits expressed alone are able to produce GABA inducible current this indicates that the mutation either prevents both coassembly of the mutant and wild-type subunits but also coassembly of the wild-type α and β subunits or prevents proper trafficking of the formed receptor to the membrane. Fusion of GFP onto this mutated subunit has indicated that it is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the cell membrane. As with other known GEFS+ type 3 mutation, Q351X likely results in neuronal hyperexcitability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Codon usage in genomes {{is biased}} towards {{specific}} subsets of codons. Codon usage bias affects translational speed and accuracy, {{and it is}} associated with the tRNA levels and the GC content of the genome. Spontaneous mutations drive genomes to a low GC content. Active cellular processes are needed to maintain a high GC content, which influences the codon usage of a species. Loss-of-function <b>mutations,</b> such as <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations,</b> are the molecular basis of many recessive alleles, which can greatly affect the genome of an organism and are the cause of many genetic diseases in humans. Methods We developed an event based model to calculate the risk of acquiring <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations</b> in coding sequences. Complete coding sequences and genomes of 40 eukaryotes were analyzed for GC and CpG content, codon usage, and the associated risk of acquiring <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations.</b> We included one species per genus for all eukaryotes with available reference sequence. Results We discovered that the codon usage bias detected in genomes of high GC content decreases the risk of acquiring <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations</b> (Pearson's r = - 0. 95; P P = 0. 019). Conclusions While the maintenance of a high GC content is energetically costly, it is associated with a codon usage bias harboring a low risk of acquiring <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations.</b> The reduced exposure to this risk may contribute to the fitness of vertebrates. </p...|$|R

Here, {{we focus on}} the factors influencing viability of yeast cells bearing premature termination codons (PTCs) in the essential gene SUP 45 encoding translation termination factor eRF 1. Using a dual reporter system we compared readthrough efficiency of the natural termination codon of SUP 45 gene, spontaneous sup 45 -n (<b>nonsense)</b> <b>mutations,</b> <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations</b> obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (76 Q [...] > TAA, 242 R [...] > TGA, 317 L [...] > TAG). The <b>nonsense</b> <b>mutations</b> in SUP 45 gene were shown to be situated in moderate contexts for readthrough efficiency. We showed that readthrough efficiency of some of the mutations present in the sup 45 mutants is not correlated with full-length Sup 45 protein amount. This resulted from modification of both sup 45 mRNA stability which varies 3 -fold among sup 45 -n mutants and degradation rate of mutant Sup 45 proteins. Our results demonstrate that some substitutions in the place of PTCs decrease Sup 45 stability. The viability of sup 45 nonsense mutants is therefore supported by diverse mechanisms that control the final amount of functional Sup 45 in cells...|$|R
