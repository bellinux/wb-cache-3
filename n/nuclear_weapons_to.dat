5|$|Project E was a {{joint project}} between the United States and the United Kingdom during the Cold War to provide <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Air Force (RAF) prior to Britain's own nuclear weapons {{becoming}} available.

A plan for using newly available jet aircraft and <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> wage a possible future war with the United States was laid out by Novikov and shown to Nikita Khrushchev, who turned the proposal down in favor of ballistic missiles.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Singapore {{strategy}} was revived {{in the form}} of Operation Mastodon, a plan to deploy V bombers of RAF Bomber Command equipped with <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the Vbombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at RAF Gan in the Maldives. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for Vbombers, so RAF Butterworth had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran into political complications.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> increase efficiency (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) of tungsten.|$|E
50|$|The Mark-12 {{has been}} speculated {{to have been the}} first {{deployed}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> have used beryllium as a reflector-tamper inside the implosion assembly (see <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> design). It is believed to have used a spherical implosion assembly, levitated pit, and 92-point detonation.|$|R
50|$|The {{system used}} <b>to</b> deliver a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> its target is an {{important}} factor affecting both <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> design and <b>nuclear</b> strategy. The design, development, and maintenance of delivery systems are among the most expensive parts of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> program; they account, for example, for 57% of the financial resources spent by the United States on <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> projects since 1940.|$|R

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group working within the Military Department, which {{approved}} of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> the Federal Council. In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E
5|$|Mastodon {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E
5|$|McLachlan {{completed}} his term as Air Member for Supply and Equipment on 23July 1968 and {{retired from the}} RAAF; he was divorced from his wife the same year. Upon leaving the military, he became an aeronautical consultant to the Northrop Corporation, and chairman of Information Electronics Pty Ltd from 1983, serving in both positions until 1987. He was also chairman of Pokolbin Winemakers from 1970 through 1975. In retirement he continued to exercise his interest in Australia's defence, joining in 1975 a group of pundits, including former Chief of the Air Staff Sir Alister Murdoch, who promoted the addition of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> the country's arsenal. A resident of Sydney's Darling Point, Ian McLachlan died on 14July 1991.|$|E

5|$|This eventuality was foreseen. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in December 1953, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{suggested}} that the United States allow Britain {{to have access to}} American <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> make up the shortfall. There were several technical and legal issues. For American bombs to be carried in British aircraft, the United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act. Further down the line, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight refuelling capabilities were added in 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans. Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the refuelling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s. Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular Singapore, where a fully equipped nuclear weapons storage facility had been constructed in 1959. During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> the region; although this was ultimately decided against, Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions. Britain regularly deployed Vulcans to the Far East {{as a part of}} their contribution to SEATO operations, often to test the defenses of friendly nations in joint exercises. In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus; the Vulcans were withdrawn as Cypriot intercommunal violence intensified in the mid-1970s.|$|E

Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994, and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} importance {{of nuclear weapons}} is a major reason why the technology of nuclear fission is politically sensitive. Viable fission bomb designs are, arguably, within the capabilities of many, being relatively simple from an engineering viewpoint.
