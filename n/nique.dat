60|$|But Edith had {{anticipated}} these difficulties, {{and was not}} to be daunted. Proud of her husband, confident in herself, supported by a great establishment, and having many friends, she determined to exchange salutes with these social sharp-shooters, who are scarcely as courageous as they are arrogant. It was discovered that Mrs. Coningsby could be as malicious as her assailants, and far more epigrammatic. She could describe in a sentence and personify in a phrase. The mot was circulated, the nom de <b>nique</b> repeated. Surrounded by a brilliant band of youth and wit, even her powers of mimickry were revealed to the initiated. More than one social tyrant, whom all disliked, but whom none had ventured to resist, was made ridiculous. Flushed by success and stimulated by admiration, Edith flattered herself that she was assisting her husband while she was gratifying her vanity. Her adversaries soon vanished, but the powers that had vanquished them were too choice to be forgotten or neglected. The tone of raillery she had assumed for the moment, and extended, in self-defence, to persons, was adopted as a habit, and infused itself over affairs in general.|$|E

40|$|Because renal homotransplantation {{has been}} used {{increasingly}} in recent years, {{there is a great}} need for simple, reliable techniques that can evaluate accu rately renal function during the post-transplant pe nod. Conventional urologic and radiologic tech <b>niques</b> cannot be repeated frequently, may be difficult to interpret, often provide information too late to be clinically helpful and are not without significant side effects (1 â€” 5). With the development of the scintillation camera, radioisotope techniques have become available which permit dynamic visualization of transplant vascularity, function and morphology. These tech <b>niques</b> may be repeated daily if necessary, and they are accurate, reproducible and atraumatic. The case to be presented illustrates their impor tance and usefulness in the evaluation of a renal transplant problem.

The marriage contract included Marie's inheritance, Montpellier, {{which was to be}} passed to the child immediately should something happen to Peter, says <b>Nique,</b> citing documents discovered in 1850, something Marie would at first not agree too, but finally agreed to a few months later, stating that she had agreed under pressure.
