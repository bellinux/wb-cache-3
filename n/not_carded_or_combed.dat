Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using sulphuric acid (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and sodium carbonate. The wool is oiled before <b>carding</b> <b>or</b> <b>combing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A sliver (rhymes with diver) {{is a long}} {{bundle of}} fiber that is {{generally}} used to spin yarn. A sliver is created by <b>carding</b> <b>or</b> <b>combing</b> the fibre, which is then drawn into long strips where the fibre is parallel. [...] When sliver is drawn further and given a slight twist, it becomes roving.|$|R
50|$|When {{spinning}} fleece into yarn, the fleece must be scoured {{and vegetable}} matter removed. The fleece is <b>carded</b> <b>or</b> <b>combed</b> and then spun into singles. These singles {{are used to}} create the finished yarn in {{a process known as}} plying. The purpose of plying singles is to strengthen them so that they do not break while knitting or crocheting them.|$|R
50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb {{is an example of}} circular combing. The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out <b>carded</b> <b>or</b> <b>combed</b> top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|R

Often buyers are asking to produce finished product from <b>carded</b> <b>or</b> <b>combed</b> yarn. So knowing the performance of product made from cared <b>or</b> <b>combed</b> yarn is getting higher day by day. Yarn is the fundamental unit of fabric. Yarn contains a lot of properties (variables) which can affect dyed fabric finished quality. Carded and combed yarns of same GSM have many different properties because of different manufacturing process. Combed yarn is of superior quality and carded yarn is of inferior quality. The main purpose of this project {{is to find out}} <b>or</b> investigate <b>carded</b> and <b>combed</b> yarn effect on dyed fabric finished quality such as Color fastness properties(Rubbing, Wash, Perspiration, K/S value) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} of archaeological textilia is important. The empower this statement, the textilia {{of the past}} have to be understood. Why did people make and use these products? To get a grasp of the answer, the production process has to be understood. Due to its complexity, {{every part of the}} chain functions as a choice, influencing the final product. This thesis focusses on the sorting preparation of woollen fibres, comparing experimentally processed and spun threads with archaeological samples of woollen yarn from Roswinkel, Smilde-Ravensmeer and Oss. The research starts with setting up a new methodology for the experiment, because little to none has been written on the subject. Focussing on the preparation of woollen fibres, the different reactions to carding, combing and teasing techniques are captured in a handspun thread. The visible reaction of the fibres are noticeable under a microscope. Differences are use of different fibre types, different fibre lengths, the alignment, the amount of crimp and the airiness between the fibres. The feel often corresponds with the used technique. The threads spun of the teased fibres feel either <b>carded</b> <b>or</b> <b>combed,</b> but are much less aligned. Comparing the analysis of the experimental yarn to the archaeological samples, the fibres show much alignment and almost no crimp. The threads are also of a very fine diameter. By using a VP-SEM instead of a stereo light microscope, as had been used for the experimental samples, many details are noticeable. Much {{can be seen in the}} material excavated from the peat, but the Oss material was often too mineralized. Therefore, the seemingly fibre reaction to the preparation technique could have been due to post-depositional causes. Contradictory, it seems unlikely that the fibres align (almost) perfectly in nature, concluding some sorting technique must have been used...|$|R

50|$|One way of {{extending}} a two-player game to more players is by building two teams of equal size. A common case is four players in two fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise as in whist and contract bridge. Partners sit opposite {{to each other}} and cannot see each other's hands. If communication between the partners is allowed at all, then it is usually restricted to a specific list of permitted signs and signals. 17th-century French partnership games such as triomphe were special in that partners sat next {{to each other and}} were allowed to communicate freely so long as they did <b>not</b> exchange <b>cards</b> <b>or</b> play out of order.|$|R

Experimental results in this study show that Gaussian noises well removed from the ear images and has acceptable affect on verification accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{offers a}} new {{perspective}} on battling credit card fraud. It departs from a focus on post factum liability, which characterizes most legal scholarship and federal legislation on credit card fraud and applies corrective mechanisms only after the damage is done. Instead, this article focuses on preempting credit card fraud by tackling the root causes of the problem: the built-in incentives that keep the credit card industry from fighting fraud on a system-wide basis. This article examines how credit card companies and banks have created a self-interested infrastructure that insulates them from the liabilities and costs of credit card fraud. Contrary to widespread belief, retailers, <b>not</b> <b>card</b> companies <b>or</b> banks, absorb much of the loss caused by thieves who shop with stolen credit cards. Also, credit card companies and banks earn fees from every credit card transaction, including those that are fraudulent. In addressing these problems, this article advocates broad reforms, including legislation that would mandate data security standards for the industry, empower multiple stakeholders to create the new standards, and offer companies incentives to comply by capping bank fees for those that are compliant, while deregulating fees for those that are not compliant...|$|R

5000|$|The game is {{a contest}} of arms between two warriors from {{numerous}} historical periods. Each game lasts a maximum of five rounds. The game is unusual for a card game in {{that it does not}} use shuffling as a randomization technique. Anachronism [...] "decks" [...] consist of five cards, and players do <b>not</b> draw <b>cards</b> <b>or</b> have a [...] "hand" [...] of cards. Despite the relatively small number of cards used in each game, card interactions and strategy can become surprisingly intricate, especially in the later rounds. Each player places his chosen warrior card on the playmat and his four support cards, face down, in slots corresponding to the first four rounds. The support cards may be any combination of inspiration, weapon, armor, <b>or</b> special <b>cards.</b> Each player flips his leftmost face-down support card {{at the beginning of each}} round. Initiative numbers on the support cards determine which player goes first in each round. The warrior cards may move and be turned (faced) as in a miniatures game. Support cards represent a variety of historical weapons, armor, items, deities, people, places or concepts such as the Norse sverd or Japanese book Go Rin No Sho. The game's name is derived from the ability to mix the various support cards such that the ancient Greek Leonidas wearing a kimono may fight a Japanese ninja who is wielding a gladius. Dice are used by both the attacker and defender to determine the outcome of battles.|$|R
