25|$|The mapping N of {{elements}} of an interior algebra to their filters of neighbourhoods is a neighbourhood function on the underlying Boolean algebra {{of the interior}} algebra. Moreover, given a neighbourhood function <b>N</b> <b>on</b> a Boolean algebra with underlying set B, we can define an interior operator by xI = max {y∈B : x∈N(y)} thereby obtaining an interior algebra. N(x) will then be precisely the filter of neighbourhoods of x in this interior algebra. Thus interior algebras are equivalent to Boolean algebras with specified neighbourhood functions.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. (Mathematics) Our {{objective}} {{in this thesis}} is to investigate two fundamental questions concerning Riesz operators de <b>ned</b> <b>on</b> a Banach space. Recall that Riesz operators are generalizations of compact operators {{in the sense that}} Riesz operators have the same spectral properties as compact operators. However, they do not possess the same algebraic properties as compact operators. Our rst question that we investigate is: When is a Riesz operator a nite rank operator? This question is motivated from the fact that if a compact operator de <b>ned</b> <b>on</b> a Banach space has closed range, then it is a nite rank operator. Also, Ghahramani proved that a compact homomorphism de <b>ned</b> <b>on</b> a C -algebra is a nite rank operator, see.
