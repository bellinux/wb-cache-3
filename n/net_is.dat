5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel <b>net</b> <b>is</b> a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a <b>net</b> <b>is</b> a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

25|$|NET has a {{terminal}} half-life of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, {{with a mean}} terminal half-life of 8.0 hours. The metabolism of <b>NET</b> <b>is</b> {{very similar to that}} of testosterone (and nandrolone) and is mainly via reduction of the Δ4 double bond to 5α- and 5β-dihydro-NET, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 keto group to the four isomers of 3,5-tetrahydro-NET. These transformations are catalyzed by 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues such as the pituitary gland, uterus, prostate gland, vagina, and breast. With the exception of 3α,5α- and 3β,5α-tetrahydro-NET, which have significant affinity for the ER and are estrogenic to some degree, the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of NET are inactive in terms of affinity for sex steroid receptors (specifically, the PR, AR, and ER). A small amount of <b>NET</b> <b>is</b> also converted by aromatase into EE. <b>NET</b> <b>is</b> metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation as well, mainly by CYP3A4. Some conjugation (including glucuronidation and sulfation) of NET and its metabolites occurs in spite of steric hindrance by the ethynyl group at C17α. The ethynyl group of <b>NET</b> <b>is</b> preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites.|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Efficacy of Olyset nets, {{long-lasting}} insecticidal <b>nets</b> <b>were</b> tested fromAugust 2003 to August 2006 against Anopheles culicifacies, {{the vector}} which transmits 60 % of allmalaria cases in rural India.

Results: The use of Olyset nets reduced the indoor resting density of An. culicifacies and also reducedmosquito entry into the structures where Olyset <b>nets</b> <b>were</b> used. No mosquitoes were caught landingon the Olyset <b>nets.</b> There <b>was</b> {{a reduction in the}} parity rate of An. culicifacies in the Olyset net villageas compared with untreated net and no net villages.

30|$|Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) {{consist of}} a {{heterogeneous}} group of neoplasms originating from cells characterized by the synthesis and release of amines/peptides [1]. Since 1973, the incidence of <b>NETs</b> has <b>been</b> increasing, in which genetic factors might play a role [2] and in addition improved diagnostics contributed to a higher registered incidence of NETs [1].

40|$|Background: Olyset <b>nets</b> <b>are</b> {{a type of}} {{long-lasting}} insecticidal net made of {{polyethylene fibre}} withpermethrin incorporated into it and with a 4 mm mesh size. Bioassays: Olyset <b>netting</b> <b>was</b> wrapped around a wire frame and the mosquitoes were released insidefor bioassays. There was significantly faster knockdown and higher percent mortality than bioassayswith the netting attached to a WHO cone {{with a piece of}} cardboard {{on the other side of}} the net toprevent escapes through the large mesh. It is suggested that with the latter method some mosquitoesplace their tarsae through the mesh on to the cardboard, thus avoiding insecticide contact. Trials in experimental huts: Four mm mesh <b>nets</b> <b>were</b> compared with conventional 1. 5 mm meshnets treated with permethrin. In further trials in huts Olyset <b>nets</b> which <b>were</b> either unwashed or fivetimes washed, with or without subsequent heating, and a Olyset <b>net</b> which had <b>been</b> in domestic usefor four years or a new Olyset <b>net</b> <b>were</b> compared with a net treated with bifenthrin. Results & conclusion: In all cases Anopheles biting on sleepers under the <b>nets</b> <b>was</b> reduced andAnopheles mortality was increased by the use of the insecticidal nets. No significant impact of washingor heating was detected and an Olyset <b>net</b> <b>was</b> as good as new after four years use, but did not causeas much mosquito mortality as bifenthrin treated nets...|$|R
