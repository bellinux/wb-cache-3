We define formally what a structure is, and then show that the set F n of <b>n-layers</b> B F N structures can be expressed as the direct sum of the set A n of <b>n-layers</b> B F N architectures and the set D n of <b>n-layers</b> B F N dimensions.

A self-consistent condition based on a strain-energy equivalence in the case of inclusion-matrix type composite materials is restated for <b>n-layered</b> inclusions with imperfect interfaces and applied to get estimates of such composites materials.

5000|$|Triggering in this {{quadrant}} {{is similar}} to triggering in quadrant III. The process uses a remote gate control and is illustrated in Figure 7. As current flows from the p-layer under the gate into the <b>n-layer</b> under MT1, minority carriers {{in the form of}} free electrons are injected into the p-region {{and some of them are}} collected by the underlying n-p junction and pass into the adjoining n-region without recombining. As in the case of a triggering in quadrant III, this lowers the potential of the <b>n-layer</b> and turns on the PNP transistor formed by the <b>n-layer</b> and the two p-layers next to it. The lower p-layer works as the collector of this PNP transistor and has its voltage heightened: actually, this p-layer also acts as the base of an NPN transistor made up by the last three layers just over the MT2 terminal, which, in turn, gets activated. Therefore, the red arrow labeled with a [...] "3" [...] in Figure 6 shows the final conduction path of the current.|$|E

The first level {{is to show that}} Yue’s solution can be automatically and uniformly degenerated into these classical solutions in closed-form such as Kelvin’s, Boussinesq’s, Mindlin’s and bimaterial’s solutions when the material properties and boundary conditions are the same. This mathematical verification also gives and serves a clear and concrete understanding on the mathematical properties and singularities of Yue’s solution in <b>n-layered</b> solids. The second level is to analytically and rigorously show the convergence and singularity of the solution and the satisfaction of the solution to the governing partial differential equations, the interface conditions, the external boundary conditions and the body force loading conditions. This verification also provides the easy and executable means and results for the solutions in <b>n-layered</b> or graded solids to be calculated with any controlled accuracy in association with classical numerical integration techniques. The third level is to demonstrate the applicability and suitability of Yue’s approach, Yue’s treatment, Yue’s method and Yue’s solution to uniformly and systematically derive and formulate exact and complete solutions for other boundary-value problems, mixed-boundary value problems, and initial-boundary value problems in layered solids in the frameworks of classical elasticity, boundary element methods, elastodynamics, Biot’s theory of poroelasticity and thermoelasticity.

50|$|In the OSI model, {{communicating}} {{systems are}} assumed to be connected by an underlying physical medium providing a basic (and unspecified) transmission mechanism. The layers above it are numbered (from one to seven); the nth layer is referred to as (<b>n)-layer.</b> Each layer provides service to the layer above it (or at the top to the application process) using the services of the layer immediately below it. The layers communicate with each other by means of an interface, called a service access point. Corresponding layers at each system are called peer entities. To communicate, two peer entities at a given layer use an (n)-protocol, which is implemented by using services of the (n-1)-layer. When systems are not directly connected, intermediate peer entities (called relays) are used. An address uniquely identifies a service access point. The address naming domains need not be restricted to one layer, so it is possible to use just one naming domain for all layers.For each layer {{there are two types of}} standards: protocol standards defining how peer entities at a given layer communicate, and service standards defining how a given layer communicates with the layer above it.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} <b>N-layer</b> {{model for}} charge transport {{close to a}} surface {{is derived from the}} solution of Poisson's equation and used to describe distance-dependent electrical four-point measurements on the microscale. As the <b>N-layer</b> model comprises a surface channel, multiple intermediate layers and a semi-infinite bulk, it can be applied to semiconductors in combination with a calculation of the near-surface band-bending to model very precisely the measured four-point resistance on the surface of a specific sample and to extract a value for the surface conductivity. For describing four-point measurements on sample geometries with mixed 2 D- 3 D conduction channels often a very simple parallel-circuit model has so far been used in the literature, but the application of this model is limited, as there are already significant deviations, when it is compared to the lowest possible case of the <b>N-layer</b> model, i. e. the 3 -layer model.
