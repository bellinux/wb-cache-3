25|$|In {{order to}} change the {{incentives}} for war and make peace more appealing the UN can provide a military force by way of an enforcement mandate which provides deterrence to would-be spoilers. They can monitor the situation making the potential for surprise attack {{by one of the}} belligerents less likely to occur or by making it more difficult to carry out such an attack. A lightly-armed observer mission can also serve as an early-warning force or “tripwire” for the aforementioned enforcement mission. Aid and recognition provided to the belligerents by the international community should be made conditional and based on compliance with objectives laid out in the <b>negotiating</b> <b>process.</b> And lastly, peace dividends should be provided in the forms of jobs, public works and other benefits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} world-systems {{frontier}} framework by approaching frontiers and frontier zones as analytical tools in indicating {{and understanding the}} uneven local-global interactions underlying world-systemic incorporation processes. It argues {{that the notion of}} frontier can highlight the role of ‘peripheral agency’ in local-global interactions, revealing incorporation as a <b>negotiated</b> <b>process.</b> This paper applies a world-systems frontier perspective to the analysis of historical processes of land rights standardization in the Andes. Based on a longue durée assessment of the implementation and contestation of land reforms in Highland communities in Bolivia, the formation and reorganization of a centralized land regime in a peripheral setting is unveiled as a <b>negotiated</b> <b>process.</b> Its course is shaped by the interplay of the modernizing aspirations of public authorities and international interest groups and the strong communal land claims defended by indigenous peasants. This complex (re) negotiation over rights and resources drives the creation and movement of (new) frontiers of land control, materializing in an uneven trajectory of land commodification. The presented frontier perspective is instructive to questions on the expansion, limits, and contradictions of the capitalist world...|$|R

40|$|Selling {{organizations}} often offer quantity discounts schedules, but do {{not provide}} the underlying Quantity Discount Price Functions (QDPF). In literature an analysis on how QDPF could be derived from discount schedules is lacking. This is remarkable as QDPF contain useful information for buying organizations. QDPF give more insight into the fixed and variable costs of selling organizations and can be {{a useful tool for}} buying organizations in selecting and <b>negotiating</b> <b>processes.</b> Furthermore, QDPF can be used for calculating and allocating price savings in group purchasing and multiple sourcing decisions. In this paper we develop one general QDPF and two related measures for negotiating spaces. We prove that our QDPF gives a highly reliable approximation of 66 quantity discount schedules of different selling organizations. Finally, we compare the QDPF parameters of the 66 schedules and discuss their basic properties.

2500|$|Lenin, who {{had earlier}} {{hoped for a}} speedy Soviet {{revolution}} in Germany {{and other parts of}} Europe, quickly decided that the imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the <b>negotiating</b> <b>process</b> for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum.

2500|$|On November 10, 1917, {{three days}} after the Soviet seizure of power during the October Revolution, the {{executive}} committee of the national railroad labor union, Vikzhel, threatened a national strike unless the Bolsheviks shared power with other socialist parties and dropped the uprising's leaders, Lenin and Trotsky, from the government. Zinoviev, Kamenev and their allies in the Bolshevik Central Committee argued that the Bolsheviks {{had no choice but to}} start negotiations, since a railroad strike would cripple their government's ability to fight the forces that were still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government. Although Zinoviev and Kamenev briefly had the support of a Central Committee majority and negotiations were started, a quick collapse of the anti-Bolshevik forces outside Petrograd aided Lenin and Trotsky to convince the Central Committee to abandon the <b>negotiating</b> <b>process.</b> In response, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Alexei Rykov, Vladimir Milyutin and Victor Nogin resigned from the Central Committee on 4 November 1917 (Old Style) and Kamenev resigned from his Central Executive Committee post. The following day Lenin wrote a proclamation calling Zinoviev and Kamenev [...] "deserters."

2500|$|In 1991 Miscavige, {{together}} with Marty Rathbun, visited the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters in Washington D.C. {{to arrange a}} meeting with Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg, Jr.. [...] For more than two decades, the IRS had refused to recognize Scientology as a nonprofit charitable organization, a status granted to most established religious organizations. Prior to this meeting, Scientology had filed more than fifty lawsuits against the IRS and, according to The New York Times, [...] "Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig into the private lives of IRS officials and to conduct surveillance operations to uncover potential vulnerabilities... taken documents from an I.R.S. conference {{and sent them to}} church officials and created a phony news bureau in Washington to gather information on church critics. The church also financed an organization of I.R.S. whistle-blowers that attacked the agency publicly." [...] At the meeting with Commissioner Goldberg, Miscavige offered to cease Scientology's suits against the IRS in exchange for tax exemptions. [...] This led to a two-year <b>negotiating</b> <b>process,</b> in which IRS tax analysts were ordered to ignore the substantive issues because the issues had been resolved prior to review. [...] Ultimately, the church was granted recognition as a nonprofit religious or charitable organization in the United States, which creates a tax exemption for the Church of Scientology International and its organizations, and tax deductions for those who contribute to their programs. Senior Scientology officials and the IRS later issued a statement that the ruling was based on a two-year inquiry and voluminous documents that showed the church was qualified for the exemptions.|$|E

This article shows how, when irrigation systems expand in space and across boundaries to capture new water, they also involve new claims by existing and emergent users. This results in complex processes of design, contestation and negotiated redesign, where irrigation projects are being produced by the negotiated construction of water networks. Therefore, the design process in a closing watershed is better approached as a dynamic and <b>negotiated</b> <b>process</b> of engineering than as a prescriptive mode of network building...|$|R

In light of the growing role research and interdisciplinary collaboration play in contemporary design performance, Design Integrations calls for an innovative shake up in design education. Poggenpohl asserts that design research is developed through a typology within academic and business contexts, and follows different research theories and strategies. Such issues in design collaboration are explored in-depth, with essays on an inter-institutional academic project, cross-cultural learning experiences, and a multi-national healthcare project, demonstrating the importance of shared values, interdisciplinary <b>negotiated</b> <b>process</b> and clear communication for tomorrow’s designers...|$|R
