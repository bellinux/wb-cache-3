Make <b>no</b> <b>bones</b> <b>about</b> it, we would carry on, and Roger replied: 'You'll never fucking do it.'" [...] Waters {{had written to}} EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. He also dispensed with the services of Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. This left Gilmour and Mason, in their view, free {{to continue with the}} Pink Floyd name.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This {{will give us a}} lot of confidence I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will be an interesting season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make <b>no</b> <b>bones</b> <b>about</b> it, this is a big game to win and it certainly could give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E

[...] Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for One News said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots [...] "recreational violence". A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: [...] "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{style is}} anecdotal, with many fun tales {{inserted}} into what {{might otherwise be}} sober history. For example, the reign of Frederick II is interrupted to tell an entirely fictional story of a nobleman named Friedrich von Antfurt. This Friedrich subjects a duchess to what we today could only call sexual harassment, {{to the point where}} she thinks up a ruse to get rid of him. She promises to give him what he wants (the poet makes <b>no</b> <b>bones</b> <b>about</b> the fact that he only wants her body) provided he takes part in a joust wearing her chemise (underdress) instead of his armour.

2500|$|David Adair of Contactmusic.com {{wrote that}} Conley's vocals [...] "take on greater pangs of passion ... to deliver lyrics {{that more than}} likely sum up the way the guys felt during their time in music's wilderness".

Entertainment Weekly {{reviewer}} Leah Greenblatt wrote that the album is [...] "as turgidly epic as the tenets of the genre demand" [...] with Conley [...] "mak <b>no</b> <b>bones</b> <b>about</b> his bad mood". She added that the band [...] "have rediscovered their riff-heavy melodics {{to go along with}} Alarm impressively righteous indignation". Gigwise staff member David Renshaw wrote that the instrumentation is [...] "nothing spectacular," [...] while noting that [...] "there are riffs piled on top of riffs ... and a few funky basslines ... but the thing that keeps you coming back to this album is the lyrics". He said that with the album's [...] "heart on sleeve honesty set to a riff-tastic backdrop there is no reason that this album will not bring them the success expected of them on Stay What You Are".|$|E
2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make <b>no</b> <b>bones</b> <b>about</b> the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E

However, by the start of the 1902-03 season the WPHL was now a fully professional league with the Pittsburgh Victorias making a fourth WPHL team. More great stars were enticed to come to Pittsburgh as they could accept pay for play. Bruce and Hod Stuart became major stars in 1902-03. While players like Fred Lake, were already well known to hockey fans. There is still a strong suspicion that hockey players were paid before 1904, when the first pro league was officially formed.|$|R
