Applying a 2 SLS model, the authors find evidence in favour of the self-selection hypothesis.

The objective of the study is to constitute and operationalize the multidimensional construct of technology orientation. A two-step field study with a survey method was preferred.

40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} model for the {{persistence}} of abnormal returns both <b>at</b> <b>firm</b> and industry <b>levels,</b> when longitudinal data for the profits of firms classiffied as industries are available. The model produces a two- way variance decomposition of abnormal returns: (a) <b>at</b> <b>firm</b> versus industry <b>levels,</b> and (b) for permanent versus transitory components. This variance decomposition supplies information on the relative importance of the fundamental components of abnormal returns that have been discussed in the literature. The model is applied to a Spanish sample of firms, obtaining results such as: (a) there are significant and permanent differences between profit rates both <b>at</b> industry and <b>firm</b> levels; (b) variation of abnormal returns <b>at</b> <b>firm</b> <b>level</b> is greater than at industry level; and (c) <b>firm</b> and industry <b>levels</b> do not differ significantly regarding rates of convergence of abnormal returns.

40|$|The {{representative}} agent framework has endowed macroeconomists {{with powerful}} microeconomic tools. Unfortunately, {{it has also}} blurred the distinction between statements that are valid {{at the individual level}} from those that apply to the aggregate. In this paper I argue that probability theory puts strong restrictions on the joint behavior {{of a large number of}} units that are less than fully synchronized, and that many fallacies arise from disregarding these restrictions. For example, the observation that the aggregate price level is more rigid to downward changes than to upward changes, has led many authors to suggest asymmetries <b>at</b> the <b>firm</b> <b>level</b> as responsible for the alleged macroeconomic fact. However, the basic insight developed in this paper shows that asymmetric pricing policies <b>at</b> the <b>firm</b> <b>level</b> do not necessarily imply asymmetries in upward and downward adjustments of the aggregate price level; and asymmetries in the aggregate price level need not come from asymmetries <b>at</b> the <b>firm</b> <b>level.</b> Similarly, asymmetric factor adjustment costs <b>at</b> the <b>firm</b> <b>level</b> need not imply asymmetric responses of the aggregate capital stock and the level of employment to positive and negative shocks. ...|$|R

40|$|No {{evidence}} exists so far on the causality between insider trading and stock returns for the banking industry.

Therefore, we conclude that the stock mispricing detected by insiders is not caused by economy-wide factors, but by firm-specific features. Unlike previous literature, we also analyse the firm-specific variables that cause bank insider trading. By using panel data estimation {{for the first time}} in the insider trading literature, we identify bank reputation, level of entrenchment, charter values, capitalisation and size as determinant factors...|$|R
