40|$|MIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Cosmic-ray {{fluctuations}} are {{monitored by}} neutron monitors using several {{different kinds of}} proportional <b>counter</b> <b>tubes.</b> An important component of these monitors is the electronic subsystem that registers and counts output pulses from these <b>counter</b> <b>tubes.</b> Part of the electronic subsystem is a specific preamplifier. The pulse-height distribution curve of the existing preamplifier used in the neutron monitor system at the Centre for Space Research at the North-West University {{was found to be}} incorrect, and therefore the pulse-height information cannot be used for further research on the <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> characteristics. A correct pulse-height distribution implies that the envelope of the pulse, as generated by an amplifier, has a very specific shape {{as a result of the}} physics that governs the generation of pulses in the neutron <b>counter</b> <b>tube.</b> It was therefore proposed that a new charge-sensitive preamplifier be synthesized to provide an output that provides the correct pulse-height distribution graph for a neutron monitor system. The Centre for Space Research at the North-West University is in the process of designing and building a new mini neutron monitor system. The new charge-sensitive preamplifier will be implemented into this updated system. Ultimately, the electronic subsystem must be able to provide a pulse-height distribution graph at the push of a button, thus making the preamplifier a key component in the new design. In this dissertation the theory of charge-sensitive amplifiers is researched following a design science research methodology. The results showed that a charge-sensitive amplifier can be synthesized to address both the real-world requirements and the theoretical requirements of this research. Master...|$|R
40|$|GM {{counters}} {{are often}} used in radiation detection since they generate a strong signal which can be easily detected. The working principal of a GM counter {{is based on the}} interaction of ionizing radiation with the atoms and molecules of the gas present in the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube.</b> Free electrons created {{as a result of this}} interaction become initial electrons, i. e. start an avalanche process which is detected as a pulse of current. This current pulse is independent of the energy imparted on the gas, that being the main difference between a GM counter and the majority of other radiation detectors. In literature, the dependence on the incidence of radiation energy, tube's orientation and characteristics of the reading system are quoted as the main sources of measurement uncertainty of GM counters. The aim of this paper is to determine the dependence of measurement uncertainty of a GM counter on the volume of its <b>counter's</b> <b>tube.</b> The dependence of the pulse current on the size of the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube</b> has, therefore, been considered here, both in radial and parallel geometry. The initiation and expansion of the current pulse have been examined by means of elementary processes of electrical discharge such as the Markov processes, while the changes in the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube</b> volume were put to test by the space - time enlargement law. The random variable known as the 'current pulse in the counter's tube' (i. e. electrical breakdown of the electrode configuration) has also been taken into account and an appropriate theoretical distribution statistically determined. Thus obtained theoretical results were then compared to corresponding experimental results established in controlled laboratory conditions...|$|R

A Dekatron is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting.

50|$|Alpha {{particles}} are helium-4 nuclei (two protons and two neutrons). They interact with matter strongly {{due to their}} charges and combined mass, and at their usual velocities only penetrate a few centimeters of air, or a few millimeters of low density material (such as the thin mica material which is specially placed in some Geiger <b>counter</b> <b>tubes</b> to allow alpha particles in). This means that alpha particles from ordinary alpha decay do not penetrate the outer layers of dead skin cells and cause no damage to the live tissues below. Some very high energy alpha particles compose about 10% of cosmic rays, and these are capable of penetrating the body and even thin metal plates. However, they are of danger only to astronauts, since they are deflected by the Earth's magnetic field and then stopped by its atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>counter</b> <b>tubes</b> {{and the related}} instrument geometries {{have made it possible}} to obtain greatly improved x-ray powder patterns. Most of the important factors that must be understood in x-ray diffractemetry are described in terms of their effect on the intensity, peak-te-backgrom~d ratio, resolution and line shape. These factors are the geometry of the x-ray optical system, the x-ray tube focal spot size, the angular apertures of the primary beam in the focusing and axial planes, the 2 : 1 setting, and the receiving slit. The precision is often limited by the specimen preparation rather than the instrument, and the effects of homogeneity, displacement and transparency, crystallite sizes, and preferred orientation are outlined.

5000|$|Since {{transistor}} {{technology was}} still in its infancy, these machines used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes, and Dekatrons in their circuits, and cold-cathode Nixie tubes for their displays. This technology was fairly robust and cost effective; the Dekatron <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> being the equivalent of an integrated circuit counter. The ANITA Mk VII was marketed in continental Europe while the ANITA Mk VIII was marketed in Britain {{and the rest of}} the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII version. The logic circuits, although digital, were based on decimal notation rather than binary; as Kitz himself stated at a symposium [...] "no binary stunts here!". Similar to the Comptometer calculating machines of the time, the ANITA had a full keyboard, a feature that was unique to it and the later Sharp CS-10A among electronic calculators. Being silent and very quick in operation, and the only electronic desktop calculator available, the ANITA sold well, reaching nearly 10,000 units per year by 1964.|$|R

40|$|Gold alloys can be {{analyzed}} quickly and in a non-destructive manner using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence analysis (ED-XRFA). Two factors determine {{the accuracy of the}} measurement; the repeatability precision of the instrument and the inhomogeneity of the sample. In principle, the first can be kept low, all be it, {{at the expense of the}} measurement time, which is typically between 100 sec and 1000 sec. Values of 0. 1 % 1 or better, matching the accuracy of the cupellation method (fire assaying), are possible. Inhomogeneous element distribution influences an individual measurement result. As the analyzed volume is determined by the measurement spot size, measurements should be made with as large a collimator as possible and repeated at different places. Statistical evaluations will then provide reliable statements about the uncertainty of the mean value. Whether it is preferable to use instruments with a semiconductor detector or with a proportional <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> depends on the specific application and will be covered in greater detail later in this report. In addition, and to a limited degree, ED-XRFA permits the detection of coatings on the surface. It also allows for the differentiation between solid Au alloys and Au alloy coatings.
