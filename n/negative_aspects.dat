5|$|By the 19th century, {{emphasis}} on the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of Cynic philosophy led to the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional add-on.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} most important works of Indonesian literature, with its love story being compared to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the Chinese legend of the Butterfly Lovers. Some Western critics, including Dutch critic A. Teeuw and writer A. H. Johns, consider it to be the first true Indonesian novel, as opposed to Azab dan Sengsara, which was less developed in its theme of forced marriage and the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of adat.|$|E
5|$|Ethically, silver also symbolizes {{greed and}} {{degradation}} of consciousness; {{this is the}} <b>negative</b> <b>aspect,</b> the perverting of its value.|$|R
50|$|One <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of the co-occurrence matrix is {{that the}} {{extracted}} features do not necessarily correspond to visual perception.|$|R
50|$|It {{is said to}} have a <b>negative</b> <b>aspect,</b> the Qliphothic {{order of}} demons called Thaumiel ruled by the Archdemons Satan and Moloch.|$|R
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspects,</b> but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the company}} {{developed}} Resistance 3—the sequel to Resistance 2—which {{was designed to}} be similar to Fall of Man. The team at Insomniac reviewed players' feedback regarding the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of Resistance 2, re-introduced some mechanics from Fall of Man, and focused on narrative. They considered such an approach can differentiate a franchise from other first-person shooters. Resistance 3 was regarded by the team as the best game in the series, but it sold poorly and was a financial failure. According to Price, the team was disappointed but were still proud of the project. In early 2012, Price announced that the company would not be involved in any future Resistance projects. Sony retained the intellectual property rights to the franchise.|$|E
50|$|Despite the <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of Aži Dahāka in mythology, dragons {{have been}} used on some banners of war {{throughout}} the history of Iranian peoples.|$|R
50|$|A planet's {{detriment}} is {{the sign}} opposite to its rulership or domicile, considered a <b>negative</b> <b>aspect.</b> However, a detriment {{is not as}} averse as its fall.|$|R
50|$|A further <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of beak-trimming is that {{it leaves}} birds less able to groom {{themselves}} effectively, thus beak-trimmed hens have greater ectoparasite burdens than hens with intact beaks.|$|R
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{development of the}} Gier valley had its <b>negative</b> <b>aspects.</b> An 1884 writer described the region of Échalas and Saint-Romain-en-Gier, where the country was furrowed by the river, the canal, the railway and the national road. He described the people as the most miserable in the canton of Givors. He said that everything showed this misery: agriculture, roads, houses, church. Work in the mines was the only choice for the poor villagers. An 1885 travel guide mentions the station of Givors-canal on the railway south from Lyon, where the Nîmes line separated from the line to Saint Etienne. The canal then was mainly used by coal barges. The route from Givors-Canal to St. Etienne passed coal mines, large smelting works and iron foundries.|$|E
5|$|The series {{ended its}} sixth season with 13.26 million viewers, ranking #17 {{in terms of}} ratings, the lowest the series had ever ranked up to then. The season {{received}} mixed critical feedback, with the season's premiere and finale given heavier critical acclaim, {{in contrast to the}} middle. The season was one of the least acclaimed in terms of awards and nominations, being the show's only season not to warrant a Primetime Emmy nomination. Despite the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of ratings and awards, the season managed to receive a spot on Movieline top ten list. Buena Vista released the season onto a DVD box-set, being made available to regions 1 and 2.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> {{of trade}} {{barriers}} {{is that they}} result in a limited choice of products and would therefore force customers to pay higher prices and accept inferior quality.|$|R
5000|$|Brian Inglis who was {{supportive}} {{of some of}} Guirdham's ideas wrote that a <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of his writing was that he tended [...] "to make sweeping assertions unsupported by evidence".|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} period when Egypt became occupied, the <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of the Nun (chaos) became the {{dominant}} perception, reflecting {{the forces of}} disorder that were set loose in the country.|$|R
25|$|Under the Marxism {{mandated}} {{during the}} communist era, the Horthy era was depicted extremely negatively. Scholars agree {{that due to}} political pressure, Horthy's positive achievements were unmentioned while his <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> were exaggerated {{to the point of}} total distortion.|$|E
25|$|Although {{research}} has {{taken into account}} {{the positive aspects of}} forgiveness interventions, there are also <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> that have been explored as well. Some researchers have taken a critical approach and have been less accepting of the forgiveness intervention approach to therapy.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union transformed, often radically, the country's {{physical}} environment. In the 1970s and 1980s, Soviet citizens, {{from the}} highest officials to ordinary factory workers and farmers, began to examine <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of this transformation and to call for more prudent use {{of natural resources and}} greater concern for environmental protection.|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot said [...] "An {{engaging}} story, logical puzzles, {{and nice}} visuals combine to make The Awakened a great adventure game", {{adding that the}} only <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> {{of it is that}} you can't skip cutscenes.|$|R
50|$|Harry Potter {{has been}} seen as seeking a {{succession}} of father figures, from Rubeus Hagrid to Albus Dumbledore, contrasted from the role of Lord Voldemort as the counterpart and <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of the father figure.|$|R
50|$|A <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of Japan's {{economic}} growth is industrial pollution. Until the mid-1970s, {{both public and private}} sectors pursued {{economic growth}} with such single-mindedness that prosperity was accompanied by severe degradation of both the environment and the quality of life (see environmental protection in Japan).|$|R
25|$|The {{storm of}} {{controversy}} created by Velikovsky's publications {{may have helped}} revive the catastrophist movement {{in the second half}} of the 20th century; however, it is also held by some working in the field that progress has actually been retarded by the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of the so-called Velikovsky Affair.|$|E
25|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of {{inequality}} are {{spread across the}} population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels. This is also true {{of the difference between}} mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Monopoly {{can be traced}} back to 1903, when American anti-monopolist Elizabeth Magie created a game through which she hoped to be able to explain the single tax theory of Henry George. It was {{intended}} as an educational tool to illustrate the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of concentrating land in private monopolies. Magie took out a patent in 1904. Her game, The Landlord's Game, was self-published, beginning in 1906.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> that Pynchon {{retrospectively}} {{found in}} the hippie cultural and literary movement, both {{in the form of}} the Beats of the 1950s and the resurgence form of the 1960s, was that it [...] "placed too much emphasis on youth, including the eternal variety." ...|$|R
30|$|We {{estimate}} an additional radiation dose of approximately 3.4  mSv for these CT scans, {{which is another}} <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of our study. However, the incremental dose compared with the cardiac catheterisation procedure is small, the images are limited to the kidneys, and can be rapidly performed.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} aspects of the Dragon Quest series is that it retains the same setting and general {{gameplay}} throughout the series, instead of reinventing itself with each new installment. This {{has been seen as}} both a positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> by critics of the series.|$|R
25|$|In 2009 the Tesla Roadster {{was one of}} the Scandinavian Sports Car of the Year participants. In a {{comparison}} made by Nordic car magazines Tekniikan Maailma (Finland), Teknikens Värld (Sweden) and Bil Magasinet (Denmark), critics praised the torque of the car and a track car structure, but also highlighted more <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> such as a short battery life; they were unable to drive a full track lap in dry track conditions.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, Alphabet City {{was home}} to a mix of Puerto Rican and African American {{families}} living alongside struggling artists and musicians (who were mostly young and white). Attracted by the Nuyorican movement, low rents, and creative atmosphere, Alphabet City attracted a growing Bohemian population. At one time it {{was home to}} many of the first graffiti writers, b-boys, rappers, and DJs. The area also had high levels of illegal drug activity and violent crime. The Broadway musical Rent portrays some of the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of this time and place.|$|E
25|$|According to Shusterman our culture’s growing {{preoccupation with}} the body has not yet found an {{appropriate}} response {{in the realm of}} philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich our experience of the varieties of bodily charms”).|$|E
50|$|The book {{focuses on}} the {{philosophy}} of personal incrementalism, the daily removal of one <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> from a person's life each day {{and replacing it with}} something more positive. This ongoing change is one possible path to someone becoming authentic and happy. The book was released in September 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Rosenfeld saw {{confusion}} as a {{half-way house}} between splitting and reintegration, {{either as a}} progressive step towards the latter, or as a regression from it. In its <b>negative</b> <b>aspect,</b> according to Hanna Segal, [...] "a most powerful element in confusion is envy...Narcissistic organisation protects us from that confusion".|$|R
2500|$|The {{benefit of}} the J.E.M. {{decision}} is that universities {{will be able to}} more easily capture the full economic value of their plant genetic inventions and discoveries. The <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> of this case, however, is that professors and universities will be hesitant to publish their findings until they have obtained IP ...|$|R
