50|$|The V251 is {{somewhat}} awkward {{to play as}} the neck is wider at the <b>nut</b> <b>end</b> than at the body, and a player's natural tendency to bend a string results in it slipping off the divided fret. Additionally it is very heavy, weighing, nearly 9 lbs.|$|E
50|$|Bolts use a {{wide variety}} of head designs, as do screws. These are {{designed}} to engage with the tool used to tighten them. Some bolt heads instead lock the bolt in place, so that it does not move and a tool is only needed for the <b>nut</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For guitars, {{some players}} feel that smaller radii (7.25-10") are more {{comfortable}} for chord and rhythm playing, while larger radii (12"-16" [...] and up to flat) are better for fast soloing. Conical and compound radius fingerboards try to merge both these features. The <b>nut</b> <b>end</b> of the fingerboard has a smaller radius to ease in forming chords. The bridge end of the fingerboard has a larger radius to make soloing more comfortable and prevent [...] "noting out" [...] ("fretting out"), in which a string comes in contact with a higher fret during bends.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a splined hub to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the <b>nut</b> <b>end.</b> These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely.|$|E
40|$|The paper reveals one of {{possible}} methods for higher productivity {{and reliability of}} building self-propelled pneumopunchers which are intended for making holes in soil while using trenchless method and constructing various engineering communications under car, tram and rail lines, airport runways. A new design of building pneumopuncher with increased productivity due to higher speed for hole formation in soil and its reliability has been presented in the paper. A formula for determination of displacement increment for a new pneumopuncher {{in comparison with the}} conventional one has been obtained in the paper. The paper describes a design and operation principal of the building self-propelled pneumopuncher which is equipped with a locking mechanism with the purpose to neutralize action of soil elastic forces and reactive repulsive force. The locking mechanism keeps the pneumopuncher in the hole. The pneumopuncher consists of a body with anvil, movable hammer, a manifold which is set in axial deepening of the hammer, a nut and a locking mechanism. Improvement of operational pneumopuncher reliability is attained {{due to the fact that}} the locking mechanism is made in the form of two coaxially positioned inner and outer cups having a common basis. A piston is installed in the middle of the inner cup, a spring is fixed over the piston and a rod with a breaking shoe is positioned at the end. Height of the inner cup is less the outer cup height and there is an annular cavity between them which is connected with a chamber. The chamber is formed by the piston, the inner cup and the manifold. The annular cavity through an opening in the inner cup wall, two sylphons, a channel in the <b>nut</b> <b>end</b> and an opening in the vertical wall of the manifold are connected with a chamber of operating stroke. The sylphons are placed between the outer cup and the nut, between the nut and the manifold. Differential equations for movement of pneumopuncher in soil have been compiled. While solving the equations a formula for determination of increase in displacement of the pneumopuncher with the locking mechanism and without it has been obtained in the paper. </p...|$|E
40|$|The SM- 2 core {{lifetime}} {{was calculated}} and stuck rod criteria formulated. The control system could shutdown the core {{under the most}} adverse conditions with any single rod stuck out. The one-half-inch Eu/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / flux supressors adequately supressed the power spike {{at the bottom of}} the core. The nuclear effects of increasing the dimensione of the fuel matrix were calculated. A new analysis of various reactivity measuremerts performed durirg the SM- 2 critical experiments was made to test the validity of the calculational modes. Twodimensional temperature distributions for the stainless steel vessel shell and flange and for the SM- 2 control rod plates were plotted. The loss of flow experiment was completed on the SM- 1 at Fort Belvoir, and the results agreed with analytical predictions. The SM- 2 fuel element, control rod, core support structure, and vessel designs were completed. Three steel mills indicated they could supply low cobalt, low tantalum type 347 stainless steel. Corrosion testing of irradiated boron-stainless steel was reactivated. Corrosion and impact testing of <b>nut</b> <b>end</b> bolting materials was scheduled. Dysprosium oxide was considered as an alternate absorber material. Two modified SM- 2 fuel aesemblies were fabricated for testing in the Westinghouse Test Reactor loop, and two fuel elements were fabricated for insertion in the SM- 1 core. Work on controlled addition of a burnable poison, such as ZrB/sub 2 /, in fuel plates was continued. Procedures for welding fuel plates to side plates were completed. Automatic weld sequence timing was adopted for improvirg product quality. Pressure losses through the complete flow circuit in the reactor were recalculated and the pressure drop analysis brought up to date. Good flow distribution in the control rod fuel element was obtained in a single element rig. Methods of temperature regulation and corrosion control were established. Extended SM- 2 critical experiments were initiated. Core support design modifications necessary for an accurate flow. divider mockup were completed. Effects of flux suppression upon reactivity and neutron flux {{at the bottom of the}} core were measured. Gamma dose rates were measured over the core support plate and along the control rod basket guide. Prototype testing of the control rod drive mechanism was started. The blocked channel method of measuring fuel element internal temperature in SM- 2 Core I instrumental fuel assembly was selected as the reference design. (M. C. G. ...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of 4 th International Conference on Fracture Fatigue and Wear, FFW 2015, Ghent University, Belgium, 27 - 28 August 2015 The high {{strength}} {{bolts and nuts}} are widely used in various fields. In this study the effect of slight pitch difference is considered when the nut pitch is αμm larger than the bolt pitch. In the first place, the fatigue experiment is conducted with varying pitch difference. The {{results show that the}} fatigue life is extended to about 1. 5 times by introducing the suitable pitch difference under the high stress amplitude. Next, the detail observation is performed on the fractured specimens including the fractured positions and the crack configurations. It is found that the fractured positions and the crack distributions vary depending on the pitch difference. Finally, to clarify the improvement mechanism of the fatigue strength, the finite element method is applied to calculate the stress amplitude and mean stress at each bolt threads, and the incomplete threads at the <b>nut</b> <b>ends</b> are also considered to obtain the accurate analytical results...|$|R

50|$|A nut, on a {{stringed}} musical instrument, is a {{small piece}} of hard material that supports the strings at the end closest to the headstock or scroll. The <b>nut</b> marks one <b>end</b> of the vibrating length of each open string, sets the spacing of the strings across the neck, and usually holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard. Along with the bridge, the nut defines the vibrating lengths (scale lengths) of the open strings.|$|R

Unions are a type of very compact flange connector.|$|R
50|$|A lap steel guitar's strings {{are raised}} {{at both the}} <b>nut</b> and bridge <b>ends</b> of the fingerboard, {{typically}} to about half an inch. The strings are too high to contact {{the surface of the}} neck, so frets, if present, are only for reference and are often replaced by markers. Some lap steel guitars can be converted between lap and fretted playing, or are modified versions of conventional guitars—the only difference is usually string height. Round-necked resonator guitars set up for steel playing fall into this category.|$|R

2500|$|Vettel {{achieved}} {{his second}} consecutive pole position in Australia, while Webber qualified in second position. Technical problems plagued Vettel {{for a second}} consecutive race when a loose wheel <b>nut</b> <b>ended</b> his challenge while leading. Webber had to stay on track longer as Vettel pitted for dry tyres, and finished in ninth position after a late-race incident with Lewis Hamilton. In Malaysia the Red Bull drivers scored a dominant 1-2 finish, with Vettel winning. In China they took {{the front row of}} the starting grid, but rain affected the race and they finished in sixth and eighth positions. In Spain Webber won the race with teammate Vettel finishing third after a major brake problem in the last 8 laps. In Monte Carlo Webber again took pole position and dominated the race. Sebastian Vettel passed Robert Kubica's Renault on lap one and remained in second position {{for the remainder of the}} race distance, completing Red Bull's second 1-2 of the season. In Turkey Webber claimed pole again in qualifying, while Vettel managed third, behind Lewis Hamilton. In the race, Vettel managed to overtake Hamilton during pit stops to be in second place for much of the race. Webber and Vettel were on course for Red Bull's third 1-2 of the 2010 season, until lap 40 when Vettel and Webber crashed into each other as a result of an attempted overtake by Vettel. The crash forced Vettel out of the race and put an end to Webber's chance of victory. The race ended in a McLaren 1-2 instead of a Red Bull 1-2, with Hamilton winning and Jenson Button coming in second. Webber eventually finished in third place. Webber managed to hold on to first place in the Drivers' Championship, with a five-point lead over second placed Button. Vettel however slipped to fifth place. Red Bull also surrendered first place in the Constructors' Championship to McLaren, albeit being behind by only one point. In Canada they finished 4th and 5th and are now 22 points behind. In Valencia, Vettel won his first race since Malaysia while Webber had a spectacular accident where he collided with Heikki Kovalainen and flipped over at [...] and hit an advertising board, escaping unhurt from the incident.|$|R

60|$|In {{the morning}} {{he ran to the}} nearest stream to wash himself, but to his horror, when he caught sight of his face, he saw his nose had grown the colour of an apple, and reached nearly to his waist. He started back {{thinking}} he was dreaming, and put up his hand; but, alas! the dreadful thing was true. 'Oh, why does not some wild beast devour me?' he cried to himself; 'never, never, can I go again amongst my fellow-men! If only the sea had swallowed me up, how much happier it had been for me!' And he hid {{his head in his hands}} and wept. His grief was so violent, that it exhausted him, and growing hungry he looked about for something to eat. Just above him was a bough of ripe, brown <b>nuts,</b> <b>end</b> he picked them and ate a handful. To his surprise, as he was eating them, he felt his nose grow shorter and shorter, and after a while he ventured to feel it with his hand, and even to look in the stream again! Yes, there was no mistake, it was as short as before, or perhaps a little shorter. In his joy at this discovery Tiidu did a very bold thing. He took one of the apples out of his pocket, and cautiously bit a piece out of it. In an instant his nose was as long as his chin, and in a deadly fear lest it should stretch further, he hastily swallowed a nut, and awaited the result with terror. Supposing that the shrinking of his nose had only been an accident before! Supposing that that nut and no other was able to cause its shrinking! In that case he had, by his own folly, in not letting well alone, ruined his life completely. But, no! he had guessed rightly, for in no more time than his nose had taken to grow long did it take to return to its proper size. 'This may make my fortune,' he said joyfully to himself; and he gathered some of the apples, which he put into one pocket, and a good supply of nuts which he put into the other. Next day he wove a basket out of some rushes, so that if he ever left the island he might be able to carry his treasures about.|$|R
50|$|A {{push nut}} resembles a toothed washer, {{commonly}} fabricated in metal. These are installed by pressing onto {{the end of}} a grooved shaft, until the nut's inner teeth snap into the groove. The use of push nuts avoids the cost of threading a <b>nut</b> onto the <b>end</b> of the shaft during the manufacturing process. However, a push nut once installed is normally destroyed in the removal process, which potentially prevents removal of mechanisms captive to the shaft for replacement or servicing without having the correct replacement push nut on hand—if the part number and specification for the push nut is even known—and possibly also requires a specialized pressing tool to conform with manufacturer's guidance.|$|R

50|$|An {{adjustable}} {{hand reamer}} can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining <b>nuts</b> at each <b>end</b> varies the size {{that may be}} cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a clamping hole, each straight tooth will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position. This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to size a hole.|$|R
