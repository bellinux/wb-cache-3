40|$|Accompanying {{infrastructure}} {{improvements and}} networking technology innovation, {{the development of}} digital home service industry has gotten more and more attention. However, the digital home service levels have not sufficiently met rising demand from users. Therefore, it is urgent to propose and develop new service modes for the digital home. Geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> can provide various spatial <b>information</b> <b>services</b> such as map search, spatial information query. It has become an inevitable trend to implement geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the digital home. This paper proposes three new geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> modes for the digital home after sufficient requirement analysis: pushed <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode, interactive <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode, personalized <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode. The key technologies to implement geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> on digital televisions are studied, involving digital television middleware technology, network transmission technology and visualization technology. According to the service modes’ characteristics mentioned above, a service system in the digital home is established to implement geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> {{on the basis of}} digital television. The implementation of geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the digital home not only enriches the digital home services content, but also promotes geographic information from specialization to public popularity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a market}} where {{the provision of}} <b>information</b> <b>service</b> is costly, but <b>information</b> <b>service</b> has {{the characteristics of a}} public good. Consumers, on the other hand, can use the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> to make an informed purchase decision and derive higher utility from consuming their ideal product. However, after receiving the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> from an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider, consumers can easily free ride by purchasing at low-price sellers who do not provide any <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> The paper examines the competition where sellers compete by providing <b>information</b> <b>service</b> for horizontally differentiated products and where technology reduces consumers' search cost. It is found that in this market a seller needs to establish itself as an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider in order to make positive profits, even when there is free riding. A seller, however, cannot make positive profits by free riding all the time. Also, with an increase in competition in the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> market, sellers have reduced incentives to provide <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> It is also found that in this market a decrease in search cost may increase or decrease social welfare. free riding, search cost, electronic markets, electronic commerce...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a {{structured}} literature review, design concepts, and research propositions related to a product-oriented design theory for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Information</b> <b>services</b> facilitate the exchange of information goods with or without transforming these goods. Exemplar <b>information</b> <b>services</b> are e-publishing, electronic communities-of-practice, and management reporting. The importance of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the current economy merits the development of an explicit product- and process-oriented design theory. Design/methodology/approach – This article focuses on the product-oriented design theory by applying Walls et al. 's framework. A product-oriented design theory of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> identifies relevant descriptive and explanatory insights (i. e. content, use, value, and revenue), meta-requirements, and meta-designs. The paper describes design problems for <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> and gives key requirements for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> Next, it describes the information, organizational and information technological components of an <b>information</b> <b>service,</b> and identifies at least four <b>information</b> <b>service</b> architectures. Finally, it gives research hypotheses, research ideas, and discusses practical implications. Findings – The results form a product-oriented design theory for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> The paper gives a structured way for practitioners to analyze <b>information</b> <b>service</b> design challenges, and suggestions are given for requirements and design decisions on three aspects (content, use feature, and revenue). Originality/value – Given the previously fragmented nature of the literature, this paper gives new opportunities for research and practic...|$|R
