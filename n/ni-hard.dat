The jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with replaceable liners which are made of manganese steel, or <b>Ni-hard</b> (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron).

50|$|The Heavy Media Cyclone may be {{lined with}} very high quality ceramic tiles or {{manufactured}} from <b>Ni-hard</b> (a very hard alloy {{of cast iron}} containing nickel) with a specially designed helical profile. A cyclone {{is the heart of}} the washing unit in a Heavy Media Washery. It is a non moving part and hence requires very low maintenance. However, the pressure at the inlet of the cyclone is a very important factor and it is suggested to maintain a minimum pressure of around D x 9 x 9.81 x density/100 (in bars), where D = the inner diameter of the cyclone in mm. It is important to note that the pressure at which pulp (mixture of coal and magnetite) is introduced in the cyclone is the principal means of controlling the forces within the cyclone. With the decrease in pressure more coal shall report to the discard/middlings, thus impairing the efficiency of separation.|$|E

These white irons contain Ni to ensure that the {{austenite}} transforms to martensite following heating and chromium to increase the hardness of the eutectic carbide. <b>Ni-hard</b> irons are normally stress relieved at 200 - 300 °C for approximately four hours to relieve the martensitic transformation stresses and to promote the transformation of retained austenite.

The experiments are performed by 5 rows mechanical precision drilling machine. 8 sets of drill cultures were marked distinctively in order to be recognized later, their initial weighs were taken, and mounted randomly to the mostly used precision drilling machines in Afyon and Bor Sugar Factories. After the finishing of the sowing phase, drill cultures were cleaned and weighed again. The differences between the initial and last weighs were compared by calculation of wear amount according to the unit surface and the distance. As the result of this research: Drill culture blades produced from 27 chromium materials were determined to be 44 % less worn comparing to <b>Ni-hard</b> 4 (1), 61 % to <b>Ni-hard</b> 4 (2), 90 % according to the blades filled with Citadur 600 B and 306 % comparing to the C 1050 wrought iron material...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ni-Hard</b> {{or white}} cast iron is one categorv of high {{combination}} cast iron, having harness of 550 - 690 BHN, drag strength of 27 - 45 kgf, elasticity modulus of 169 - 183 kgf/mm 2, main crystal structure of marthensit. It has perlit matrix after the process of hardening and temper. The making of <b>Ni-Hard</b> is done through a casting process, using Nickel Chromium White Cast Iron or Unalloyed white Cat Iron as the main material.

40|$|The carbide and {{graphite}} {{formation and}} redistribution of alloy elements during solidification were investigated on high-speed steel (HS) and <b>Ni-hard</b> type cast irons with Nb and V. The crystallization of hypereutectic HSS proceeds {{in the order}} of primary MC, γ[*]+[*]MC, γ[*]+[*]M 6 C, γ[*]+[*]M 7 C 3, and γ[*]+[*][*]graphite eutectic, in hypoeutectic alloys proceeds {{in the order of}} primary γ, γ[*]+[*]MC, γ[*]+[*]graphite, γ[*]+[*]M 6 C, and γ[*]+[*]M 7 C 3 eutectic, and in <b>Ni-hard</b> proceeds in the order of primary γ, γ[*]+[*]MC, γ[*]+[*]M 3 C, and γ[*]+[*][*]graphite eutectic. The γ[*]+[*][*]graphite eutectic solidifies with the decrease of V, Nb, and Cr and the increase of Si and C contents in residual liquid during solidification. The behavior in graphite forming tendency in the residual liquid is estimated by the parameter ∑CLimi′. The eutectic graphite crystallizes at the solid fraction when ∑CLimi′ takes a minimum value. The amount of graphite increases with the decrease in ∑CLimi′ of initial alloy content in both specimens. Inoculation with ferrosilicon effectively increases the graphite content in both specimens...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an investigation which was undertaken to reveal the similarities and differences in the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of three <b>Ni-Hard</b> I alloys. One alloy (B 1) is ASTM A 532 class IA <b>Ni-Hard</b> containing 4. 2 wt. pct. Ni. The second alloy (B 2) is similar to B 1 but higher in Cr, Si, and Mo. The third alloy (T 1) also falls in the same ASTM specification, but it contains 3. 3 wt. pct. Ni. The alloys were evaluated in both as-cast and stress-relieved conditions except for B 2, which was evaluated in the stress-relieved condition only. While the matrix of the high Ni alloys is composed of austenite and martensite in both conditions, the matrix of the low Ni alloy consists of a considerable amount of bainite, in addition to the martensite and the retained austenite in as cast condition, and primarily bainite, with some retained austenite, in the stress relieved condition. It was found that the stress relieving treatment does not change the tensile strength of the high Ni alloy. Both the as cast and stress relieved high Ni alloys had a tensile strength of about 350 MPa. On the other hand, the tensile strength of the low Ni alloy increased from 340 MPa to 452 MPa with the stress relieving treatment. There {{was no significant difference in}} the wear resistance of these alloys in both as-cast and stressrelieved conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The CDC (Cast-Decant-Cast) Process is novel {{semi-solid}} {{processing method}} for joining two alloys, allowing {{the production of}} components from two or more alloys. The process produces a functionally gradient material (FGM) which, instead of having a sharp interface between the two alloys, features a transition region exhibiting a smooth gradient in concentration, microstructure and properties. Functionally gradient materials provide engineers with the flexibility to design components with different material properties at different locations. The details of the CDC Process are described. This paper, for the first time, provides information regarding the fabrication of functionally gradient castings from steels, cast irons and cobalt alloys. The first example involves the production of functionally gradient castings from a <b>Ni-Hard</b> cast iron + mild steel. The second example describes the production of functionally gradient castings from Stellite + mild steel. Processing parameters are documented and microstructures of the castings described...|$|E
40|$|Disk {{refining}} {{has become}} an increasingly important process for the manufacture of mechanical pulp {{for the production of}} newsprint and other "groundwood" speciality papers. The history of the development of chip refiners beginning with their use in pulp property modifications in the early 1900 's and their use for semichemical and mechanical pulping processes at present is briefly renewed. [...] Disk refining, as a pulping process, has in spite of its promise to replace chemical pulp not been without its technical difficulties; the major ones being the high energy inputs required as compared to stone groundwood, variations in quality and inadequate plate life. Each of the variables associated with these difficulties is reviewed in an extensive literature review. [...] Since refiner plate wear and refiner plate corrosion both involve loss of plate material and are critical factors in plate life, the review of literature was extended to cover these variables. Although literature on wear and corrosion of refiner plates is extensive, little was found directly pertaining to refiner plate life. Because of this deficiency of information in both these important areas, experimental work was conducted on both the wear and corrosion of <b>Ni-hard</b> refiner plates. [...] The wear of refiner plates run on a Sprout Waldron 42 - 1 B refiner at Price (Nfld.) Pulp and Paper Company Limited, Grand Falls, Newfoundland, was monitored using a systems analytical approach coupled with standard v metallurgical techniques. The refiner plates after use were found to have worn in sharply defined annular zones at randomly defined radii. In each zone the wear was asymmetrical, with one of the opposing plates wearing more than the other. The location of the wear zone and the disk experiencing wear (rotor or stator) were found to be random. [...] At first, it was believed that this unusual wear pattern was the result of plate clashing and/or damage by foreign material. Metallurgical and electrochemical studies of the plates within the framework of systems analysis clearly showed that this was not the case, and that the metal removal patterns observed were indicative of that produced by a process not dissimilar to electrochemical machining. [...] The corrosion characteristics of <b>Ni-Hard</b> plates were analyzed by potentiostatic polarization methods using an intact refiner plate as the working electrode. A potential was impressed upon this electrode causing it to corrode. The resultant current density as a function of applied potential was plotted giving a polarization curve for <b>Ni-Hard.</b> The procedure followed was based upon ASTM Standard Method G 5, modified such that an intact refiner plate could be used. No attempt was made to duplicate the temperature and consistency conditions in the refining zone of a commercial refiner because of the experimental difficulties involved and the fact that these conditions are still not well understood. In spite of this limitation, the results gave some interesting insights into the effect that additives have in extending refiner plate life. Results showed that corrosion rates were lower when dissolved oxygen was high, bringing into question the belief that the role played by Na₂SO₃ in enhancing refiner plate life is via a mechanism of oxygen scavenging. [...] The potential for extending refiner plate life by corrosion control techniques is discussed. These include: [...] 1 [...] control of O₂ content, [...] 2. alloying of plates, [...] 3. anodic protection, [...] 4. cathodic protection...|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous dispersions of fissile and fertile {{material}} in graphite are being currently considered as fuel for high-temperature, gas-cooled nuclear reactors. A possible method of fuel preparation involves compaction of finely ground artificial graphite with U and Th metal powders. Size reduction of artificial graphite is therefore {{of interest in}} the preparation of graphite-fuel compacts. Reactor graphite has been successively size reduced in a jaw crusher, pin disc mill and ball mill to give material 50 % finer than 9 microns, and with a B. E. T. nitrogen adsorption surface area ranging up to 18. 4 m 2 /g. This variables in ball milling have been studied, and in particular it was found that <b>Ni-hard</b> balls gave a faster grinding rate, but a higher contamination than was obtained with steel balls. Leaching with boiling HCI was effective in removing contamination introduced by these grinding media. The Rosin-Rammler function, R = 100 e - (x/x) n applied to the size distributions of the ground graphite. In the size range 70 - 1000 microns the distribution constant "n" equaled 1, which is consistent with publishing data for other materials. However, above and below this size range, the distribution constant approximated 2. This high value of n for the sub-sieve range has not been previously reported, but is not peculiar to artificial graphite as other materials were found to have a similar value of n...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} wear resistance cast steel casting the TiC-Fe-Cr type composite zones were fabricated. These zones were obtained by means of in situ synthesis of substrates of the reaction TiC with a moderator of a chemical composition of white cast iron with nickel of the <b>Ni-Hard</b> type 4. The synthesis was carried out directly in the mould cavity. The moderator was applied to control the reactive infiltration occurring during the TiC synthesis. The microstructure of composite zones was investigated by electron scanning microscopy, using the backscattered electron mode. The structure of composite zones was verified by the X-ray diffraction method. The hardness of composite zones, cast steel base alloy and the reference samples such as white chromium cast iron with 14 % Cr and 20 % Cr, manganese cast steel 18 % Mn was measured by Vickers test. The wear resistance of the composite zone and the reference samples examined by ball-on-disc wear test. Dimensionally stable composite zones were obtained containing submicron sizes TiC particles uniformly distributed in the matrix. The macro and microstructure of the composite zone ensured three times hardness increase {{in comparison to the}} cast steel base alloy and one and a half times increase in comparison to the white chromium cast iron 20 % Cr. Finally ball-on-disc wear rate of the composite zone was five times lower than chromium white cast iron containing 20 % Cr...|$|E
40|$|Wear {{caused by}} {{abrasive}} particles {{is far more}} extensive, when compared with adhesive or normal wear. The effect of a mating surface on the abrasive wear was rarely observed. In practice, however, the wear caused by particles introduced between rubbing surfaces is very important. Combining various materials as rubbing surfaces, the author investigated {{the effect of the}} difference in hardness on wear caused by abrasive particles between them. Bearing steel, stainless steel, high-chromium steel, heat resisting steel castings, <b>Ni-hard</b> and several hard facing alloys were used as the material for the cylindrical testpiece of 8 mm diameter. The mating surface was a disc of bearing steel, carbon steel, phospher bronze or cast iron. Carborundum, alundum, quartz and garnet were experimented with as the abrasive particles. Test results showed clearly the presence of steep peak in the plot of the product of the hardness and the specific wear, i. e. the abraded volume/(load×rubbed distance), against the hardness, when the hardness of both surfaces became nearly equal. This tendency was always observed irrespective {{of the nature of the}} abrasive material, and deviated considerably from the empirical law stating the constancy of the product. The author attempted to explain this fact by observing traces of free particles and embedded particles on the rubbing surfaces by means of an electron microscope. The difference in the embedability of the rubbing surfaces was found to cause the wide deviation of the value of the product. When the hardness of the cylindrical test piece related to its embedability closely approaches to that of the disk, the abrasive action of embedded particles becomes remarkable...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{foundries}} {{have observed}} porosity primarily as interdendritic porosity in large freezing range alloys such as <b>Ni-Hard</b> I and hypoeutectic high Cr alloys or pinholes and fissure defects in gray and ductile irons. For most iron foundries, porosity problems occur sporadically, but even occasional outbreaks {{can be costly}} since even a very small amount of porosity can significantly reduce the mechanical properties of the castings. As a result when porosity is detected, the castings are scrapped and remelted, or when the porosity is undetected, defective parts are shipped to the consumer. Neither case is desirable. This project was designed to examine various factors contributing to the porosity formation in iron castings. Factors such as solubility of gases in liquid and solid iron alloys, surface tension of liquid iron alloys, and permeability of dendritic structures were investigated {{in terms of their}} effect on the porosity formation. A method was developed to predict how much nitrogen the molten alloy picks up from air after a given amount of holding time for a given melting practice. It was shown that small batches of iron melts in an induction furnace can end up with very high concentration of nitrogen (near solubility limit). Surface tension of liquid iron alloys was measured as a function of temperature. Effect of minor additions of S, Ti, and Al on the surface tension of liquid iron alloys was investigated. Up to 18 % change in surface tension was detected by minor element additions. This translates to the same amount of change in gas pressure required in a bubble of a given size to keep the bubble stable. A new method was developed to measure the permeability of dendritic structures in situ. The innovative aspect of these experiments, with respect to previous interdendritic permeability measurements, {{was the fact that the}} dendritic structure was allowed to form in situ and was not cooled and re-heated for permeability tests. A permeability model was developed and tested using the results of the permeability experiments. The permeability model for flow parallel to the columnar dendrites predicted the experimental permeability results closely when the liquid volume fraction data from equilibrium calculations were used. The permeability gradient model was constructed in order to test the impact of interdendritic channel constriction on the flow of liquid through the mushy zone of a casting. The model examines two different regimes: (i) Dendritic solidification regime where the permeability is dominated by changes in liquid volume fraction and dendrite arm spacing, and (ii) Eutectic solidification regime where the permeability is dominated by changes in viscosity of eutectic mixture. It is assumed that the eutectic mixture behaves like a slurry whose viscosity increases with increasing solid fraction. It is envisioned that this model can be developed into a tool that can be very useful for metal casters...|$|E
