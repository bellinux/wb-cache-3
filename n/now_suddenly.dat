5|$|In April 1944, {{tests on}} the first sample of {{plutonium}} that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor-bred plutonium contained five times more plutonium-240 than that hitherto produced in a cyclotrons. This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly. It now became apparent that only implosion would work for practical plutonium bombs; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft, and plutonium-240 was {{even more difficult to}} separate from plutonium-239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving the rest of the Manhattan Project such difficulties. Plutonium was unusable unless implosion worked, but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs. Thus, the implosion technique <b>now</b> <b>suddenly</b> stood as the key to production of nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|This {{favorable}} economic constellation came to {{a rather}} abrupt end around 1670 {{as a consequence of}} two mutually reinforcing economic trends. The first was the rather abrupt closure of major European markets, especially France, for political reasons, as indicated in the previous section. This {{put an end to the}} heretofore secular increase in trade volumes for the Dutch economy. The effect of this stall probably would not have been as serious, but at approximately the same time the secular trend of the price level had reversed from inflation to deflation. The whole of the 16th century, and the first half of the 17th century, had seen a rising price level. This <b>now</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{came to a}}n end, to be replaced by deflationary tendencies that would last into the 1740s. Because of the tendency of nominal wages to be sticky downward, the already high level of real wages in the maritime provinces continued to rise, even though the business cycle went downward. This of course reinforced the trade depression in the short run, but in the longer run it caused a structural realignment of the Dutch economy.|$|E
25|$|Before Robin's funeral, Emma {{stands at}} Hook's grave and cries, {{trying to cope}} {{with the fact that he}} is truly gone <b>now.</b> <b>Suddenly,</b> a wave of magic flies through the air, causing her to stumble. She hears her name called from behind her and turns around and is shocked to see Hook. She happily embraces Hook, who tells her Zeus sent him back as a reward for {{stopping}} Hades. After informing him that Robin is gone, Emma decides to break the news about Hook's return to Regina as delicately as possible. However, when an earthquake occurs, Hook rushes to see if Emma is okay. It turns out the earthquake was caused by Mr. Gold tethering magic to the Olympian Crystal fragment. Emma works with Regina to find it, only to later have Gold explain that Henry used his Author power to steal the crystal to destroy magic (again). Both follow Henry to New York, where it turns out Gold got the crystal back. At the same time, Hook, David, Snow and Zelena are accidentally sucked into another realm, which they could become trapped in without any magic in the Real World. Henry succeeds in destroying magic, only to be later convinced by the Dragon to get enough belief to recharge the crystal. It works and everyone is brought home. Once back in Storybrooke, Emma shares a passionate kiss with Hook.|$|E

500|$|Transcending this [...] "dark {{circumstance}} of composition," [...] Crane had {{a particular}} telos and impetus for his creation: beyond the tautologies that all art is alterity and to some formal extent mimesis, Crane sought and obviously found [...] "a form of catharsis" [...] in writing. This view accounts for his uniqueness, especially as operative through his notorious [...] "disgust" [...] with his family's religion, their [...] "vacuous, futile psalm-singing". His favorite book, for example, was Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, in which God is mentioned only twice—once as irony and once as [...] "a swindle." [...] Not only did Crane call out God specifically with the lines [...] "Well then I hate thee / righteous image" [...] in [...] "The Black Riders" [...] (1895), but even his most hopeful tropes, such as the [...] "comradeship" [...] of his [...] "Open Boat" [...] survivors, make no mention of deity, specifying only [...] "indifferent nature." [...] His antitheism is most evident in his characterization {{of the human race}} as [...] "lice clinging to a space-lost bulb," [...] a climax-nearing speech in [...] "The Blue Hotel," [...] Ch. VI. [...] It is possible that Crane utilized religion's formal psychic space, <b>now</b> <b>suddenly</b> available resulting from the recent [...] "Death of God," [...] as a milieu for his compensative art.|$|E
500|$|British {{timing was}} good. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first {{artificial}} satellite, on 4 October 1957, {{came as a}} tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. <b>Now,</b> <b>suddenly,</b> there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action {{in response to the}} Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis. At the suggestion of Harold Caccia, the British Ambassador to the United States, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge. To do this, the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed. British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958. The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed on 3 July, and was approved by Congress on 30 July. Macmillan called this [...] "the Great Prize".|$|E
2500|$|Paglia and Frank {{have similar}} {{views on the}} {{religious}} references made throughout the poem. The Speaker first states that heaven is deaf to his [...] "bootless [...] cries" [...] (line 2). The [...] "lark at break of day arising" [...] (line 11) symbolizes the Speaker's rebirth to a life where he can now sing [...] "hymns at heaven's gate" [...] (line 12). This creates another contrast in the poem. The once deaf heaven that caused the Speaker's prayers to be unanswered is <b>now</b> <b>suddenly</b> able to hear. Both authors note {{the lack of any}} reference to God and how the Speaker instead speaks only of heaven.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the climb}} of the Col de Peyresourde, Wegmann {{suddenly}} attacked and de la Fuente easily followed {{and beat him}} at the top for the points. Flecha had tried to follow them but came through more than 2 minutes behind at the top. Camano and Voeckler, whose plan {{had not been so}} smart after all, had used up most of their strengths and had been overtaken by the peloton before the top, who were 3 minutes behind at the top with yet again Rasmussen taking the points. Flecha was caught in the descent and on the Col du Portillon Wegmann was also caught; he {{had not been able to}} counter an attack from de la Fuente. On the Portillon something happened in the peloton also, because <b>now</b> <b>suddenly</b> it were the riders from [...] who took over from the guys from AG2R Prévoyance and pumped up the pace.

2500|$|The album also {{received}} criticism for following the musical directions of artists that {{are said to}} have been influenced by Goldfrapp. Andy Gill of The Independent observed that [...] "Goldfrapp <b>now</b> <b>suddenly</b> effect a complete volte-face on Head First, heading back to the electronic pop of their three previous releases", which is [...] "a curious, circuitous trajectory which gives the impression that Goldfrapp are in the invidious position of playing catch-up to all the Gagas, [...] and Little Boots upon whom they must surely have been a major influence." [...] Barry Nicolson of NME commented, [...] "Once the source of pop inspiration, now it seems they're content to follow", concluding that the album is [...] "basically an upbeat electro-pop record with one foot in the '80s, much like roughly 85 per cent of music made in the last two years." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer agreed, stating, [...] "Having pre-empted the wave of womanly electro, they appear now to be behind rather than ahead of the curve", while calling the album [...] "decent but unsurprising".|$|E

2500|$|On 15 May Favourite was sailing {{in company}} with Captain Herbert Sawyer's frigate [...] off Cape St Mary, when a Spanish ship was sighted and chased down. Once {{captured}} {{she was found}} to be the Spanish register ship Hermione, which had sailed from Lima on 6 January bound for Cadiz with a valuable cargo of bags of dollars, gold coin, ingots of gold and silver, cocoa, and blocks of tin. The Hermione was taken into Gibraltar and eventually condemned as a prize, with her contents, hull, and fittings valued at £519,705 10s. 0d., approximately £ at today's prices. Pownoll and Sawyer each received captain's shares of the prize money of £64,872, approximately £ at today's prices, amounting to one of the largest individual sums obtained in the period. The ordinary seamen received £480 each, equivalent to thirty years' wages. Coincidentally Sawyer and Pownoll had been courting two sisters, the daughters of a Lisbon merchant, but had been rejected for their lack of funds. <b>Now</b> <b>suddenly</b> extremely wealthy, the two captains married the sisters. Pownoll used his money to buy an estate at Sharpham in the parish of Ashprington in Devon, where he built a large mansion house, surviving today, designed by Robert Taylor, with gardens designed by Capability Brown. It was about this time that he commissioned a portrait from Sir Joshua Reynolds.|$|E
