50|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} standard IEEE 802.11 was released in 1997 and clarified in 1999, but is now obsolete. It specified two <b>net</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> of 1 or 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s), plus forward error correction code. It specified three alternative physical layer technologies: diffuse infrared operating at 1 Mbit/s; frequency-hopping spread spectrum operating at 1 Mbit/s or 2 Mbit/s; and direct-sequence spread spectrum operating at 1 Mbit/s or 2 Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used microwave transmission over the Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band at 2.4 GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the U.S. 900 MHz ISM band.|$|R

In the laboratory, we demonstrate 10 -channel wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) point-to-point transmission over 2000 km on a 150 -GHz WDM grid, and 1200 -km optically routed networking including 6 recon-figurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) on a 100 -GHz grid. We then report transmission over the commercial, 50 -GHz spaced long-haul optical transport platform LambdaXtreme®. In a straight-line laboratory testbed, we demonstrate single-channel 700 -km transmission, including an intermediate ROADM. On a field-deployed, live traffic bearing Verizon installation between Tampa and Miami, Florida, we achieve 500 -km transmission, with no changes to the commercial system hardware or software and with 6 dB system margin. On the same operational system, we finally demonstrate 100 -Gb/s DQPSK encoding on a field-pro-grammable gate array (FPGA) and the transmission of real-time video traffic.

25|$|The <b>net</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the Ethernet 100Base-TX {{physical}} layer standard is 100Mbit/s, while the gross bitrate is 125Mbit/second, {{due to the}} 4B5B (four bit over five bit) encoding. In this case, the gross bit rate {{is equal to the}} symbol rate or pulse rate of 125megabaud, due to the NRZI line code.|$|E
25|$|In {{communications}} technologies without forward {{error correction}} and other physical layer protocol overhead, there is no distinction between gross bit rate and physical layer <b>net</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> For example, the net as well as gross bit rate of Ethernet 10Base-T is 10Mbit/s. Due to the Manchester line code, each bit is represented by two pulses, resulting in a pulse rate of 20megabaud.|$|E
40|$|Successful {{transmission}} of live (real time) video traffic is demonstrated using a prototype 100 Gb/s single-polarization differential quadrature {{phase shift keying}} (DQPSK) transmitter and receiver over an in-service 504 km link of the LambdaXtreme ® optical transport platform. Teaming with Verizon Business, we demonstrate the feasibility of upgrading an existing, live traffic bearing network to 100 Gb/s per wavelength without any changes to the current hardware or software. The 107 Gb/s signal is added at a reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) at a network node in Tampa, Florida, and dropped at a ROADM in Miami, Florida, where both live video and pseudorandom test sequences are received. In addition, we discuss the steps leading up to this field trial that included several important precursor laboratory experiments.

30|$|In the figures, FDASH shows a slow {{increase}} in <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and stably maintains the appropriate <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> after reaching it.

The proposed scheme quickly reaches a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and maintains this <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{sum up the}} results, FDASH {{maintains}} the appropriate <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and shows a low number of <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes. However, it requests a low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment until the client buffer reaches the target buffer level, so clients {{have to wait a}} long time to watch high-quality video. SARA reaches a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> faster than other methods. However, it consumes client buffers quickly by requiring segments with an excessively high <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> The proposed scheme reaches a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> faster than FDASH, and it {{maintains the}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> longer than SARA after reaching the <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> In addition, it usually shows a small quality variation.|$|R
25|$|Goodput or data {{transfer}} rate refers to the achieved average <b>net</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> that is delivered to the application layer, exclusive of all protocol overhead, data packets retransmissions, etc. For example, {{in the case of}} file transfer, the goodput corresponds to the achieved file transfer rate. The file transfer rate in bit/s can be calculated as the file size (in bytes) divided by the file transfer time (in seconds) and multiplied by eight.|$|E
2500|$|In modems and {{wireless}} systems, link adaptation (automatic adaption {{of the data}} rate and the modulation and/or error coding scheme to the signal quality) is often applied.

30|$|In those {{simulation}} results, FDASH requests many segments {{at a low}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{until the}} target buffer level is reached. After reaching the target buffer level, the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the next segment gradually increases. In Fig.  6, the FDASH client requests the segment of 1500  kbps at 73  s for the first time, which is the 34 th request, while the proposed scheme requests a segment of 1500  kbps at 18  s for the first time, which is the 7 th request. In other words, the FDASH client has to wait 136  s (34 [*]×[*]D) to view the video at 1500  kbps. The SARA increases the client buffer level quickly by requesting many low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segments and requests a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment {{when there is a}} sufficient buffer level. However, because it requests an excessively high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment, the download time for the segment is too long and the client buffer is quickly consumed. This causes an abrupt decrease in the segment <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> Moreover, since the SARA method increases the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> step by step from the low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> following an abrupt reduction in the <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes frequently. In addition, although FDASH and SARA show small variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> increases, they generally show large variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> decreases. On the other hand, the proposed scheme shows a small variation in both the increases and decreases in <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> according to the characteristics of the training data.|$|R

30|$|In Figs.  10 and 11, {{which are}} the results in the two Wi-Fi environments, FDASH shows the lowest average <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> {{although}} its number of <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes is smallest.

However, it shows {{the largest number of}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes, and its variation in <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is also the largest. The proposed scheme shows a similar number of changes as FDASH. In addition, the proposed scheme shows the smallest variation and the highest average <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of all the schemes evaluated. Thus, it is clearly shown that the proposed method appropriately meets each element of a given QoE matrix.|$|R

The <b>net</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is lower due to the addition of forward error correction codes. The eight signal levels are selected {{with the use of}} a trellis encoder. There are also similar modulations 2VSB, 4VSB, and 16VSB. 16VSB was notably intended to be used for ATSC digital cable, but quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) has become the de facto industry standard instead as it is cheap and readily available.|$|E
