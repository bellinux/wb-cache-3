However, the government also stated that it could do <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> support the project. The museum continued on private donations and the efforts of Guati Rojo’s work.

Otho is devastated and appeals to Agrippina, Poppaea, and Nero for support, but they all reject him, leaving him in bewilderment and despair ("Otton, qual portentoso fulmine" [...] followed by [...] "Voi che udite il mio lamento").|$|E
500|$|By 1829–30, Verdi had {{established}} himself as a leader of the Philharmonic: [...] "none of us could rival him" [...] reported the secretary of the organisation, Giuseppe Demaldè. An eight-movement cantata, I deliri di Saul, based on a drama by Vittorio Alfieri, was written by Verdi when he was 15 and performed in Bergamo. It was acclaimed by both Demaldè and Barezzi, who commented: [...] "He shows a vivid imagination, a philosophical outlook, and sound judgment in the arrangement of instrumental parts." [...] In late 1829, Verdi had completed his studies with Provesi, who declared that he had <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> teach him. At the time, Verdi had been giving singing and piano lessons to Barezzi's daughter Margherita; by 1831, they were unofficially engaged.|$|E

500|$|It was revealed, {{a quarter}} century after the war, that Benjamin and Davis had agreed for the {{secretary}} to act as scapegoat rather than reveal the shortage of arms. Not knowing this, the Richmond Examiner accused Benjamin of [...] "stupid complacency". Diarist Mary Chestnut recorded, [...] "the mob calls him Mr. Davis's pet Jew". The Wise family never forgave Benjamin, {{to the detriment of}} his memory in Southern eyes. The general's son, Captain Jennings Wise, fell at Roanoke Island, and Henry's grandson John Wise, interviewed in 1936, told Meade that [...] "the fat Jew sitting at his desk" [...] was to blame. Another of the general's sons, also named John Wise, wrote a highly popular book about the South in the Civil War, The End of an Era (1899), in which he said that Benjamin [...] "had more brains and less heart than any other civic leader in the South... The Confederacy and its collapse were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> Judah P. Benjamin than last year's birds nest." ...|$|E

[...] Gomersall himself {{did little to}} {{disassociate}} himself from those claims, famously referring to the only two matches under his control won by New South Wales rugby league team; [...] "Surely anyone's entitled to two bad games".

[...] He plays with gender roles (20), comments on political events (124), makes fun of love (128), speaks openly about sexual desire (129), parodies beauty (130) and even references pornography (151).
