5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Fauxlivia and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) investigate {{reports of a}} Fringe event in the Rosencrantz building, and speak with Derek, who tells them he has <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> {{anything out of the}} ordinary. The two leave, and Derek is left paging sadly through a photo album filled with pictures of him and his late wife and their daughters.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who had <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly {{over the edge of}} the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-14b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{in orbit around}} the primary star of the binary Kepler-14 system. It is {{currently}} the only planet known to exist in this star system. Kepler-14b is 8.4 times the mass of Jupiter and has a radius 1.14 times that of Jupiter, and it orbits its host star every 6.79 days. It was discovered by NASA-led Kepler mission, which noted the planet as a planetary candidate as early as March 2009, {{around the same time}} as the discovery of the first five planets discovered by Kepler (Kepler-4b to Kepler-8b). However, the team was unable to confirm the planet until extensive follow-up observations, as high-resolution imaging resolved the star Kepler-14 as a closely orbiting binary system. The Kepler team would have <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> that Kepler-14 was a binary star based solely on initial radial velocity measurements (a standard method for confirming a planet's existence), and found that if they had not realized this, their data on Kepler-14b would have been very inaccurate.|$|E

25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, the {{interest}} in analysis situs did not stay unnoticed. However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one discussed in this article was not yet evident. Piers Bohl, a Latvian mathematician, applied topological methods to the study of differential equations. In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was <b>not</b> <b>noticed.</b>|$|E

25|$|Catalase was <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> until 1818 when Louis Jacques Thénard, who {{discovered}} H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), suggested its breakdown {{is caused by}} an unknown substance. In 1900, Oscar Loew {{was the first to}} give it the name catalase, and found it in many plants and animals. In 1937 catalase from beef liver was crystallised by James B. Sumner and Alexander Dounce and the molecular weight was found in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks and Romans had <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the {{magnitudes}} of {{the relative}} frequencies of the games of chance. For centuries, chance was discussed in Europe with no mathematical foundation {{and it was only}} in the 16th century that Italian mathematicians began to discuss the outcomes of games of chance as ratios. In his 1565 Liber de Lude Aleae (a gambler's manual published after his death) Gerolamo Cardano wrote one of the first formal tracts to analyze the odds of winning at various games.|$|E
25|$|The {{shelling}} of Port Gregory {{took place}} on 28 January 1943 during World War II. The attack was conducted by the Japanese submarine I-165 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Commander Tatenosuke Tosu as part of the attempts to divert Allied attention away from the evacuation of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. None of the ten shells fired at Port Gregory caused any damage, and the attack was <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> by the Allied naval authorities until a radio signal sent by Tosu was intercepted and decoded a week later.|$|E

25|$|The Metaphysics (anachronistic Greek title: Θεοφράστου τῶν μετὰ τὰ φυσικά), in nine {{chapters}} (also {{known as}} On First Principles), {{was considered a}} fragment of a larger work by Usener in his edition (Theophrastos, Metaphysica, Bonn, 1890), but according to Ross and Fobes in their edition (Theophrastus, Metaphysica, Oxford, 1929), the treatise is complete (p.X) and this opinion is now widely accepted. There {{is no reason for}} assigning this work to some other author because it is <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> in Hermippus and Andronicus, especially as Nicolaus of Damascus had already mentioned it.|$|E
25|$|The AAIB {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator gust lock became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the overrun area could not be made. The re-engagement of the gust lock was made possible by the condition of the gust lock lever gate plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.|$|E
25|$|One {{downside}} to the panel-rib construction was <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> until the aircraft {{had been in}} service for some time. Because the panels were glued together, they formed a liquid-tight bond, unlike conventional systems using rivets. Instead of using a separate tank to hold fuel, builders simply drilled holes in the ribs to interconnect the sections to form a tank. In service, {{it was found that}} leaks inevitably developed due to problems like improper seals and natural flexing of the wing. BedeCorp later redesigned the wing to use a more conventional system with separate fuel tanks in the BD-4C.|$|E

25|$|Air traffic {{controllers}} had <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the disappearance from radar. Emergency services only {{became aware of}} the accident after 15minutes and did not know the circumstances for nearly an hour. First on the scene was a nurse living nearby, who had been alerted by the boys, and an ambulance crew that happened to be driving past. A male passenger who had survived the accident was discovered in the aircraft cabin, but died on arrival at Ashford Hospital without recovering consciousness. A young girl was also found alive but died at the scene; there were no other survivors. Altogether, 30 ambulances and 25 fire engines attended the accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{permit for}} the {{overhaul}} was found, {{but not the}} other permit stating that the pump must not be started under any circumstances due to the missing safety valve. The valve was in a different location from the pump and therefore the permits were stored in different boxes, as they were sorted by location. None of those present were aware that {{a vital part of}} the machine had been removed. The manager assumed from the existing documents that it would be safe to start Pump A. The missing valve was <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> by anyone, particularly as the metal disc replacing the safety valve was several metres above ground level and obscured by machinery.|$|E
25|$|So {{completely}} absorbed was {{the attention}} of the twelve pounder Battery No. 6, which stood in a somewhat isolated position, by the contest in Saint-Amand-la-Haye, which it covered by its fire, that it had <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> the stealthy advance of a Troop of the French horsemen, wearing the uniform of the Light Artillery of the Guard, and most unexpectedly found itself attacked in flank by these bold adventurers. This give rise to a curious scene, for the Prussian Gunners, in the first moment of surprise, could only defend themselves with their rammers and handspikes; but with these they plied the intruders with so much adroitness and resolution as to hurl their leaders to the ground, and force the remainder to hasty flight.|$|E

25|$|On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White {{was trying}} {{to break up a}} group of late revelers {{shooting}} at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone. He attempted to confiscate the pistol of Curly Bill Brocius and was shot in the abdomen. Wyatt Earp buffaloed Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt told his biographer many years later that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time and had <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> that Brocius' pistol was already on the ground. The pistol contained only one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. White died two days after his shooting, changing Brocius' charge to murder.|$|E
25|$|Miss Peake, {{suffering}} hysterics, {{has been}} helped upstairs. Clarissa has been fed {{a glass of}} brandy and has now recovered and, after closing the recess door to hide the unpleasant sight of the body, the police question all the people separately. Elgin {{and his wife have}} returned early from their night off as she was ill and he testifies to hearing Clarissa talking to Costello of blackmail. During the questioning of Jeremy, the Inspector finds the gloves used to move Costello that were hurriedly hidden in the drawing room by the three men when the police arrived. He also finds one of the playing cards from the pack dropped accidentally by Pippa earlier (In Act I when playing patience) and whose absence was <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> by Clarissa when setting up the false bridge game.|$|E
25|$|There {{were only}} {{thirteen}} monks besides the prior {{at the time}} of the dissolution; eleven canons and two lay brothers; in the early days there were probably more, though never a very large number. Between the years 1223 and 1275 only twenty-five admissions to the novitiate are recorded, and thirteen deaths; but the entries were perhaps not always made with equal care, and the entrance of lay brothers was <b>not</b> <b>noticed</b> at all. Besides the religious there were a number of other inmates of the priory; a 'new house for the carpenters and wheelwrights within the court' was built in 1250; there was accommodation also for the chaplains of the monastery, and for boarders who had bought corrodies, as well as pensioners in the almonry. The porter of the great gate was sometimes a secular, unlike the custom of Benedictine houses.|$|E
