40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found {{beneficial}} effects of aromatherapy massage for agitation in people with dementia, for pain relief and for poor sleep. Children with autism often have sleep difficulties, and {{it was thought that}} aromatherapy massage might enable more rapid sleep onset, less sleep disruption and longer sleep duration. Twelve children with autism and learning difficulties (2 girls and 10 boys aged between 12 years 2 months to 15 years 7 months) in a residential school participated in a within subjects repeated measures design: 3 <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> the children were given aromatherapy massage with lavender oil were compared with 14 <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> it was not given. The children were checked every 30 min throughout the night to determine the time taken for the children to settle to sleep, the number of awakenings and the sleep duration. One boy’s data were not analyzed owing to lengthy absence. Repeated measures analysis revealed no differences in any of the sleep measures between the <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> the children were given aromatherapy massage and <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> the children were not given aromatherapy massage. The results suggest that the use of aromatherapy massage with lavender oil has no beneficial effect on the sleep patterns of children with autism attending a residential school. It is possible that there are greater effects in the home environment or with longer-term interventions...|$|R

The North Korean forces repeatedly attacked US lines at <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at <b>night</b> <b>when</b> other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
