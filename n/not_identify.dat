5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein {{produced}} a similar substance, but could <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Boinik (German name of Bajmócska) village of Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia). Klaproth {{found that it}} contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{formally}} {{described and}} named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> a type specimen, {{but the one}} specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E

5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall {{the words of the}} first line of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% of respondents said they liked the anthem.|$|E
5|$|In late 1261 Breton {{is noted}} as owing £120 {{in the royal}} records. A {{notation}} next to the debt implies {{that he was a}} canon of Hereford Cathedral at this point, but the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300 does <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> him as such. Breton does not appear in the records from this point until after the Battle of Evesham in 1265, when he is noted as holding a grant of royal safeguarding.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|The XLVI Motorised Corps {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating, and all aircraft of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group had been destroyed. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to suspicions {{that he was an}} Ustaše sympathiser, but could <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> a suitable replacement.|$|E

5|$|The house {{owes its}} name {{to the fact that it}} was {{formerly}} mistakenly identified with the Abbey’s tribunals, where secular justice was administered for Glaston Twelve Hides. The name may have been first used by John Collinson in his History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset in 1791, however whwen investigated by Richard Warner in 1826 he could <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> where the name had originated. It was also thought to be the site of trials by Judge Jeffreys for the Bloody Assizes after the Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E

Consciousness of membership within a greater Polish or Czech nation spread slowly in Silesia.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> Manning as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources such}} as the Manchester Mercury name Byrom as the sponsor of the building, they do <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> his architect. The church was described by the English author and historian Clare Hartwell as being the first significant building in Manchester to be constructed in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. It had galleries supported by slender cast-iron columns. The foundation stone was laid by Edward Byrom on 28 April 1768 and Keene performed the consecration on 7 July 1769, when the sermon was given by John Byrom's friend, John Clayton. Construction of the tower, which contained a peal of eight bells manufactured by Lester and Pack, was completed in May 1770.|$|E
5|$|An American Museum of Natural History {{expedition}} led by Sydney Anderson {{collected the}} first three specimens of Oecomys sydandersoni in 1964 and 1965. The material was mentioned in passing in {{a report on the}} chiggers of the region and tentatively identified as O.concolor in publications of the 1990s. During studies in the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) from 1997 to 2006, Smithsonian zoologist Louise Emmons and coworkers obtained large series of Oecomys, including four species—Oecomys bicolor, Oecomys roberti, Oecomys trinitatis, and a fourth species they could <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> to species level. In 2009, Michael Carleton, Louise Emmons, and Guy Musser described the latter as a new species, Oecomys sydandersoni, referring to it the specimens collected in the 1960s and previously identified as O.concolor. They named the new species after Sydney Anderson in honor of his work on the Bolivian mammal fauna, including the first collection of O.sydandersoni.|$|E
5|$|From {{the same}} site where T.goodmani was found, Samonds also {{recorded}} the distal (far) end of a Triaenops humerus (upper arm bone), with a width of 3.58mm. This bone was similar to humeri of T.menamena, but she did <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> it as either species {{because of the small}} size difference between T.menamena and T.goodmani. In site NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), two Triaenops mandibles were recorded, one with p4 and m1 and another with m1–2 and part of m3. Relative to living Triaenops and Paratriaenops, m1 in those jaws is longer and narrower. Although sample sizes are small, the measurements do not resemble those of T.goodmani. In addition, the ridge between the entoconid and metaconid is stronger than in T.goodmani. Samonds identified these jaws only as Triaenops.|$|E

5|$|In 1192, the Chronicle of Mann {{records that}} Ragnall {{and his sons}} were {{defeated}} in a particularly bloody battle against Áengus. The chronicle does <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> {{the location of the}} battle, or elaborate under what circumstances it was fought. However, {{it is possible that the}} conflict took place in the northern part of the meic Somairle domain, where some of Áengus' lands may have lain. Although the hostile contact between Ragnall and Áengus could have been result of Ragnall's rise in power at Dubgall's expense, the clash of 1192 may also mark Ragnall's downfall.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia's 2000 census {{reported}} 2,411,503 citizens (1.20 {{percent of}} the total population) as ethnic Chinese. An additional 93,717 (0.05 percent) ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were reported as foreign citizens, mostly those of the People's Republic of China and Republic of China, who {{may not be able to}} pay the cost of becoming an Indonesian citizen. Because the census employed the method of self-identification, those who refused to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese, or had assumed the identity of other ethnic groups, were recorded as non-Chinese. It is also likely that some did <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> themselves for fear of repercussions in the wake of anti-Chinese violence in 1998, as several census stated that there are around 6 to 7 millions Chinese living in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of {{obtrusive}} polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would <b>not</b> <b>identify</b> the class of ship.|$|E
