In Munster, if the third syllable of a word is stressed and the preceding two syllables are short, the first of the two unstressed syllables is <b>not</b> <b>reduced</b> to schwa; instead it receives a secondary stress, e.g. [...] ('scythe-man'). Also in Munster, an unstressed short vowel is <b>not</b> <b>reduced</b> to schwa if the following syllable contains a stressed [...] or , e.g. [...] ('art'), [...] ('gather').

However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> teenage pregnancy.

Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E

5|$|Added to {{the state}} highway system in 1933, and defined in 1935, Route198 {{extended}} from US 80 onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR94 by 1938. In 1947, the San Diego County Highway Development Association requested that the highway from Sixth Avenue in Mission Valley to US 80 be constructed as a freeway. Although state senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal in July 1953 because he believed {{that it would be}} too expensive and would <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> congestion in the long-term, especially around the junction with US 80 in Grossmont, approval for the Route 94 freeway extended to the junction with U.S. Route 80 (US80) by October, with the Grossmont part of the route signed as Route 67. The Route 67 freeway was completed in March 1957, from Campo Road and Route 94 to US 80; the project was completed for $1,625,000.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E

Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention.

In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} the price and format, looking for a {{profitable}} combination. Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of Wonder Stories. With the November 1930 issue Wonder Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications Thrilling Wonder remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called denatonium benzoate, known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The bittering agent is thought to stop ingestion {{as part of the}} human defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> reported cases of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age of}} 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts to kill themselves. These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or inadvertent exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E
5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does <b>not</b> <b>reduce</b> the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E
