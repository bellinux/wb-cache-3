25|$|Within the novels, {{opponents of}} the Culture {{have argued that the}} role of humans in the Culture is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of pets, or parasites on Culture Minds, and that they can have nothing {{genuinely}} useful to contribute to a society where science is close to omniscient about the physical universe, where every ailment has been cured, and where every thought can be read. Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) wondering how far-reaching the Minds' dominance of the Culture is, and how much of the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and Special Circumstances influence other societies. Also, except for some mentions about a vote over the Idiran-Culture War, and the existence of {{a very small number of}} 'Referrers' (humans of especially acute reasoning), few biological entities are ever described as being involved in any high-level decisions.|$|E

According to Horrocks: [...] "Rapt in contemplation he stood for some time, scarcely trusting his own senses, through excess of joy... In a little while, the clouds again obscured {{the face of the}} Sun, so that he could observe <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> Venus was certainly on the disc at the time." [...] Afterwards, he made [...] "so rapid a sketch" [...] of Venus as it had passed across the Sun's disc, allowing Crabtree to estimate the angular size of Venus to be 1' 3", accurate to within 1 second of arc of its actual size; Horrocks's estimate of 1' 12" [...] was less accurate.|$|E
500|$|Recent {{works have}} {{generally}} accepted {{the image of}} Theramenes as a moderate, committed to the ideal of a hoplite-based broad oligarchy. Donald Kagan has said of him that [...] "...his entire career reveals {{him to be a}} patriot and a true moderate, sincerely committed to a constitution granting power to the hoplite class, whether {{in the form of a}} limited democracy or a broadly based oligarchy", while John Fine has noted that [...] "like many a person following a middle course, he was hated by both political extremes." [...] The constitution of the 5,000 is recognized as his political masterpiece; his attempt to bring about a similar shift towards moderatism in 404 led directly to his death. That death, meanwhile, has become famous for its drama, and the story of Theramenes' final moments has been repeated over and over throughout classical historiography. [...] "Because he met his death defying a tyrant," [...] John Fine notes, [...] "it is easy to idealize Theramenes." [...] In the millennia since his death, Theramenes has been both idealized and reviled; his brief seven-year career in the spotlight, touching as it did on all the major points of controversy in the last years of the Peloponnesian War, has been subject to myriad different interpretations. From the polemical contemporary works which describe his career have emerged the outlines of a complex figure, charting a dangerous course through the chaos of the late 5th-century Athenian political scene; although historians from ancient times to the present have offered far more specific portraits, of one form or another, it may be that <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> outline will ever be known with certainty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{final case}} again upheld tribal {{sovereignty}} and reasserted federal supremacy {{with respect to}} tribal affairs by protecting tribal sovereignty from incursions by the states, holding that the laws of a state have no force on tribal lands within that state's geographical boundaries.

He was bowled first ball and, as he left the wicket, turned and vowed to the bowler that it would not happen again; nor did it, as Thewlis worked his way to 41 not out in the second innings.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 Public Law 90-100 {{found the}} traffic in {{pornography}} to be [...] "a matter of national concern", {{as well as}} in obscenity. In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 Ginzburg v. United States case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice Hugo Black in the 1966 Mishkin v. New York: [...] "I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read." [...] In the 1974 Hamling v. United States decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials are for sale and purchased around the country, [...] "Mere availability of similar materials by itself means <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> other persons are engaged in similar activities." [...] The 1976 American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defined that pornography consists of [...] "written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings". Since determining what is pornography and what is [...] "soft core" [...] and [...] "hard core" [...] are subjective questions to judges, juries, and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow. The Rehnquist Court further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography. Current Chief Justice John Roberts told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: [...] "Well, Senator, it's my understanding under the Supreme Court's doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not".|$|E
