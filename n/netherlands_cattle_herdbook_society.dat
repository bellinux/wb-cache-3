Subsequently, maize cv. Melody or Mandigo was sown at a row spacing of 75 cm parallel to the slots, either at random lateral positions in the standard injection treatment or 10 cm from the injection slots of the banded injection treatment. All treatments, including a control without slurry, were combined with 0 or 20 - 31 kg/ha of subsurface banded P starter fertilizer. Dry matter yields of silage maize were on average reduced by 8 % when standard injection of slurry was not supplemented with P. However, the yield reduction was only 2 % when slurry was banded...|$|R

40|$|Background]: A new betacoronavirus-Middle East {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -has {{been identified}} in patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses {{have been unable to}} identify direct ancestors of MERS-CoV. Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats. We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock. [Methods]: We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, <b>Netherlands,</b> Chile). <b>Cattle</b> (n= 80), sheep (n= 40), goats (n= 40), dromedary camels (n= 155), and various other camelid species (n= 34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S 1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC 43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus. [Findings]: 50 of 50 (100...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{increase}} of anthropogenic activities {{is the main}} reason for the {{increase of}} methane emissions in the Netherlands. Methane is an important greenhouse gas. The most important sources in the <b>Netherlands</b> are landfills, <b>cattle,</b> manure and the exploration, transport and distribution of oil and gas. In this report the emissions of methane are calculated for 1989 - 1992 using IPCC methodology. Developments in the emissions for the years until 2015 are estimated. Scenario's are used of the Third National Environmental Outlook. The government aim to reduce methane emissions with 10 % by the year 2000 will only be effectuated if policies in the oil and gas sector, the livestock sector and the landfill sector are successful. Additional policy measures are feasible in landfill gas recovery and prevention of venting in the oil and gas sector. Cattle reduction are especially effective...|$|R
40|$|A new betacoronavirus-Middle East {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -has {{been identified}} in patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses {{have been unable to}} identify direct ancestors of MERS-CoV. Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats. We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock. METHODS: We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, <b>Netherlands,</b> Chile). <b>Cattle</b> (n= 80), sheep (n= 40), goats (n= 40), dromedary camels (n= 155), and various other camelid species (n= 34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S 1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC 43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus. FINDINGS: 50 of 50 (100 %) sera from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14 %) from Spanish camels had protein-specific antibodies against MERS-CoV spike. Sera from European sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids had no such antibodies. MERS-CoV neutralising antibody titres varied between 1 / 320 and 1 / 2560 for the Omani camel sera and between 1 / 20 and 1 / 320 for the Spanish camel sera. There was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies. INTERPRETATION: MERS-CoV or a related virus has infected camel populations. Both titres and seroprevalences in sera from different locations in Oman suggest widespread infection.

40|$|The {{light trap}} is the tool {{of choice for}} {{conducting}} large-scale Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) vector surveillance programmes. Its efficacy is in doubt, however. To assess this, hourly changes in Culicoides activity over the 24 -h diel were determined comparatively by way of light trapping and aerial sweeping, and correlated against light intensity. In the <b>Netherlands,</b> sweeping around <b>cattle</b> at pasture revealed that, in early summer, Culicoides are active throughout the diel, and that their abundance peaks during the crepuscular period and falls to a low during the brightest hours of the day. By contrast, the light trap was able to accumulate Culicoides only at night (i. e. after illuminance levels had dropped to 0 lux and midge activity had begun to decline). Although Culicoides chiopterus and species of the Culicoides obsoletus complex were similarly abundant around livestock, they differed critically in their hours of peak activity, being largely diurnal and nocturnal, respectively. This polarity helps to explain why, routinely, the C. obsoletus complex dominates light trap collections and C. chiopterus does not. Inability to accumulate Culicoides at light intensity levels above 0 lux means that, at ever-higher latitudes, particularly beyond 45 ° N, the progressive northward lengthening of the twilight period will have an increasingly adverse impact upon {{the efficacy of the}} light trap as a vector surveillance tool. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{nutrient}} {{emissions from}} {{intensive animal husbandry}} have contributed to decreased species diversity in (semi) natural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, pollution of groundwater, and possibly global warming due to N 2 O emissions. This paper {{presents the results of}} a modelling study presenting the impacts of both structural measures and improved farming practices on major nitrogen (N) fluxes, including NH 3 and N 2 O emission, uptake, leaching, and runoff, in the Netherlands, using input data for the year 2000. Average annual fluxes (Gg N year– 1) for the year 2000 were estimated at 132 for NH 3 emission (160 Gg NH 3 year– 1), 28 for N 2 O emission, 50 for N inflow to groundwater, and 15 for N inflow to surface water at a total N input of 1046. At this input, nitrate (NO 3) concentrations in groundwater often exceeded the target of 50 mg NO 3 l– 1, specifically in well-drained sandy soils. The ammonia (NH 3) emissions exceeded emission targets that were set to protect the biodiversity of nonagricultural land. Improved farming practices were calculated to lead to a significant reduction in NH 3 emissions to the atmosphere and N leaching and runoff to groundwater and surface water, but these improvements were not enough to reach all the targets set for those fluxes. Only strong structural measures clearly improved the situation. The NH 3 emission target of 30 Gg NH 3 year– 1, suggested for the year 2030, could not be attained, however, unless pig and poultry farming is completely banned in the <b>Netherlands</b> and all <b>cattle</b> stay almost permanently in low emission stables...|$|R
