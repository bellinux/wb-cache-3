Goldacre writes that Holford based this conclusion on a <b>non-clinical</b> <b>study</b> where [...] "you tip lots of vitamin C onto HIV-infected cells and measure {{a few things}} related to HIV replication". Goldacre notes that the paper does not compare vitamin C to AZT for efficacy.

[...] Prof David Colquhoun argues that Holford's [...] "advocacy of vitamin C as better than conventional drugs to treat Aids is truly scary".|$|E
40|$|The various {{beneficial}} effects of soybeans, which {{are rich in}} phytochemicals, have received much attention because of increasing health awareness. Soy milk that has been fermented using lactic acid bacteria {{has been used to}} prepare cheese-like products, tofu (bean-curd), and yogurt-type products. However, the distinct odor of soybeans has limited the acceptance of such foods, particularly in Western countries. In Japan, while tofu and soy milk have long been habitually consumed, the development of novel, palatable food products has not been easy. The unpleasant odor of soy milk and the absorption efficiency for isoflavones can be improved using a recently developed fermented soy milk beverage. Cancer has been the leading cause of death, and breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women. The most common type of breast cancer is estrogen-dependent, and the anti-estrogenic effects of isoflavones are known.

40|$|The {{process of}} drug {{development}} involves <b>non-clinical</b> and clinical <b>studies.</b> <b>Non-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> are conducted using different protocols including animal studies, which mostly follow the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. During the early pre-clinical development process, {{also known as}} Go/No-Go decision, a drug candidate needs to pass through several steps, such as determination of drug availability (studies on pharmacokinetics), absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) and preliminary studies that aim to investigate the candidate safety including genotoxicity, mutagenicity, safety pharmacology and general toxicology. These preliminary studies generally {{do not need to}} comply with GLP regulations. These studies aim at investigating the drug safety to obtain the first information about its tolerability in different systems that are relevant for further decisions.

It is important toallow flexibility in developing manufacturing process to designand control the purity of NCAPI. There arevarious ways to optimize the purity on purpose, such as addition of individualimpurities on use of harsh chemical reactions. Inthe present study, we established a method to ensurethe desired purity of NCAPI by adding a separate setof API containing various species of impurities (IMAPI). Methods: Firstly, the target purity ofNCAPI {{was determined by the}} purity of API used for a two-week repeated dosetoxicity study in the dog. Secondly, IMAPI was prepared in lab, and labexperiments were conducted to determine how much IMAPIneeded to achieve the target purity of NCAPI at large-scalemanufacturing. Thirdly, we conducted large-scale manufacturing by addition ofIMAPI and confirmed whether the purity of NCAPI was within the desired one. Results: The purity of API used in the dogtoxicity study was 97. 8 %, so we set the target purity at 98 %. IMAPI wassynthesized with the purity of 82. 2 %, and added to the reaction mixture inlarge-scale production.

40|$|Failures of {{inhibitory}} control can severely affect {{everyday life}} in healthy individuals and represent a common feature of many neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly disorders with dopaminergic disturbances implicated. This study's aim {{was to examine the}} interacting influences of three common and functional gene variants that influence dopaminergic pathways on an aspect of inhibitory control (action restraint). Three hundred and twenty two healthy adults were selected from an international consortium linked to Brain Research and Integrative Neuroscience (BRAINnet). DNA was extracted from cheek swab samples and participants were genotyped for the Val 158 Met single nucleotide polymorphism on COMT (rs 4680), C 957 T on DRD 2 (rs 6277) and the 40 bp variable number of tandem repeat on the DAT 1 (SLC 6 A 3, 10 / 10 vs 9 +). Response inhibition was measured using a computerised Go/No-Go task. Main effects and interactions between genotypes were explored. We did not observe a genotype effect on fundamental measures of response inhibition, i. e. reaction time (RT) and commission errors. RT variability was significantly increased in DRD 2 C 957 T heterozygotes. In conclusion, this large, <b>non-clinical</b> <b>study</b> reveals that the selected genetic polymorphisms regulating dopamine (COMT, DRD 2 and DAT 1) do not influence one aspect of response inhibition, action restraint, as measured by the Go/No-Go task, reinforcing the neuropharmacological dissociation between stop-signal and Go/No-Go tasks.

40|$|Iron sucrose {{originator}} (ISORIG) {{has been}} used to treat iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia for decades. Iron sucrose similars (ISSs) have recently entered the market. In this <b>non-clinical</b> <b>study</b> of non-anemic rats, five doses (40 mg iron/kg body weight) of six ISSs marketed in Asian countries, ISORIG or saline solution (control) were administered intravenously over four weeks to compare their toxicologic effects. Vasodilatory effects, impaired renal function and hepatic damage were only observed in the ISS groups. Significantly elevated serum iron and transferrin saturation levels were observed in the ISS groups suggesting a higher release of iron resulting in higher amounts of non-transferrin bound (free) iron compared to ISORIG. This might explain the elevated oxidative stress and increased levels of inflammatory markers and antioxidant enzymes in the liver, heart and kidneys of ISS-treated animals. Physico-chemical analyses showed that the molecular structure of most of the ISSs differed greatly from that of the ISORIG. These differences may be responsible for the organ damage and oxidative stress observed in the ISS groups. Significant differences were also found between different lots of a single ISS product. In contrast, polarographic analyses of three different ISORIG lots were identical, indicating that the molecular structure and thus the manufacturing process for ISORIG is highly consistent. Data from this study suggest that ISSs and ISORIG differ significantly. Therefore, before widespread use of these products it would be prudent to evaluate additional non-clinical and/or clinical data proving the safety, therapeutic equivalence and interchangeability of ISSs with ISORIG...|$|E

40|$|Mit der Einführung der hochaktiven antiretroviralen Therapie (HAART) 1995 wandelte sich die HIV-Infektion in den Industrieländern von einer akut lebensbedrohlichen zu einer chronisch verlaufenden und scheinbar gut kontrollierten Erkrankung. Das Virus wird allerdings nie vollständig aus dem Körper eliminiert, sodass die Betroffenen zeitlebens Medikamente einnehmen müssen. Die Langzeit-Medikation wird häufig von schweren Nebenwirkungen begleitet, führt zur Selektion resistenter Viren und muss häufig umgestellt werden. Gentherapeutische Verfahren, die die CD 4 + Zielzellen durch die Expression antiviraler Gene vor der Infektion durch HIV schützen („intrazelluläre Immunisierung“), stellen viel versprechende Therapiealternativen dar. Der in der Arbeitsgruppe von Laer entwickelte retrovirale Vektor M 87 o (EGELHOFER et al. 2004, EGELHOFER 2004) exprimiert das 46 Aminosäuren lange membran-verankerte Peptid C 46, das in der Lage ist, die gp 41 -vermittelte Fusion von Virus- und Zellmembran zu inhibieren. In Zelllinien und primären Lymphozyten konnte gezeigt werden, dass M 87 o die Infektion durch unterschiedliche HIV-Isolate sehr effektiv verhindert. Im Rahmen vorklinischer Untersuchungen konnte {{in vitro}} gezeigt werden, dass die retrovirale Transduktion mit M 87 o das Transformationsrisiko und damit das Risiko der Entstehung von Neoplasien nicht steigert. An primären peripheren T-Zellen konnte zeigt werden, dass M 87 o die Zielzellen weder phänotypische noch funktionelle verändert. Für die Untersuchung der retroviralen Gentherapie im Rhesusaffenmodell wurde zunächst ein Gentransferprotokoll für periphere Affenlymphozyten entwickelt, mit dem in Vorversuchen Gentransferraten von ca. 50 % erreicht werden konnten. Das Transduktionsprotokoll wurde anschließend im Rahmen einer präklinischen Studie zur Toxizität und Immunogenität der M 87 o-Gentherapie, bei der Herstellung zweier Studientransplantate angewandt. Beide Zellpräparate wurden den Versuchstieren transplantiert. Während des Eingriffs traten keine akuttoxischen Reaktionen auf. M 87 o+-Zellen konnten bis 140 Tage nach der Transplantation mittels PCR nachgewiesen werden. Immunologische Untersuchungen (Cytokinfärbung, Proliferationsassay, ELISPOT) ergaben keine Hinweise auf zelluläre oder humorale Immunreaktionen. M 87 o-spezifische Antikörper waren im Serum nicht nachweisbar. Für die Durchführung einer klinischen Studie zur Toxizität und Wirksamkeit (Phase I/II) an HIV-infizierten Probanden wurde ein Protokoll zur Produktion M 87 o-modifizierter T-Zellen (mindestens 5 × 108 M 87 o+ CD 4 -T-Zellen pro Spender) entwickelt. In die klinische Prüfung wurden Patienten aufgenommen, die nach multiplem Therapieversagen durch das Auftreten multiresistenter HIV eine CD 4 -Zellzahl von 50 bis 200 µl- 1 Blut, sowie eine Viruslast von > 5. 000 Kopien ml- 1 Blut aufwiesen. Im Versuchsmaßstab konnte ein Transduktionsprotokoll erarbeitet werden, mit dem im Mittel 46 % der CD 4 + T-Zellen mit M 87 o transduziert werden konnten. Innerhalb von 10 Tagen expandierte die Zellzahl im Mittel um den Faktor 153, wobei die HIV-Replikation vollständig inhibiert wurde. Das Protokoll wurde erfolgreich vom Versuchsmaßstab in den klinisch relevanten Produktionsmaßstab übersetzt. In drei Versuchsläufen wurde im Mittel eine Transduktionsrate von 29 % erreicht und die Zellzahl um den Faktor 44 vermehrt. Der Anteil an CD 3 +/CD 4 + Zellen an der Gesamtpopulation lag im Mittel bei 91 %. Insgesamt konnten mit dem etablierten Protokoll durchschnittlich 2, 3 × 109 CD 3 +/CD 4 +/M 87 o+ Zellen, bei gleichzeitig vollständiger Inhibition der HIV-Replikation, generiert werden. Im Rahmen einer klinischen Studie zur Toxizität und Wirksamkeit der M 87 o-Gentherapie wurden 10 Studientransplantate gemäß dem im Rahmen dieser Arbeit entwickelten Protokoll hergestellt. Alle Transplantate wurden am Universitäts-Krankenhaus Eppendorf in Hamburg transfundiert und von den Patienten sehr gut vertragen. With the {{introduction}} of the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in 1995 the HIV infection converted from an acute life threatening diseased into an apparently well controlled chronicle disease. The virus is in fact not completely eliminated for the body of the patient, thus the affected need to be treated lifelong. Long time medication is in many cases accompanied by serious side effects, leads to selection of resistant virus and therefore therapy has to be changed frequently. Gene therapeutic approaches that efficiently save the CD 4 -positive target cell population from the HIV infection by expression of anti-viral genes (intracellular immunization) could offer promising therapeutic alternatives. The retroviral vector M 87 o (EGELHOFER et al. 2004, EGELHOFER 2004) developed in the group of Prof. VON LAER at the Georg-Speyer-Haus in Frankfurt, Germany, expresses a membrane-anchored peptide, 46 amino acids long, that is able to inhibit gp 41 -mediated fusion of the virus and host cell membrane. It could be shown that M 87 o is able to inhibit the infection of T cell lines as well as primary lymphocytes by different HIV isolates. In the context of non-clinical investigations, it could be shown in vitro that transduction with M 87 o does not increase the risk of transformation and therefore does not increase the risk of neoplasia. It was demonstrated that M 87 o does not alter T cells with respect to phenotype and function. To support the investigation of the M 87 o gene therapy in a rhesus monkey model, a gene transfer protocol for peripheral monkey lymphocytes was developed able to achieve a gene transfer rate of approximately 50 %. This protocol was consecutively applied {{in the context of a}} <b>non-clinical</b> <b>study</b> for investigation of toxicity and immunogenicity of the M 87 o gene therapy for production of two study transplants. Both cell products were transplanted without acute toxic reactions. M 87 o-positive T cells could be detected for up to 140 days by means of PCR. Immunological investigations did not give any hind on cellular of humoral immune reactions. M 87 o specific antibodies could not be detected in the serum of the animals. To support a clinical trial for investigation of toxicity and efficacy of the M 87 o gene therapy in HIV infected volunteers, a protocol for production of M 87 o-modified T cells (minimum requirement: 5 x 108 M 87 o-positive CD 4 T cells per donor) was developed. Into this clinical trial, patients with a history of multiple therapy failure due to multi resistant HIV, a CD 4 cell count of 50 to 200 cells per µl of blood, and a virus load greater than 5, 000 per ml of blood were enrolled. First a transduction protocol that allowed genetic modification of at mean 46 % of CD 4 T cells was developed at experimental scale. During 10 days of culture cell number multiplier by 153 with complete inhibition of viral replication. The protocol was than successfully transferred from the experimental scale to the clinically relevant production scale. During three production campaigns a mean transduction rate of 29 % was achieved and cells expanded 44 -fold in number. At mean 91 % cells of the total population were positive for CD 3 as well as CD 4. With the established protocol on average 2, 3 x 109 CD 3 +/CD 4 +/M 87 o+ cells could be generated. HIV replication was completely inhibited in parallel. In the context of a clinical trial for investigation of toxicity and efficacy of the M 87 o gene therapy, ten study transplants were generated according to the protocol established during this work. All cell preparations were transplanted at the university hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, and tolerated very well by the recipients...|$|E

The clinical studies, all reported from Asian countries, described a number of cases for eating disorders quite different from one another. The <b>non-clinical</b> quantitative <b>studies</b> reported a number of cases consistent with the ranges previously reported for controlled samples of non-clinical Caucasian populations. We found few or no quantitative studies on eating disorders from Hispanic, Middle Eastern, African, or Asian countries other than Japan...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{levels in}} the {{intensive}} care unit are known to be high. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines suggest hospital noise levels should average 35 dBA during the day and 30 dBA at night. Research conducted by our group in five local units recorded levels just under 60 dBA during the day (equivalent to a busy restaurant) with peaks above 100 dBA 22 - 28 times every hour. Staff and patients may be in a chronic state of alertness when alarms are constantly sounding. Alarms share characteristics with the human scream and tend to activate areas of the brain that recognise danger. Raised sound levels have been associated with increased stress for staff, and <b>non-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> show that noise adversely affects physiology, motivation, and general health...|$|R
40|$|This review {{presents}} a historical overview of drug discovery and the non-clinical {{stages of the}} drug development process, from initial target identification and validation, through in silico assays and high throughput screening (HTS), identification of leader molecules and their optimization, {{the selection of a}} candidate substance for clinical development, and the use of animal models during the early studies of proof-of-concept (or principle). This report also discusses the relevance of validated and predictive animal models selection, as well as the correct use of animal tests concerning the experimental design, execution and interpretation, which affect the reproducibility, quality and reliability of <b>non-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> necessary to translate to and support clinical studies. Collectively, improving these aspects will certainly contribute to the robustness of both scientific publications and the translation of new substances to clinical development...|$|R
40|$|Summary This {{review is}} aimed at the {{systematic}} mapping of ascorbic acid in the prevention and/or treatment of cancer in clinical and <b>non-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> from 2011 to 2015, {{in order to understand}} dose-response variations as well as its mechanisms of action as an antioxidant and antitumor agent. Seventy-eight articles were retrieved from the PubMed/Bireme database, of which only 30 included ascorbic acid in the prevention and/or treatment of cancer. However, there are controversies regarding doses and a lack of clinical studies featuring its mechanism of action more clearly. Other studies are needed to understand dose-response variations, as well as its targeting mechanisms of action, both as an antioxidant and antitumor agent, to assist treatment and prevention of cancer, aiming at better quality of life for both patients and the general population...|$|R
40|$|Inhaled {{administration}} of test materials to animals has technical challenges for quantitative dosimetry. Inhaled “doses” reported in <b>non-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> are often calculated using an equation {{such as that}} of Alexander et al. [1] to estimate the respired minute volume (eRMV) from body weight data. This approach may overlook physiological effects on lung function associated with a formulation’s properties or habituation of animals to the “dosing” technique. Rats are insensitive to red light [2] and anecdotal data (unpublished) suggested red lighting may induce a calmer state in restrained rats. We hypothesized that the lighting color (red or white) and duration of restraint tube acclimation protocols may influence the breath frequency and minute volume of rats during inhalation exposure, representing a potential source of variability in achieved doses. Head-out plethysmography [3] was used to investigate this hypothesis concurrent with inhaled {{administration of}} an anti-inflammatory drug...|$|R
40|$|Conventional egg-based {{manufacturing}} technology for seasonal influenza vaccines has several drawbacks, including its inflexibility, reliance on egg supplies, risk of contamination, absence {{of growth of}} some isolates and egg-adaptive viral mutations that threaten vaccine matching. To overcome these limitations, cell culture-derived vaccines have been designed, including the trivalent inactivated vaccine Flucelvax®/Optaflu® (brand names in the US/EU, respectively). Flucelvax/Optaflu has gained wide regulatory approval and is currently implemented in several countries. <b>Non-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> have assuaged hypothetical concerns regarding oncogenicity and use in persons allergic to dogs. Ample clinical data suggest the non-inferiority of Flucelvax/Optaflu to egg-based vaccines in terms of immunogenicity, safety and tolerability, and it has fulfilled American and European mandatory requirements. Although Flucelvax/Optaflu is currently indicated only for adults and the elderly, pediatric data indicate its good immunogenicity and safety. This paper provides {{an update on the}} clinical development of Flucelvax/Optaflu, its seasonal trials and available post-marketing surveillance data...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is some {{evidence}} that early sexual abuse is an aetiological factor for eating disorder. However, there is sparse information from large-scale, <b>non-clinical</b> <b>studies.</b> AIMS: This study was designed to explore which early experiences, recalled during pregnancy, were associated with both lifetime and antenatal eating disorder symptoms in a community sample. METHOD: Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted of data from questionnaires administered during pregnancy to a community sample of pregnant women. RESULTS: Recall of parental mental health problems and of early unwanted sexual experiences were independently associated with both lifetime eating problems, laxative use and vomiting during pregnancy, and marked concern during pregnancy over shape and weight. CONCLUSIONS: There are public health implications for these results. Eating disorders in mothers represent a risk for child development. It may be important to enquire during pregnancy about a history of eating problems and to provide the opportunity for early experiences to be discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMarked {{successes in}} {{treating}} {{a wide variety}} of malignancies in both adults and children have raised concerns about the cardiotoxic sequelae of several mainstream and emerging cancer therapies. There is a critical need for the health care community to more quickly and reliably identify the unique treatment-related cardiac risks facing patients with cancer. Meeting these needs will likely involve identifying new biomarkers of early and reversible cardiotoxicity, designing and optimizing dosing and drug selection, and developing oncology drugs that can be administered with protectant therapies to improve safety profiles. <b>Non-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> offer the opportunity to more thoroughly characterize underlying biological mechanisms that might aid in designing and optimizing safer drugs. The Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI), a global, non-profit institute that promotes multi-sector scientific partnerships along with other academic, government, patient-advocacy, and clinical partners, proposes to develop novel collaborations to develop new ways of performing non-clinical safety assessments that will benefit patient quality of life...|$|R
