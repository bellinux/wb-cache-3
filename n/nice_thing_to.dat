People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|The {{first issue}} was {{released}} November 26, 2002, with a January 2003 cover date. It premiered with five series: Dragon Ball Z, Sand Land, Yu-Gi-Oh!, YuYu Hakusho, and One Piece. With {{the launch of}} the magazine considered successful, Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha's editors, but declined, {{due to a lack of}} interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects. After six issues had been released, Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff. Reflecting back later, he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that [...] "I basically told Viz that I wanted to work part time or I'd quit. It probably wasn't a really <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] He eventually stepped down as editor-in-chief, being replaced by his former boss Yumi Hoashi.|$|E
500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have achieved." ...|$|E

2500|$|The name of {{the album}} was chosen because the band could not agree upon any other names. Taylor {{described}} the album title as being [...] "a very dumb pun in a way" [...] and felt it was [...] "quite an ugly sounding phrase" [...] but despite this, he felt the sentiment behind made it [...] "quite a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say" [...] because, as in the title song, it refers to [...] "turning a one night stand into someone's whole life". Taylor stated that he liked [...] "that kind of way of expressing love towards someone" [...] {{and the idea of}} using a [...] "simple but quite clumsy turn on [...] cliché" [...] to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer {{said that}} {{characters}} like Keith {{are not the}} most enjoyable to play. [...] "Keith is a very simple character. I actually prefer more of a challenge. He wasn't a hugely interesting character. But {{he was a good}} guy and he was just a really genuine human being with good intentions", commented Sheffer. [...] "And that's a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> play and come {{home at the end of}} the day. You don't bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff." [...] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas and fell in love with her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was stated}} again by Clinton in the culminating chapter of Hard Choices, her 2014 memoir {{of her time}} as secretary:... It was {{no coincidence that the}} places where women's lives were most undervalued largely lined up with the parts of the world most plagued by instability, conflict, extremism, and poverty. This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but over the years I came to view it {{as one of the most}} compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. [...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> work on but hardly a necessity. I became convinced that, in fact, this was a cause that cut to the heart of our national security.|$|E
6000|$|Mother {{had been}} brooding. She was only distantly {{conscious}} {{of his final}} collapse. She said, suddenly, bluntly: [...] "Let's go away together. If we could only die while we are still together and have some <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> remember--" ...|$|R

2500|$|During a fall movie preview, Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Malkovich [...] "easily racks {{up the most}} laughs" [...] among the cast as the foul-mouthed and short-tempered ex-CIA man. The first scene Malkovich {{performed}} was a phone call in which he shouts several obscenities at Pitt and McDormand. But Malkovich could {{not be on the}} sound stage for the call because he was rehearsing a play, so he called in the lines from his apartment in Paris. Regarding the scene, Malkovich said, [...] "It was really late at night and I was screaming {{at the top of my}} lungs. God knows what the neighbors thought." [...] Swinton plays Malkovich's wife who engages in an affair with Clooney, although the two characters do not get along well. Clooney's and Swinton's characters also had a poor relationship in their previous film together, Michael Clayton, prompting Clooney to say to Swinton at the end of a shoot, [...] "Well, maybe one day we'll get to make a film together when we say one <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> each other." [...] Swinton said of the dynamic, [...] "I'm very happy to shout at him on screen. It's great fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Justice Stephen Breyer {{asked if}} [...] "Congress passes a law {{and it says}} it's a very <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> commemorate the Pilgrims by {{building}} a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where {{we will have the}} regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I would say no, no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, {{we are going to have}} a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?" [...] Clement answered [...] "I think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing. Plenty of people could probably challenge that [...]" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You say <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] she declared, {{looking at}} him reproachfully, [...] "but only when Pauline isn't here. We all know that {{directly}} she comes {{we are no longer}} any of us human beings. I wish I were intelligent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You dear people!" [...] she exclaimed, impulsively. [...] "I know I {{am going}} to have ever such <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> thank you for. May I be a child, and put off looking at them until after breakfast? Do you mind, all of you?" ...|$|R
60|$|After the Pinkies {{had been}} dismissed, their new Queen Rosalie, {{by means of}} a clever charm, conjured up a dinner table set with very <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> eat. They all enjoyed a hearty meal and {{afterward}} sat and talked over their adventures.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have barely}} {{a quarter of}} an hour, Stirling," [...] she said. [...] "It was too absurd of you to be sitting there talking to father all the time. Come and say <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> me. Mother has gone upstairs to put on her tiara." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess the}} name's all right," [...] she replied. [...] "Glad {{to see you}} don't bear any ill-will against me, Mr. Crawshay. You Englishmen {{sometimes}} get so peevish when things don't go quite your way, and you weren't saying <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> me last time we met." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{looked in}} the mirror and smiled and tossed her curly head. She studied the oval face framed in its mass of curls, the steady gray-blue eyes, the soft, wistful, tenderly curved lips. [...] "Yes, I'm pretty," [...] she said. [...] "And I'm going <b>to</b> buy <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> wear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Alma, let {{my child}} alone: {{and if you}} want to play, go and play with Niebla down by the river. A <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> catch my duckie in your hands--what next, I wonder!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] said Hardy, hastily. [...] "You {{are quite}} right, of course. It {{was not a}} <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, but I would do a {{thousand}} times worse to please you." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, I considered, when I had got safe back again, {{this was}} a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have done! Now I was hot and had made {{the worst of it}} instead of the best.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} {{suspected}} something {{when you said}} all those <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] said the mollified lady. [...] "Well, you must take your chance, {{like all the rest}} of them. She can only say ’No,’ again. It’ll explain this affair better, that’s one thing; but I expect they’ll laugh at you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Coon was {{the last}} to be called before her, and instead of being {{frowning}} and cross, as she had been to the others, she was all smiles. She said a lot of <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> him, and when at last she sent him away, what do you think she had given him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is stolid {{without being}} stupid," [...] she explained. [...] "He is entirely self-centered. I smile at him, and he waits patiently until I have {{finished}} {{to get on}} with our business. I have said quite <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> him and he has stared at me without change of expression, absolutely without pleasure or emotion of any sort." ...|$|R
