25|$|In July 1989, the Beam Experiments Aboard a Rocket (BEAR) program {{launched}} a sounding rocket containing a <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> beam (NPB) accelerator. The experiment successfully demonstrated that a particle beam would operate and propagate as predicted outside {{the atmosphere and}} that there are no unexpected side-effects when firing the beam in space. After the rocket was recovered, the particle beam was still operational. According to the BMDO, the research on <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> beam accelerators, which was originally funded by the SDIO, could eventually be used to reduce the half-life of nuclear waste products using accelerator-driven transmutation technology.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s the Nuclear Pulse Propulsion concept further was refined by Project Daedalus {{by use of}} {{externally}} triggered {{inertial confinement}} fusion, in this case producing fusion explosions via compressing fusion fuel pellets with high-powered electron beams. Since then, lasers, ion beams, <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> beams and hyper-kinetic projectiles have been suggested to produce nuclear pulses for propulsion purposes.|$|E
25|$|Since neutral kaons carry strangeness, they {{cannot be}} their own antiparticles. There must be then two {{different}} neutral kaons, differing by two units of strangeness. The question was then how to establish {{the presence of these}} two mesons. The solution used a phenomenon called <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> oscillations, by which these two kinds of mesons can turn from one into another through the weak interactions, which cause them to decay into pions (see the adjacent figure).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} effects of <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> on shocks propagating into the partially ionized medium. We find that for 120 km/s < u_{sh} < 3000 km/s (u_{sh} is the shock velocity), about {{ten percent of}} upstream <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> leak into the upstream region from the downstream region. Moreover, we investigate how the leakage <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> affect the upstream structure of the shock and particle accelerations. Using four fluid approximations (upstream ions, upstream <b>neutral</b> <b>particles,</b> leakage <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> and pickup ions), we provide analytical solutions of the precursor structure due to leakage <b>neutral</b> <b>particles.</b> It is shown that the upstream flow is decelerated in the precursor region and the shock compression ratio becomes smaller than without leakage <b>neutral</b> <b>particles,</b> but the total compression ratio does not change. Even if leakage of <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> is small (a few percents of total upstream particles), this smaller compression ratio of the shock can explain steep gamma-ray spectra from young supernova remnants. Furthermore, leakage <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> could amplify the magnetic field and heat the upstream region. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{experimental}} {{data on the}} number of charged <b>neutral</b> nuclear-active <b>particles</b> were obtained at 200 BeV. The ratio of the number of charged particles to the number of <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> was 2. 1 + or - 0. 3.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an apparatus for the differential coating rate measurement of <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> and ions. The apparatus is {{moved to the}} position of the substrates to be coated or to a defined reference position. The rate is determined by a suitable detector (4), e. g. a crystal oscillator. The apparatus is configured in such a manner as to make it possible to measure the total flow of ions and <b>neutral</b> <b>particles,</b> through a shielding screen (3), and to detect the <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> while dismissing the ions. The proportion of ions and also <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> in the coating-forming species can thus be measured via differential measurements...|$|R
500|$|There are {{two types}} of weak {{interaction}} (called vertices). The first type is called the [...] "charged-current interaction" [...] because it is mediated by particles that carry an electric charge (the [...] or [...] bosons), and is responsible for the beta decay phenomenon.

2500|$|James Chadwick {{discovered}} {{a much more}} massive nuclear particle in 1932 and also named it a neutron, leaving two kinds of particles with the same name. Pauli earlier (in 1930) had used the term [...] "neutron" [...] for both the <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> that conserved energy in beta decay, and a presumed <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> in the nucleus, and initially did not consider these two neutral particles as distinct from each other. The word [...] "neutrino" [...] entered the scientific vocabulary through Enrico Fermi, who used it during a conference in Paris in July 1932 and at the Solvay Conference in October 1933, where Pauli also employed it. The name (the Italian equivalent of [...] "little neutral one") was jokingly coined by Edoardo Amaldi during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> from Chadwick's neutron.|$|E
5000|$|The fusion {{reaction}} of D-T producescharged and <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> in the plasma. The charged particles remainmagnetically confined to as a plasma. The <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> are not magneticallyconfined and will {{move toward the}} boundary between the hotter plasma and thecolder PFC. Upon reaching the first wall, both <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> and chargedparticles that escaped the plasma become cold <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> in gaseousform. An outer edge of cold neutral gas is then [...] "recycled", or mixed,with the hotter plasma. A temperature gradient between the cold neutral gas andthe hot plasma {{is believed to be the}} principal cause of anomalous electron andion transport from the magnetically confined plasma. As recycling decreases,the temperature gradient decreases and plasma confinement stability increases.With better conditions for fusion in the plasma, the reactor performanceincreases.|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> in a plasma arc jet {{is crucial for}} {{the distribution of the}} ions and electrons, especially in an unsteady rarefied plasma arc jet with chemical reactions. A 3 -D unsteady investigation of <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> in a rarefied flow with chemical combination and dissociation reactions is numerically simulated based on an in-house direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code. The evolution of the <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> flow in vacuum cylinders is presented, and the influence of the chemical reactions has been investigated for the <b>neutral</b> <b>particles.</b> The predicted results imply that the dissociation reaction {{plays a key role in}} the {{expansion of}} the <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> process. In order to study the expansion of the <b>neutral</b> <b>particles</b> in an electric field, an electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) and DSMC are combined to simulate the axisymmetric rarefied plasma flows with chemical reactions. Two sets of grids are employed for the DSMC/PIC method by considering the different requirements of both the methods based on the molecule mean free path and the Debye length. The properties of both the flow and electric fields are analyzed in detail. It is found that the electric potential increases if the initial velocity of the ions from the inlet is sufficiently large, and accordingly, the number density of the ions in the flow field increases further...|$|R

2500|$|In 1947, G. D. Rochester and Clifford Charles Butler of the University of Manchester {{published}} two {{cloud chamber}} photographs of cosmic ray-induced events, one showing {{what appeared to}} be a <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> decaying into two charged pions, and one which appeared to be a charged particle decaying into a charged pion and something neutral. The estimated mass of the new particles was very rough, about half a proton's mass. More examples of these [...] "V-particles" [...] were slow in coming.|$|E
2500|$|In that lecture, Rutherford conjectured the {{existence}} of new particles. [...] The alpha particle {{was known to be}} very stable, and it was assumed to retain its identity within the nucleus. [...] The alpha particle was presumed to consist of four protons and two closely bound electrons to give it +2 charge. [...] In a 1919 paper, Rutherford had reported the apparent discovery of a new doubly charged particle of mass 3, denoted the X++, interpreted to consist of three protons and a closely bound electron. [...] This result suggested to Rutherford the likely existence of two new particles, one of two protons with a closely bound electron, and another of one proton and a closely bound electron. [...] The X++ particle was later determined to have mass 4 and to be just a low-energy alpha particle. Nevertheless, Rutherford had conjectured {{the existence}} of the neutron, a <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> of mass 1, and the deuteron, a +1 charge particle of mass 2. [...] The latter is the nucleus of deuterium, discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey. The mass of the hypothetical <b>neutral</b> <b>particle</b> would be little {{different from that of the}} proton. Rutherford determined that such a zero-charge particle would be difficult to detect by available techniques.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Pauli {{considered}} {{the problem of}} beta decay.

In 1934, Enrico Fermi incorporated the particle, which he called a neutrino, into his theory of beta decay. The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan, {{two and a half years}} before Pauli's death. On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: [...] "Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli." ...|$|E
