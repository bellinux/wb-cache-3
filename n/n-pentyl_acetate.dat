40|$|A {{summary of}} basic {{characteristics}} for <b>n-Pentyl</b> <b>Acetate</b> production in a reactive distillation column is achieved. Computer simulation {{was performed to}} study the process and to evaluate operational alternatives. Results show that the reactive system exhibits reactive azeotropy phenomena, as is displayed in the residue curves maps illustrated here. The proposed process resulted technically viable for <b>n-Pentyl</b> <b>Acetate</b> fabrication as the principal bottom's product of a reactive distrillation column...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) {{data for}} water + acetic acid, acetic acid + <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> water + acetic acid + <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> {{systems have been}} {{measured}} at 101. 33 k Pa using a recirculating still. The nonideality of the vapor phase caused by the association of the acetic acid has been corrected by the Hayden-O’Connellmethod. The three experimental binary data have been correlated by the NRTL and UNIQUAC models. The obtained NRTL model parameters from binary data {{have been used to}} predict ternary VLE data. The ternary predicted values obtained in this way agree well with the experimental values...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect and react to a {{predator}} odour is crucial for prey species. In the present study 10 mice (Mus musculus) were {{used to test the}} behavioural response of mice towards two predator odours (3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol and 3 -mercapto- 3 -methyl-butan- 1 -ol) and one fruity odour (<b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate).</b> All three odours were tested against a near odourless blank stimulus (diethyl phthalate). The animals were individually placed in a test chamber of two equally sized compartments divided by a vertical Plexiglas wall with a semicircular opening. Their proximity to the odours, placed beneath the floor in petri dishes in each compartment, was measured continuously with stop watches. The mice spent less time in proximity to 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol and <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> compared to diethyl phthalate (P 0, 05). The avoidance of 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol and <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> can be explained either by neophobia, {{or in the case of}} 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol that it contains sulphur. The lack of behavioural response towards 3 -mercapto- 3 -methyl-butan- 1 -ol may be due to its loss of intensity over time. From this study it is not certain if mice have an innate fear of predator odours...|$|E
40|$|It is {{essential}} for prey species {{to be able to}} detect predators to avoid them. The sense of smell is used by a number of prey species for this purpose. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess if one of the odourants that make up a predator odour is sufficient to induce a behavioural response in mice (Mus musculus). Two predator odourants were used, 2, 2 -dimethylthietane and methyl- 2 -phenylethyl sulfide, which are both found in the secretions of natural predators of mice. An odourant found in fruits, <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> was also used. All three odourants were presented at a concentration that was a factor of 100 above the olfactory detection threshold of mice. Ten adult predator-naïve CD- 1 mice were individually put in a two-compartment chamber one of which contained an odourant while the other contained a near-odourless solvent (diethyl phthalate). The results indicated that methyl- 2 -phenylethyl sulfide was actively avoided by the mice. Towards 2, 2 -dimethylthietane and <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> in contrast, the mice behaved indifferent. Further, the results suggest a significant correlation between the number of switches between the two compartments of the test chamber and the test sessions when the animals were presented with <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> but not when they were presented with the predator odourants. The results support the notion of an innate fear response towards the predator odourant methyl- 2 -phenylethyl sulfide in mice, but further studies with more animals and different concentrations of the odourants are necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface tension}} in the {{homogeneous}} domain of the ternary liquid mixtures water + n-butyl acetate + methanol and water + <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> + methanol {{as well as of}} the constituent binaries has been measured at 303. 15  K and atmospheric pressure. The respective excess surface tension was correlated as a function of the composition using empirical and thermodynamic-based relations. The liquid interfacial tension was measured in the liquid-liquid equilibrium range at the same conditions of temperature and pressure. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotational}} {{spectra of}} n-butyl acetate (CH 3 -COO-C 4 H 9), <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (CH 3 -COO-C 5 H 11), and n-hexyl acetate (CH 3 -COO-C 6 H 13) were recorded using molecular beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. First of all, ab initio calculations {{were carried out}} for every conformer at MP 2 / 6 311 ++G(d,p) level. The theoretical rotational constants were used to predict the spectra. In the next step, broadband scans were recorded in selected ranges and the measured lines were re-measured in the high resolution mode. Three conformers were assigned for the molecule n-butyl acetate, two for the molecule <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> {{and one for the}} molecule n-hexyl acetate. Comparing the experimental with the theoretical values, the structures of these assigned conformers were obtained. The strongest lines of each spectrum belong to the conformer with the lowest energy, which has C 1 symmetry. A conformer with CS symmetry was assigned for each of the molecules n-butyl acetate and n pentyl acetate. Comparing the structures of the conformers with lowest energy, the results show, that by extending the carbon chain successively, the previous structure is conserved. The new carbon atoms are added antiperiplanar. For the energetically lowest conformers of n-butyl acetate, <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and n hexyl acetate quantum chemical calculations with different methods and basis sets were carried out. The used methods are Hartee-Fock (HF), second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP 2), Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the Becke Lee Yang functional (B 3 LYP). The used basis sets are 6 - 31 G(d,p), 6 31 +G(d,p), 6 - 31 ++G(d,p), 6 311 G(d,p), 6 - 311 +G(d,p), and 6 311 ++G(d,p). The investigations have shown, that the best agreement between the experimental and theoretical values are observed at the MP 2 / 6 - 311 +G(d,p) level. The MP 2 / 6 311 ++G(d,p) level, which has been used in this work has also a good agreement and is suitable for predicting rotational constants of acetic acetate esters...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{assessing}} possible {{gender differences in}} human olfactory detection thresholds for three odorants; bourgeonal, an aromatic aldehyde, helional, a structural analogue of bourgeonal,  and <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> an aliphatic ester. A total of 500 subjects, 250 males and 250 females between 18 and 40 years of age, were tested using a triangular forced choice method with an ascending staircase procedure. The {{subjects were asked to}} sniff the contents of three bottles and to identify the one containing the stimulus presented at a given concentration. Males were found to have a significantly lower olfactory detection threshold for bourgeonal compared to females (3. 4 · 1011 molecules·cm- 3 air and 5. 9 · 1011 molecules·cm- 3 air, respectively) whereas no significant gender difference in the olfactory detection thresholds for helional (1. 4 · 1013 molecules cm- 3 air and  1. 3 · 1013 molecules·cm- 3 air, respectively) or <b>n-pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (1. 4 · 1014 molecules·cm- 3 air and  1. 1 · 1014 molecules·cm- 3 air, respectively) were found. This is the first study ever to report a human male superiority in olfactory sensitivity for a monomolecular odorant. One possible explanation for this finding is that bourgeonal may differ in its biological significance for males and females. It has recently been demonstrated that bourgeonal elicits chemotaxis in human sperm cells and olfactory receptors activated by bourgeonal might thus be subject to sexual selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of predators by prey species {{is crucial in}} order to escape {{the threat posed by}} a predator. In mammals, the olfactory sensory system is commonly used to detect odors emitted by predators, and to determine how threatening the situation actually is. However, knowledge about this ability is still sparse and in some cases conflicting. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to assess whether CD- 1 mice (Mus musculus) show behaviors such as avoidance, anxiety and/or decreased activity when exposed to any of the three odorants: cat bladder urine, horse voided urine or a fruity odor (<b>N-pentyl</b> <b>acetate),</b> with a blank solvent as an alternative in a two-compartment test arena. I found no significant differences between avoidance (the time that the mice spent in the different compartments), anxiety (the numbers of fecal pellets dropped by the mice), or the overall activity (the number of switches between the two compartments), when the mice were exposed to the three different odors. The fact that the cat urine derived from the bladder of the cat may explain the lack of avoidance responses, since bladder urine might not contain the same chemical components as voided urine. Bladder urine might therefore also lack the chemical components that signal “predator” to the mice. In conclusion, mice do not respond differently to the odor of cat bladder urine than to horse voided urine or to the fruity odor of <b>N-pentyl</b> <b>acetate...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} prey species {{are able to}} detect predators by odours emanating from their urine, feces, fur and anal glands. However, it is unknown whether the odour of a predator’s blood also {{contains}} information signalling “predator” to a prey. The aim {{of the present study}} was therefore to assess if blood odour from a cat elicits avoidance or anxiety responses in CD- 1 mice (Mus musculus). A two-compartment test arena was used to assess place preference, motor activity and fecal excretions when the mice were simultaneously presented with cat blood and a blank control. Additionally, the mice were tested with horse blood and <b>N-pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> a fruity odour. The mice did not show avoidance of any of the three odours. Nevertheless, the mice were significantly less active when exposed to cat blood in comparison to horse blood, but did not increase defecation when exposed to cat blood. This suggests that the information mice get by the odour of cat blood did not contain the signal “predator”...|$|E
