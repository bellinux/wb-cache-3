50|$|Other {{innovations}} {{included the}} square-pallet bilge pump, which {{was adopted by}} the West during the 16th century for work ashore, the western chain pump, which was adopted for shipboard use, being of a different derivation. Junks also relied on the compass for navigational purposes. However, as with almost all vessels of any culture before the late 19th century, the accuracy of magnetic compasses aboard ship, whether from a failure to understand deviation (the magnetism of the ship's iron fastenings) or poor design of the compass card (the standard drypoint compasses were extremely unstable), meant that they did little to contribute to the accuracy of <b>navigation</b> <b>by</b> <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning.</b> Indeed, a review of the evidence shows that the Chinese embarked magnetic pointer was probably little used for navigation. The reasoning is simple. Chinese mariners were as able as any and, had they needed a compass to navigate, they would have been aware of the almost random directional qualities when used at sea of the water bowl compass they used. Yet that design remained unchanged for some half a millennium. Western sailors, coming upon a similar water bowl design (no evidence as to how has yet emerged) very rapidly adapted it in a series of significant changes such that within roughly a century the water bowl had given way to the dry pivot, a rotating compass card a century later, a lubberline a generation later and gimbals seventy or eight years later. These were necessary because in the more adverse climatic context of north western Europe, the compass was needed for navigation. Had similar needs been felt in China, Chinese mariners would also have come up with fixes. They didn't.|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{following}} three properties are foundations of robust robot navigation: ffl The use of landmarks (and, in particular, {{the use of a}} compass sense), ffl the use of canonical paths, and ffl the use of topological rather than geometrical maps. Some examples of successful animal navigation are presented that support this view. We have performed initial experiments with mobile robots to investigate mechanisms suitable to implement such navigational architectures. Experiments concerning <b>navigation</b> <b>by</b> <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> are presented, and a differential light compass is introduced to aid robot navigation. 1 Introduction Most of the work to date concerning navigation of mobile robots uses internal geometrical representations of the robot's environment to perform navigational tasks.

The logistics of it all made the task daunting. Fuel was hard to come by. Flight and maintenance crews had to be positioned through the Middle East.

But in the end, despite being shot at and even bombed upon, the mission was accomplished - and without a single loss of life. [...] "One of the things that really got to me was when we were unloading a plane at Tel Aviv," [...] said Marian, who assisted Israeli nurses on a number of flights.

40|$|Traditionally, {{the problem}} of {{autonomous}} <b>navigation</b> is solved <b>by</b> <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> <b>navigation</b> flight parameters (NFP) of the aircraft (AC). With increasing requirements to accuracy of definition NFP improved the sensors of the prima- ry navigation information: gyroscopes and accelerometers. the gyroscopes of a new type, the so-called solid-state wave gyroscopes (SSVG) are currently developed and put into practice. The work deals with {{the problem of}} increasing the accu- racy of measurements of angular velocity of the hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG). The reduction in the accuracy characteristics of HRG is caused by the presence of defects in the distribution of mass in the volume of its design. The syn- thesis of control system for optimal damping of the distortion parameters of the standing wave due to the influence of the mass defect resonator is adapted. The research challenge was: to examine and analytically offset the impact of the standing wave (amplitude and frequency) parameters defect. Research was performed by mathematical modeling in the environment of SolidWorks Simulation for the case when the characteristics of the sensitive element of the HRG met the technological drawings of a particular type of resonator. The method of the inverse dynamics was chosen for synthesis. The research re- sults are presented in graphs the amplitude-frequency characteristics (AFC) of the resonator output signal. Simulation was performed for the cases: the perfect distribution of weight; the presence of the mass defect; the presence of the mass defects are shown using the synthesized control action. Evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is deter- mined by the results of the resonator output signal simulation provided the perfect constructive and its performance {{in the presence of a}} mass defect in it. It is assumed that the excitation signals are standing waves in the two cases are identical in both amplitude and frequency.
