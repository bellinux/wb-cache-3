Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings.

Tono reveals {{that after he}} {{graduated}} from elementary school in Bandung, where he studied with Yah, he attended medical school in Surabaya and married Tini for her beauty.

However, Perón objects and says {{that if it was}} <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> they would never have {{achieved}} as much as they have ("She Is a Diamond"). But he also concedes she {{will not be able to}} keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for vice-president, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health ("Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet").|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Bill Steigerwald in Reason Magazine, Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of import replacement. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.|$|E

[...] Another mixed review came from Harry Hawcroft of Contactmusic.com, who wrote [...] "I can't give it more than a polite clap." ...|$|E
500|$|Claudia Black {{made her}} {{entrance}} in Stargate SG-1 in a full-body Kull Warrior costume, not dissimilar {{to her first}} appearance as a Peacekeeper in Farscape. For her entrance in season 9's [...] "Avalon", however, the costume designers intended her to wear a dress that the producers later deemed too revealing. Leaving the dress for Vala's appearance as Qetesh in [...] "The Powers That Be", Vala's outfit for [...] "Avalon" [...] was switched to a black fetish leather gear which a costume designer described as [...] "a dominatrix outfit". Black admitted the wildness of her [...] "Avalon" [...] wardrobe was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> liking. But since it mirrored the attention-seeking personality of the character, and because the character does not spend {{much time in the}} same outfit anyway, the actress did not mind wearing it.|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Nellie, Rodgers sought Mary Martin, who had nearly been cast to {{originate}} {{the role of}} Laurey in Oklahoma! [...] Martin was playing the title role in the touring company of Annie Get Your Gun. [...] After Hammerstein and Rodgers saw her play in Los Angeles in mid-1948, they asked her to consider the part. [...] Martin was reluctant to sing opposite Pinza's powerful voice; Rodgers assured her he would see to it the two never sang at the same time, a promise he mostly kept. Rodgers and Martin lived near each other in Connecticut, and after her tour Rodgers invited Martin and her husband, Richard Halliday, to his home to hear the three songs for the musical that he had completed, none of them for Nellie. [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] especially struck Martin, and although disappointed the song was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> she agreed to do the part. Although Nellie and Emile were already fully developed characters in Michener's stories, during the creation of South Pacific, Rodgers, Hammerstein and Logan began to adapt the roles specifically to the talents of Martin and Pinza and to tailor the music for their voices.|$|E
500|$|Some episodes {{revolve around}} {{characters}} other than Kim and Ron, particularly villains, {{who have been}} provided with nearly as much back story as the heroes. Other significant recurring characters include Kim's parents, Drs. James and Ann Possible (Gary Cole and Jean Smart, respectively), and her younger brothers, twin geniuses Jim and Tim (Shaun Fleming, seasons 1–3; Spencer Fox, season 4), to whom she refers as [...] "Tweebs" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "twin" [...] and [...] "dweebs"); the twins speak their own made up language known as [...] "Twinnish". Kim shares a bitter rivalry with fellow cheerleader Bonnie Rockwaller (Kirsten Storms), a popular schoolmate who, unlike Kim, is snobby, selfish and generally unkind towards others – her [...] "polar opposite", essentially respresenting {{the kind of person}} Kim could have been if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> humility. Kim's best female friend is Monique (Raven-Symoné), who is occasionally forced into accompanying Kim on select missions when Ron is unavailable. With her fashion and pop culture expertise, Monique bridges the worlds between Kim's high school and crime-fighting lives, also serving as something of a guidance counselor. Although Drakken and Shego are Kim and Ron's most frequent opponents, the characters occasionally battle a diverse cast of other villains, namely Monkey Fist (Tom Kane), who Ron particularly dislikes due to his fear of monkeys; Scottish golfer Duff Killigan; father-son billionaires Señor Senior, Sr. and Señor Senior, Jr, who treat villainy as a hobby out of boredom, and Professor Dementor (Patton Oswalt).|$|E

However, on February 5, 2009, the series showcases Todd's admittance that the sex was indeed rape; the confession is made to Marty and others as Todd concurs Marty would have never been sexually intimate with him if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> mental disability and his manipulation of her, and that he now genuinely considers the act to have been rape.|$|E

However, before the trial was concluded, Meinhof was found hanged by a rope, fashioned from a towel, in her cell in the Stammheim Prison on 9 May 1976. It is highly probable that, if <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> death, {{she would have been}} sentenced to 'life imprisonment plus 15 years'.

2500|$|The initial {{concept for}} Faith's {{character}} was [...] "the road not taken", a Slayer {{who makes the}} wrong choices in life. She {{is intended to be}} a reflection of Buffy, and what Buffy could have become were it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> support system of friends and family. The question the writers wanted to answer was, despite being made from the same [...] "raw materials," [...] how would upbringing and environment affect the type of people they would become later in life? Joss Whedon describes her as everything Buffy would never let herself become; although Buffy is tempted by Faith's approach to slaying, she ultimately decides not to make the same choices herself. Some fans argued that the show developed a lesbian subtext between Faith and Buffy; Jane Espenson states that Whedon says he didn't intend this, but admitted it was there after he had it pointed out to him, jokingly attributing this to his subconscious.|$|E

Aika considers herself reliable, especially compared to distractible Akari and antisocial Alice, but both her friends call her a crybaby for her tendency to tear up when emotional. She is proud of her gondola skill as an undine, and can be very competitive about it.
