So standard definition of complexity (a la A. <b>N.</b> Kolmogorov) is <b>not</b> <b>applicable.</b> New approach is needed. Here you find one natural way to define complexity {{in the case of}} infinite countable languages. Besides, some known results about continuous fractions and some news, drawing from this new approach are stated. There are new tasks related with the complexity distributions and efficiency of a description language. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R

Exception: Until practices for form and style of nonroman script references are * established, name authority records with nonroman script references should contain value “b ” * (Tracings are not necessarily consistent with the heading) in 008 / 29 (Reference evaluation). * Although much work was done prior {{to the adoption of}} AACR 2 to identify the correct AACR 2 heading, {{it was not possible to}} do this in advance for references. Near the end of 1980, a new fixed field (008 / 29) was added to the authorities format to indicate explicitly the status of the references with regard to the heading. The values in this byte of the fixed field are a = tracings are consistent with the heading * b = tracings are not necessarily consistent with the heading * <b>n</b> = <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> (i. e., there are no references in the record) * For records in the automated file and coded for AACR 2 at the time of the "flip " of the name authority file on November 15, 1980, the value "b " was automatically added to all records with {{cross references}} and "n " to all records without references.

40|$|Laboratories in a {{checklist}} format. The policies, procedures {{and activities of}} laboratories performing field tests or calibrations must meet these requirements. Management system documentation and supporting records must be available for the assessor’s review. Before the assessment, the laboratory is asked to complete all of the document reference identifiers associated with the each of the requirements within a thick, black border. This helps both the laboratory and the assessor(s) prepare for the assessment and may save {{a significant amount of}} assessment time and cost. The appropriate “document reference ” should include quality manual, laboratory manual, SOP, etc. references. The noted references should specify procedure number, page number and section number, if possible, where each checklist item is addressed. A 2 LA Assessor Instructions: Review the laboratory’s documented management system to verify compliance with the applicable Field Testing/Calibration criteria documentation requirements. Assess to verify that the documented management system is indeed implemented as described.

40|$|The {{following}} pages present the Forensic Examination Accreditation Program specific requirements. The policies, procedures {{and activities of}} organizations performing forensic inspections must meet these requirements. Management system documentation and supporting records must be available for the assessor’s review. Requirements (clauses) that include {{the need for a}} written policy, procedure or arrangement have a thick, black border. Inspection Body (IB) Instructions: This checklist must be completed and submitted as part of the application for accreditation in order to help both the IB and assessor(s) prepare for the assessment. Correct completion of this checklist may save a significant amount of assessment time and cost. Complete the document reference identifiers in the checklist's second column (labeled "Reference") for all requirements within a thick, black border. The appropriate “reference ” must identify the document (quality manual, laboratory manual, SOPs, etc) and include a “locator ” to facilitate identification of the appropriate portion(s) of the relevant document (page number, section number, etc.) The management system documentation and supporting records must be available for the assessor's review.
