25|$|Collaboration systems {{utilizing}} Operational Transformations typically use replicated document storage, {{where each}} client {{has their own}} copy of the document; clients operate on their local copies in a lock-free, <b>non-blocking</b> manner, and the changes are then propagated {{to the rest of}} the clients; this ensures the client high responsiveness in an otherwise high-latency environment such as the Internet. When a client receives the changes propagated from another client, it typically transforms the changes before executing them; the transformation ensures that application-dependent consistency criteria (invariants) are maintained by all sites. This mode of operation results in a system particularly suited for implementing collaboration features, like simultaneous document editing, in a high-latency environment such as the web.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} systems also made forays into GUI-based interfaces, either using {{character}} graphics sent from the host, or using custom GUI-based terminal systems. The latter initially appeared, unsurprisingly, on the Amiga and Macintosh platform, where TeleFinder and FirstClass became very popular. FirstClass offered {{a host of}} features that would be difficult or impossible under a terminal-based solution, including bi-directional information flow and <b>non-blocking</b> operation that allowed the user to exchange files in both directions while continuing to use the message system and chat, all in separate windows. Skypix featured on Amiga a complete markup language. It used a standardized set of icons to indicate mouse driven commands available online and to recognize different filetypes present on BBS storage media. It was capable to transmit data like images, audio files, and audio clips between users linked to same BBS or off-line if BBS was in the circuit of FidoNet organization.|$|E
25|$|The {{microkernel}} {{concept was}} introduced {{in an effort to}} reverse the trend towards larger kernels and return to a system in which most tasks were completed by smaller utilities. In an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a data terminal for input and output (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as most I/O was linear. However, modern systems include networking and other new devices. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a mouse. In the 1980s, <b>non-blocking</b> I/O and the set of inter-process communication mechanisms were augmented with Unix domain sockets, shared memory, message queues, and semaphores. In microkernel implementations, functions such as network protocols could be moved out of the kernel, while conventional (monolithic) Unix implementations have network protocol stacks as part of the kernel.|$|E

Any reversible cellular automaton may be simulated by a reversible block cellular automaton with a larger number of states; however, because of the undecidability of reversibility for <b>non-block</b> cellular automata, there is no computable bound on the radius of the regions in the <b>non-block</b> automaton that correspond to blocks in the simulation, and the translation from a <b>non-block</b> rule to a block rule is also not computable.|$|R

As shown in Figure S 3, the glucose also can be isolated. It seemed that the “blocking” molecules showed no influence to the isolation of glucose. Because in the simple samples, which contained less interferents, the nonspecific absorptions of peptides or proteins are not existed, the glucose can be isolated by the <b>non-blocked</b> PMNPs. The <b>non-blocked</b> PMNPs would be applied to isolate complex glycans from biological samples to further study whether the “blocking” molecules can deplete the nonspecific absorption of peptide or proteins.|$|R
25|$|In a federated {{database}} {{system or}} any other more loosely defined multidatabase system, which are typically distributed in a communication network, transactions span multiple (and possibly distributed) databases. Enforcing global serializability in such system, where different databases may use different types of concurrency control, is problematic. Even if every local schedule of a single database is serializable, the global schedule of a whole system is not necessarily serializable. The massive communication exchanges of conflict information needed between databases to reach conflict serializability globally would lead to unacceptable performance, primarily due to computer and communication latency. Achieving global serializability effectively over different types of concurrency control has been open for several years. Commitment ordering (or Commit ordering; CO), a serializability technique publicly introduced in 1991 by Yoav Raz from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), provides an effective general solution for global (conflict) serializability across any collection of database systems and other transactional objects, with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. CO does not need the distribution of conflict information, but rather utilizes the already needed (unmodified) atomic commitment protocol messages without any further communication between databases. It also allows optimistic (<b>non-blocking)</b> implementations. CO generalizes Strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which {{in conjunction with the}} Two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is the de facto standard for achieving global serializability across (SS2PL based) database systems. As a result, CO compliant database systems (with any, different concurrency control types) can transparently join existing SS2PL based solutions for global serializability. The same applies also to all other multiple (transactional) object systems that use atomic transactions and need global serializability for correctness (see examples above; nowadays such need is not smaller than with database systems, the origin of atomic transactions).|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the anaesthetic, vasodilator, and post-operative analgesic sparing effect of bilateral sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) in patients undergoing endoscopic endo-nasal trans-sphenoidal surgery. MethodsThirty adult patients of ASA (I, II), aged 20 – 60 years, were randomly allocated to either the block group or the <b>non-block</b> group (n= 15, for each). After establishment of general anesthesia with sevoflurane and 100 % oxygen, the patients received bilateral SPGB with 1. 5 ml of either 0. 5 % bupivacaine (block group) or 0. 9 % NaCl (<b>non-block</b> group). Intra-operative mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained at 60 – 65 mmHg by using nitroglycerine. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration required to maintain bispectral index values (40 – 50) throughout the operation was recorded. Nitroglycerine and propranolol consumption, blood loss, recovery profile, perioperative catecholamines, post-operative pain and meperidine consumption were evaluated. ResultsBlock group showed significant decrease in sevoflurane and nitroglycerine consumption, blood loss, emergence time and time needed to achieve⩾ 9 Aldrete score, P< 0. 0001. All patients in non-blockade group (100 %) were supplemented by nitroglycerine to achieve the target MAP versus 9 patients (60 %) in the block group (P< 0. 01). Propranolol administration was necessary in 9 patients (60 %) in the <b>non-block</b> group versus 3 patients (20 %) in the block group, P< 0. 05. At PACU, visual analogue pain score and number of patients received meperidine analgesia were significantly less in the block group versus <b>non-block</b> group, P< 0. 0001 and P< 0. 001, respectively. Intra- and post-operative plasma epinephrine and nor-epinephrine levels were significantly higher in the <b>non-block</b> group than the block group, P< 0. 05.

Thirty patients were randomly allocated to receive GA alone (<b>non-block</b> group, n = 15) or combined GA and SPGB (block group, 15). The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) intraoperatively was maintained at 55 - 60 mm Hg. The consumption of isoflurane and the frequency of esmolol use were evaluated in both groups. The recovery time was recorded. A scoring system named Postoperative Respiratory System Evaluation Scoring (PRSES), was formed for evaluation of postoperative respiratory complications The pain intensity, postoperative tramadol consumption in both groups were also assessed. Intraoperatively, the isoflurane consumption was less in block group (p< 0. 001). The number of patients requiring esmolol was significantly higher in <b>non-block</b> group. Recovery time was longer in <b>non-block</b> group. PRSESs in all evaluation times were better in block group. In the PACU the total tramadol consumption was significantly reduced in block group (p<= 0. 005). Postoperative pain scores were lower in block group until 150 min. Other postoperative complications were more frequent in <b>non-block</b> group at all evaluation times. Bilateral SPGB combined with GA is effective in reducing blood loss, isoflurane consumption, hypotensive agent use, postoperative PRSESs 2 - 5, other complications, tramadol consumption and postoperative pain intensity in sinonasal surgery and associated with better recovery profiles and accepted surgeon and patient satisfaction...|$|R

As shown in Figure S 5, {{the influence of the}} “blocking” molecules was obviously. The <b>non-blocked</b> PMNPs were not able to enrich the N-glycans efficiently, just a few glycans ion peaks were observed, and they were strongly depressed by the ion peaks of the nonspecific absorbed peptides. The MS results (Fig.  5; Figure S 5) indicated that the “blocking” molecules can deplete the nonspecific absorptions effectively. The influence of the “blocking” molecules indicated that the binding of saccharides and PMNPs are associated with the compositions of the samples and nano-environment of PBA. For glucose isolation, because it is standard samples without other absorbed competitors, the glucose can be isolated by the <b>non-blocked</b> PMNPs; but for the biological samples, the glycans always coexisted with the peptides or proteins, PMNPs without “blocking” molecules could absorb these interferents, the ion peaks of the peptides would strongly depress the peaks of glycans.

40|$|Abstract—Differential, {{transmitted}} reference (TR) {{and energy}} detection (ED) based ultra-wideband impulse radios (UWB-IR) can collect the rich multipath energy offered by UWB channels with a low-complexity receiver. However, they perform satisfactorily {{only when the}} channel induced inter-pulse interference (IPI) is negligible. This {{can be achieved by}} appending a guard interval with duration {{greater than or equal to}} the channel’s delay spread to each frame – an operation limiting the maximum achievable data rate. As a remedy, this Letter advocates block transmissions in conjunction with orthogonal spreading sequences to remove the introduced IPI. The resultant scheme requires no channel knowledge besides timing offset and incurs slightly more complexity than <b>non-block</b> alternatives, while it increases the data rate at no cost in error performance. Given a fixed data rate of 25 Mbps, the novel block scheme exhibits about 1. 8 dB gain relative to its <b>non-block</b> counterpart in single-user simulated tests.
