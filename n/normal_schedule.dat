5|$|The Indonesian Transport Ministry {{said that}} if the {{aircraft}} showed signs of problems, the checks would be expanded to cover all 737s operating in Indonesia. On 5 March, it was reported that five of the six aircraft had returned to normal operations, but the sixth was still undergoing a full maintenance overhaul at maintenance, repair and overhaul firm, GMF AeroAsia facility.

5|$|October 4 also {{provided}} another worrying incident to Egyptian commanders, who {{became aware that}} evening that EgyptAir, the country's national airline, had canceled all its flights and was arranging the protection of its civil air fleet by dispersing its aircraft to refuges outside Egypt. The orders came from the Minister of Aviation, Ahmed Nuh. General Headquarters quickly intervened to reverse the dispersal orders, and by October 5 flights were back to their <b>normal</b> <b>schedule.</b> It was believed the incident was a breach of security and a leak on Egyptian plans for war. It was not clear to Egyptian commanders however, whether the Israelis {{were aware of the}} incident.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War in Europe having {{ended in}} May 1945, {{it was only}} {{possible}} to arrange eleven first-class matches in the 1945 English cricket season and so 1946, despite postwar recovery and continued rationing, was the first season in which a <b>normal</b> <b>schedule</b> of matches could be established in the County Championship and in Test cricket {{with the arrival of}} the Indian tourists.|$|E
25|$|Cricket in World War II was {{severely}} disrupted {{in most of}} the countries where first-class cricket is played.

25|$|SU Agen {{would go}} on to win three titles during the 1960s as well. Lourdes were also the champions of the 1968 season, but due to the May 1968 events, the finale was played three weeks behind <b>normal</b> <b>schedule.</b> At the end of {{regulation}} time the score was tied at 6–6, and then 9–9 after extra-time. Lourdes were declared champions because they had scored two tries to Toulon’s none and also because it was impossible to reschedule a third final so late, as the French national team were to leave on a tour to New Zealand and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Another local holiday observing {{an event}} in the American Revolutionary War is Bunker Hill Day. State workers outside Suffolk County are allowed to choose any two days off in lieu of celebrating Evacuation Day and Bunker Hill Day on the {{observance}} days. The two holidays are generally not observed by the private businesses. In Charlestown, where the Battle of Bunker Hill took place, there are week-long celebrations culminating in a road race and a parade. Some government services remain in operation, such as trash pickup in the City of Boston and all state Registry of Motor Vehicle offices. The MBTA runs a <b>normal</b> <b>schedule</b> but, due to special events, prohibits bicycles on the subway.|$|E

25|$|Yorktown {{emerged from}} the {{shipyard}} in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That {{tour of duty in}} the Far East consisted of a <b>normal</b> <b>schedule</b> of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October 1962, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, then on to Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines in the Far East. During that deployment, she served as flagship for Carrier Division 19. She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the SEATO ASW exercise, Operation Sea Serpent. The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.|$|E
25|$|Iberia {{departed}} London on {{her maiden}} voyage on 28 September 1954. From there, {{she crossed the}} Mediterranean Sea, calling in at Port Said before passing through the Suez Canal. It was here that she had her first mishap, grounding on the sandy bottom. Breakfast was being served {{at the time and}} passengers in the 1st Class Dining Room were given a fine view of the waters of the Canal as she listed about 15 degrees to port. She continued into the Red Sea and, after calling in at Aden, she traversed the Indian Ocean calling in at Mumbai (known as Bombay then), Colombo, Fremantle, Western Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, and Melbourne, Victoria, before arriving at Sydney in New South Wales, Australia on 1 November 1954. Iberia operated on this route for most of her working life. On 27 March 1956, while on her standard itinerary from London to Sydney and offshore of the island of Sri Lanka, she collided with the tanker , resulting in a gash amidships in her upper port decks, as well as damage to the bow of Stanvec Pretoria. Fortuitously, neither of the ships was put in danger of sinking. It was only after 17 days of repairs in Sydney that Iberia resumed her <b>normal</b> <b>schedule.</b>|$|E
500|$|Starting with August 7, the PTC resumed its <b>normal</b> <b>schedule</b> {{and there}} were no further disruptions. The troops {{remained}} in Philadelphia for another week and a half and rode as guards on PTC vehicles, but encountered no further problems. Seven of the eight black trainees resumed their training (one withdrew voluntarily because his duties as Jehovah's Witness minister conflicted with the PTC work schedule). On August 9, the PTC finally agreed to a favorable contact which had been approved by the TWU in June. On August 17, Hayes returned full control of the public transportation network to the PTC. Subsequent integration of black employees into the PTC workforce proceeded with no further trouble. [...] By December 1944 the PTC had 18 black streetcar operators. An attractive new union contract helped quell the remaining discontent among the white PTC workers. Within a year, the company had over 900 black employees working in a variety of positions, including as drivers and conductors.|$|E

50|$|The RAAF ceased ‘public {{transport}} operations’ on 15 December 1989, by 31 December 1989 regular leasing {{of seats}} on international flights ceased and, by 12 January 1990, the Government ceased its waiver of landing charges. The airlines {{were able to}} slowly return to <b>normal</b> <b>schedules</b> as they hired replacement pilots. Thus no specific date can be set for when the dispute stopped impacting flights, tourism and the economy.|$|R
25|$|Before the Games of the XXX Olympiad it was {{reported}} that over £7 million (in 2011) was invested in the terminal to extend the Central Search area and adding other improvements. During the Games, though, the airport operated only restricted hours and experienced street block closures (for security), and the low capacity ramp and short runway excluded most long-range arrivals. However, it was the closest airport to Olympic Park, with <b>normal</b> <b>scheduled</b> travel by road of 15 min.|$|R
500|$|Some film {{sequences}} {{were shot}} {{with up to}} 14 cameras, significantly more than the norm at that time. There were many difficulties with the film's lighting; cinematographer Mathur reportedly took eight hours to light a single shot. In total, 500 days of shooting were needed, compared to a <b>normal</b> <b>schedule</b> of 60 to 125 shooting days at the time. Owing to the very large size of the Sheesh Mahal set, the lighting {{was provided by the}} headlights of 500 trucks and about 100 reflectors. The presence of the mirrors on the set caused problems, as they sparkled under the lights. Foreign consultants, including British director David Lean, told Asif to forget the idea since they felt {{that it was impossible to}} film the scene under the intense glare. Asif confined himself to the set with the lighting crew, and subsequently overcame the problem by covering all the mirrors with a thin layer of wax, thereby subduing their reflectivity. Mathur also used strategically placed strips of cloth to implement [...] "bounce lighting", which reduced the glare.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the damage}} wrought by Nina, President Corazon Aquino {{declared}} four Luzon provinces a disaster area. Initially, only 11 provinces were {{declared a state}} of emergency, but by November29, this total increased to 17. United States Ambassador Nicholas Platt released $25,000in emergency aid and sent officials to help with relief efforts. The American Red Cross also provided $24,000worth of aid to post-storm victims. The Roman Catholic Church also provided $160,000 worth of food to the nation. Additionally, Social Welfare and Development Secretary Mita Pardo de Tavera donated $50,000for emergency disaster relief, though many locals complained that this aid was too little and too late. Around [...] of rice was donated for use in eight provinces, and on December1, an additional [...] pounds of aid was airlifted to the region. Belgium also launched a four-month program to help 380,000post-storm victims. Most flights in and out of Manila had returned to a <b>normal</b> <b>schedule</b> by November28. In all, nine countries and several foreign Red Cross organizations responded by providing aid, totaling roughly $700,000worth of value, mostly from Japan. PAGASA later retired the name Sisang on the list of tropical cyclones in the country; it was replaced by Sendang.|$|E
500|$|Harrison acted quite {{independently}} {{in selecting}} his cabinet, {{much to the}} dismay of the Republican bosses. He began by delaying the presumed nomination of James G. Blaine as Secretary of State so as to preclude Blaine's involvement {{in the formation of the}} administration, as had occurred in President Garfield's term. In fact, other than Blaine, the only Republican boss initially nominated was Redfield Proctor, as Secretary of War. Senator Shelby Cullom's comment symbolizes Harrison's steadfast aversion to use federal positions for patronage: [...] "I suppose Harrison treated me as well as he did any other Senator; but whenever he did anything for me, it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please." [...] Harrison's selections shared particular alliances – such as their service in the Civil War, Indiana citizenship and membership in the Presbyterian Church. Nevertheless, Harrison with these choices had alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future. Harrison's <b>normal</b> <b>schedule</b> provided for two full cabinet meetings per week, as well as separate weekly one-on-one meetings with each cabinet member.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, the pregame show {{returned}} full-time, prompting another {{change in}} <b>scheduling.</b> The <b>normal</b> <b>scheduling</b> in 2012 and 2013 {{was for the}} pregame airing at either 12:30 or 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The pregame {{would not be a}} part of Fox's exclusive window, which began with the game telecast starting a half-hour later. The scheduling did not change for the spring prime time games, however, as the scheduling for these games remained the same as in 2010 and 2011.|$|R
