40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} among 13 Quebec isolates of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), 4 reference strains and 2 American isolates {{were studied}} by <b>peroxidase-linked</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> (PLA assay) and neutralization test (NT). The Quebec strains consisted of 3 isolates before 1993 and 10 isolates from 1993. In the PLA assay, we compared 2 different fixatives, acetone and formalin. Acetone-fixation {{allowed us to}} identify 6 groups from amongst the viruses tested. All the Quebec isolates were different from the reference strains. In addition, antigenic variation was detected between Quebec isolates obtained before and during 1993. However, PLA assays performed after formalin fixation did not detect these antigenic variations. Neutralization tests were carried out with 2 polyclonal antibodies (PAb) and 6 monoclonal antibodies (MAb). They were used to classify BVDV strains and isolates into 4 groups and 7 subgroups respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the BVDV isolates from the 1993 outbreak in Quebec are antigenically different from reference strains and from isolates existing in Quebec before 1993. In addition, we have shown that 2 internationally used fixation-methods in PLA assay give different results. The usefulness of each method is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{performance}} characteristics and diagnostic {{value of a}} monoclonal antibody-based radioimmu-noassay for serum total thyroxine (Mallinckrodt) are described. Between-batch precision (coefficient of Varia-tion) was 10. 4 % at 87 nmol/ 1 and 3. 3 % at 185 nmolA Scatchard analysis revealed a linear plot with a Ka of 5. 4 x 108 1 /mol. Sensitivity was 4. 5 nmol/ 1 of thyroxine. An association study showed that the assay reached equilibrium well within the specified incubation time. Cross-reaction of triiodothyronine and reverse triiodothyronine in the assay was 0. 6 % and 25. 0 % respectively. Analytical recovery was 91 — 110 %. Linearity was well demonstrated but dilutions of {{a high concentration of}} thyroxine in serum did not parallel the Standard curve. The correlation coefficient for comparison with a polyclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> was 0. 95 for 83 patients. The diagnostic accuracy of the monoclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> was adequate for most patients with thyroid disease, pregnant women, oral contraceptive users and subjects on thyroxine-replacement therapy.

40|$|Objective: Cytotoxin-{{associated}} gene (CagA) -bearing Helicobacter pylori strains {{have been}} associated with significant gastroduodenal pathologies. We have performed a study to evaluate the prevalence of CagA-bearing strains in a group of H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer disease and non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) patients, and healthy asymptomatic controls. Method: Two hundred ninety-seven peptic ulcer disease, 45 NUD subjects, and 200 asymptomatic controls were studied. The newly developed anti-CagA <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> was used {{for the purpose of this}} study. The assay was performed by a conventional three-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the concentration of anti-CagA antibody present in the tested sera against the recombinant CagA 17 / 12 fusion protein. The final results were expressed with reference to a standard curve constructed from pooled CagA+ sera. Anti-CagA <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> reproducibility was assessed by intraplate and interplate variations. Results: The mean intraplate and interplate variations were 8. 0 % and 11. 2 %, respectively. Anti-CagA antibody was present in 165 / 197 (84 %) duodenal ulcer disease, 80 / 100 (80 %) gastric ulcer disease, 25 / 45 (55. 6 %) NUD subjects, and 29 / 100 (29 %) asymptomatic controls. The ulcer disease subjects were significantly more likely than the NUD subjects and the asymptomatic controls to have a positive anti-CagA <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> (p < 0. 005 and p < 0. 001, respectively). Moreover, the NUD subjects were more likely to be anti- CagA+ than the asymptomatic controls (p < 0. 005). Conclusions: This newly developed anti-CagA <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> was highly reproducible. Anti-CagA antibody positivity was present in a significantly higher percentage of peptic ulcer disease subjects than in non-ulcer and asymptomatic healthy controls.

METHODS: Conjunctival scraping samples were obtained from 177 patients who {{were divided into two}} groups: avernal keratoconjunctivitis group (group A) and a control group (group B). The {{polymerase chain reaction}} and adirect fluorescent <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> were performed. Sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curves,and areas under the curve were calculated for both tests in groups A and B. Receiver operating characteristic curveswere plotted using a categorical variable with only two possible outcomes (positive and negative). RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between vernal keratoconjunctivitis and Chlamydia trachomatis infection detected by a direct fluorescent <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> with high sensitivity and specificity. Allpatients in group A with positive polymerase chain reactions also presented with positive direct fluorescentantibody assays. CONCLUSION: The association between vernal keratoconjunctivitis and Chlamydia trachomatis infection wasconfirmed by positive direct fluorescent <b>antibody</b> <b>assays</b> in 49. 4 % of vernal keratoconjunctivitis patients and bypositive polymerase chain reactions in 20 % of these patients. The direct fluorescent <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> detectedChlamydia trachomatis in a higher number of patients than did the polymerase chain reaction. Although thediagnosis of trachoma is essentially clinical, the disease may not be detected in vernal keratoconjunctivitis patients. Due to the high frequency of chlamydial infection detected in patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, we suggestconsidering routine laboratory tests to detect Chlamydia trachomatis in patients with severe and refractory allergicdisease.

40|$|BackgroundIncreasing {{evidence}} implicates {{immune response}} as {{a contributing factor}} in the failure of allograft valve transplants. Increases in panel reactive antibodies {{have been identified in}} human subjects. To correlate these responses with novel preimplantation processing methods to reduce cellularity, both a relevant panel reactive <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> and a chronic implantation animal model are necessary. We modified a human flow cytometric panel reactive <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> for ovine model use to detect antibody responses to residual antigen-loading decellularized scaffolds engineered from pulmonary artery tissue. MethodsA clinical panel reactive <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> was modified with anti-sheep antibodies. Dimethyl sulfoxide cryopreserved (n = 4) and decellularized scaffolds (n = 8) fashioned as patches from pulmonary arteries were implanted for study. Fresh (nonprocessed) tissue implants were used as positive controls (n = 2), and sham-treated animals were used as negative controls (n = 2). Baseline, 10 -week, and 20 -week blood samples were assayed for panel reactive antibody levels. Immunohistochemistry with anti–major histocompatibility complex antibodies were performed on preimplantation scaffolds. ResultsChronic implants of fresh tissue stimulated strong panel reactive antibody responses. Classically cryopreserved tissues provoked modest panel reactive antibody responses to major histocompatibility complex I antigen and no response to major histocompatibility complex II antigen. Decellularized tissue scaffolds provoked minimal to no panel reactive antibody responses to either major histocompatibility complex I or II antigen. Immunohistochemistry correlated with the panel reactive antibody results by identifying significant amounts of major histocompatibility complex I and II in fresh tissue, reduced antigen staining in cryopreserved control tissues, and minimal amounts in decellularized tissues. ConclusionsThese studies with an ovine modified panel reactive <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> confirmed minimal immune allosensitization to transplanted decellularized tissue patches. Qualifying criteria for putative tissue-engineered scaffolds should include minimal recipient panel reactive antibody response...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe John Cunningham virus (JCV) is a {{generally}} benign and asymptomatic polyomavirus. Due to {{an association of}} the anti-integrin agent natalizumab with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a newly developed anti-JCV <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> has been implemented as a risk-stratification tool for natalizumab-treated patients with MS. This viewpoint offers insight and perspective regarding the potential unapproved use of the anti-JCV <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and examines how rheumatologists can best assist patients. MethodsA primary literature search was conducted to identify articles {{on the number of}} cases of PML associated with natalizumab in patients with MS, the number of cases of PML associated with patients with rheumatic disease, PML incidence in the general population, serum-based assays to detect JCV exposure, and clinical PML presentation and treatment methods. ResultsRisk of PML in patients with RA receiving biologics appears orders of magnitude lower than that expected in natalizumab-treated patients with MS (1 in 1000). If patients with RA are risk stratified assuming an anti-JCV antibody seropositivity of 60 %, theoretically 23, 400 anti-JCV antibody-positive patients would have to receive rituximab before potentially observing 1 PML case. ConclusionsData currently indicate that rheumatologists should not order the anti-JCV <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> for patients requiring biologics. Monitoring relevant symptoms indicative of emerging PML might provide greater value to patients, thus prompting interventional measures that could affect prognosis...|$|R

Results: Out of 200 pregnant women, 38 (19 &#x 0025;) were found positive for Chlamydia trachomatis antigen. Out of the 68 symptomatic patients, C. trachomatis antigen was detected in 26. 4 &#x 0025;. After verification of the positive samples 13. 6 &#x 0025; of the asymptomatic pregnant women {{were found to be}} harbouring the infection in their genital tract. Two (5. 2 &#x 0025;) out of the 38 positive samples, on verification with the blocking <b>antibody</b> <b>assay,</b> were found to be false positive by IDEIA,TM thus the specificity of the IDEIATM being 94. 8 &#x 0025;. In patients with previous history of abortions, 27. 7 &#x 0025; were tested positive for C. trachomatis infection. Conclusions: Significant number of pregnant women shad C. trachomatis antigen in their endocervical canal, which can be easily diagnosed by this simple enzyme immuno assay having a specificity of 94. 8 &#x 0025;. Verification of positive results by <b>antibody</b> blocking <b>assay</b> can further improve the specificity of this non-culture test.

40|$|AbstractThe {{diagnostic}} {{impact of}} PCR-based detection {{was compared to}} single-serum IgM antibody measurement and IgG antibody seroconversion during an outbreak of Chlamydophila pneumoniae in a military community. Nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR-based detection, and serum, were obtained from 127 conscripts during the outbreak. Serum, drawn many months before the outbreak, provided the baseline antibody status. C. pneumoniae IgM and IgG <b>antibodies</b> were <b>assayed</b> using microimmunofluorescence (MIF), enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and recombinant ELISA (rELISA). Two reference standard tests were applied: (i) C. pneumoniae PCR; and (ii) assay of C. pneumoniae IgM antibodies, defined as positive if ≥ 2 IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>assays</b> (i. e. rELISA with MIF and/or EIA) were positive. In 33 subjects, of whom two tested negative according to IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>assays</b> and IgG seroconversion, C. pneumoniae DNA was detected by PCR. The sensitivities were 79 %, 85 %, 88 % and 68 %, respectively, and the specificities were 86 %, 84 %, 78 % and 93 %, respectively, for MIF IgM, EIA IgM, rELISA IgM and PCR. In two subjects, acute infection was diagnosed {{on the basis of}} IgG antibody seroconversion alone. The sensitivity of PCR detection was lower than that of any IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>assay.</b> This may be explained by the late sampling, or clearance of the organism following antibiotic treatment. The results of assay evaluation studies are affected not only by the choice of reference standard tests, but also by the timing of sampling for the different test principles used. On the basis of these findings, a combination of nasopharyngeal swabbing for PCR detection and specific single-serum IgM measurement is recommended in cases of acute respiratory C. pneumoniae infection...|$|R
