Moses and Joshua provided six cities of refuge--Bezer, Golan, Ramoth, Kadesh, Schekem and Hebron--to which one who had taken life inadvertently could flee when hunted by relatives of the deceased. This admirable expedient supplied him with wholesome exercise and enabled them to enjoy {{the pleasures of the}} chase; whereby the soul of the dead man was appropriately honored by observations akin to the funeral games of early Greece.|$|E

In reality we cannot have partial samples so n − ½ (2.5 for n = 3) is approximately <b>n.</b> <b>Anything</b> less than n − ½ is approximately n − 1 (2 if n = 3) and is not valid {{because we want to}} find the probability band that contains n observations, not n − 1 samples.

"I do {{not want}} you to tell me, <b>Ned,</b> <b>anything</b> that happens at home--God forbid that I should pry into matters so sacred as {{relations}} between a boy and a parent!--but I can see, my boy, that something is wrong. You are not yourself. At first when you came back I thought all was well with you; you were, as was natural, sad and depressed, but I should not wish it otherwise. But of late a change has come ever you; you are nervous and excited; you have gone down in your class, not, I can see, because you have neglected your work, but because you cannot bring your mind to bear upon it. Now all this must have a cause. Perhaps a little advice on my part might help you. We shall break up in a week, Ned, and I shall be going away for a time. I should like to think before I went that things were going on better with you." ...|$|R

Nothing was known of the fate of the colonists, though {{surprise}} had been felt at not receiving any visits from their vessels. The intercourse had not been great of late, and most of the Kannakas had come away. Soon after the Woolstons had left, the especial friends of humanity, and the almost exclusive lovers of the [...] "people" [...] having begun to oppress them by exacting more work than was usual, and forgetting to pay for it. These men could say but little about the condition of the colony beyond this fact. Not only they, but all in the group, however, could render some account of the awful earthquake of the last season, which, by their descriptions, greatly exceeded <b>n</b> violence <b>anything</b> formerly known in those regions.

Theorem 1 Let z: SL → [0, 1] satisfy (P 1 - 2) and let L + be L augmented by additional constants bi, i ∈ N +. Then there is a probability function w on SL + satisfying (P 1 - 3) which agrees with z on SL. Proof We work in a non-standard universe, more precisely a nonstandard ω 1 -saturated elementary extension, U ∗ say, of a sufficiently large portion U of the set theoretic universe containing z, L, <b>N</b> and <b>anything</b> else that we might need as we go along.

5000|$|In-place {{can have}} {{slightly}} different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm {{can only have}} a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log <b>n),</b> though sometimes <b>anything</b> in o(n) is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in {{whether or not to}} count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given {{in terms of the number}} of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log n factor compared to an analysis that ignores the length of indices and pointers.|$|R

40|$|The Semantic Web drives {{towards the}} use of the Web for {{interacting}} with logically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies {{the use of}} rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert <b>anything.</b> <b>N</b> 3 Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of N 3 Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N 3 Logic and illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web. Comment: To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP...|$|R
40|$|Th e {{challenge}} {{of climate change}} demands reduction in global CO 2 emissions. In order to fi ght global warming many coun- tries are looking at technological solutions to keep the release of CO 2 into the atmosphere under control. One {{of the most promising}} techniques is carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), also known as CO 2 geological storage. CCS can re- duce the world’s total CO 2 release by about one quarter by 2050 (IEA 2008, 2013; Metz et al. 2005). CCS usually in- volves a series of steps: (1) separation of the CO 2 from the gases produced by large power plants or other point sources, (2) compression of the CO 2 into supercritical fl uid, (3) trans- portation to a storage location and (4) injecting it into deep underground geological formations. CO 2 StoP is an acronym for the CO 2 Storage Potential in Europe project. Th e CO 2 StoP project which started in Janu- ary 2012 and ended in October 2014 included data from 27 countries (Fig. 1). Th e data necessary to assess potential loca- tions of CO 2 storage resources are found in a database set up in the project. A data analysis system was developed to analyse the com- plex data in the database, as well as a geographical informa- tion system (GIS) that can display the location of potential geological storage formations, individual units of assessment within the formations and any further subdivisions (daugh- ter units, such as hydrocarbon reservoirs or potential struc- tural traps in saline aquifers). Finally, formulae have been developed to calculate the storage resources. Th e database is housed at the Joint Research Centre, the European Commis- sion in Petten, the Netherlands.
