40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Narrow</b> <b>groove</b> welding is an {{important}} technique for increasing pro-ductivity {{in the manufacture of}} thick-walled components. The nature of the process demands an automated approach and precise control to ensure consistently high weld quality. The most important ob-jective of <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> welding is to maintain uniform and sufficient penetra-tion at both groove faces. Several different approaches, such as wire bending tech-nique and wire rotating method, have been adopted in an attempt to minimize the incomplete fusion in the <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> GMAW process. In this study, a welding system using electromagnetic arc oscillation was developed for <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> welding. The electromagnet for applying a magnetic field to the welding arc was designed from the electromag-netic analysis results. This paper shows the arc and bead characteristics in <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> GMAW using electromagnetic arc oscillation. Based on the results, the ap-propriate welding and oscillation condi-tions were selected to satisfy high weld quality. Consequently, magnetic arc oscil-lation resulted in uniform and sufficient penetration to both groove faces. Arc sig-nal characteristics for automatic joint tracking were also investigated. The peri-odic change of welding current in electro-magnetic arc oscillation was examined by experiments and numerical analysis. To establish the mathematical model of the arc sensor, some assumptions were needed to calculate the arc length. Ana-lytical results using these assumptions showed good agreement with experimen-tal ones. The periodic signal was adopted to develop an automatic joint tracking sys-tem in <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> GMAW...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} {{circular}} dichroism and structure-directed drugs {{to identify the}} role of structural features, wide and <b>narrow</b> <b>grooves</b> in particular, required for the cooperative polymerization, recognition of homologous sequences, {{and the formation of}} joint molecules promoted by recA protein. The path of cooperative polymerization of recA protein was deduced by its ability to cause quantitative displacement of distamycin from the <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> of duplex DNA. By contrast, methyl green bound to the wide groove was retained by the nucleoprotein filaments comprised of recA protein-DNA. Further, the mode of binding of these ligands and recA protein to DNA was confirmed by DNaseI digestion. More importantly, the formation of joint molecules was prevented by distamycin in the <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> while methyl green in the wide groove had no adverse effect. Intriguingly, distamycin interfered with the production of coaggregates between nucleoprotein filaments of recA protein-M 13 ssDNA and naked linear M 13 duplex DNA, but not with linear phi X 174 duplex DNA. Thus, these data, in conjunction with molecular modeling, suggest that the <b>narrow</b> <b>grooves</b> of duplex DNA provide the fundamental framework required for the cooperative polymerization of recA protein and alignment of homologous sequences. These findings and their significance are discussed in relation to models of homologous pairing between two intertwined DNA molecules...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe i-motif DNA tetrameric {{structure}} is formed of two parallel duplexes intercalated in a head-to-tail orientation, and {{held together by}} hemiprotonated cytosine pairs. The four phosphodiester backbones forming the structure define two <b>narrow</b> and wide <b>grooves.</b> The short interphosphate distances across the <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> induce a strong repulsion which should destabilize the tetramer. To investigate this point, molecular dynamics simulations were run on the [d(C 2) ] 4 and [d(C 4) ] 4 tetramers in 3 ′E and 5 ′E topologies, for which {{the interaction of the}} phosphodiester backbones through the <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> is different. The analysis of the simulations, using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Solvation Area and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Solvation Area approaches, shows that it is the van der Waals energy contribution which displays the largest relative difference between the two topologies. The comparison of the solvent-accessible area of each topology reveals that the sugar-sugar interactions account for the greater stability of the 3 ′E topology. This stresses the importance of the sugar-sugar contacts across the <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> which, enforcing the optimal backbone twisting, are essential to the base stacking and the i-motif stability. Tighter interactions between the sugars are observed in the case of N-type sugar puckers...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} water of {{hydration}} {{in contact with}} the double helix can exist in several states. One state, found in the <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> of poly(dA). poly(dT), should be considered as frozen to the helix, i. e., {{an integral part of the}} double helix. We find that this enhanced helix greatly effects the stability of that helix against base separation melting. Most water surrounding the helix is, however, melted or disassociated with respect to being an integral part of helix and plays a much less significant role in stabilizing the helix dynamically, although these water molecules play an important role in stabilizing the helix conformation statically. We study the temperature dependence of the melting of the hydration spine and find that <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> nonbonded interactions are necessary to stabilize the spine above room temperature and to show the broad transition observed experimentally. This calculation requires that synergistic effects of nonbonded interactions between DNA and its hydration shell affect the state of water-base atom hydrogen bonds.

A quadruplex with a basket type structure has also been examined. The binding of the paramagnetic ion manganese to these quadruplex DNAs has been investigated by solution state electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. The EPR results indicate that the DNA aptamer, d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG), binds two manganese ions and that the binding constants for each of these sites is approximately 10 (5) M- 1.

More curling is observed when the groove radius of curvature is reduced by increasing the groove depth or decreasing the groove width. It is also observed that the increase in normal tensile stress at the chip root next to the tool tip is proportional to the amount of curl displayed in the chip. However, the increase in normal compressive stress is related to the increase in chip thickness, a variable that depends on the effective rake angle of cutting...|$|R

The effect of the high speed swing arc <b>narrow</b> <b>groove</b> welding MAG parameters on weld formation is studied. The results show that increasing the swing width or frequency can reduce the weld penetration and increase lateral wall penetration; when the swinging width makes side spacing greater than - 0  5 mm and less than 1 mm, good weld forming will be gained; when the oscillation frequency increases to more than 5 Hz, weld finger penetration can be eliminated, but when it is above 9 Hz, increasing the swing frequency cannot cause obvious change of the dimension of weld. The effects of these oscillating parameters on weld formation can provide guidance for the selection of welding parameters...|$|R
