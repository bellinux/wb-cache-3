25|$|By custom, all {{males of}} full age {{have a right}} to {{petition}} the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis. In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule. Tribal identity remains strong and, outside of the royal family, political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation, with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events. As mentioned earlier, in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s and the <b>National</b> <b>Dialogue</b> Forum in 2003.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} <b>national</b> social <b>dialogue</b> (bipartite wage bargaining) across European countries. Several commentators in the 1990 s expected the dismantling of <b>national</b> social <b>dialogue</b> institutions. Following the liberalisation of markets, intensification of competition, and declining union power, bargaining structures were supposed to converge to the Anglo-Saxon model of decentralised bargaining. The paper seeks to gauge the plausibility of the ‘decentralization thesis’ using novel indicators of collective bargaining centralization across the EU 15. It is shown that despite the changes in product markets, flexible working, and declining union density, a generalized decentralization of bargaining did not occur. Instead, in many European cases there is a counter-trend of centralization, which casts doubt to the decentralization thesis...|$|R

25|$|There {{has been}} {{mounting}} pressure to reform and modernize the royal family's rule, an agenda championed by King Abdullah {{both before and}} after his accession in 2005. The creation of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s did not satisfy demands for political participation, and, in 2003, an annual <b>National</b> <b>Dialogue</b> Forum was announced that would allow selected professionals and intellectuals to publicly debate current national issues, within certain prescribed parameters. In 2005, the first municipal elections were held. In 2007, the Allegiance Council was created to regulate the succession. In 2009, the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post. However, the changes have been criticized as being too slow or merely cosmetic.|$|E
