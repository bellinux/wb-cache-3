5|$|Peptides {{in black}} mamba venom {{have been found}} to be {{effective}} analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins do not have a resistance to <b>naloxone,</b> suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>naloxone</b> to {{injection drug users}} and other opioid drug users decreases {{the risk of death}} from overdose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that U.S. programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of <b>naloxone</b> and training on its utilization are estimated to have prevented 10,000 opioid overdose deaths. Healthcare institution-based <b>naloxone</b> prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the U.S. state of North Carolina, and have been replicated in the U.S. military. Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers' insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home <b>naloxone</b> to prevent opioid overdose. Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using <b>naloxone</b> have also shown promise in the US.|$|E
25|$|Buprenorphine behaves {{differently}} than other opioids in this respect, as {{it shows a}} ceiling effect for respiratory depression. Moreover, doubts about the antagonisation of the respiratory effects by <b>naloxone</b> have been disproved: Buprenorphine effects can be antagonised with a continuous infusion of <b>naloxone.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{laxatives}} are insufficiently effective (which {{is often}} the case), opioid formulations or regimens that include a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist, such as methylnaltrexone bromide, naloxegol, alvimopan, or <b>naloxone</b> (as in oxycodone/naloxone), may be tried. A 2008 Cochrane review found that the evidence was tentative for alvimopan, <b>naloxone,</b> or methylnaltrexone bromide.|$|E
25|$|Captopril (as other ACE inhibitors) {{overdose}} can be antagonized with <b>naloxone.</b>|$|E
25|$|As it has {{euphoric effects}} {{similar to other}} opioids, {{oxycodone}} {{is one of the}} drugs abused in the current opioid epidemic in the United States. An abuse-deterrent combination with <b>naloxone</b> is available in managed-release tablets. If injected, the <b>naloxone</b> precipitates opioid withdrawal symptoms and blocks the effect of the medication. However, there have been concerns raised about the effectiveness of the abuse prevention measures.|$|E
25|$|In case of {{overdose}} or adverse reaction, {{the immediate}} intravenous administration of <b>naloxone</b> (Narcan) {{is a specific}} antidote. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and other supportive measures should be used as indicated.|$|E
25|$|Physicians in Moscow {{condemned}} {{the refusal to}} disclose {{the identity of the}} gas that prevented them from saving more lives. Some reports said the drug <b>naloxone</b> was used to save some hostages.|$|E
25|$|Identical {{drugs can}} produce {{different}} results {{depending on the}} route of administration. For example, some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after enteral administration is therefore different from that after parenteral administration. This can be illustrated {{by the action of}} <b>naloxone</b> (Narcan), an antagonist of opiates such as morphine. <b>Naloxone</b> counteracts opiate action in the central nervous system when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of opiate overdose. The same drug, when swallowed, acts exclusively on the bowels; it is here used to treat constipation under opiate pain therapy and does not affect the pain-reducing effect of the opiate.|$|E
25|$|Overdose of kratom {{is managed}} similar to opioid overdose, and <b>naloxone</b> can be {{considered}} to treat an overdose that results in a reduced impulse to breathe, despite mixed results for its utility, based on animal models.|$|E
25|$|Physicians in Moscow {{condemned}} {{the refusal to}} disclose {{the identity of the}} gas. Some reports said the drug <b>naloxone</b> was successfully used as an antidote to save some hostages, suggesting the gas was an opiate-based compound.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, a {{paper by}} Gosselin {{estimated}} that the lethal dose is between 50 and 500mg/kg. Doses as high as 15â€“20mg/kg are taken by some recreational users. It is suggested by a single case study that the antidote to dextromethorphan overdose is <b>naloxone,</b> administered intravenously.|$|E
25|$|A large {{overdose}} {{can cause}} asphyxia and death by respiratory depression {{if the person}} does not receive medical attention immediately. Overdose treatment includes the administration of <b>naloxone.</b> The latter completely reverses morphine's effects, but may result in immediate onset of withdrawal in opiate-addicted subjects. Multiple doses may be needed.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health {{distributed}} to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug <b>naloxone</b> in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training {{developed by the}} National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered {{by a grant from}} a private foundation.|$|E
25|$|Fatalities with {{tramadol}} overdose {{have been}} reported and are increasing in frequency in Northern Ireland; {{the majority of these}} overdoses involve other drugs including alcohol. Recognised risk factors for tramadol overdose include depression, addiction and seizures. <b>Naloxone</b> only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.|$|E
25|$|The {{closely related}} medication, methylnaltrexone, {{is used to}} treat opioid-induced {{constipation}} but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Nalmefene is similar to naltrexone and {{is used for the}} same purposes as naltrexone. Naltrexone {{should not be confused with}} <b>naloxone,</b> which is used in emergency cases of opioid overdose.|$|E
25|$|Ambulances were {{standing}} by and ordinary city buses were brought in. Medical workers were expecting to treat victims of explosions and gunfire {{but not a}} secret chemical agent. The drug <b>naloxone</b> counteracts the chemical agent's effects, but {{would have to have}} been administered by rescue workers immediately. Some reports said the drug was used to save some hostages.|$|E
25|$|Specific antidotes are {{available}} for certain overdoses. For example, <b>Naloxone</b> is the antidote for opiates such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, benzodiazepine overdoses may be effectively reversed with flumazenil. As a nonspecific antidote, activated charcoal is frequently recommended if available within one hour of the ingestion and the ingestion is significant. Gastric lavage, syrup of ipecac, and whole bowel irrigation are rarely used.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as <b>naloxone</b> or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of <b>naloxone</b> can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with <b>naloxone</b> being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E
25|$|These direct cardiac effects include {{decreased}} {{heart rate}} (i.e. cardiovascular depression), decreased contractility, and decreased electrical conductivity (i.e., increased PR, AH, HV, and QRS intervals). These effects {{appear to be}} due to their local anesthetic activity and are not reversed by <b>naloxone.</b> Widening of the QRS complex appears to be a result of a quinidine-like effect of propoxyphene, and sodium bicarbonate therapy appears to have a positive direct effect on the QRS dysrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to other}} opiates, {{overdose}} by heroin alone is rather rare, and most reported overdoses occur either due to {{combination with other}} sedatives, such as benzodiazepines and ethanol, or after a person has been abstinent {{for some time and}} then uses. Their tolerance level will have decreased but user does not often account for time abstinent and overdoses or as a purposeful act of suicide. Heroin overdose is also reversible within minutes with administration of the opioid antagonist <b>Naloxone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Physical {{dependence}} is {{the physiological}} {{adaptation of the}} body to the presence of a substance, in this case opioid medication. It is defined by the development of withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued, when the dose is reduced abruptly or, specifically in the case of opioids, when an antagonist (e.g., <b>naloxone)</b> or an agonist-antagonist (e.g., pentazocine) is administered. Physical dependence is a normal and expected aspect of certain medications and does not necessarily imply that the patient is addicted.|$|E
25|$|Nalbuphine is a semi-synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist {{analgesic}} of the phenanthrene series. It is chemically {{related to the}} widely used opioid antagonists, <b>naloxone</b> and naltrexone, and the potent opioid analgesic, oxymorphone. It is available in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride per mL. Both strengths contain 0.94% sodium citrate hydrous, 1.26% citric acid anhydrous, 0.1% sodium metabisulfite, and 0.2% of a 9:1 mixture of methylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives; pH is adjusted, if necessary, with hydrochloric acid. The 10mg/mL strength contains 0.1% sodium chloride.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{buprenorphine}} (Subutex) and buprenorphine with <b>naloxone</b> (Suboxone) {{were approved}} for opioid addiction by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2002. The FDA rescheduled buprenorphine from a Schedule V drug to a Schedule III drug just before approval of Subutex and Suboxone. The ACSCN for buprenorphine is 9064, {{and being a}} Schedule III substance {{it does not have}} an annual manufacturing quota imposed by the DEA. The salt in use is the hydrochloride, which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.928.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of behavioral, pharmacological, and biochemical research led Akil and colleagues of the Barchas Laboratory at Stanford to the endorphins, specifically two peptides called enkephalins. What followed was {{a race against}} other research groups to isolate these morphine-like chemicals and determine what activates the system. Essentially, they developed a model of stress induced analgesia that was <b>naloxone</b> responsive. Building on prior research, Akil and colleagues established that in the rate inescapable acute stress causes {{a significant increase in}} the opioid peptides, enkephalins and endorphins with a concurrent reduction in pain responsiveness.|$|E
25|$|Activation of {{both the}} GHB {{receptor}} and GABA(B) {{is responsible for the}} addictive profile of GHB. GHB's effect on dopamine release is biphasic. Low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor. Higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABA(B) receptors as do other GABA(B) agonists such as baclofen and phenibut. After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor. Both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by GHB are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as <b>naloxone</b> and naltrexone. Dynorphin {{may play a role in}} the inhibition of dopamine release via kappa opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{morphine}} can be countered with opioid antagonists such as <b>naloxone</b> and naltrexone; {{the development of}} tolerance to morphine may be inhibited by NMDA antagonists such as ketamine or dextromethorphan. The rotation of morphine with chemically dissimilar opioids in the long-term treatment of pain will slow down the growth of tolerance in the longer run, particularly agents known to have significantly incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine such as levorphanol, ketobemidone, piritramide, and methadone and its derivatives; all of these drugs also have NMDA antagonist properties. It is believed that the strong opioid with the most incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine is either methadone or dextromoramide.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2015, Canada {{has seen}} a {{widespread}} number of fentanyl overdoses. Authorities suspect that the drug is being imported from Asia to the western coast by organized crime groups in powder form and being pressed into pseudo-OxyContin tablets. Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs including cocaine, MDMA, and heroin. The drug has been implicated in multiple deaths from the homeless to young professionals, including multiple teens and young parents. Because of the rising deaths across the country, Health Canada is putting a rush on {{a review of the}} prescription-only status of <b>naloxone</b> in an effort to combat overdoses of the drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{pethidine}} administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause miosis because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, obtundation, cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma. A narcotic antagonist such as <b>naloxone</b> is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis {{have been attributed to}} accumumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.|$|E
25|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} of morphine {{has been extensively}} studied. As {{a result of the}} extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including <b>naloxone</b> (Narcan), naltrexone (Trexan), diprenorphine (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and nalorphine (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like apomorphine are devoid of narcotic effects.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{is quickly}} {{hydrolysed}} {{in the liver}} to pethidinic acid and is also demethylated to norpethidine, which has half the analgesic activity of pethidine but a longer elimination half-life (8â€“12 hours); accumulating with regular administration, or in renal failure. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. The toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with opioid receptor antagonists such as <b>naloxone</b> or naltrexone, and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine, though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored. The neurotoxicity of pethidine's metabolites is a unique feature of pethidine compared to other opioids. Pethidine's metabolites are further conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted into the urine.|$|E
25|$|The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) {{took to the}} {{morphine}} instantly, {{even with}} relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males {{in one of the}} experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionallywith the females trying it more often than the malesbut they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to Rat Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the sweet water, he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior. Even more significant, he writes, was that when he added a drug called <b>Naloxone,</b> which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.|$|E
500|$|Competitive antagonists {{are used}} to prevent the {{activity}} of drugs, and to reverse the effects of drugs {{that have already been}} consumed. <b>Naloxone</b> (also known as Narcan) is used to reverse opioid overdose caused by drugs such as heroin or morphine.
