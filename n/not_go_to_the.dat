5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of {{attempting}} to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.|$|E

However, this possibility was later closed off. Since his move to Celtic he has been considered for England duty and was called up to the under-21 squad for a friendly but had to pull out due to injury.

5|$|As George tells Jerry {{that his}} girlfriend no longer {{wants to see}} him, Jerry tells George that he gave away his ticket to Horneck. Although Jerry offers George his own ticket, George does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game with Horneck {{because he does not}} know Horneck. Jerry decides to give Horneck both tickets, {{claiming}} that he cannot make the game because he is tutoring his nephew. Later, the night of the Knicks game,Jerry is in his apartment talking to his ex-girlfriend Elaine. She jokingly tries to add to Jerry's list of excuses with which he avoids Horneck. He later discovers that Horneck took Kramer to the game and that Horneck is in the building. When Horneck meets Jerry and Elaine, Horneck invites them out to another Knicks game. They come up with more unusual excuses in an attempt to avoid going out. However, Horneck then gets out a newspaper and tries to organize a time when they can all meet, weeks in advance. Jerry realizes that no matter what excuses he comes up with, he cannot avoid Horneck.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trouble of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E

However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to show more respect for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E
5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.|$|E

25|$|In a 1994 poll by The Washington Post, 9% of the {{respondents}} {{said that it was}} possible that astronauts did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon and another 5% were unsure. A 1999 Gallup Poll found that 6% of the Americans surveyed doubted that the Moon landings happened and that 5% of those surveyed had no opinion, which roughly matches the findings of a similar 1995 Time/CNN poll. Officials of the Fox network said that such skepticism rose to about 20% after the February 2001 airing of their network's television special, Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?, seen by about 15 million viewers. This Fox special is seen as having promoted the hoax claims.|$|E

Colin visits The Queen Victoria pub and witnesses the funeral of Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), who was killed for being gay, and laments to another gay man, Johnny Carter (Ted Reilly), of the homophobia in the world, but is comforted {{by the majority of}} gay acceptance. After exchanging memories, Dot agrees to attend the wedding, much to Colin's delight.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{increased}} demand, F.4 production was divided between Gloster and Armstrong Whitworth. The majority of early F.4s did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> RAF: 100 were exported to Argentina, seeing action {{on both sides}} in the 1955 revolution; in 1947, only RAF Nos. 74 and 222 squadrons were fully equipped with the F.4. Nine further RAF squadrons converted from 1948 onwards. From 1948, 38 F.4s were exported to the Dutch, equipping four squadrons (322, 323, 326 and 327) split between bases in Soesterberg and Leeuwarden until the mid-1950s. In 1949, only two RAF squadrons were converted to the F.4, Belgium was sold 48 aircraft in the same year (going to 349 and 350 squadrons at Beauvechain) and Denmark received 20 over 1949‚Äì1950. In 1950, three more RAF squadrons were upgraded, including No. 616 and, in 1951, six more.|$|E
25|$|Lamphere {{represented}} an unresolved danger to Gunness; now Asle Helgelien was making inquiries that {{could very well}} send her to the gallows. She told a lawyer in La Porte, M.E. Leliter, that she feared for her life and that of her children. Ray Lamphere, she said, had threatened to kill her and burn her house down. She wanted to make out a will, in case Lamphere went through with his threats. Leliter complied and drew up her will. She left her entire estate to her children and then departed Leliter's offices. She {{went to one of}} the La Porte banks holding the mortgage for her property and paid this off. She did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police to tell them about Lamphere's allegedly life-threatening conduct. The reason for this, most later concluded, was that there had been no threats; she was merely setting the stage for her own arson.|$|E

Trouble flared up again when the mutineers, believing they would be supported by the majority of the crew, again made their refusal to sail to the West Indies known, and began to agitate against the officers. Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the following day and after a period of tensions and standoffs between the officers and the crew, the mutiny collapsed when the marines obeyed orders to arrest the ringleaders.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, Van Brocklin {{followed}} {{two former}} high school teammates north and enrolled at the University of Oregon in Eugene. He became the starting quarterback in 1947 under first-year head coach Jim Aiken, and led the Ducks to a 16-5 record in his two seasons as a starter. In 1948, Oregon tied with California {{for the title of}} the Pacific Coast Conference, forerunner of the Pac-12. California was undefeated overall, and Oregon's only loss was at undefeated Michigan, that year's national champions, and the Ducks had seven victories in the PCC to Cal's six. Oregon did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rose Bowl, however, because Cal was voted by the other schools to represent the PCC in the game. Oregon needed only a 5-5 tie vote, as Cal had been to the game more recently, and with six Northwest schools and four in California, appeared favored to advance. Oregon had opted for a playoff game, but California declined. Among the Cal voters was the University of Washington, which elevated the intensity of the Oregon-Washington rivalry. Breaking with tradition, the PCC allowed Oregon to accept an invitation to play SMU in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. It {{was the first time that}} a Pacific Coast team played in a major bowl game other than the Rose Bowl (a policy which was continued by the Pac-8 through 1974). Both Oregon and California lost their New Year's Day bowl games. That season, Van Brocklin was honored with an All-America selection and finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Coincidentally, the Heisman Trophy winner that year was SMU running back Doak Walker. Both Walker and Van Brocklin got Outstanding Player recognition for their performance in the Cotton Bowl Classic.|$|E
