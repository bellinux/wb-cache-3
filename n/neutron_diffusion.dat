The {{self-diffusion}} {{of nitrogen}} is studied in amorphous silicon nitride, {{which is a}} model system for a covalently bound amorphous solid with a low atomic mobility where reliable diffusion data are still lacking. Comparative experiments on Si 14 Nx/Si 15 Nx (x ≈ 1. 33) isotope multilayers were carried out with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and neutron reflectometry (NR), respectively. It was found that experiments with SIMS are not very well suited for the determination of diffusivities in a broad temperature range. The minimum diffusion length of about 5 - 10 nm detectable with this method is too large. At high temperatures (> 1200 °C) the amorphous solid crystallizes before any diffusion is measured and at low temperatures (< 1100 °C) the diffusivities are too low to be detected.

40|$|We {{determine}} the liquid-solid phase diagram for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-selenium plasma mixtures using two-phase MD simulations. We identified liquid, solid, and interface regions using a bond angle metric. To study finite size effects, we perform 27648 and 55296 ion simulations. To help monitor non-equilibrium effects, we calculate diffusion constants $D_i$. For the carbon-oxygen system {{we find that}} $D_O$ for oxygen ions in the solid is much smaller than $D_C$ for carbon ions and that both diffusion constants are 80 or more times smaller than diffusion constants in the liquid phase. There is excellent agreement between our carbon-oxygen phase diagram and that predicted by Medin and Cumming.

The worth of an ejected control rod is affected by both power level, and the positions of control banks.

Although the peak fuel pellet enthalpy rise during an REA will be greater for a given ejected rod worth at elevated initial power levels, it is more likely the HZP condition will cause a greater net energy deposition because an ejected rod will have the highest worth at HZP.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{copolymer}} PS-b-PAA Langmuir films {{and the formation}} of non-organic nanostructures by reduction of silver ions Ag+ in their neighborhood. On the one hand, we have precisely determined the structure of these copolymers at the air-water interface for different pH with many complementary techniques (isothermal, π-A, neutron reflectivity, grazing-incidence x-ray scattering). This study proved that the classic interpretation of these isotherms should be reconsidered and we emphasized the major role played by the spreading solvent. This (solvent) is partially absorbed by the surface after the deposit and the mixed copolymer-solvent monolayer is created by the surface nanostructure. These nanostructures have a well-defined typical size. When the PAA chains are neutral, the pseudo-surface observed on the isotherms corresponds to the reversible expulsion of the solvent to a subphase which induces a reorganization of the nanostructures. In the case of charged PPA chains, the isotherm does not show the flat surface. This is due to the electrostatic repulsion between these chains. The compression of the film induces the «dive» of a part of the monolayer – copolymer and solvent – towards the volume. On the other hand, we studied the behavior of these charged copolymer films in the presence of silver ions Ag+ in the before and after reduction. We showed that the presence of Ag+ ions induces the collapse of the PAA chains at the interface. The ions reduction by surface x-rays radiolysis produces silver colloids following a «bi-continuous» 2 D structure with a typical length scale. However, the photo-chemical reduction does not seem to produce homogenous and dense layers of colloids. Nous avons étudié les films de Langmuir de copolymères PS-b-PAA et la formation de nanostructures inorganiques par réduction d’ions Ag+ à leur voisinage. D’une part, nous avons déterminé précisément la structure de ces copolymères à l’interface air-eau pour différents pH, à l’aide de techniques complémentaires (isothermes π-A, réflectivité de <b>neutrons,</b> <b>diffusion</b> de rayons x rasants). Cette étude a démontré que l’interprétation usuelle de ces isothermes devait être reconsidérée et en particulier nous avons mis en évidence le rôle majeur du solvant d’étalement. Ce dernier reste partiellement adsorbé à la surface après le dépôt, la monocouche mixte copolymère-solvant est alors formée de nanostructures de surface. Ces nanostructures ont de taille caractéristique bien. Lorsque les chaînes de PAA sont neutres, le pseudo-plateau observé sur les isothermes correspond à l’expulsion réversible du solvant vers la sous-phase ce qui induit une réorganisation des nanostructures. Dans le cas de chaînes de PAA chargées, l’isotherme ne présente plus ce pseudo-plateau. Ceci est dû aux répulsions électrostatiques entre ces chaînes. La compression du film entraîne le «plongeon» d’une partie de la monocouche, copolymère et solvant, vers le volume. D’autre part, nous avons étudié le comportement des films de copolymères chargés en présence d’ions Ag+ dans la sous-phase avant et après leur réduction.

In order to enable also 3 D pin-by-pin and nodal coupled NK-TH simulations of SFR, different developments are in progress.
