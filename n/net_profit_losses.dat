40|$|Today, at {{the bakery}} industry, little {{attention}} is paid to marketing activities. Limited financial resources and the lack of a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of marketing activities leads to a reduction in marketing budgets and a decrease in the profitability of the enterprise as a whole. Therefore, despite the complexity of conducting an analysis of the cost effectiveness of marketing activities, in market conditions it is necessary to control the level of costs and the formation of optimal marketing budgets. In the work it is determined that the main direction of marketing activity evaluation is the analysis of the cost effectiveness for its implementation. A scientific-methodical approach to the analysis of the effectiveness of marketing costs in the bakery industry is suggested. The analysis of the cost effectiveness of marketing activities {{on the basis of the}} assumption that marketing costs are a factor variable determining the patterns of changes in the values of the resulting indicators of financial and economic activities of the enterprise, such as net income from sales of products, gross profit, financial results from operating activities and <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> (<b>losses).</b> The main directions of optimization of marketing activities at bakery enterprises are given. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2005. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 121 - 124). Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxi, 124 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis dissertation {{consists of three}} essays. The overall theme is about the economic effects of technology transfer and spillovers in developing countries through foreign direct investment (FDI). The first essay is an oligopoly approach. The second essay is an endogenous growth approach. The third essay is a policy implication of intellectual property rights (IPRs) enforcement using the first oligopoly model. The first essay develops an oligopoly model with endogenous technology spillovers through FDI. The foreign entrant brings a superior technology and therefore may spend resources to prevent spillovers of its technology to the home firm. The home firm has an incentive to spend resources to gain these spillovers. After firms strategically choose their expenditures to influence technology spillovers, they compete in a Cournot Nash quantity game. This study provides theoretical insight on {{the positive and negative}} empirical spillover results of FDI on productivity of local firms. Up to a critical bound, the larger the initial technology gap between the foreign and home firms, the more the home firm spends to gain spillovers. Past that boundary, the home firm decreases spending. As a result, the home firm's profits from spillovers vary, but larger technology gaps engender greater <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> <b>losses</b> from FDI. My results suggest that the developing countries should promote FDI when small technology gaps exist and support R&D activities of local firms in all cases. The second essay modifies the endogenous growth model with 1 eaming-by-doing and knowledge spillovers of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1999) to analyze the effects of FDI on economic growth in developing countries. The effects of technology transfer and spillovers are separately analyzed. The growth of capital accumulation, consumption, and income depends on the conditions of the population growth, the rate of return on capital, and the net foreign capital inflow. For a developing country to sustain endogenous economic growth, the required conditions are the higher rate of return on investment and positive foreign capital inflow. The best policy package for the developing country is to promote FDI to increase the net foreign capital inflow, and to support R&D activities of local firms to increase their absorptive capacities. The third essay provides theoretical policy analysis of the effects of IPR protection on the spillover equilibrium and home welfare, using the first oligopoly model. It concludes that private enforcement of the foreign firm's spending to prevent technology spillovers is complementary to public enforcement of IPR protection. IPR protection affects the foreign firm's behavior to spend more to prevent spillovers while its enforcement affects the home firm's behavior to spend less to gain spillovers. As a result, the spillover ratio decreases in equilibrium. A decrease in the spillover ratio leads to reduction in consumers' welfare with existing FDI {{as well as in the}} profits of the home firm. However, since the likelihood of FDI increases, home welfare improves by a new FDI which was not previously profitable because welfare gains for consumers dominate negative effects in the home firm's profits. Therefore, a developing country can benefit from strengthening its IPR enforcement if this serves to attract additional FDI in the country...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to (a) analyze IFRS {{requirements}} for the recognition and presentation of non-controlling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements in relation to theoretical concepts of consolidation of financial statements, and (b) assess the share and importance of non-controlling inter-ests in financial performance and the equity of the groups of companies in practice. For the purpose of the article, selected scientific methods have been used, including: descriptive and analytical ones (for analyzing the theoretical concepts and IFRS requirements), critical analysis, especial-ly used for the literature review, and for the assessment of practice: primary empirical research methods, and quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests and correlation analysis. The empirical material collected was used to verify several hypotheses related to non-controlling interests of the groups whose parents are registered in Poland and whose securities are traded on a regulated, Polish capital market (Warsaw Stock Exchange). The empirical evidence is that non-controlling interests represent a very small part of group’s equity (taking the mean of about 3. 5 %, but the median below 1 %) and obviously, they are significantly lower than the share of majority interests. Their deviation among the different classes of companies (big, small and banks) is negligible. Slightly higher is the share of minority interests in the group’s <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> and total comprehensive income. However, no significant difference is to be found between the shares of non-controlling interests in the group’s equity, <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> and total comprehensive income. Overall, shares of majority (minority) interests in a group’s income are in line with their shares in the group’s equity. The hypothesis on comparable returns on non-controlling and majority interests (in terms of ROE) cannot be rejected if both <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> and <b>losses</b> are considered. How-ever, if losses are skipped then there is evidence that non-controlling interests are more profitable than majority interests. Analysis of the impact of the number of subsidiaries in groups on non-controlling interests indicates the existence of such an effect only in relation to the equity (rather obvious but weak). No effect is observed for the impact on <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> for the entire sample...|$|R
