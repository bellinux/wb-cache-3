50|$|The {{cause of}} coeliac disease was {{eventually}} discovered {{to be an}} autoimmune reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat, plus Secalin in rye and Hordien in barley.The lining of the small bowel is flattened, which interferes with the absorption of nutrients. Gee {{would not have been}} able to discover this on post-mortem since this lining quickly deteriorates on death. The only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. The rice, sago, fruit and vegetables that were forbidden by Gee would all have been quite safe to eat; the toasted bread he recommended, however, would not. The disease he describes in adults, affecting those returning from India and other foreign parts, is likely to have been tropical sprue. For many years this was inadequately distinguished from coeliac disease, which was also known as <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue.</b>|$|E
40|$|CONVINCING {{evidence}} has been brought forward by Thaysen (1929 b, 1932, 1935) that tropical and <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue</b> in adults and coeliac disease in children are essentially identical conditions, and he has grouped the three together as subdivisions of ' idiopathic steatorrhoea', a syndrome which ha...|$|E

40|$|An {{abnormal}} small-intestinal {{pattern has}} been demonstrated by roentgenologic studies in both the tropical and <b>non-tropical</b> variety of <b>sprue</b> (1 to 3). Generalized hypomotility is observed, and the barium moves along the gut in thick, sausage-shaped masses which are separated by intestinal areas, apparently {{in a state of}} spasm. Many of the bowel loops are widely dilated and often con-tain considerable gas. At the same time, the mu-cosal relief is strikingly altered in that the usual markings of the valvulae conniventes are thick-ened, widely separated, and, in advanced cases, completely obliterated. In an admirable review of this subject, Golden (4) has, however, reiterated the original contention of Snell and Camp (1) that the observed changes are not characteristic of sprue, but may occur in other chronic deficiency states and, at times, may appear as the result of emotional stresses. In 2 patients with sprue, whom we repeatedly intubated over a period of 8 and 13 months, re-spectively, the small-intestinal motor activity was studied by means of the balloon-kymograph method, described by Ingelfinger and Abbott (5). Of the 2 patients, the first would be considered to have the tropical, the second, the <b>non-tropical</b> van-ety of <b>sprue...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article entitled “are hepatitis B virus and celiac disease linked? ” by Leonardi, et al, (1) published in Hepatitis Monthly. Celiac disease (CD), also known as glutensensitive enteropathy and <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue,</b> is a prevalent autoimmune disorder. The balance of {{evidence suggests that the}} celiac immunopathology involves a complex individualized interplay of many pathophysiological variables on a genetic background (2). CD develops {{as a consequence of the}} encounter between an environmental trigger (i. e., derivatives of gluten from wheat, rye, and barley), immunologic factors, and a genetically predisposed host, with the possible participation of other environmental cofactors.

40|$|Liability to gout is a {{frequent}} feature of poly-cythaemia vera, myeloid leukaemia, and myeloid metaplas~a (Hickling, 1953), and is a well-recognized though less common event in Addisonian anaemia. Of greater rarity is the association of gout with the anaemia arising from <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue.</b> In a comprehensive review, Talbott (1959) found only two examples. The following is a third. Case Report In 1949, {{at the age of}} 43 years, a man was discovered to have proteinuria.

40|$|Coeliac {{disease is}} a chronic {{inflammatory}} disorder of the small bowel that results in malabsorption of nutrients. The disease, also called <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue,</b> coeliac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is induced by components in the prolamin fraction of wheat (gliadin), barley (hordein), rye (secalin) and possibly oats (avenin). In addition to nutrient deficiencies, prolonged coeliac {{disease is a}}ssociated with an increased risk of malignancy, especially intestinal T-cell lymphoma. The characteristic histological appearance is that of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium and lamina propria. The disease has a number of autoimmune-like features which include a strong association with HLA, the occurrence of autoantibodies in patient's sera, association with other autoimmune diseases (IDDM, SLE, RA), responsiveness to corticosteroids and a dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the affected bowel.

40|$|T HE OUTLOOK for {{the patient}} with primary {{intestinal}} malabsorption has changed dra-matically in the past decade. Ten years ago treatment of tropical sprue with liver extract produced reasonably good results but treat-ment of celiac disease or <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue</b> with the same agent was of questionable benefit. Dietary management seemed beneficial in somne instances {{but there was little}} agreement about which type of diet helped. In 1946, folic acid’- ” was introduced into the therapy of tropical sprue. While the use of folic acid does not dramatically improve the previous good results of treatment with liver extract, it has led to better understanding of the fact that folic acid deficiency is consistently present in tropical sprue and that symnptoms disappear or are remarkably improved when the deficiency is corrected. In 1950, Dicke’ 2 reported that patients with celiac disease benefited from wheat restriction From the Gastrointestinal Section of the Departmnen...|$|E
40|$|According to the National Institutes of Health, “Celiac {{disease is}} an immune disease {{in which people}} can’t eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Gluten may also be used in {{products}} such as vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, and some medicines. ” A new study shows that less than 1 % of the U. S. population has this disorder, {{but most of them}} don’t know it. Conversely, most of the people following gluten-free diets do NOT have this disease. Diagnosing celiac disease (a. k. a., celiac sprue, <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue,</b> gluten intolerance, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is not easy. If blood tests show positive results the presence of the disease may be confirmed by a biopsy which involves taking a tiny piece of tissue from the person’s small intestine. You cannot make a definite diagnosis based on food diaries, allergy skin tests, or saliva samples, as claimed by some alternative practitioners. If a person has a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease, the only treatment is total avoidance of foods containing gluten – wheat, rye and barley and foods made with ingredients from those grains. Cutting back on those foods is not enough – total avoidance is needed to prevent damage to the person’s intestinal system...|$|E
40|$|One of the puzzling {{conditions}} {{encountered in}} the practice of pediatrics is the fairly well-defined syndrome known as cceliac disease. This condition was originally described in 1888 by Gee 29 who formulated as the principal symptoms: distended abdomen, pronounced emaciation affecting the limbs more than the face, muscular atrophy, anemia, and a white diarrhea. Cheadle 20 called the condition "acholia", believing, despite the absence of jaundice, that the pale color of the stools resulted from a lack of bile secretion into the intestine. What appears to be the same syndrome was described in 1908 by Herter 34 under the name of "intestinal infantilism", with the same symptoms as described by Gee. Heubner" 6 designated the disease, which he considered to involve a constitutional weakness of the digestive apparatus, by the noncommittal title of "schwere Verdauungsinsuffizienz beim Kinde jenseits des S'auglingsalters". Modern opinion (Miller 52, Neff 54, Thaysen 80) concurs that Gee, Cheadle, Herter, and Heubner were describing the same disease complex, for which, in view of its obscure etiology, Miller and Neff suggest the retention of Gee's original name of cceliac disease. The similarity of coeliac disease and tropical sprue is emphasized by Thaysen 80 81, who considers that Gee's "cceliac affection of Englishmen returning from India " could be nothing but tropical sprue. Thaysen 78, and later Holmes and Starr 38, in describing under the name of <b>non-tropical</b> <b>sprue</b> a sprue-like affection of northern countries, emphasize the strong resemblance between nontropical sprue, cceliac disease, and tropical sprue, and Thaysen 80 discusses all three diseases, which he considers to be identical, under the name of "idiopathic steatorrhea"...|$|E
40|$|Celiac disease, {{also known}} as celiac sprue, <b>non‐tropical</b> <b>sprue,</b> {{idiopathic}} sprue, idiopathic steatorrhoea and gluten‐sensitive enteropathy, is a serious genetic autoimmune disease, which damages the villi of the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food. The latest researches show that while in the 1970 s the prevalence of celiac disease {{in the world was}} 0. 03 %, in the present years the estimated prevalence is 1 %. In average, the prevalence of celiac disease in the Western countries is close to 1 : 100. The celiac disease occurs more often in the case of women than of men, at a ratio of 2. 8 : 1. The aim of the present paper was to bring few information about the celiac disease, highlight the increasing number of celiacs, as well as to determine the Slovak celiacs opinion about the situation on Slovak market and their consumer behaviour on the market of gluten free products. As research methods, there have been used the methods of survey and structured questionnaire consisting of 22 questions. The total number of respondents was 130 randomly selected celiacs from all over the Slovak republic. For a deeper analysis of the obtained results, there have been set out four assumptions and ten hypotheses, which have been tested with the use of Pearson´s chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-Test and Cramer´s contingency coefficient. The results of the present paper show, that despite the fact that few of our findings are pleasing - almost 52 % of our respondents stay that the labelling of gluten free products is sufficient, over 74 % of respondents think that they have enough information about the availability of gluten free products and more than 89 % of respondents think that the present scope of range of gluten free products is better as before; there are still some shortcomings, which has to be reduced or eliminated - only less than 7 % of respondents think that the price of gluten free products is adequate, over 45 % of respondents use this possibility of granting a monetary contribution for compensation of increased expenses on a special diet, almost 65 % of respondents think that the scope of range of gluten free products is in the Slovak market insufficient, 53 % of respondents think that the availability of gluten free products in the Slovak market is inadequate and only 48 % of respondents prefer the domestic producers of gluten free products. </p...|$|E
