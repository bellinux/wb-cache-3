5|$|A {{music video}} {{was created to}} {{accompany}} the song featuring Gaga.

However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. The video {{went on to win the}} BET award for Video of the Year.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E

Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E

5|$|Amanita abrupta {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1897, {{based on a}} specimen he found in Auburn, Alabama. Because {{the remains of the}} volva are <b>not</b> <b>present</b> on the bulb in dried, mature, specimens, Peck thought that the species should be grouped with Amanita rubescens and A.spissa. Synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers by Jean-Edouard Gilbert to Lepidella in 1928, and to Aspidella in 1940. Both of these genera have since been subsumed into Amanita.|$|E
5|$|As the MacBook Pro uses a {{different}} hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, {{and does not}} support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features. Rosetta is <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
