5|$|Americium-241 {{has been}} used as a {{portable}} source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409keV gamma ray emissions from 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed <b>nuclear</b> <b>density</b> gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen is {{the most}} {{frequently}} imaged nucleus in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high gyromagnetic ratio gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net nuclear spin could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include helium-3, lithium-7, carbon-13, fluorine-19, oxygen-17, sodium-23, phosphorus-31 and xenon-129. 23Na and 31P are naturally abundant in the body, so can be imaged directly. Gaseous isotopes such as 3He or 129Xe must be hyperpolarized and then inhaled as their <b>nuclear</b> <b>density</b> is too low to yield a useful signal under normal conditions. 17O and 19F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form (e.g. 17O-water) that hyperpolarization is not a necessity.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a state of the art tool to {{disentangle}} proton and neutron densities in exotic nuclei from hadron (proton and neutron mainly) scattering observables, and the extension to charge-exchange reactions. We start by folding of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>densities</b> with effective (oneboson-exchange) Nucleon-Nucleon (NN) interaction to describe scattering observables, via an optical potential. This has been shown to be suitable for kinetic energies in the range of 20 MeV to 1 GeV per nucleon, but has not been tested for exotic nuclei, which may have non standard <b>nuclear</b> <b>densities</b> (halos, etc.). We examine uncertainties associated with the choice of the effective NN interaction and improve on the treatment of nuclear corrections, such as Pauli blocking. We would provide with reasonable models for the <b>nuclear</b> <b>densities</b> when predictions of scattering observables are needed and study how a combination with electron scattering (conventional and parity violating) can constrain neutron and proton densities derived from hadron-nucleus scattering.
