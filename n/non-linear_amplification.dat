Comparing the hourly rate in (d) with the daily and monthly rates in (e), longer-period variations were more emphasized for the slip rates that were averaged over longer durations.

40|$|In paper I, we {{obtained}} an equation for {{the evolution of}} density inhomogeneities in a radiation dominated universe when they are affected by magnetic fields. In this second paper we apply this equation to the case in which the subjacent magnetic configuration is a flux tube. For scales of the order of 1 Mpc or less the differential equation is elliptical. To solve it, we have used the numerical method based on "Simultaneous Over Relaxation", SOR, with Chebyshev acceleration and we have treated the problem as a boundary value problem, which restricts the prediction ability of the integration. For large-scale flux tubes, much larger than 1 Mpc, the equation can be analytically integrated and no assumption about the final shape or magnitude of the inhomogeneity is required. In both cases we obtain an evolution which does not differ very much from linear in time. The inhomogeneity in the density becomes filamentary. Large scale structures (> 10 Mpc) are probably unaffected by damping, <b>non-linear</b> and <b>amplification</b> mechanisms after Equality, so that this model provides a tool to interpret the present observed large scale structure. Filaments are very frequently found in the large-scale structure in the Universe. It is suggested here that they could arise from primordial magnetic flux tubes, thus providing an alternative hypothesis for its interpretation; in particular we consider the case of the Coma-A 1367 supercluster, where the magnetic field is known to be high.

40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between simple laminar and complex turbulent fluids. But in some cases, as for the nocturnal planetary boundary layer, a stable and well-ordered flow can develop intense and sporadic bursts of turbulent activity which disappear slowly in time. This phenomenon is ill-understood and poorly modeled; and yet, it is central to our understanding of weather and climate dynamics. We present here a simple model which shows that in stably stratified turbulence, the stronger bursts can occur when the flow is expected to be more stable. The bursts are generated by a rapid <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> of energy stored in waves, and are associated with energetic interchanges between vertical velocity and temperature (or density) fluctuations.

30|$|Orbital {{solutions}} {{suggested that}} the eccentricity cycles have negligible power in annual and seasonal insolation time series, although it does modulate the amplitude of the climatic precession, and the amplitude of seasonal insolation. According to the researches on astronomical cycles during Quaternary, it is generally thought that the ~ 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles are paced by the ~ 100 kyr eccentricity, which is amplified and/or rectified through non-linear internal climate feedback processes influenced through the amplitude modulation of the seasonal insolation by the eccentricity (e.g. Hays et al., 1976; Imbrie et al., 1993; Huybers and Wunsch, 2003). The signal of astronomical cycles detected in this study would also be amplified and/or rectified by similar internal non-linear processes(es). Similarly, we suggest that the ~ 8 Myr cycle in the chert bed thickness time series results from amplitude modulation of the ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle through <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> process(es). Boulila et al. (2012) {{suggested that the}} amplitude modulation of the ~ 2 Myr eccentricity cycle may {{play an important role}} in carbon cycling, controlling a chain of astro-climatically sensitive processes such as terrestrial weathering, biosphere productivity, carbonate sedimentation and dissolution, burial and oxidation of organic carbon, etc. (e.g., Pälike et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009). Although their potential link with the chert bed thickness variation is highly speculative, productivity is most likely related with the chert bed thickness variation (e.g. Hori et al., 1993). In addition, terrestrial weathering is also potentially a controlling factor of the chert bed thickness variation, because the extreme source of biogenic silica burial in the ocean is the dissolved silica from continents (e.g. Tréguer et al., 1995; Tréguer, 2002). The formation mechanism of bedded chert rhythms and their genetic relation to long period astronomical cycles would be a key for understanding this <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> process(es), which should be clarified in the future. The ~ 30 Myr orbitally-paced lake level records in the Newark Supergroup during Late Triassic will also provide additional constraints for this topic. These issues must be addressed for complete understanding of the impact of long period astronomical cycles on global surface environments.|$|E

The method {{is applied to}} model non-linear effects in the soils of the San Fernando Valley (SFV) from the 17 January 1994 M 6. 7 Northridge earthquake. 0 - 7 Hz particle velocities are computed for an area of 17 km by 19 km immediately above the causative fault and 5 km below the surface where peak strike-parallel, strike-perpendicular, vertical, and total velocities reach values of 71 cm/s, 145 cm/s, 152 cm/s, and 180 cm/s, respectively. Selected Green`s functions and a soil model for the SFV are used to compute the approximate stress level during the earthquake, and comparison to the values for near-surface alluvium at the U. S. Nevada Test Site suggests that the non-linear regime may have been entered. We use selected values from the simulated particle velocity distribution at 5 km depth to compute the non-linear response in a soil column below a site within the Van Norman Complex in SFV, where the strongest ground motion was recorded. Since site-specific non- linear material parameters from the SFV are currently unavailable, values are taken from analyses of observed Test Site ground motions. Preliminary results show significant reduction of spectral velocities at the surface normalized to the peak source velocity due to non-linear effects when the peak velocity increases from 32 cm/s (approximately linear case) to 64 cm/s (30 - 92 %), 93 cm/s (7 - 83 %), and 124 cm/s (2 - 70 %).

40|$|The present {{explosion}} in digital communications and multi-user wireless cellular networks has urged {{a demand for}} more effective modulation methods, utilizing the available frequency spectrum more efficiently. To accommodate {{a large number of}} users sharing the same available frequency band, one requirement is the availability of large families of spreading sequences with excellent AC and CC properties. Another requirement is the availability of sets of orthogonal basis functions to extend capacity by exploiting all available degrees of freedom (e. g., temporal, frequency and spatial dimesions), or by employing orthogonal multi-code operation in parallel, such as used in the latest 3 GPP and 3 GPP 2 Wide-band Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) modulation standards by employing sets of orthogonal Walsh codes to improve the overall data throughput capacity. The generic Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) transmitter developed in this dissertation has originally been designed and implemented to investigate the practicality and usefulness of complex spreading sequences, and secondly, to verify the concept of non-linearly interpolated root-of-unity (NLI-RU) filtering. It was found that both concepts have a large potential for application in point-to-point, and particularly micro-cellular Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless-Local-Loop (WLL) environments. Since then, several novel concepts and subsystems {{have been added to the}} original system, some of which have been patented both locally and abroad, and are outlined below. Consequently, the ultimate goal of this research project was to apply the principles of the generic DSSS transmitter and receiver developed in this study in the implementation of a WLL radio-frequency (RF) -link, and particularly towards the establishment of affordable wireless multimedia services in rural areas. The extended coverage at exceptionally low power emission levels offered by the new design will be particularly useful in rural applications. The proposed WLL concept can for example also be utilized to add a unique mobility feature to for example existing Private Automatic Branch Exchanges (PABXs). The proposed system will in addition offer superior teletraffic capacity compared to existing micro-cellular technologies, e. g., the Digital European Cordless Telephony (DECT) system, which has been consider by Telkom for employment in rural areas. The latter is a rather outdated interim standard offering much lower spectral efficiency and capacity than competitive CDMA-solutions, such as the concept analyzed in this dissertation, which is based on the use of unique large families of spectrally well confined (i. e., band-limited) constant envelope (CE) complex spreading sequences (CSS) with superior correlation properties. The CE characteristic of the new spreading sequences furthermore facilitates the design of systems with superior power efficiency and exceptionally robust performance characteristics (much less spectral re-growth) compared to existing 2 G and 3 G modulation standards, in the presence of <b>non-linear</b> power <b>amplification.</b> This feature allows for a system with larger coverage for a given performance level and limited peak power, or alternatively, longer battery life for a given maximum communication distance and performance level, within a specified fixed spreading bandwidth. In addition, the possibility to extend the concept to orthogonal multi-code operation provides for comparable capacity to present 3 G modulation standards, while still preserving superior power efficiency characteristics in <b>non-linear</b> power <b>amplification.</b> Conventional spread spectrum communication systems employ binary spreading sequences, such as Gold or Kasami sequences. The practical implementation of such a system is relatively simple. The design and implementation of a spread-spectrum communication system employing complex spreading sequences is however considerable more complex and has not been previously presented, nor been implemented in hardware. The design of appropriate code lock loops for CSS has led to a unique design with 3 dB performance advantage compared to similar loops designed for binary spreading sequences. The theoretical analysis and simulation of such a system will be presented, with the primary focus on an efficient hardware implementation of all new concepts proposed, in the form of a WLL RF-link demonstrator.

To directly detect objects hidden in highly scattering media, the diffusive component of light needs to be sorted out from early arrived ballistic and snake photons. In an optical imaging system, images are collected in transmission or back-scattered geometry. The early arrival photons in the transmission approach, always carry the direct information of the hidden object embedded in the turbid medium. In the back-scattered approach, the result is not so forth coming. In the presence of a scattering host, the first arrival photons in back-scattered approach will be directly photons from the host material. In the presentation, NLOPG was applied to acquire time resolved back-scattered images under the phase matching condition. A time-gated amplified signal was obtained through this NLOPG process. The system's gain was approximately 100 times. The time-gate was achieved through phase matching condition where only coherent photons retain their phase. As a result, the diffusive photons, which were the primary contributor to the background, were removed. With a large dynamic range and high resolution, time-gated early light imaging has the potential for improving rocket/aircraft design by determining jets shape and particle sizes. Refinements to these techniques may enable drop size measurements in the highly scattering, optically dense region of multi-element rocket injectors.

It {{is able to}} providemaximal 480 Mbps data-rate {{at a distance of}} 2 meters in realisticindoormulti-path environments. UWB technology is widely applied to the next generation WPAN as well as the wireless accessof consumer electronics at home. Recently, Multi-Band OFDM based UWB technology proposed by WiMedia has been selected as the international standard by ISO. In China, a new transmission architecture based on Dual-Carrier OFDM technology is adopted as UWB standard draft. Comparing to MB-OFDM based UWB system, DC-OFDM based UWB system has multiple advantages, like more spectrum resource,lower requirements on devices, etc. Besides, it is compatiblewith existing MB-OFDM based UWB technology. Therefore, DC-OFDM based UWB is more flexible. Synchronizationis the first step atthe receiver digital baseband, which is of tremendous importance in any wireless communication systems. The performance of synchronization directly determines whether the receiver can pick up radio signals correctly or not, whether the baseband modules can fulfill the digital signal processing effectively or not. The synchronization process in OFDM system can be briefly divided into two parts: symbol timing and frequency synchronization. Symbol timing serves to judge the starting position of OFDM symbolsafter considering the impact of multi-path fading channel. While the frequency synchronization estimates the multiple imperfections in analog front-end signal processing and make proper compensation. This thesis puts the emphasis on synchronization issues in DC-OFDM based UWB systems. We are the first to analyze the synchronization algorithm as well as the hardware implementation method tailored for DC-OFDM based UWB system. We also present the VLSI implementation result for synchronization module. The thesis consists of symbol timing and frequency synchronization. Regarding on the symbol timing, we analyze the impact of several synchronization errors inOFDM system. After that, we divide the synchronization process into four modulesby functionality: packet detection, coarse timing, TFC detection and fine timing. The internal parameters in each moduleare determined by system simulations. In the aspect of algorithm development, we adopt the joint auto-correlation and cross-correlation method to meet the requirements of UWB system in different indoor multi-path environments, and therefore achieve the robustness. In the aspect of hardware implementation, we put the attention on the structure of some key modules in symbol timing and their VLSI implementation result, such as auto-correlator, cross-correlator, real-number divider, etc. Regarding on the frequency synchronization, we first investigate the multiple analog front-end imperfections in OFDM system, like CFO, SFO and I/Q imbalance, and present their mathematics models respectively in DC-OFDM based UWB system. After that, we analyze the performance degradation in OFDM system due to these non-ideal effects by the metric of EVM. RF designer can build the connection between mismatching parameters and performance degradation by referring to the analysis. Hence, theRF designer is able to traceout the outline of system design. In the aspect of algorithm development, we explore the intrinsic character of I/Q imbalancewhich causes the image interference. Then, we design a set of new training sequences based on phase rotation and give the corresponding estimation algorithm. The simulation result shows that the new training sequence is able to obtain the diversity message introduced by I/Q imbalance and therefore achieve the diversity gain during demodulation process. In order to deal with the challenging situation where multiple analog front-end imperfections co-exist, we propose a joint estimation and compensation scheme. In the aspect of hardware implementation, we present the hardware structure of CFO estimation and compensation module catered for DC-OFDM based UWB system, with the emphasis on CORDIC unit that is responsible for triangle calculations. The VLSI implementation result shows that the proposed CFO estimation and compensation module satisfies the timing and resource requirements in DC-OFDM based UWB system. In the last, we present the prospective research area in 60 -GHz applications. It includes multiplenon-ideal impairments, like phase noise, <b>non-linear</b> power <b>amplification,</b> DC offset, ADCs mismatch, etc. It is even more challenging to develop joint estimation and compensation scheme for these non-ideal effects...|$|R
40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have pointed out}} that the accumulation of strain energy in the Penninsular Indian Shield region may lead to earthquakes of significant magnitude(Srinivasan and Sreenivas, 1977; Valdiya, 1998; Purnachandra Rao, 1999; Seeber et al., 1999; Ramalingeswara Rao, 2000; Gangrade and Arora, 2000). However very few studies have been carried out to quantify the seismic hazard of the entire Pennisular Indian region. In the present study the seismic hazard evaluation of South Indian region (8. 0 ° N - 20 ° N; 72 ° E - 88 ° E) was done using the deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard approaches. Effects of two of the important geotechnical aspects of seismic hazard, site response and liquefaction, have also been evaluated and the results are presented in this work. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) at ground surface level was evaluated by considering the local site effects. The liquefaction potential index (LPI) and factor of safety against liquefaction wee evaluated based on performance based liquefaction potential evaluation method. The first step in the seismic hazard analysis is to compile the earthquake catalogue. Since a comprehensive catalogue was not available for the region, it was complied by collecting data from different national (Guaribidanur Array, Indian Meterorological Department (IMD), National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) Hyderabad and Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) Kalpakkam etc.) and international agencies (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), International Seismological Centre (ISC), United States Geological Survey (USGS) etc.). The collected data was in different magnitude scales and hence they were converted to a single magnitude scale. The magnitude scale which is chosen in this study is the moment magnitude scale, since it the most widely used and the most advanced scientific magnitude scale. The declustering of earthquake catalogue was due to remove the related events and the completeness of the catalogue was analysed using the method suggested by Stepp (1972). Based on the complete part of the catalogue the seismicity parameters were evaluated for the study area. Another important step in the seismic hazard analysis is the identification of vulnerable seismic sources. The different types of seismic sources considered are (i) linear sources (ii) point sources (ii) areal sources. The linear seismic sources were identified based on the seismotectonic atlas published by geological survey of India (SEISAT, 2000). The required pages of SEISAT (2000) were scanned and georeferenced. The declustered earthquake data was superimposed on this and the sources which were associated with earthquake magnitude of 4 and above were selected for further analysis. The point sources were selected using a method similar to the one adopted by Costa et. al. (1993) and Panza et al. (1999) and the areal sources were identified based on the method proposed by Frankel et al. (1995). In order to map the attenuation properties of the region more precisely, three attenuation relations, viz. Toto et al. (1997), Atkinson and Boore (2006) and Raghu Kanth and Iyengar (2007) were used in this study. The two types of uncertainties encountered in seismic hazard analysis are aleatory and epistemic. The uncertainty of the data is the cause of aleatory variability and it accounts for the randomness associated with the results given by a particular model. The incomplete knowledge in the predictive models causes the epistemic uncertainty (modeling uncertainty). The aleatory variability of the attenuation relations are taken into account in the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis by considering the standard deviation of the model error. The epistemic uncertainty is considered by multiple models for the evaluation of seismic hazard and combining them using a logic tree. Two different methodologies were used in the evaluation of seismic hazard, based on deterministic and probabilistic analysis. For the evaluation of peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) and spectral acceleration (Sa) values, a new set of programs were developed in MATLAB and the entire analysis was done using these programs. In the deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) two types of seismic sources, viz. linear and point sources, were considered and three attenuation relations were used. The study area was divided into small grids of size 0. 1 ° x 0. 1 ° (about 12000 grid points) and the PHA and Sa values were evaluated for the mean and 84 th percentile values at the centre of each of the grid points. A logic tree approach, using two types of sources and three attenuation relations, was adopted for the evaluation of PHA and Sa values. Logic tree permits the use of alternative models in the hazard evaluation and appropriate weightages can be assigned to each model. By evaluating the 84 th percentile values, the uncertainty in spectral acceleration values can also be considered (Krinitzky, 2002). The spatial variations of PHA and Sa values for entire South India are presented in this work. The DSHA method will not consider the uncertainties involved in the earthquake recurrence process, hypocentral distance and the attenuation properties. Hence the seismic hazard analysis was done based on the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), and the evaluation of PHA and Sa values were done by considering the uncertainties involved in the earthquake occurrence process. The uncertainties in earthquake recurrence rate, hypocentral location and attenuation characteristic were considered in this study. For evaluating the seismicity parameters and the maximum expected earthquake magnitude (mmax) the study area was divided into different source zones. The division of study area was done based on the spatial variation of the seismicity parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’ and the mmax values were evaluated for each of these zones and these values were used in the analysis. Logic tree approach was adopted in the analysis and this permits the use of multiple models. Twelve different models (2 sources x 2 zones x 3 attenuation) were used in the analysis and based on the weightage for each of them; the final PHA and Sa values at bed rock level were evaluated. These values were evaluated for a grid size of 0. 1 ° x 0. 1 ° and the spatial variation of these values for return periods of 475 and 2500 years (10 % and 2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) are presented in this work. Both the deterministic and probabilistic analyses highlighted that the seismic hazard is high at Koyna region. The PHA values obtained for Koyna, Bangalore and Ongole regions are higher than the values given by BIS- 1893 (2002). The values obtained for south western part of the study area, especially for parts of kerala are showing the PHA values less than what is provided in BIS- 1893 (2002). The 84 th percentile values given DSHA can be taken as the upper bound PHA and Sa values for South India. The main geotechnical aspects of earthquake hazard are site response and seismic soil liquefaction. When the seismic waves travel from the bed rock through the overlying soil to the ground surface the PHA and Sa values will get changed. This amplification or de-amplification of the seismic waves depends on the type of the overlying soil. The assessment of site class can be done based on different site classification schemes. In the present work, the surface level peak ground acceleration (PGA) values were evaluated based on four different site classes suggested by NEHRP (BSSC, 2003) and the PGA values were developed for all the four site classes based on <b>non-linear</b> site <b>amplification</b> technique. Based on the geotechnical site investigation data, the site class can be determined and then the appropriate PGA and Sa values can be taken from the respective PGA maps. Response spectra were developed for the entire study area and the results obtained for three major cities are discussed here. Different methods are suggested by various codes to Smooth the response spectra. The smoothed design response spectra were developed for these cities based on the smoothing techniques given by NEHRP (BSSC, 2003), IS code (BIS- 1893, 2002) and Eurocode- 8 (2003). A Comparison of the results obtained from these studies is also presented in this work. If the site class at any location in the study area is known, then the peak ground acceleration (PGA) values can be obtained from the respective map. This provides a simplified methodology for evaluating the PGA values for a vast area like South India. Since the surface level PGA values were evaluated for different site classes, the effects of surface topography and basin effects were not taken into account. The analysis of response spectra clearly indicates the variation of peak spectral acceleration values for different site classes and the variation of period of oscillation corresponding to maximum Sa values. The comparison of the smoothed design response spectra obtained using different codal provisions suggest the use of NEHRP(BSSC, 2003) provisions. The conventional liquefaction analysis method takes into account only one earthquake magnitude and ground acceleration values. In order to overcome this shortfall, a performance based probabilistic approach (Kramer and Mayfield, 2007) was adopted for the liquefaction potential evaluation in the present work. Based on this method, the factor of safety against liquefaction and the SPT values required to prevent liquefaction for return periods of 475 and 2500 years were evaluated for Bangalore city. This analysis was done based on the SPT data obtained from 450 boreholes across Bangalore. A new method to evaluate the liquefaction return period based on CPT values is proposed in this work. To validate the new method, an analysis was done for Bangalore by converting the SPT values to CPT values and then the results obtained were compared with the results obtained using SPT values. The factor of safety against liquefaction at different depths were integrated using liquefaction potential index (LPI) method for Bangalore. This was done by calculating the factor of safety values at different depths based on a performance based method and then the LPI values were evaluated. The entire liquefaction potential analysis and the evaluation of LPI values were done using a set of newly developed programs in MATLAB. Based on the above approaches it is possible to evaluate the SPT and CPT values required to prevent liquefaction for any given return period. An analysis was done to evaluate the SPT and CPT values required to prevent liquefaction for entire South India for return periods of 475 and 2500 years. The spatial variations of these values are presented in this work. The liquefaction potential analysis of Bangalore clearly indicates that majority of the area is safe against liquefaction. The liquefaction potential map developed for South India, based on both SPT and CPT values, will help hazard mitigation authorities to identify the liquefaction vulnerable area. This in turn will help in reducing the liquefaction hazard...|$|R
40|$|A major {{critical}} {{aspect of}} the modern injection systems of low Nox emission aeronautical combustors is {{the formation of the}} fuel liquid film and its subsequent break-up in the presence of air blast co-flow. The configuration under study in the present work refers to a stratified two-phase gas-liquid flow confined in a horizontal channel. Contrary to previous papers of the literature, where a parallel flow configuration is classically analyzed with plug velocity profile in both fluids, in the present paper the flow is spatially developing, starting from a plug-plug profile at the channel entrance. The sudden change of interface boundary condition produces the flow development and the emergence of a solitary Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, whose formation and evolution are numerically studied. Computer simulations are carried out by means of a home-made modified version of the SURFER code, which is based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) technique. Two types of possible instabilities are detected. The most physically relevant one is due to <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> of finite-amplitude entrance disturbances linked to the sudden change of inlet boundary condition and manifests itself as the formation and propagation of a solitary Kelvin-Helmholtz wave. The second one is produced by the linear amplification of very small numerical disturbances generated by the so called spurious currents which may arise around the interface region not yet reached by the traveling wave...|$|E
40|$|An in vivo {{preparation}} {{has been}} developed to study the mechanisms underlying spontaneous sleep oscillations. Dual and triple simultaneous intracellular recordings were made from neurons in small isolated cortical slabs (10 mm × 6 mm) in anesthetized cats. Spontaneously occurring slow sleep oscillations, present in the adjacent intact cortex, were absent in small slabs. However, the isolated slabs displayed brief active periods separated by long periods of silence, up to 60 s in duration. During these silent periods, 60 % of neurons showed <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> of low-amplitude depolarizing activity. Nearly 40 % of the cells, {{twice as many as}} in intact cortex, were classified as intrinsically bursting. In cortical network models based on Hodgkin–Huxley-like neurons, the summation of simulated spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials was sufficient to activate a persistent sodium current, initiating action potentials in single neurons that then spread through the network. Consistent with this model, enlarging the isolated cortical territory to an isolated gyrus (30 mm × 20 mm) increased the probability of initiating large-scale activity. In these larger territories, both the frequency and regularity of the slow oscillation approached that generated in intact cortex. The frequency of active periods in an analytical model of the cortical network accurately predicted the scaling observed in simulations and from recordings in cortical slabs of increasing size...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFaster-than-Nyquist (FTN) {{signaling}} {{appears as}} an attractive method to improve spectral efficiency {{at the price}} of an increased complexity at the receiver. The receiver generally implements a turbo-equalization/detection scheme to benefit from all the promises of the FTN signaling. However, this is not the only limitation we have to deal with. Indeed, compressing in the time domain impact the emitted signal and it usually results in an increase of the envelope fluctuations. This leads to an inherent multi-objectives trade-off between performance, targeted spectral efficiency and limited Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The last aspect is crucial when considering a satellite communication link due to <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> effects that can occur on-board the satellite. Usually, FTN studies focus on spectral efficiency increase for a fixed modulation order, trying to trade-off between performance and PAPR properties. In this paper, we show that, for a given asymptotic spectral efficiency, we can compress low order modulations to increase the spectral efficiency of these schemes while controlling the PAPR increase to achieve a better PAPR than the non compressed scheme with a higher modulation order. Thus, for the same asymptotic spectral efficiency, we can achieve 1 dB gain in terms of PAPR and 2 dB gain in Bit Error Rate (BER) performances for a coded 8 -PSK FTN system compared to a coded 16 -APSK. For the same BER performances, the asymptotic spectral efficiency gain obtained in linear context is over 20 %, higher when non-linearities are taken into account...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} Fourier techniques to characterize the transmitted and reflected wavefront of optical components. Specifically, a power spectral density, (PSD), approach is used. High power solid-state lasers exhibit <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> of specific spatial frequencies. Thus, specifications that limit the amplitude of these spatial frequencies are necessary {{in the design of}} these systems. Further, NIF optical components have square, rectangular or irregularly shaped apertures with major dimensions up-to 800 mm. Components with non-circular apertures can not be analyzed correctly with Zernicke polynomials since these functions are an orthogonal set for circular apertures only. A more complete and powerful representation of the optical wavefront can be obtained by Fourier analysis in 1 or 2 dimensions. The PSD is obtained from the amplitude of frequency components present in the Fourier spectrum. The shape of a resultant wavefront or the focal spot of a complex multicomponent laser system can be calculated and optimized using PSDs of the individual optical components which comprise the system. Surface roughness can be calculated over a range of spatial scale-lengths by integrating the PSD. Finally, since the optical transfer function (OTF) of the instruments used to measure the wavefront degrades at high spatial frequencies, the PSD of an optical component is underestimated. We can correct for this error by modifying the PSD function to restore high spatial frequency information. The strengths of PSD analysis are leading us to develop optical specifications incorporating this function for the planned National Ignition Facility (NIF) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied in}} silico effects of {{structural}} stress in Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a genome-reduced model bacterial organism, by tracking the damage propagating on its metabolic network after a deleterious perturbation. First, we analyzed failure cascades spreading from individual reactions and pairs of reactions and compared {{the results to}} those in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. To alert to the potential damage caused {{by the failure of}} individual reactions, we propose a generic predictor based on local information that identifies target reactions for structural vulnerability. With respect to the simultaneous failure of pairs of reactions, we detected strong <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification</b> effects that can be predicted by the presence of specific motifs in the intersection of single cascades. We further connected the metabolic and gene co-expression networks of M. pneumoniae through enzyme activities, and studied the consequences of knocking out individual genes and clusters of genes. Damage caused by single gene knockouts reveals a strong correlation between genome-scale cascades of large impact and gene essentiality. At the same time, we found that genes controlling high-damage reactions tend to operate in functional isolation, as a metabolic protection mechanism. We conclude that the architecture of M. pneumoniae, both at the level of metabolism and genome, seems to have evolved towards increased structural robustness, similarly to other more complex model bacterial organisms, despite its reduced genome size and its greater metabolic network linearity. Our approach, although motivated biochemically, is generic enough to be of potential use toward analyzing and predicting spreading of structural stress in any bipartite complex network...|$|E
40|$|A {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} widespread deployment of LMDS systems is the limited distance of current systems. Rain attenuation and limited transmitter power are the primary causes of the limited distance. Adaptive digital predistortion {{is presented as a}} method of increasing effective transmitter power. A background on LMDS link design, <b>non-linear</b> <b>amplification,</b> and predistortion is presented to assist the reader. A developed simulation uses AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics obtained from laboratory measurements of a 28 GHz amplifier to determine the effect of several predistortion implementation options and to confirm the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The potential impact of this predistortion architecture on LMDS system design is considered. The presented multi-stage predistortion architecture is found to be capable of implementation at Msymbol/second rates utilizing a FPGA or custom IC and a moderate speed digital signal processor. iii Acknowledgements I would like to thank Dr. Bostian for being my advisor throughout my graduate school career.
