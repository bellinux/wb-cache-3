5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{indication}} of a naming error, Engelmann's binomial was {{used to describe the}} plant until 1893, when F.A. Haage Jr. changed Terscheck's Echinocactus reichenbachii to Echinocereus reichenbachii, which Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose later adopted. This broke with the long-standing botanical tradition to use the earliest known <b>name,</b> <b>but</b> because Terscheck's description was lacking and possibly referred to as many as a dozen species, his binomial was supplanted by Haage's.|$|E

They planned to name the film Bilahari after the Carnatic raga of the same <b>name,</b> <b>but</b> changed it to Rudraveena to reflect the characters' anger, equating it {{to that of the}} Hindu god Shiva.|$|E
