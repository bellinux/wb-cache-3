To explain {{the choice between}} the two alternatives for defence of fruit production against the hail risk, insurance and anti hail-nets, was developed a model that simulates the effects of variations of each component of cost and of the <b>public</b> <b>aid.</b> The quality of the model was then tested on three alpine areas representing different levels of hail risk. The test allows to answer in particular to the following questions. a) Without <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> {{which would be the}} best choice of defence against hail risk? b) How the <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> influence the choice of defence against hail risk? c) The results of the test are confirmed by the choices of alpine fruit farms? d) How can we improve the public policy against the hail risk?Fruit farms.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>aids</b> towards {{renewable}} energy sources in Spain have had the consequence of a great increase in their use. This is particularly true for the case of wind generation. For the year 2007, we show that the savings in social costs due to carbon emissions account for a figure between 25 % and 78 % of total aids. Since some of the <b>public</b> <b>aids</b> are just a money transfer with no effect on total social welfare the justification of the net costs of the aids is higher. For the particular case of wind generation, we find that in the worst case scenario 45 % of the social cost implied by the <b>public</b> <b>aids</b> is justified by the reduction in carbon emissions, and {{that the benefits of}} CO 2 reductions are 135 % higher than the costs in the best case scenario. ...|$|R

The results achieved for the period 2007 - 2010 enable us to unveil relevant relationships between the policies of assets and liabilities’ management, and the recourse to <b>public</b> <b>aid.</b> A particularly clear variable, which has emerged, is the level of participation/involvement in the derivative market, inferred from the presence of its products in the financial statements. Given that this presence does not seem to decline but, on the contrary, to increase after the <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> has been assigned, some careful considerations need to be carried out on the importance and width of the restructuring plans provided and their monitoring...|$|R
