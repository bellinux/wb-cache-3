It is quite intuitive that the multi-resolution feature can be utilized to simplify generation of NC (Numerical Control) tool paths for rough machining. In this paper, a new method of parallel <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> path generation for subdivision surfaces is presented. The basic idea of the method includes two steps: first, extending G-Buffer to a strip buffer (called S-Buffer) by dividing the working area into strips to generate <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> paths for objects of large size; second, generating <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> paths by parallel implementation of S-Buffer based on MPI (Message Passing Interface). Moreover, the recursion depth of the surface can be estimated for a user-specified error tolerance, so we substitute the polyhedral mesh for the limit surface during rough machining. Furthermore, we exploit the locality of S-Buffer and develop a dynamic division and load-balanced strategy to effectively parallelize S-Buffer.

40|$|Reliability {{evaluation}} {{is the basis}} for reliability design of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tools.</b> Since traditional reliability evaluation methods do not consider the working conditions’ effects on reliability, there is a great error of a result of a traditional method compared with an actual value. A new reliability evaluation model of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tools</b> is proposed based on the Cox proportional hazards model, which describes the mathematical relation between the working condition covariates and the reliability level of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tools.</b> Firstly, the coefficients of working condition covariates in the new reliability evaluation model are estimated by the partial likelihood estimation method; secondly, the working condition covariates which have no effects on the reliability of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tools</b> are eliminated by the likelihood ratio test; then parameters of the baseline failure rate function are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method. Thus, the reliability evaluation model of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tool</b> is obtained under different working conditions and the reliability level of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tools</b> is obtained. Case study shows that the proposed method could establish the relation between the working condition covariates and the reliability level of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tools,</b> and it would provide a new way for the reliability evaluation of <b>NC</b> machine <b>tools...</b>|$|R

This paper describes an improved <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> path pattern for pocket milling. The basic pattern of the improved tool path is a conventional contour-parallel tool path.

When reaching a corner, the cutter loops around the appended tool path segments so that corner material is removed progressively in several passes. By using the corner-looping based tool path, cutter contact length can be controlled by adjusting the number of appended tool path loops. The procedures of creating the improved tool path for different corner shapes are explained. The proposed tool path generation was implemented as an add-on user function in a CAD/CAM system.

However, several grinding cycles are often required to reduce the form error to an acceptable value, significantly dependent on the tool path compensation technique used. This paper reports on a novel form error compensation technique for tungsten carbide mould insert machining utilizing a parallel grinding method. In this technique, a newly developed program is used to process the profile data measured using a Form Talysurf profilometer, and to further generate the <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> path for form error compensation. The developed technique focuses on the compensation of form error resulted by two major error sources, wheel radius and waviness errors. Using the developed technique, the initial residual form error upon the completion of primary grinding is minimized. Subsequently, the residual form error is compensated by modifying the <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> path. With this technique, the speed of convergence of the residual form error has improved markedly. The grinding result shows that, after just one compensation cycle, a form error of approximately 0. 3 mu m in PV is achieved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm to extract machinable volumes {{that need to}} be removed from a stock, given a boundary model of the part. Machinable implies that these volumes are extracted and arranged in a hierarchy such that each volume in the list is accessible for machining after its preceding volume has been machined. These volumes can be used to automate process planning and <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> path generation. The algorithm identifies the cavity volumes in the part with respect to outermost faces in the part and fills them with the appropriate primitive volume to obtain the stock from which the part can be realized. Unlike the decomposition-based approaches reported, this algorithm directly identifies primitive volumes that when combined form the cavity volumes corresponding to the machining features. Primitive volumes enable handling parts with interacting features and renders redundant the additional processing of machining features required to generate a <b>NC</b> <b>tool</b> path. The primitive machinable volumes are cuboids, wedges and collars. The algorithm handles both prismatic and cylindrical (turned) components.
