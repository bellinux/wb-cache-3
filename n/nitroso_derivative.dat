50|$|Synthesis {{starts with}} the {{reaction}} of the N-benzyl derivative from methyl anthranilate with nitrous acid to give the N-nitroso derivative. Reduction by means of sodium thiosulfate leads to the transient hydrazine (3), which undergoes spontaneous internal hydrazide formation. Treatment of the enolate of this amide with 3-chloro-1-dimethylamkino propane gives benzydamine (5). Please note there is an error in this section: US3318905 states that the <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivative</b> is reduced with sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) and not with sodium hyposulfite (sodium thiosulfate), as shown in the above scheme and stated in text. An interesting alternative synthesis of this substance starts by sequential reaction of N-benzylaniline with phosgene, and then with sodium azide to product the corresponding carbonyl azide. On heating, nitrogen is evolved and a separatable mixture of nitrene insertion product and the desired ketoindazole # results. The latter reaction appears to be a Curtius rearrangement type product to produce an N-isocyanate #, which then cyclizes. Alkylation of the enol with sodium methoxide and 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride gives benzydamine.|$|E

Both oxidation of the dihydropyridine ring and {{the reduction of the}} nitro or benzoxadiazole moiety are observed using cyclic voltammetry and the shape of the voltammograms depending on the initial scan direction.

Removal of RDX by all isolates was accompanied by the formation of all three nitroso derivatives, with the mono <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivative</b> (MNX) being the major one.

The study was also designed to determine which lead-free ballistic modifiers accelerated 2 -NDPA depletion. The increased depletion rate occurred in propellants containing monobasic copper salicylate. Four lead-free propellants were then formulated to improved aging characteristics over previous lead-free propellant formulations. The new formulations reduced or replaced the monobasic copper salicylate. The new formulations had improved aging characteristics. Their burn rates, however, were unacceptable for use in a 2. 75 inch rocket. To compare aging characteristics, stabilizer depletion rates of RPD- 422, AA 2, M 28, and RLC 470 / 6 A were measured or taken from the literature. The data were fit to a kinetic model.

40|$|Most S-nitrosothiols (RSNO) are {{unstable}} in {{aqueous solution}} and decompose to release nitric oxide. This is catalysed by copper ions. A mechanistic study of NO formation from S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivative</b> of the most abundant thiol in the body, was carried out. This relatively stable S-nitrosothiol decomposed {{in the presence of}} reduced glutathione and copper ions. The products were identified as nitric oxide and oxidised glutathione, observed as a complex of copper. The role of reduced glutathione was two fold. Firstly, it reduced Cu(^ 2 +) to produce the active Cu(^+) catalytic species and regenerated the catalyst from the oxidised glutathione complex. Spectrophotometric kinetic measurements, under pseudo first order conditions ([GSNO]»[Cu(^ 2 +) ]) showed no conventional order with respect to nitrosothiol. This was attributed to the inconstant concentration of available copper during reaction due to the ability of reduced glutathione to complex Cu(^+) and oxidised glutathione to complex Cu(^ 2 +). An investigation of thiol induced decomposition of GSNO and other more stable nitrosothiols showed the reaction to be first order with respect to thiol and nitrosothiol. The rate equation was determined and has been explained in terms of a radical mechanism involving rate limiting attack of the thiyl radical on the RS-NO bond. The decomposition of S-nitrosothiols via the mercuric ion was also investigated. Reactions were stoichiometric rather than catalytic, and the products determined to be H(_ 2) NO(_ 2) (^+) and RSHg(^+).

Second order rate constants obtained for a variety of nitrosothiols showed no dependency of the rate of the reaction on the structure of R.

40|$|Pathways for the {{degradation}} of 3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -hydroxy-azobenzene- 4 '-sulfonic acid (I) and 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyazobenzene- 4 '-sulfonamide (II) by the manganese peroxidase and ligninase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and by the peroxidase of Streptomyces chromofuscus have been proposed. Twelve metabolic products were found, and their mechanisms of formation were explained. Preliminary oxidative activation of the dyes resulted {{in the formation of}} cationic species, making the molecules vulnerable to the nucleophilic attack of water. Two types of hydrolytic cleavage were observed. Asymmetric splitting gave rise to quinone and diazene derivatives, while symmetric splitting resulted in the formation of quinone monoimine and <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivatives.</b> These unstable intermediates underwent further redox, oxidation, and hydrolytic transformation, eventually furnishing 11 organic products and ammonia...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{transformation}} of the explosive RDX (hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine) by microorganisms involves sequential reduction of N-NO 2 to the corresponding N-NO groups resulting in the initial formation of MNX (hexahydro- 1 -nitroso- 3, 5 -dinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine). MNX is further reduced to the dinitroso (DNX) and trinitroso (TNX) derivatives. In this paper, we describe the degradation of MNX and TNX by the unusual cytochrome P 450 XplA that mediates metabolism of RDX in Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain 11 Y. XplA is known to degrade RDX under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and, in the present study, was found able to degrade MNX to give similar products distribution including NO 2 -, NO 3 -, N 2 O, and HCHO but with varying stoichiometric ratio, that is, 2. 06, 0. 33, 0. 33, 1. 18, and 1. 52, 0. 15, 1. 04, 2. 06, respectively. In addition, the ring cleavage product 4 -nitro- 2, 4,-diazabutanal (NDAB) and a trace amount of another intermediate with a [M-H]- at 102 Da, identified as ONNHCH 2 NHCHO (NO-NDAB), were detected mostly under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, degradation of TNX was observed only under anaerobic conditions {{in the presence of}} RDX and/or MNX. When we incubated RDX and its <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivatives</b> with XplA, we found that successive replacement of N-NO 2 by N-NO slowed the removal rate of the chemicals with degradation rates in the order RDX > MNX > DNX, suggesting that denitration was mainly responsible for initiating cyclic nitroamines degradation by XplA. This study revealed that XplA preferentially cleaved the N-NO 2 over the N-NO linkages, but could nevertheless degrade all three <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivatives,</b> demonstrating the potential for complete RDX removal in explosives-contaminated sites.

40|$|This review principally {{addresses}} {{a number of}} aspects of usage of pesticides as well as populations at potential risk and attempts to highlight categories of pesticides whose structures or those of their metabolites and/or trace impurities, degradation and transformation products suggest an a priori mutagenic and/or carcinogenic risk. The pesticides considered include: DDT, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 2, 4, 5 -T, pentachlorophenol, and various herbicidal precursors (e. g., carbamates, triazines) of nitrosamines and <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Structural features {{of a number of}} halo-unsaturated pesticides (e. g., dichloropropenes) were also reviewed from a viewpoint of contrasting their potential mutagenicity with that of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride. Additionally the mutagenicity of the organophosphorus pesticide Trichlorophon is contrasted with that of its degradation products. Pesticidal agents constitute a prime area of human concern. Included in this category are insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fumigants, acaricides, seed sterilants, soil nematocides, growth inhibitors, growth regulators, and chemosterilants...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Oxidation of N-alkyl and N-aryl sulfoximines and 1, 5 -hydride shift of S-alkenyl sulfoximines have been studied. Oxidation of N-alkyl sulfoximines using dimethyldioxirane gave sulfones and <b>nitroso</b> <b>derivatives.</b> A mechanism for the process was proposed. Thermal isomerization and decomposition of different N-substituted and S-alkenyl sulfoximines was studied. Cyclic sulfoximines and N-H sulfoximines were obtained. Reactivity was compared. Stereocenters and isomerization of cyclic products were studied. 1, 5 -Hydride shift was proposed as the mechanism for these transformations...|$|R
