40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Droplet {{formation}} from {{a flexible}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate</b> {{driven by a}} prescribed-waveform excitation of a piezoelectric is numerically investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the VOF method. The droplet generator with a flexible <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate,</b> which is free to vibrate due to the pressure acting on the plate, is modeled in a computational domain. The CFD analysis includes the fluid-structure interaction between fluid and a flexible plate using large deflection theory. The problem {{is characterized by the}} nondimensional variables based on the capillary parameters of time, velocity, and pressure. The CFD model is validated with experiment results. This study examines the characteristics of the applied waveforms and <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate</b> material properties to change the vibrational characteristics of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate.</b> The effect of fluid properties on the droplet formation process is also investigated focusing on surface tension and viscous forces. The mechanism of the droplet formation excited by a drop-on-demand piezoelectric waveform is investigated using a step-function and a pulse waveform. The piezoelectric displacement {{plays an important role in}} generating either forward-driven momentum or a suction pressure inside the chamber. For the step-function waveform, the nondimensional applied impulse is defined and used to characterize the post-breakoff droplet volume. Increasing the impulse of the piezoelectric can be used to cause a faster droplet velocity and it is shown that the vibration of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate</b> has a strong effect on the droplet velocity, shape, and volume. Surface tension has strong influence on the droplet formation characteristics which is in contrast to a viscous force that makes little difference on the droplet formation for a range of viscosities studied. For the combination of a fluid with high surface tension and the most flexible <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate,</b> this system can cause the droplet not to be ejected from the nozzle. Successive droplet impingement onto a solid surface is numerically investigated using a CFD multiphase flow model (VOF method). The main focus of this study is to better understand the hydrodynamics of the non-splash impingement process, particularly the effect of a dynamic contact angle and fluid properties along with the interaction between successive droplets while they are impinging onto a solid surface. The pre-impact droplet conditions are prescribed based on a spherical droplet diameter, velocity, and inter-droplet spacing. The molecular kinetic theory is used to model the dynamic contact angle as a function of a contact line velocity. The numerical scheme is validated against experiment al results. In the impact spreading and receding processes, results are analyzed to determine the nondimensional deformation characteristics of both single and successive droplet impingements with the variation of fluid properties such as surface tension and dynamic viscosity. These characteristics include spreading ratio, spreading velocity, and a dynamic contact angle. The inclusion of a dynamic contact angle is shown to have a major effect on droplet spreading. In successive droplet impingement, the second drop causes a surge of spreading velocity and contact angle with an associate complex recirculating flow near the contact line after it initially impacts the preceding droplet when it is in an advancing condition. This interaction is less dramatic when the first drop is receding or stationary. The surface tension has the most effect on the maximum spreading radius in both single and successive droplet impingements. In contrast to this, the viscosity directly affects the damping of the spreading-receding process...|$|E

Thereby, electromagnets are used to stop and hold the chips at certain desired locations. A nozzle pitch gradient is used to guide the ultra-thin chips. In addition {{to the design of}} the concept, the research focuses on the main physics corresponding to the concept to determine the theoretical system behaviour. By means of modelling steps the main physics were determined and by means of experiments the model results were evaluated. The measurement results show that the bending of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate</b> is relatively small in comparison with the chip levitation heights from the vertical airflow force test. In addition, the results show that the measurement set-up is able to lift the ultra-thin chips not only in the case when the electromagnet of the system is turned off, but also when it is turned on.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The droplet {{formation}} {{process in}} the vicinity of the nozzle exit and the behavior of a spreading droplet during impingement on a smooth glass surface were studied. Two nozzle geometries were tested. The first case was a stiff stainless steel <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate</b> 0. 787 mm thick. The second case was a flexible stainless steel <b>nozzle</b> <b>plate</b> 0. 102 mm thick. In each case, two different waveforms were used to drive the piezoelectric element in the droplet generator. This resulted in different meniscus behavior at the nozzle exit in each case. Leading and trailing edge velocities and the position of the leading edge relative to the nozzle were measured through use of double-frame images taken with a high-speed camera to describe the formation process at the nozzle. This data was displayed in both dimensional and non-dimensional form using capillary parameters. At the impingement surface, the high speed camera was used to record the spread rate and contact angle of the droplets. This research concluded that the flexible nozzle had a significant impact on droplet formation. Exit velocities were more than double those of the stiff nozzle, and break-off times were shorter for the flexible nozzle. One drawback of the flexible nozzle was that satellite droplets were produced along with the main droplet, which did not happen with a stiff nozzle. Behavior at the impingement surface was also noted to be different in each case. However, this is not directly related to the different nozzles themselves, but rather the fact that the nozzles resulted in different droplet velocities. The spread rate of the droplets was observed to increase as the impingement velocity was increased. The dynamic contact angles were also measured and compared to existing models found in the literature. Although there were discrepancies, it is likely that these are due to the difference in Weber numbers between this experiment and the models...|$|E

A hot-wire anemometry was employed to measure the vertical velocity profiles and PIV measurements were conducted to measure whole velocity field information of the jet flow in several horizontal planes. Mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles in vertical planes at three lateral spanwise locations(0, λ/ 4 and λ/ 2) were measured at several downstream locations(x/D= 0. 5 ~ 6). The jet velocity at the nozzle exit was 3 m/s and corresponding Reynolds number based on the mean width of the nozzle was ReD= 5000. For the case of in-phase nozzle, the length of potential core exhibit negligible difference at three spanwise locations.

Different multi-nozzle impactors with laser-drilled 50 – 60 μm diameter nozzles designed for a cut-off diameter of about 0. 05 μm were experimentally characterised.

40|$|Micro {{structures}} in silicon are applied in different fields of industry, medicine and research. Examples are micro mechanical sensors for car security systems, <b>nozzle</b> <b>plates</b> for printer, and optical elements for X-ray beam splitting. Wherever {{the accuracy of}} etched silicon structures is not required, laser processes with short pulses and small wave length can be an option with the advantage of shorter process time. High quality cutting and drilling of silicon {{can be achieved by}} application of diode pumped q-switched Nd:YAG-lasers and harmonics generation. The short pulses (15 ns) and the UV wave length (355 nm) of the Gator UV form Lambda Physik AG, for example, allow a reduction of thermal effects like deposition of molten material and heat effected zones at the edges. Especially in the case of deep structures the ablation plasma causes powerful heating of the walls. An reduction of the plasma temperatures and so the heat influence on the walls can be realized by a small laser wave length with low plasma absorption area into the bulk material. Also the duration and intensity of plasma heating is reduced by short laser pulses. In this contribution the possibilities and limits of laser machining of Si by diode pumped Nd:YAG-lasers with harmonics generation will be presented by means of structures processed by application of a scanner with f-theta-optic. The results will be discussed concerning the experimental setup and the laser parameters...|$|R
