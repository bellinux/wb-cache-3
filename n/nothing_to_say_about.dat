25|$|The next Annual Report had {{virtually}} <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{how and why}} the Irish banking system collapsed. Although there were four Central Bank directors {{on the board of the}} Financial Regulator, the Central Bank maintained it had no powers to intervene in the market. Yet, the Central Bank had the power to issue directives to the Financial Regulator if it thought it was conducting its business in a way that was contrary to overall Central Bank policy aims. None were issued.|$|E
25|$|The moral {{influence}} view can {{be combined}} {{with some of the}} other views of atonement. Indeed, Methodist theologian Vincent Taylor, while regarding the moral influence theory of atonement as inadequate by itself, described the moral influence theory as the 'truth' that is the 'presupposition of any worthy doctrine of the Atonement'. In the early centuries of the church, the moral influence view focused around the issue of how people can pass God's final judgment (namely through positive moral change). Some other atonement views, such as ransom from Satan, have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> final judgment and deal with other concerns. Such views can therefore be easily held in combination with the moral influence view.|$|E
25|$|LQG {{differs from}} string theory {{in that it}} is {{formulated}} in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, while the latter requires both to be true. There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory's predictions of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions. In a 2003 paper A dialog on quantum gravity, Carlo Rovelli regards the fact LQG is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation, consistent with current experimental results, over its rival string/M-theory. Proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which Loop Quantum Gravity has struggled to do. In that sense string theory's connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative, at the mathematical level. Loop Quantum Gravity has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the matter(fermions) in the universe.|$|E

500|$|On {{the second}} day of the trial, Wood called Dr. Karl A. Parshall, Palsgraf's physician. He testified that he had treated Palsgraf {{occasionally}} for minor ailments before the incident at East New York, but on the day after found her shaken and bruised. He gave it as his opinion that Palsgraf's ills were caused by the accident. Grace Gerhardt, Herbert's wife, was the next witness. She testified to being hit by one of [...] "the two young Italian fellows" [...] who were racing to make the train, and how one made it unaided and the other only with the help of two LIRR employees. She had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the scale or Palsgraf, having seen neither. Elizabeth and Lillian Palsgraf, the elder and younger daughter of the plaintiff, were next to testify and spoke of what they had seen. Wood indicated his only remaining witness was a neurologist, an expert witness, and McNamara for the LIRR moved to dismiss the case on the ground that Palsgraf had failed to present evidence of negligence, but Justice Humphrey denied it. The neurologist, Graeme M. Hammond of Manhattan, had examined Palsgraf two days before, observing her stammering, speaking only with difficulty. She told him of depression and headaches. He diagnosed her with traumatic hysteria, for which the explosion was a plausible cause, and said the hysteria was likely to continue as long as the litigation did, for only once it was resolved were the worries connected with it likely to vanish.|$|E

2500|$|Consequently, Schiller {{rejects the}} idea that {{statements}} can have meaning or truth when they are looked upon in the abstract, away from a particular context. [...] "Diamonds are hard" [...] only possesses meaning when stated (or believed) at some specific situation, by some specific person, uttered (or believed) for some specific aim. It is the consequences the statement holds for that person’s purposes which constitute its meaning, and its usefulness in accomplishing that person’s purposes that constitutes the statement’s truth or falsity. After all, {{when we look at}} the sentence [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] in a particular situation we may find it actually has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> diamonds. A speaker may very well be using the sentence as a joke, as a codephrase, or even simply as an example of a sentence with 15 letters. Which the sentence really means cannot be determined without the specific purpose a person might be using the statement for in a specific context.|$|E

2500|$|Local {{identity}} and regional British accents {{are common to}} Britpop groups, as well as references to British places and culture in lyrics and image. Stylistically, Britpop bands use catchy hooks and lyrics that were relevant to young British people of their own generation. Britpop bands conversely denounced grunge as irrelevant and having <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> their lives. Damon Albarn of Blur summed up the attitude in 1993 when after being asked if Blur were an [...] "anti-grunge band" [...] he said, [...] "Well, that's good. If punk was about getting rid of hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge." [...] In spite of the professed disdain for the genres, some elements of both crept into the more enduring facets of Britpop. Noel Gallagher has since championed Ride and stated in a 1996 interview that Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was the only songwriter he had respect for {{in the last ten}} years, and that he felt their music was similar enough that Cobain could have written [...] "Wonderwall".|$|E

[...] Cardinal Ruben Salazar Gomez of Bogota has said: [...] "Other unions {{have the right to}} exist, no one can ask them not to, but they should not be equated to marriage". The former Papal Master of Ceremonies, Archbishop Piero Marini, has said: [...] "Church and state should not be enemies to one another. In these discussions, it's necessary, for instance, to recognize the union of persons of the same sex, because there are many couples that suffer because their civil rights aren't recognized." [...] Godfried Danneels, Archbishop Emeritus of Brussels, has called the legalisation of same-sex civil marriage [...] "a positive evolution", and added that the Church has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> whether states can legalise civil marriage for gay people Cardinal Rainer Woelki the Archbishop of Berlin has also stated: [...] "If two homosexuals take responsibility for each other when they are in a stable and faithful relationship, you have to see it in a similar way to heterosexual relationships." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{his victory}} at the {{convention}} on June 23, 1990, occurred {{on the same day}} that the Meech Lake accord died, Chrétien was heavily criticized in the Quebec media for his opposition to Meech Lake. Photographs of Chrétien embracing Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells, a prominent opponent of Meech at the convention attracted much negative comment in Quebec. His leadership was also shaken by the defection from the caucus of francophone MPs (and Martin loyalists) Jean Lapierre and Gilles Rocheleau, who claimed that they could not serve under the anti-Meech Chrétien and so left to join the newly founded Bloc Québécois. In a by-election for Laurier—Sainte-Marie on August 13, 1990, Chrétien's hand-picked candidate, Denis Coderre was badly defeated by the Bloc Québécoiss Gilles Duceppe, costing the Liberals a riding that they had held since the 1917 election; many attributed this to Chrétien's opposition to the Meech Lake Accord. Chrétien appeared indecisive in the Oka Crisis, having almost <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the stand-off at Oka for the first two months of the crisis, which began on July 11, 1990. When Chrétien finally did call a press conference about the Oka crisis on September 23, 1990, Chrétien declared that he could not answer certain questions about First Nations land claims because [...] "I'm not a lawyer", which prompted widespread ridicule as Chrétien had been a member of the Quebec Bar Association since 1958. The federal Liberals were disorganized and dropped in the polls from 50% in June 1990 to 32% in September. Upon becoming Liberal leader, Chrétien appointed his friend Eddie Goldenberg as his chief of staff, and formed a leadership team comprising John Rae and David Zussman as his policy advisors, his [...] "surrogate son" [...] Jean Carle as his special executive assistant, Warren Kinsella as his media adviser, and George Radwanski as his speech-writer. All of the Chrétien leadership team that was created in 1990 were later to play prominent roles in the omnipotent Prime Minister's Office (PMO) during Chrétien's time as Prime Minister.|$|E

2500|$|The film further {{reinforced}} the popular picture held by whites, {{especially in the}} South, of Reconstruction as a disaster. In his 1929 book The Tragic Era: The Revolution After Lincoln, the respected historian Claude Bowers treated The Birth of a Nation as a factually accurate account of Reconstruction. In The Tragic Era, Bowers presented every black politician in the South as corrupt, portrayed Republican Representative Thaddeus Stevens as a vicious [...] "race traitor" [...] intent upon making blacks the equal of whites, and praised the Klan for [...] "saving civilization" [...] in the South. Bowers wrote about black empowerment that the worse sort of [...] "scum" [...] from the North like Stevens [...] "inflamed the Negro's egoism and soon the lustful assaults began. Rape was the foul daughter of Reconstruction!". The American historian John Hope Franklin wrote {{that not only did}} Bowers treat The Birth of a Nation as accurate history, but his version of history seemed to be drawn from The Birth of a Nation. Some historians, such as E. Merton Coulter in his The South Under Reconstruction (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens. Coulter in The South During Reconstruction, which again treated The Birth of a Nation as historically correct, and painted a vivid picture of [...] "black beasts" [...] running amok, encouraged by alcohol-sodden, corrupt and vengeful black Republican politicians. Franklin wrote that as recently as the 1970s that the popular journalist Alistair Cooke in his books and TV shows was still essentially following the version of history set out by The Birth of a Nation, noting that Cooke had much sympathy with the suffering of whites in Reconstruction while having almost <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the suffering of blacks or about how African-Americans were stripped of almost all their rights after 1877.|$|E
