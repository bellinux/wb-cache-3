Existing conceptions of exploitation fail to provide adequate accounts of both aspects of exploitation. Hillel Steiner and John Roemer provide convincing accounts of the unfairness involved in exploitation, but because they fail to provide restrictive `advantage taking' conditions, their theories of exploitation include cases that we would not ordinarily describe as exploitations.

30|$|The {{limits on}} yield {{strength}} {{are required to}} ensure adequate ductility of a section and {{are related to the}} prescribed limit on concrete compressive strain of 0.003. The limits on yield strength also serve to control of crack widths at service loads. Crack width is a function of steel strain and consequently steel stress (Nawy 1968). Therefore, the stress in the steel reinforcement will always need to be limited to some extent in order to prevent cracking from affecting serviceability of the structure. However, with recent improvements to the properties of concrete, the ACI 318 limit of 552  MPa (80  ksi) and AASHTO limit of 517  MPa (75  ksi) on the steel reinforcement yield strength are believed to be unnecessarily conservative for new designs. Additionally, an argument can be made that if a higher strength reinforcing steel is used but not fully taken into account in design, there may be an inherent overstrength in the member that has <b>not</b> been <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> in design.|$|R

However, in these studies, the effect of physical carrier sense has <b>not</b> been <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> into the analysis. In this paper, we study {{the problem of how}} carrier sense misbehavior can affect network performance in addition to backoff misbehavior. Our analysis shows that a cheater can increase its throughput by ignoring the carrier sense mechanism while a well-behaved user significantly loses its throughput. Consequently, not only a malicious user, but also a selfish one is motivated to disregard the carrier sense mechanism, which will result in significant throughput degradation of well-behaved ones. Our analysis also shows that carrier sense misbehavior corresponds to the case of virtually increasing the channel access probability of the cheater in the backoff procedure. We provide our preliminary simulation results, which verify our analysis...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic genes contain non-coding {{sequences}} - introns {{that are}} removed during pre-mRNA splicing by the spliceosome. The spliceosome {{is composed of}} five snRNPs (U 1, U 2, U 4 /U 6 and U 5) which assemble on pre-mRNA in a step-wise manner and together with additional non-snRNP proteins catalyse splicing. Mutations in splicing factors can cause severe diseases, for example a point missense mutation (called AD 29) in hPrp 31 (U 4 /U 6 snRNP specific protein) induces retinitis pigmentosa, disease often leading to complete blindness. In this PhD thesis we show that the hPrp 31 AD 29 mutant is unstable and is <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> into spliceosomal snRNPs. In addition, {{the expression of the}} mutant protein reduces cell proliferation, which indicates that it interferes with cellular metabolism (likely splicing) and could explain the induction of retinitis pigmentosa. Next, we focus on a role of nuclear environment in pre-mRNA splicing. It was shown that new U 4 /U 6 ·U 5 snRNPs are preferentially assembled in non-membrane nuclear structure - Cajal body. Here we expand this finding and provide evidence that Cajal bodies are also important for U 4 /U 6 ·U 5 snRNP recycling after splicing.

More recently, rodent locomotion analysis has become an increasingly popular method in a diverse range of research. Speed is an inseparable aspect of locomotion that is still not fully understood, and its effects are often <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> while analyzing data. In this hybrid manuscript, we accomplish three things: (1) review the interaction between speed and locomotion variables in rodent studies, (2) comprehensively analyze the relationship between speed and 162 locomotion variables in a group of 16 wild-type mice using the CatWalk gait analysis system, and (3) develop and test a statistical method in which locomotion variables are analyzed and reported in the context of speed. Notable results include the following: (1) over 90 % of variables, reported by CatWalk, were dependent on speed with an average R 2 value of 0. 624, (2) most variables were related to speed in a nonlinear manner, (3) current methods of controlling for speed are insufficient, and (4) the linear mixed model is an appropriate and effective statistical method for locomotion analyses that is inclusive of speed-dependent relationships. Given the pervasive dependency of locomotion variables on speed, we maintain that valid conclusions from locomotion analyses cannot be made unless they are analyzed and reported within the context of speed...|$|E

Predicting CCN properties {{is still a}} challenge and <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> in current climate models. Atmospheric particle number size distributions, hygroscopic growth factors, and polydisperse CCN number concentrations were measured at the remote subarctic Stordalen mire, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden. The CCN number concentration was highly variable, largely driven by variations in {{the total number of}} sufficiently large particles, though the variability of chemical composition was increasingly important for decreasing supersaturation. The hygroscopicity of particles measured by a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) was in agreement with large critical diameters observed for CCN activation (kappa approximate to 0. 07 - 0. 21 for D = 50 - 200 nm). Size distribution and time- and size-resolved HTDMA data were used to predict CCN number concentrations. Agreement of predictions with measured CCN within +/- 11 % was achieved using parameterized Kohler theory and assuming a surface tension of pure water. The sensitivity of CCN predictions to various simplifying assumptions was further explored: We found that (1) ignoring particle mixing state did not affect CCN predictions, (2) averaging the HTDMA data in time with retaining the size dependence did not introduce a substantial bias, while individual predictions became more uncertain, and (3) predictions involving the hygroscopicity parameter recommended in literature for continental sites (kappa approximate to 0. 3 +/- 0. 1) resulted in a significant prediction bias. Future modeling studies should therefore at least aim at using averaged, size-resolved, site-specific hygroscopicity or chemical composition data for predictions of CCN number concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{inherent}} limitations of traditional force-based (FB) procedures [1, 2, 3], innovative and transparent displacement-based (DB) procedures [4] {{have been proposed}} in recent years. In the DB procedures, design force levels {{are based on the}} estimate of yield displacement of the structure. The ultimate displacement demand is first compared with yield displacement to estimate section ductility demand. Section ductility demand can be used to calculate effective damping level [4, 5], which is then used to calculate the inelastic displacement demand and effective period from the elastic displacement response spectrum. The intended mechanism for the majority of bridge piers and columns involves the formation of plastic hinges at critical locations (plastic hinge regions). The yield displacement of concrete columns can be estimated using simple expressions that account for the flexural deformation of the column [4]. Such expressions can be developed based on yield curvature of the column at the critical location (plastic hinge region). Previous studies on effective yield curvature [4, 6, 7] have limitations of <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporating</b> all the influential parameters. This paper presents simple expressions to estimate effective yield curvature for normal- and high-strength circular reinforced concrete columns based on moment-curvature analyses [8] of 200 column sections. Such expressions can be programmed into an excel spreadsheet and can be used for the DB design of columns and also for the performance evaluation of existing columns. Effective yield curvature is presented in terms of the gross diameter of the section and the yield strain of longitudinal reinforcement together with three modification factors that take into account the effect of the strength of concrete, axial load ratio and the amount of longitudinal reinforcement. A DB procedure for the design of a bridge column has been presented based on the substitute structure approach using the developed expressions for estimating effective yield curvature...|$|R

40|$|We study non-Gaussian {{signatures}} on {{the cosmic}} microwave background (CMB) radiation predicted within inflationary models with non-vacuum initial states for cosmological perturbations. The model incorporates a privileged scale, which implies the existence of a feature in the primordial power spectrum. This broken-scale-invariant model predicts a vanishing three-point correlation function for the CMB temperature anisotropies (or any other odd-numbered-point correlation function) whilst an intrinsic non-Gaussian signature arises for any even-numbered-point correlation function. We thus focus on the first non-vanishing moment, the CMB four-point function at zero lag, namely the kurtosis, and compute its expected value for different locations of the primordial feature in the spectrum, as suggested in the literature to conform to observations of large scale structure. The excess kurtosis is found to be negative and the signal to noise ratio for the dimensionless excess kurtosis parameter is equal to | S/N | ≃ 4 × 10 ^- 4, almost independently of the free parameters of the model. This signature turns out to be undetectable. We conclude that, subject to current tests, Gaussianity is a generic property of single field inflationary models.

Foucault {{said that in the}} spatialization of knowledge and power beginning in the 18 th century, architecture is not a signifier or metaphor for power, it is rather the “technique for practising social organization. ” The role of the IAUS in the architectural dissemination of Foucault’s ideas on the subject and space in the North American academy – such as the concept “heterotopia,” and Foucault’s writing on surveillance and Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon, subsequently analysed by Georges Teyssot, who was teaching at the Venice School – is well known. Teyssot’s work is part of the historical canalization of Foucauldianism, and French subjectivity more broadly, along its dizzying path, via Italy, to American architecture schools, where it solidified in the 1980 s paradigm that would {{come to be known as}} American architecture theory.

Also the ratio between lamins A and C proteins was 1 : 8 instead of the 1 : 1 ratio seen in the other cell lines, Northern blotting con firmed the altered level of A-type lamin expression. Secondly, an abnormal localization of lamin A was observed, Intensely fluorescing lamin A aggregates were observed in the nucleus, rather than the typical perinuclear staining pattern, Confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that the lamin A aggregates were indeed present throughout the internal nucleus, When these cells were extracted with Triton X- 100 the nucleoplasmic aggregates disappeared, which indicates that the A-type lamins are <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> into the lamina.

This truncated product is partly Triton X- 100 soluble since it was also detected in the detergent soluble fraction, Thirdly, using an antibody to A-type lamins sporadic GLC-A 1 cells showed a filamentous cytoplasmic staining pattern, which was Triton X- 100 resistant, Double labeling immunofluorescence studies revealed that these cytoplasmic lamins colocalized with the vimentin cytoskeleton in this cell line...|$|E
40|$|Although psychologists often {{believe that}} all {{assessment}} information collected on a client should be integrated to reach a conclusion, statistical analyses and empirical evidence show that {{this may not be}} the optimal procedure for ensuring diagnostic decision-making accuracy. As a result, we are left with the question: How should psychologists determine the optimal combination of variables, or the single variable, to use in diagnosis or prediction? Proper assessment of incremental validity addresses these issues by allowing one to identify the most valid combination of assessment information beyond which either additional variables do not add information in a clinically significant way, or the cost/benefit ratio of additional information is unnecessarily high. ^ In order to study this issue in the field of school psychology, hypothetical case scenarios were provided to school psychologists, via the Internet or postal mail. These scenarios were designed (a) to assess respondents 2 ̆ 7 use of statistical information when deciding which measures to use in a diagnostic process, and (b) to assess if a generic diagnostic label (e. g., Disorder X) and assessment instrument (e. g., Measure 1) versus a specific label (e. g., ADHD) and instrument (e. g., Parent Rating Scale) was associated with the use of statistical information during this process. ^ No differences were identified between the Internet and postal-mail methods of participation. Results, however, showed that the school psychologists made sub-optimal statistical choices about measures even when only two measures were provided. In more complex scenarios (i. e., four measures), respondents continued to make sub-optimal choices. When diagnostic labels and names of assessment instruments were included, a number of inconsistencies were observed, indicating that statistical information was <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> in the decision-making process.

Hepatocytes in long-term DMSO culture can be iron loaded by exposure to non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) {{in the form of}} ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4), ferric nitrilotriacetate, or trimethylhexanoyl (TMH) -ferrocene. Holotransferrin, at equivalent times and concentrations, was unable to load hepatocytes. Of the iron compounds tested, TMH-ferrocene most accurately simulated the morphological features of iron-loaded hepatocytes in vivo. When exposed to 25 micromol/L TMH-ferrocene, hepatocytes loaded increasing amounts of iron for 2 months before the cells died. When exposed to lower concentrations of TMH-ferrocene (as low as 2. 5 micromol/L), hepatocytes continuously loaded iron and remained viable for more than 2 months. The cellular deposition of iron was different in hepatocytes exposed to TMH-ferrocene compared with those exposed to FeSO 4; exposure to TMH-ferrocene resulted in the presence of more ferritin cores within lysosomes than were seen with FeSO 4. When the concentration of TMH-ferrocene was increased, a greater number of ferritin cores were observed within the lysosome, and total cellular ferritin, as assessed by Western blot, increased. The formation of hemosiderin was also observed. Furthermore, nuclear shape was distorted in iron-loaded hepatocytes. The extent of deviation from circularity in the nucleus correlated with increasing concentrations of TMH-ferrocene and was greater in hepatocytes exposed to FeSO 4 than an equivalent concentration of TMH-ferrocene. The deviation from circularity was smallest in hepatocytes that contained well formed ferritin cores and increased in hepatocytes that contained greater amounts of hemosiderin. Furthermore, in hepatocytes treated with FeSO 4, a large amount of cell-associated iron was detected but without {{a significant increase in the}} total amount of ferritin. The deviation from circularity was the largest in FeSO 4 -treated hepatocytes, indicating that iron <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> into ferritin caused more cellular damage.

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that socio-cultural factors {{play an important role}} in determining the outcomes of natural resource conservation. Conservationists have discovered that when such factors are <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> from the earliest planning stages, projects are often less successful than hoped and at times outright failures. Thus, several core values that vary among cultures were studied to examine their relationships to natural resources and conservation. This study investigated the relationships between natural resources and conservation and the 3 value orientations individualism, collectivism, and locus of control and socio-demographics in the North Rupununi, Guyana. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in 5 villages (Annai Central, Apoteri, Rewa, Aranaputa, and Wowetta) via participant observation and mostly structured interviews of 167 local residents. Field research took place from January to November 2008, and interviews occurred from July to October of the same year. Analysis indicates the following results for this sample. Neither the individualism measurement used in this study not the locus of control scale showed many statistically significant associations, but some interesting patterns and trends appear in the case of locus of control. In contrast, the collectivism scale showed associations to several of the natural resource items. The main conclusions from the study are that to promote more successful conservation, professionals need to focus on several factors that promote more effective communication and negotiation. Developing equity among participants; empowering people through their own knowledge, influence, and options; establishing respect by and for all parties; co-creating a common mental model among the parties; and fostering the competence and confidence of all parties to actively participate in the negotiations are key to success. This can be especially tricky in cases in which the various parties come from different socio-cultural backgrounds, such as in the case of Western scientists working with remote indigenous peoples. Coming to a shared mental model and feelings of true equity among the parties is even harder then because the disparate backgrounds make common understanding difficult at best. However, it is that much more necessary when common backgrounds are absent. In such cases, a well-trained, culturally sensitive, and neutral facilitator can be the most useful tool to help co-create the right circumstances for authoring solutions which foster natural resource conservation that can succeed...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} {{geographical}} transferability of niche-based species distribution models fitted with two modelling techniques. Location Two distinct geographical study areas in Switzerland and Austria, in the subalpine and alpine belts. Methods Generalized linear and generalized additive models (GLM and GAM) with a binomial probability distribution and a logit link were fitted for 54 plant species, based on topoclimatic predictor variables. These models were then evaluated quantitatively {{and used for}} spatially explicit predictions within (internal evaluation and prediction) and between (external evaluation and prediction) the two regions. Comparisons of evaluations and spatial predictions between regions and models were conducted {{in order to test}} if species and methods meet the criteria of full transferability. By full transferability, we mean that: (1) the internal evaluation of models fitted in region A and B must be similar; (2) a model fitted in region A must at least retain a comparable external evaluation when projected into region B, and vice-versa; and (3) internal and external spatial predictions have to match within both regions. Results The measures of model fit are, on average, 24 % higher for GAMs than for GLMs in both regions. However, the differences between internal and external evaluations (AUC coefficient) are also higher for GAMs than for GLMs (a difference of 30 % for models fitted in Switzerland and 54 % for models fitted in Austria). Transferability, as measured with the AUC evaluation, fails for 68 % of the species in Switzerland and 55 % in Austria for GLMs (respectively for 67 % and 53 % of the species for GAMs). For both GAMs and GLMs, the agreement between internal and external predictions is rather weak on average (Kulczynski's coefficient in the range 0. 3 - 0. 4), but varies widely among individual species. The dominant pattern is an asymmetrical transferability between the two study regions (a mean decrease of 20 % for the AUC coefficient when the models are transferred from Switzerland and 13 % when they are transferred from Austria). Main conclusions The large inter-specific variability observed among the 54 study species underlines the need to consider more than a few species to test properly the transferability of species distribution models. The pronounced asymmetry in transferability between the two study regions may be due to peculiarities of these regions, such as differences in the ranges of environmental predictors or the varied impact of land-use history, or to species-specific reasons like differential phenotypic plasticity, existence of ecotypes or varied dependence on biotic interactions that are <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> <b>incorporated</b> into niche-based models. The lower variation between internal and external evaluation of GLMs compared to GAMs further suggests that overfitting may reduce transferability. Overall, a limited geographical transferability calls for caution when projecting niche-based models for assessing the fate of species in future environments...|$|E

Using the proper continuum mechanical theory of granular materials, two such problems are examined in this thesis. Firstly, the phenomenon of stable vertical cylindrical cavities known as rat-holes in stockpiles and hoppers that impede {{the flow of the}} granular material through the reclaim hole is examined. Secondly, the stress distribution {{at the base of a}} two and three-dimensional sand pile is considered in search of the peak vertical pressure, which may not be located directly beneath the vertex of the sand-pile. The rat-hole problem is well known but is <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> understood, and existing theory is unsatisfactory, in that it is believed <b>not</b> to <b>properly</b> <b>incorporate</b> actual material properties. Here the classical rat-hole theory of Jenike and his co-workers is re-examined, with a view to examining the validity of the so-called 2 ̆ 2 stable rat-hole equation 2 ̆ 2, which is widely used in practice. Jenike 2 ̆ 7 s original theory assumes a symmetrical stress distribution which is independent of height. However in practice, rat-holes tend to exhibit some tapering with height, and here the stress profiles corresponding to a symmetrical but slightly tapered circular cavity are determined. Existing theory for rat-holes applies only to the Coulomb-Mohr yield function. Here for an existing rat-hole, and assuming a shear-index granular material, the limiting stress profiles are determined which extends existing theory to a wider constitutive law. The determination of the horizontal and vertical force distributions at the base of a sand-pile is by now a famous problem in granular theory. In 1981 it was suggested from experimental work that the peak vertical force at the base does not occur directly beneath the vertex of the pile, but at some intermediate point so that there is a ring of maximum vertical pressure. Practising engineers have some reservation this result and numerous discrete theoretical and computational models of granular sand-piles have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, with varying degrees of success. Here for two and three-dimensional sand-piles the horizontal and vertical force distributions are estimated using the Jenike solutions for converging hoppers. For a two-dimensional sand-pile, a formal exact parametric solution is presented for the special case of the angle of internal friction equal to ninety degrees. Next, a sand-pile that is not entirely at yield is proposed, which has an inner dead region and an outer yield region. From this model a solution is determined which is not unique but does predict the dip in the vertical force as suggested from experimental work. Finally, the exact parametric solution for the two-dimensional sand-pile problem for an angle of internal friction equal to ninety degrees is exploited to solve the of granular materials in the presence of gravity through a converging wedge shaped hopper, which are used in many industrial situations. This is the only known exact solution of these important equations which involves two arbitrary constants...|$|R
