The <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> has proven utility for {{prescribing}} approximate background-error covariances required by variational data assimilation systems. Here, untunedNMCmethod estimates are compared with explicitly determined error covariances produced within an OSSE context by exploiting availability of the true simulated states. Such a comparison provides insights into what kind of rescaling is required to render the <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> estimates usable. It is shown that rescaling of variances and directional correlation lengths depends greatly on both pressure and latitude. In particular, some scaling coefficients appropriate in the Tropics are the reciprocal of those in the Extratropics. Also, the degree of dynamic balance is grossly overestimated by the <b>NMC</b> <b>method.</b> These results agree with previous examinations of the <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> which used ensembles as an alternative for estimating background-error statistics.

In this paper, we first develop an efficient non-Monte-Carlo (NMC) transient mismatch analysis, where transient response is represented by stochastic orthogonal polynomial (SOP) expansion under PVT variations and probabilistic distribution of transient response is solved. We further define performance yield and derive stochastic sensitivity for yield {{within the framework of}} SOP, and finally develop a gradient-based multi-objective optimization to improve yield while satisfying other performance constraints. Extensive experiments show that compared to Monte Carlo based yield estimation, our <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> achieves up to 700 X speedup and maintains 98 % accuracy. Furthermore, multi-objective optimization not only improves yield b...|$|E
40|$|Since most of AMSU {{channels}} have a beam position-dependent bias, it {{is crucial}} to remove such a bias for providing useful profiles of the atmosphere. Measurement errors are estimated from the differences between satellite observations and the simulated satellite observations, which were obtained from a radiative transfer operator with 12 -hours forecast of their input. The measurement errors estimated in this way will contain the forecast error of a 12 hour forecast. The <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> assumes that the statistics of differences between forecasts at different ranges valid at the same time are the representative of forecast error statistics. The differences used in the <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> have been transferred to brightness temperature in each AMSU channel with the radiation transfer operator. These data can then be used to obtain the value of 12 hours forecast error in brightness temperature for each AMSU channel. Thus, the 12 hour forecast error in each AMSU channels can be removed when the measurement errors are estimated as mentioned above. In this study, we carefully examine the AMSU beam near Taiwan. A bias correction method, which concerns the beam position-dependent bias and the effect of 12 hours forecast error used on the regression equations, has been built. A data retrieval method based on one-dimensional variational scheme has also been developed. Through the comparison of the retrieved profiles and the background fields, we found that the method worked well near the Taiwan area. Even with quite accurate background fields, the retrieved profiles have shown positive impact to improve the fields. The results show that the improvement made in the retrieval scheme over the background error is about 0. 45 K in the temperature profiles, above 780 hPa. The study used corrected AMSU data to identify thermal anomalies and estimate tangent winds that successfully analyzed typhoon structure...|$|E
50|$|Product {{design is}} {{typically}} a highly iterative and interactive activity involving {{a group of}} designers who are geographically dispersed. A neutral modeling commands (<b>NMC)</b> based <b>method</b> is proposed to construct a real-time collaborative product design platform within heterogeneous CAD systems. Different from the visualization-based approaches, models can be constructed and modified synchronously from various sites in the proposed collaborative design environment. Based on a translation mechanism between system modeling operations (SMO) and neutral modeling commands (NMC), every operation given by a user on one site will be translated into a NMC and be sent {{to all the other}} sites through the network. When the other sites receive this command, it is converted into corresponding SMOs on the local system. In this way, the real-time collaborative product design with heterogeneous CAD systems is achieved.|$|R

The NMC particles have a much rougher surface compared to the LCO particles. Cracks due to processing exist in both LCO and NMC particles but the NMC particles exhibit more severe cracking and also tend to have internal pores in addition to radial cracks.

30|$|In this study, {{the input}} {{function}} {{was assumed to}} be obtained by an arterial blood sampling, which is challenging in practice. Image-derived input function is an elegant and attractive noninvasive alternative to blood sampling [33, 34]. For cardiac perfusion PET, the image-derived input function can be obtained by computing activity concentration within an ROI within the blood pool of the left ventricle. Such method is practical for cardiac PET because the heart is within the FOV. However, if NMC PET images are used for such purpose, errors may be introduced into the input function due to motion. We defined an ROI of ~[*] 4 pixels in the blood pool (the ROI was kept away from the myocardium to avoid the spillover effect) and obtained image-derived input functions using GA, <b>NMC,</b> and MC <b>methods.</b> FigureÂ  2 shows that the image-derived input functions using GA and MC agree well with the true input function, while NMC yields large errors. Therefore, image-derived input functions should be obtained using GA or MC methods.|$|R
40|$|Several {{operational}} Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) centres {{around the}} world run wave forecasting models that routinely assimilate satellite wave observations (e. g. Breivik and Reistad, 1994; NMOC, 1999). There has been {{a considerable amount of}} research into the development of wave data assimilation systems in recent years (e. g. Lionello et al., 1992; Greenslade, 2001; Mastenbroek et al., 1994). A major limitation to current assimilation systems is the specification of the model (or background) errors. This has not previously been explored to any great extent for wave models. One method that may be used to investigate the structure of the background errors is the <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> (Parrish and Derber, 1992; Rabier et al., 1998). This method uses forecast divergence as a proxy for background error growth. Correlations and variances of the differences between forecasts of different ranges valid at the same time are determined and can be used to construct the background error covariances. In this work, forecasts of Significant Wave Height (SWH) from a global wave model are investigated. A general assumption {{is that most of the}} errors occurring in wave forecasts are due to errors in the surface winds (Cardone et al., 1995). Therefore, the surface wind fields that are used to force the wave model are also examined. A brief review of previous wave data assimilation research is given in Section 2 with an emphasis on specification of the wave model background errors. Previous work using the <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> is also presented here. The wave model used in this work is a version of the WAM model (WAMDI Group, 1988; Komen et al., 1994). This is described in Section 3. The details of the method used to calculate the correlations and variances are presented in Section 4. Results for isotropic and anisotropic correlations are presented and discussed in Section 5. Further issues are addressed in Section 6 and finally Section 7 provides a summary. [Introduction...|$|E
30|$|Both cardiac and {{respiratory}} motions introduce blurring in the PET parametric images if the motion is not corrected. Conventional cardiac gating {{is limited by}} high noise level on parametric images. Dual cardiac {{and respiratory}} gating further increases the noise level. In contrast to GA, the MR-based MC method reduces motion blurring in parametric images without increasing noise level. It also improves the myocardial defect delineation as compared to <b>NMC</b> <b>method.</b> Finally, the MR-based MC method yields lower bias and variance in K 1 values than NMC and GA, respectively. The reductions of K 1 bias by MR-based MC are 7.7, 5.1, 15.7, and 29.9 % in four selected 0.18 -mL myocardial regions of interest, respectively, as compared to NMC for CRM. MR-based MC yields 85.9, 75.3, 71.8, and 95.2 % less K 1 standard deviation in the four regions, respectively, as compared to GA for CRM.|$|E
40|$|One of the microphysical variables, the {{rainwater}} {{mixing ratio}} qr, is retrieved from the observed reflectivity of Doppler radar by a 3 D variational data assimilation system. The qr as an analysis variable is obtained by minimizing a cost function {{defined as the}} difference between observed radar reflectivity and its retrieval from qr, plus the difference between qr and its background field from a mesoscale modelâs prediction. Covariance matrix of the background fieldâs error {{is determined by the}} so-called <b>NMC</b> <b>method.</b> A method called the second-order auto-regression (SOAR) is used to calculate the coefficients of regressive filtering to fit in with small spatial scale such as cumulus in the process of spatial transformation. An ideal experiment demonstrates the correctness of this system and a sensitivity experiment proves that the random error of observed reflectivity has effect on the analyzed results. At last an experiment with observed data from the Doppler radar at Maâanshan City in Anhui Province on 19 June 2002 was performed.

40|$|Passive neutron {{interrogation}} for fissile mass estimation, {{relying on}} neutrons coming from spontaneous fission events, {{is considered a}} standard NDT procedure in the nuclear safeguard and safety community. Since most structure materials are (relatively) transparent to neutron radiation, passive neutron interrogation is considered highly effective {{in the analysis of}} dirty, poorly characterized samples. Since a typical passive interrogation assembly is based on 3 He detectors embedded in a moderating medium, neutrons from additional neutron sources (mainly (alpha, n) reactions and induced fissions in the tested sample) {{can not be separated from}} the main spontaneous fission source through energetic spectral analysis. There for, applying the passive interrogation methods requires the implementation of Neutron Multiplicity Counting methods (NMC) for separation between the main fission source and the additional sources. Applying NMC methods requires a well characterized system, in the sense that both system die away time and detection efficiency must be well known (and in particular, both parameters must be independent of the tested sample). Hence, the implementation of standard passive neutron interrogation methods on poorly characterized systems (say, systems with a large uncertainty on the position of the sample), or on samples containing neutron absorbers, is not practical. In the present study we introduce a new <b>NMC</b> <b>method,</b> in which the detection efficiency is computed directly through the measurement itself, without the need of a prior calibration. In particular, since we do not need to a priory know the system efficiency, the method might prove extremely useful in the above mentioned cases. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E
40|$|Optimally {{modeling}} background-error horizontal correlations {{is crucial}} in ocean data assimilation. This paper investigates the impact of releasing the assumption of uniform background-error correlations in a global ocean variational analysis system. Spatially varying horizontal correlations are introduced in the recursive filter operator, which is used for modeling horizontal covariances in the Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC) analysis system. The horizontal correlation length scales (HCLSs) were defined on the full three-dimensional model space and computed from both a dataset of monthly anomalies {{with respect to the}} monthly climatology and through the so-called National Meteorological Center (<b>NMC)</b> <b>method.</b> Different formulas for estimating the correlation length scale are also discussed and applied to the two forecast error datasets. The new formulation is tested within a 12 -yr period (2000 â 11) in the Â½Â° resolution system. The comparison with the data assimilation system using uniform background-error horizontal correlations indicates the superiority of the former, especially in eddy-dominated areas. Verification skill scores report a significant reduction of RMSE, and the use of nonuniform length scales improves the representation of the eddy kinetic energy at midlatitudes, suggesting that uniform, latitude, or Rossby radius-dependent formulations are insufficient to represent the geographical variations of the background-error correlations. Furthermore, a small tuning of the globally uniform value of the length scale was found to have a small impact on the analysis system. The use of either anomalies or NMC-derived correlation length scales also has a marginal effect with respect to the use of nonuniform HCLSs. On the other hand, the application of overestimated length scales has proved to be detrimental to the analysis system in all areas and for all parameters...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} to current wave data assimilation systems {{is the lack of}} an accurate representation {{of the structure of the}} background errors. One method that may be used to determine background errors is the &# 8220;NMC method. &# 8221; This method examines the forecast divergence component of the background error growth by considering differences between forecasts of different ranges valid at the same time. In this paper, the <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> is applied to global forecasts of significant wave height (SWH) and surface wind speed (U 10). It is found that the isotropic correlation length scale of the SWH forecast divergence (LSWH) has considerable geographical variability, with the longest scales just to the south of the equator in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the shortest scales at high latitudes. The isotropic correlation length scale of the U 10 forecast divergence (LU 10) has a similar distribution with a stronger latitudinal dependence. It is found that both LSWH and LU 10 increase as the forecast period increases. The increase in LSWH is partly due to LU 10 also increasing. Another explanation is that errors in the analysis or the short-range SWH forecast propagate forward in time and disperse and their scale becomes larger. It is shown that the forecast divergence component of the background error is strongly anisotropic with the longest scales perpendicular to the likely direction of propagation of swell. In addition, in regions where the swell propagation is seasonal, the forecast divergence component of the background error shows a similar strong seasonal signal. It is suggested that the results of this study provide a lower bound to the description of the total background error in global wave models...|$|E
40|$|Targeted {{observations}} are generally taken in regions of high baroclinicity, but often show little impact. One plausible {{explanation is that}} important dynamical information, such as upshear tilt, is not extracted from the targeted observations by the data assimilation scheme and used to correct initial condition error. This is investigated by generating pseudo targeted observations which contain a singular vector (SV) structure that is not present in the background field or routine observations, i. e. assuming that the background has an initial condition error with tilted growing structure. Experiments were performed for a single case-study with varying numbers of pseudo targeted observations. These were assimilated by the Met Office four-dimensional variational (4 D-Var) data assimilation scheme, which uses a 6 h window for observations and background-error covariances calculated using the National Meteorological Centre (<b>NMC)</b> <b>method.</b> The forecasts were run using the operational Met Office Unified Model on a 24 km grid. The results presented clearly demonstrate that a 6 h window 4 D-Var system is capable of extracting baroclinic information from a limited set of observations and using it to correct initial condition error. To capture the SV structure well (projection of 0. 72 in total energy), 50 sondes over an area of 1 Ã 106 km 2 were required. When the SV was represented by only eight sondes along an example targeting flight track covering a smaller area, the projection onto the SV structure was lower; the resulting forecast perturbations showed an SV structure with increased tilt and reduced initial energy. The total energy contained in the perturbations decreased as the SV structure was less well described by the set of observations (i. e. as fewer pseudo observations were assimilated). The assimilated perturbation had lower energy than the SV unless the pseudo observations were assimilated with the dropsonde observation errors halved from operational values.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the current status}} of development of a three-dimensional variational data assimilation system (3 D-Var). The system can be used with different numerical weather prediction models, but it is mainly designed to be coupled with the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS). Analyses are given for the following parameters: zonal and meridional wind components, temperature, relative humidity, and geopotential height. Important features of the data assimilation system are the use of incremental formulation of the cost function, and the representation of the background error by recursive filters and the eigenmodes of the vertical component of the background error covariance matrix. This matrix is estimated by the National Meteorological Center (<b>NMC)</b> <b>method.</b> The data assimilation and forecasting system is applied to the real context of atmospheric profiling data assimilation, and in particular to the short-term wind prediction. The analyses are produced at 20 km horizontal resolution over central Europe and extend over the whole troposphere. Assimilated data are vertical soundings of wind, temperature, and relative humidity from radiosondes, and wind measurements of the European wind profiler network. Results show the validity of the analyses because they are closer to the observations (lower root mean square error (RMSE)) compared to the background (higher RMSE), and the differences of the RMSEs are in agreement with the data assimilation settings. To quantify the impact of improved initial conditions on the short-term forecast, the analyses are used as initial conditions of three-hours forecasts of the RAMS model. In particular two sets of forecasts are produced: (a) the first uses the ECMWF analysis/forecast cycle as initial and boundary conditions; (b) the second uses the analyses produced by the 3 D-Var as initial conditions, then it is driven by the ECMWF forecast. The improvement is quantified by considering the horizontal components of the wind, which are measured at asynoptic times by the European wind profiler network. The results show that the RMSE is effectively reduced at the short range. The results are in agreement with the set-up of the numerical experiment...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we apply}} the four-dimensional variational (4 D-Var) data {{assimilation}} to optimize initial ozone state {{and to improve}} the predictability of air quality. The numerical modeling systems used for simulations of atmospheric condition and chemical formation are the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The study area covers the capital region of South Korea, where the surface measurement sites are relatively evenly distributed. The 4 D-Var code previously developed for the CMAQ model is modified to consider background error in matrix form, and various numerical tests are conducted. The results are evaluated with an idealized covariance function for {{the appropriateness of the}} modified codes. The background error is then constructed using the <b>NMC</b> <b>method</b> with long-term modeling results, and the characteristics of the spatial correlation scale related to local circulation are analyzed. The background error is applied in the 4 D-Var research, and a surface observational assimilation is conducted to optimize the initial concentration of ozone. The statistical results for the 12 h assimilation periods and the 120 Â observatory sites show a 49. 4 % decrease in the root mean squared error (RMSE), and a 59. 9 % increase in the index of agreement (IOA). The temporal variation of spatial distribution of the analysis increments indicates that the optimized initial state of ozone concentration is transported to inland areas by the clockwise-rotating local circulation during the assimilation windows. To investigate the predictability of ozone concentration after the assimilation window, a short-time forecasting is carried out. The ratios of the RMSE (root mean squared error) with assimilation versus that without assimilation are 8 and 13 % for the + 24 and + 12 h, respectively. Such a significant improvement in the forecast accuracy is obtained solely by using the optimized initial state. The potential improvement in ozone prediction for both the daytime and nighttime with application of data assimilation is also presented...|$|E
