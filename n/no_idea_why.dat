[...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed.

500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I was terrified, of course. But he liked it. I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why,</b> but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so it is an interesting way to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily sing—essentially commenting in song on her character’s situation in the film — provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise not have been so clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E

It's an uninteresting one, peopled with almost criminally bland characters. In fact, as portrayed here - quite possibly accurately - they're a bunch of bibulous knuckleheads who shoot at each other year after year - or on TV, hour after hour - and have <b>no</b> real <b>idea</b> <b>why.</b> It's an interminable eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth narrative." [...] Washington Posts Hank Stuever also gave a negative review: [...] "The point of the entire saga, it seems, is to make you lose track of what the feudin' was about, and how it managed to burn out of control. It will always be tempting to view their story through any modern analogy of one's choosing - such as partisan political stalemates or the red-blue socioeconomic divide.

In order to help in understanding these inequalities, we develop an intuition into the validity of such inequalities by giving a unifying way of defining them through a sequential lifting procedure.

We apply this procedure to some known classes of valid inequalities for the TSP, respectively Comb, Brushes, Star and Path, Bipartition inequalities, where the lifting coefficients are sequence independent.

30|$|The {{lowest level}} of {{hierarchical}} organization of bone has successfully been simulated by CDHA precipitation on peptide-amphiphile nanodimensional fibers (Hartgerink et al. 2001). However, apatite platelets nucleating {{on the surface of}} peptide tubules are not similar to the nanostructure of bone and they are only an example of surface induced nucleation (and not accurately characterized either), while the nanostructure of bone consists of intra-fibrillar platelets intercalated within the collagen fibrils. However, the interface between collagen and biological apatite is still poorly understood; for the available details, the readers are referred to a review devoted to the structure and mechanical quality of the collagen/mineral nanodimensional biocomposite of bones (Fratzl et al. 2004). There is still <b>no</b> clear <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> the crystals of biological apatite are platelet shaped even though dahllite has hexagonal crystal symmetry (Weiner and Wagner 1998; Currey 2002; Rho et al. 1998; Rey et al. 2009). One possible reason is that they grow via an OCP transition phase, in which crystals are plate-shaped (Weiner and Wagner 1998). Another explanation involves the presence of citrates, which strongly bound to (10 Ī 0) surface of biological apatite because of space matching (Hu et al. 2010; Xie and Nancollas 2010). Therefore, the crystal growth in the [10 Ī 0] direction becomes inhibited, while the citrate effect on other crystal surfaces of biological apatite appears to be very small owing to poor space matching. Thus, after crystal growth, the (10 Ī 0) crystal face becomes predominant resulting in plate-like morphology of biological apatite (Xie and Nancollas 2010).|$|R

40|$|These lectures {{will cover}} the {{relationship}} of SU_ 3 and the weak interactions. The lectures will be geared for experimental people {{so that they may}} get an idea of how our theoretical predictions arise. At first, I will speak {{a little bit about how}} calculations are made for the weak decays, then we shall consider SU_ 3, and finally the effects of unitary symmetry upon the weak interactions. The subject matter is split in this way so that one may get a clearer idea of the origins of the various problems in the theory of weak interactions. Not all of our difficulties arise from SU, nor do all of the successes, and it is important to realize this. The theory of weak decays is very unsatisfactory except that it agrees with experiment. To understand that remark let us consider the muon. A muon is a particle which has exactly the same properties as the electron except that its mass is 207 times the mass of the electron. This statement completely describes our experiments with the muon, but such a comment is also unsatisfactory for a true theorist. Experimentalists find a beautiful and simple thing which is easy for the theorists to describe. Nevertheless, we must be unhappy about this situation because we have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>why</b> this particle exists. Similarly, the theory of weak decay, up to the point where we encounter strangeness changing interact ions, is accurate but unsatisfactory. There are various mysterious properties which I shall mention as I go on, but I should like to remind you that the most mysterious aspect of the weak decays is that they exist at all. It seems so much simpler just to forget them. There is no clue from electromagnetism, from gravity, or from nuclear forces that the weak interactions must exist.
