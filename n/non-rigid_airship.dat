K-1 remained the sole specimen of its type; the Navy considered it too large for its tasks.|$|E
2500|$|At {{its first}} trial the LZ 1 carried five people, reached an {{altitude}} of [...] and flew a distance of [...] in 17 minutes, but by then the moveable weight had jammed {{and one of the}} engines had failed: the wind then forced an emergency landing.

2500|$|Later Settle piloted {{different}} types of airships stationed at Lakehurst. In January 1928 Settle nearly drowned at sea when his J-3 <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> carrying trainee pilots lost power and was swept into the Atlantic; the crew managed to restart the engines and reach Lakehurst.

In October 1928 Settle crossed the Atlantic on board Graf Zeppelin together with two other Navy observers.

2500|$|On 19 June 1915, after Churchill {{had been}} {{replaced}} as First Lord by Arthur Balfour, a conference [...] was held [...] at the Admiralty to consider all airship development. [...] At that time the <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> programme was proving to be successful, and at this meeting it was agreed to expand the non-rigid programme and also to resume construction of HMA No.9. However, resumption of work was delayed by the necessity to retrieve Pratt and Wallis who had enlisted in the Army when construction was cancelled. [...] Final erection of the ship began {{in the autumn of}} that year, but there were delays in obtaining flax from Ireland to make nets for the gasbags following the Easter Rising, and the ship was not completed until 28 June 1916.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 April N.S.3 {{performed}} {{her first}} convoy escort, and from 20–22 April she completed {{a flight of}} 55hours with various convoys – the longest flight to that date of any <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airship.</b> During May 1918, she flew over 130 hours – one patrol lasted for 33hours, and another for 20hours which was curtailed only by orders to return to base due to increasing winds. During a flight {{on the night of}} 31 May / 1 June whilst participating in the testing of the anti-aircraft capabilities of the Grand Fleet and shore batteries near Rosyth, N.S.3 achieved a height of [...] – another record for the type. In early June 1918, she commenced towing trials with the destroyer [...] to examine the possibility of towing an airship at speed should it break down or run short of fuel.

5000|$|From {{the launch}} of the Pilgrim in 1925 to the {{decommissioning}} of the Spirit of Innovation in 2017, Goodyear generally owned and operated <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> in its global public relations fleet.

Although technically incorrect, Goodyear has planned to use [...] "blimp" [...] in reference to these new semi-rigid models.

40|$|AbstractFluid–structure {{interaction}} {{is an important}} issue for <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> with inflated envelopes.

The results obtained indicate that the effect of fluid–structure {{interaction is}} noticeable and should be considered for <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airships.</b> Flow-induced deformation can further intensify the upward lift force and pitching moment, which can lead to a large deformation. Under a wind speed of 15 m/s, the lift force of the non-rigid model is increased to approximately 60 % compared with that of the rigid model under a high angle of attack...|$|R

50|$|A blimp, or <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airship,</b> is an airship (dirigible) {{without an}} {{internal}} structural framework or a keel. Unlike semi-rigid and rigid airships (e.g. Zeppelins), blimps {{rely on the}} pressure of the lifting gas (usually helium, rather than hydrogen) inside the envelope and the strength of the envelope itself to maintain their shape.|$|E
50|$|Although {{technically}} an aircraft, pre-World War II rigid airships (e.g., zeppelins) {{were treated}} like commissioned surface warships and submarines, flew the U.S. ensign from their stern {{and carried a}} United States Ship (USS) designation. <b>Non-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> (e.g., blimps) continued to fly the U.S. ensign from their stern, but were always considered to be primarily aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century, {{semi-rigid}} airships were considered more suitable for military use because, unlike rigid airships, they could be deflated, stored and transported by land or by sea. <b>Non-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> had a limited lifting capacity due to the strength limitations of the envelope and rigging materials then in use.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time that <b>non-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> were {{starting}} to have some success, the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These would be far more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo carrying capacity for decades.
