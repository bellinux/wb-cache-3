40|$|Structural vector-autoregressions with long-run {{restrictions}} are extraordinarily sensitive to low-frequency correlations. This paper explores this sensitivity analytically and via simulations, {{focusing on the}} contentious issue of whether hours worked rise or fall when technology improves. Recent literature finds that when hours per person enter the VAR in levels, hours rise; when they enter in differences, hours fall. However, once we allow for (statistically and economically plausible) trend breaks in productivity, the treatment of hours is relatively unimportant: Hours fall sharply on impact following a technology improvement. The issue is the common high-low-high pattern of hours per capita and productivity growth since World War II. Such low-frequency correlation almost inevitably implies a positive estimated impulse response. The trend breaks control for this correlation. In addition, the specification with breaks can easily "explain" (or encompass) the positive estimated response when the breaks are omitted; in contrast, the <b>no-breaks</b> specification has more difficulty explaining the negative response when breaks are included. More generally, this example suggests a need for care in applying the long-run-restrictions approach. ...|$|R

5000|$|In word {{processing}} and digital typesetting, a non-breaking space (" [...] ") (also called <b>no-break</b> space, non-breakable space (NBSP), hard space, or fixed space) is a space character that prevents an automatic line break at its position.

5000|$|The {{model is}} focused on the energy {{transformation}} to usable heat and flexible deployment where heat is required in a larger scale, with constant heat demand. The micro data centers optimally don't require any overhead installations for cooling or <b>no-break</b> systems. The cooling of the servers is facilitated by sourcing cold water from the heat user, thus creating a synergy between different industries.Due to the minimised overhead, these nodes can be deployed in large quantities near or within network hubs for urban or office areas or even as part of a non-data center facility which can directly benefit from the reusable heat. This allows for fast network access and simple energy reuse.The micro edge nodes (10-100 kW) function as forward locations of the core data centers. The edge nodes provide services like data processing for IoT systems, data caching for digital content (YouTube, Netflix, etc.) and fast access to cloud services. The edge nodes are continuously replicated with the core datacenters and several strategic other edge nodes. This provides constant availability through geo-redundancy.|$|E

Using an experimental method comprising 36 groups of 5 individuals, the relationships between different types of off-task group break and performance in creative tasks post-break are explored. When compared to the <b>no-break</b> case, it is seen that off-task breaks, in which all individuals participate in the group activity, lead to more original ideas being generated post-break. On the other hand, individual incubation breaks and self-organising group breaks, lead to lower levels of post-break idea originality {{when compared with the}} <b>no-break</b> case.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{problem in}} this investigation is {{to determine if a}} <b>no-break</b> electric power system using a gas turbine as the emergency prime mover can be manufactured and operated within certain specified limits to provide continuous electric power to the critical portions of Naval Communications equipment.

The gas turbine system must be so designed as to overcome these disadvantages. One system is proposed that can be manufactured from equipment now available; however, this system while being less bulky and weighing less than the diesel system, costs more to own and operate.

40|$|This paper investigates {{selection}} and averaging of linear regressions {{with a possible}} structural break. Our main contribution is {{the construction of a}} Mallows criterion for the structural break model. We show that the correct penalty term is nonstandard and depends on unknown parameters, but it can be approximated by an average of limiting cases to yield a feasible penalty with good performance. Following Hansen (2007, Econometrica 75, 1175 – 1189) we recommend averaging the structural break estimates with the <b>no-break</b> estimates where the weight is selected to minimize the Mallows criterion. This estimator is simple to compute, as the weights are a simple function of the ratio of the penalty to the Andrews SupF test statistic. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the paper emphasizes an increasingly important role of alternative power sources nowadays. At the same time, a solar collector (suntrap) {{is one of the}} most frequent techniques to use the solar energy. It is an absorber that picks up solar radiation and heats a heat carrier circulating in the close loop. Then the heat is transferred to the heat accumulator that is integrated in the hot-tap water system (HWS). The paper presents a prospective circuit of the solar collector. It differs from the traditional one because, in addition to absorbing panel, it uses photoconverters to generate electric power for the circulating pump. The advantage of this system is that for operation such a solar energy converter has no need in external power sources, i. e. it is autonomous. The need to calculate the essential thermo-physical parameters that ensure <b>no-break</b> system operation was stated as a main objective of the work. The suggested circuit has a photocell panel to convert solar radiation into dc voltage of 12 V. In case of a lack of the solar energy an accumulator battery can be used for feeding. To ensure the <b>no-break</b> supply of power an adaptor is offered. To calculate a density distribution of solar radiation a sine law is offered depending on the time of day and geographical locality. This dependence was used to obtain the expressions for calculating the water temperature in boiler over daytime. Further, the calculations have been done for the operating conditions under which an efficient heat exchange will be provided with the minimum consumption of electric power for the heat carrier circulation in the first loop. For this purpose, a pump power was calculated depending on consumption and hydraulic losses of head in the pipeline. As a minimum required consumption the value has been chosen at which a laminar flow regime changes to the turbulent one because of the most efficient heat exchange being both in collector and in heat accumulator. The hydraulic loss has been calculated by Darcy-Weisbach equation. Finally, the formula has been obtained to calculate a minimum area of photo converters to be needed for the solar power system to ensure <b>no-break</b> operation. As a result of studies, it has been found that with typical external parameters, the area required for photo converters is about 100 - 300 cm 2. Dependences to calculate main parameters of system components including necessary minimum areas of absorber and photo converter, pump power, heat carrier consumption has been obtained as well. The paper conclusions are as follows. The model of solar heat accumulator obtained in the paper makes it possible to calculate main parameters of system components. Required photo converter dimensions have acceptable values. Also it is necessary to calculate the convection exchange processes in absorber to optimize a design for reducing the thermal and hydraulic losses. Further, the paper presents the calculation of operating conditions under which an efficient heat exchange is ensured with minimum consumption of electric power for the heat carrier circulation in the first loop. For this, a pump power has been calculated depending on the consumption and hydraulic losses in the pipeline. </p...|$|E
