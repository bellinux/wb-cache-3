50|$|The microplane model, {{conceived}} in 1984, is a material constitutive model for progressive softening damage. Its {{advantage over the}} classical tensorial constitutive models {{is that it can}} capture the oriented <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> such as tensile cracking, slip, friction, and compression splitting, as well as the orientation of fiber reinforcement. Another advantage is that the anisotropy of materials such as gas shale or fiber composites can be effectively represented. To prevent unstable strain localization (and spurious mesh sensitivity in finite element computations), this model must be used in combination with some nonlocal continuum formulation (e.g., the crack band model). Prior to 2000, these advantages were outweighed by greater computational demands of the material subroutine, but thanks to huge increase of computer power, the microplane model is now routinely used in computer programs, even with tens of millions of finite elements.|$|E
