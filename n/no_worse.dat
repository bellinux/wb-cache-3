5|$|While World War I {{affected}} all NHA teams, Ottawa {{was able}} to retain players and be competitive. The club finished <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than second during the wartime seasons of 1914–15 to 1917–18.|$|E
5|$|Coates {{reached his}} peak at the 1976 games in Innsbruck. He competed in five events, {{and apart from}} a 25th-place finish in the 500m event, did <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than 11th in the {{remaining}} four. He came sixth in the 10,000m, eighth in the 1,500m and tenth in the 5,000m. It was {{only the second time}} that an Australian had placed in the top 10, and remained Australia's best result until 1994. His five skiing compatriots were less productive; they registered in 13 races between them and completed only seven due to crashes and disqualifications, with only one top 30 result.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} the {{hospital}} ship AHSCentaur on 14May1943 with heavy loss of life led the Advisory War Council to seek information from the RAN and RAAF on the actions being taken to protect shipping. While the RAN acknowledged that the Bathurst-class corvettes that made up most of its escort force were too slow, it argued that the losses suffered by escorted convoys were <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than those {{in other parts of}} the world. Despite the Navy's assurances, Australia's anti-submarine forces were constrained by a shortage of training opportunities and poor coordination between the RAN, RAAF and the United States Navy. The Australian military had also not kept pace with improvements to British and United States ASW doctrine by fully implementing the tactics that had proven most successful in other theatres of the war.|$|E

5|$|Bosanquet {{was one of}} the few bowlers in the MCC team not to {{have some}} success in the opening two matches of the tour, {{although}} he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against New South Wales; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman Reggie Duff. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By this stage of the tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain made a joke about his team's bowling being <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than Bosanquet's.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
5|$|Two Angels first-round picks, outfielder Darin Erstad (1995) {{and third}} basemen Troy Glaus (1997), {{played with the}} 2002 World Series {{championship}} team. Outfielder Mike Trout, who was chosen in 2009 and has spent his entire MLB career to date with the Angels, was named American League Rookie of the Year in 2012, and has finished <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than second in voting for American League Most Valuable Player {{in each of his}} first five full seasons with the Angels, winning that award in 2014 and 2016. Pitcher Jim Abbott (1988), born without a right hand, won the 1987 Golden Spikes Award while playing at the University of Michigan, and the 1992 Tony Conigliaro Award and the 1995 Hutch Award while with the Angels. Danny Goodwin (1975), who was picked first overall in 1971 by the Chicago White Sox but opted for four years of college, is the only player to be selected first in the draft on two separate occasions.|$|E

5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle for}} the top overall seed {{came down to the}} final match in pool play. Waikato claimed the top seed by {{defeating}} North Harbour. Regardless of the Waikato-Harbour result, Auckland was assured of <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than the second seed they eventually received. Harbour received the third seed.|$|E
50|$|Ebastine {{has shown}} overall safety and {{tolerability}} profile with no cognitive/psychomotor impairment and <b>no</b> sedation <b>worse</b> than placebo, and cardiac safety, that is, no QT prolongation. The incidence of most commonly reported adverse events was comparable between the ebastine and placebo groups, which confirms that ebastine has a favourable safety profile.|$|R
30|$|Main symptom {{improvement}} was graded as <b>worse,</b> <b>no</b> change, improvement or completely improved. Overall comparison was graded as <b>worse,</b> <b>no</b> change, improvement or major improvement. Extent of patient satisfaction was graded as satisfied, neutral or not satisfied. All patients {{had the opportunity}} to mention persisting or new onset symptoms in the questionnaire. Exemption of a hospital’s Ethics Committee approval was granted in view of the cheer registration design of the study (not WMO obligated; WMO is Dutch law on Medical Research).|$|R
50|$|The 1942 {{short story}} Talboys, {{the very last}} Wimsey fiction {{produced}} by Sayers, is both a sequel to the present book, in having the same location {{and some of the}} same village characters, and an antithesis in being lighthearted and having <b>no</b> crime <b>worse</b> than the theft of some peaches from a neighbour's garden.|$|R
25|$|Starting from 1987, the NBA {{modified}} the lottery {{system so that}} only the first three picks were determined by the lottery. After the three envelopes were drawn, the remaining non-playoff teams would select in reverse order of their win-loss record. This meant that {{the team with the}} worst record could receive <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than the fourth selection, and the second-worst team could pick no lower than fifth, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Commitment ordering, {{publicly}} {{introduced in}} May 1991 (see below), provides an efficient elegant general solution, from both practical and theoretical points of view, {{to the global}} serializability problem across database systems with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. It provides conflict serializability with no negative effect on availability, and with <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> performance than the de facto standard for global serializability, CO's special case Strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL). It requires knowledge about neither local nor global transactions.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the WorkChoices {{coming into}} force, {{certified}} agreements, subsequently called Collective Agreements (CAs) and Individual Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs), {{had to pass}} a No Disadvantage Test. This test compared a proposed agreement to an underpinning and relevant award that had or should have covered employees up until the proposal for an agreement. The No Disadvantage Test weighed {{the benefits of the}} award against the proposed agreement to ensure that, overall, employees were <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> off.|$|E
50|$|With three wins, two poles, and 14 top tens (<b>no</b> finish <b>worse</b> than 7th), Rick Mears ran {{way with}} the inaugural CART {{championship}} title. Mears took a large points lead after winning the Indy 500, and never relinquished the top spot through {{the remainder of the}} season. Bobby Unser won six races, and finished second in points.|$|R

25|$|While the {{admissibility}} criterion guarantees {{an optimal}} solution path, {{it also means}} that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths to find the optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, it is possible to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. Oftentimes we want to bound this relaxation, so that we can guarantee that the solution path is <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} was {{undertaken}} {{with the utmost}} secrecy, {{as much for the}} public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend Mass nor receive the sacraments. The jails of the Inquisition were <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.|$|E
25|$|Injuries in rock {{climbing}} are mainly sports injuries that occur due to falls or overuse. Injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; {{the vast majority}} of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Such injuries are often <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than torn calluses, cuts, burns and bruises. There are a number of skincare products specifically for climbers available in the market. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage especially to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and capsules. Injuries from lead climbing are common.|$|E

25|$|Jeffery {{comments}} {{that for all}} Wilson’s reputation for intrigue he was mainly an inveterate gossip (a feature which endeared him to some politicians), whose closeness to the French alienated Robertson, and whose behaviour was <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than the intrigues of Robertson, Haig, Rawlinson and Gough to remove Sir John French. His reputation for political intrigue was acquired for {{his involvement in the}} arguments over conscription and Ireland in 1912–14. Esher (in his life of Kitchener) later blamed Wilson’s “Irish blood, exuberant with combative malice” for having drawn him into the latter quarrel, which had earned him the reputation of “a pestilential fellow”.|$|E
25|$|Caltrain {{plans to}} use lighter {{electric}} multiple units that do not comply with the US Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) crashworthiness standards, but instead comply with the International Union of Railways (UIC) standards, on the electrified lines. FRA granted Caltrain a waiver to operate these units, which were previously banned on mix-used lines with other FRA-compliant rolling stock due to concerns over crash worthiness, after Caltrain submitted simulation data showing UIC-compliant rolling stock performed <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> or even better than FRA-compliant rolling stock in crashes. Caltrain plans to retain their newer diesel-electric rolling stock for use on the Dumbarton Extension and service south of Tamien.|$|E
25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> than they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
