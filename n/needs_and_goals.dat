To evaluate the adherence of formulations of <b>needs,</b> problems <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> to specifications of the Rehabilitation Activities Profile for Children. Methods: Raw text data were extracted and organized. Two raters independently weighed the entries' quality against the specifications and linked the extracted content to ICF-CY categories. Results: In 12 % of the reports no <b>needs,</b> <b>and</b> in 24 % no principal goals, were formulated. Needs mostly pertained to the activities-and-participation domain (65 %), whereas problems <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> covered all 3 ICF-CY domains. None of the <b>needs</b> were prioritized <b>and</b> 79 % met the quality criterion of description of a problem/desire. Twenty-four percent of the problems were described in the activity-and-participation domain and 83 % referred to a treatable problem. Fifty-six percent of the goals were formulated in terms of intended result/effect and 63 % as child/parent actions. Conclusion: Insight is provided into the content of rehabilitation programmes for children with cerebral palsy.

40|$|Introduction 1. The <b>need</b> <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> of {{the study}} CAT (Computer-based Adaptive Testing) is a {{computer}} based evaluation device to assess accurate and effective measurement of ones attainment and psychological status (Sung, 1992; Sung, 1998; Baek, 1994). Among many CAT, {{it is well known}} that SPRT is the most simple and reliable in attaining results (Kim & Chung, 2000; Frick, 1990; Spray & Reckase, 1996). Traditional linear evaluation devices are known to have limits in providing information on how much the learner has learned. They could only provide the assumption that the learner has or has not learned everything. To compensate for this Bruno suggests Admissible Probability Measures Testing (APM) which applies a confidence variable. However, when tests are conducted using computers, it is very convenient to obtain a variety of information, such as how much time is taken and required to answer the questions and the confidence of the test takers in whether the answers chosen were correc...|$|R
40|$|This article reconceptualizes {{the change}} process from a {{rational}} planning perspective to an interpretive perspective emphasizing {{the social construction}} of meaning. Discourse is viewed as the core of the change process through which our basic assumptions about organizing are created, sustained, and transformed. To illustrate the dynamics of mean-ing systems, examples are provided of organizations shifting from mechanistic assump-tions to become more adaptive, responsive, quality-oriented organizations. Implications for researchers and managers are included. The dominant models for understanding large-scale change have relied on prescrip-tions that follow a sequence of steps or stages that emphasize rational planning and analysis. These models of planned change include identifying the <b>need</b> <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> for change, targeting change strategies, implementing change, monitoring and evaluating The views expressed in this paper {{are those of the authors}} and should not be ascribed to any person or organization.
