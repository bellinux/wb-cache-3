5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

When she learns {{the truth about the}} shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England, Sheffield Castle {{was built to}} control the Saxon {{settlements}} and Sheffield developed into a small town, <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Sheffield City Centre. By the 14th century Sheffield was noted {{for the production of}} knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of cutlery production in England after London. In the 1740s the crucible steel process was improved by Sheffield resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, Sheffield plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.|$|E

5|$|In November 1962, the National Liberation Front's Military Region 2 {{ordered the}} Viet Cong 261st Battalion and the 514th Battalion, the home {{battalion}} of Dinh Tuong Province, {{to destroy the}} strategic hamlets in their region {{and at the same}} time to attack South Vietnamese sweeping operations. Between 28–30 December 1962, an American aircraft equipped with eavesdropping equipment located a Viet Cong radio transmitter. It intercepted radio signals in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann's intelligence officer, indicated that the Viet Cong were using Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed the Viet Cong had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Certain that the Viet Cong unit was <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.|$|E
5|$|Natives of {{the region}} {{encountered}} foreigners at several times and places during the 18thand 19thcenturies. European and American vessels explored the coastal area around {{the mouth of the}} river in the late 18thcentury, trading with local natives. The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic. Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793. From 1805 to 1807, the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake rivers, and encountered numerous small settlements of natives. Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors. They also noted brass teakettles, a British musket, and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes. From the earliest contact with westerners, the natives of the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal, but instead congregated in social units <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> a village, and more often at a family level; these units would shift with the season as people moved about, following the salmon catch up and down the river's tributaries.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the period}} from the {{beginning}} of the 17th century through modern times, much of the development of Virginia, as well as the establishment and major changes in communities were relative to patterns of commerce and transportation. For the Native Americans and early European settlers, the natural waterways were the principal paths of commerce, and communities were often located along them. Former Indian trails, often <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> footpaths, evolved into stagecoach routes. The lessons of floods joined advancements in bridge-building to modify the viability of some locations. The construction of canals expanded the reach of water-borne traffic.|$|E

25|$|There are, however, some {{potential}} drawbacks to using stratified sampling. First, identifying strata and implementing {{such an approach}} can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection, as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates. Second, when examining multiple criteria, stratifying variables {{may be related to}} some, but not to others, further complicating the design, and potentially reducing the utility of the strata. Finally, in some cases (such as designs with a large number of strata, or those with a specified minimum sample size per group), stratified sampling can potentially require a larger sample than would other methods (although in most cases, the required sample size would be <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> would be required for simple random sampling).|$|E

Details of their existence, design, and use were kept secret well into the 1970s. Winston Churchill personally issued an order for their destruction into pieces <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> a man's hand, to keep secret that the British were capable of cracking Lorenz SZ cyphers (from German rotor stream cipher machines) during the oncoming cold war. Two of the machines were transferred to the newly formed GCHQ and the others were destroyed. As a result, the machines were not included in many histories of computing.

25|$|This {{lasted for}} almost nine months from December 1944 {{right up to}} the end of the war in August 1945, during which time the 2/8th was in action almost continuously. It was a long and hard campaign, and to a large extent this made up for the long periods of {{inactivity}} that the squadron had suffered while it had been garrisoned in Australia. Certainly the squadron was in the thick of it, with many of its members distinguishing themselves during this time, as evidenced by the rather large number of decorations 2/8th members earned in such a short space of time. The patrols during this time were conducted in small groups, usually <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> two sections roughly 18–20 men, and they would last for between four and six days, although some lasted up to nine. Sometimes they would employ barges to move along the coast.|$|E

40|$|Let n � 4 be even. It {{is shown}} that every set S of n {{points in the}} plane can be {{connected}} by a (possibly self-intersecting) spanning tour (Hamiltonian cycle) consisting of n straight-line edges such that the angle between any two consecutive edges is at most 2 π/ 3. For n = 4 and 6, this statement is tight. It is also shown that every even-element point set S can be partitioned into at most two subsets, S 1 and S 2, each admitting a spanning tour with <b>no</b> angle <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> π/ 2. Fekete and Woeginger conjectured that for sufficiently large even n, every n-element set admits such a spanning tour. We confirm this conjecture for point sets in convex position. A much stronger result holds for large point sets randomly and uniformly selected from an open region bounded by finitely many rectifiable curves: for any ε> 0, these sets almost surely admit a spanning tour with <b>no</b> angle <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> ε...|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{prove that}} the scaling choice of Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is order-optimal. First, we show that <b>no</b> scaling order <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> this results in higher throughput. We have {{observed}} that by the scaling of Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)), the scaling of R 1 is as R 1 [*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)). Choosing a <b>larger</b> scaling <b>than</b> Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) for Q, does not help improving the scaling order of R 1. That is because R 1 [*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is the best achievable scaling even {{in the case of}} Q[*]=[*]∞. Thus, increasing the scaling order of Q does not help improving the scaling order of R 1. On the other hand, this action will deteriorate the pre-constant factor by increasing the third phase load. Consequently, <b>no</b> scaling <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is the optimum scaling order.|$|R
