5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington Monument, the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged {{three of the}} four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone {{topped the}} New York Times list of best-selling fiction, and stayed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> list {{for much of}} 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult {{sections}} under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings. Publishers Weeklys report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6million copies).|$|E

5|$|Loose debuted {{at number}} one on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling more than 34,000 copies in its first week, at that time the year's strongest debut for a Canadian artist. In late July, after Furtado {{embarked}} on a short tour of Canada and made a guest appearance on the television show Canadian Idol, the album returned to number one. It subsequently stayed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album chart until late January 2007, when it reached number one again for two weeks. It was the third best-selling album of 2006 in Canada, and the highest selling by a female solo artist, with 291,700 copies sold. The Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) certified Loose five times platinum in May 2007 for shipments of more than 500,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December the Australians {{attacked}} again, {{this time}} with two companies approaching from the north-east, using an intense artillery and mortar bombardment to prepare the area first; the attack was repulsed with heavy fire. A further barrage rained down on the Japanese and by sunset, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, severely depleted with most its companies– several of which were commanded by junior non commissioned officers due to heavy casualties amongst the subalterns– at platoon strength, had managed to establish a lodging <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feature on its eastern approach.

5|$|Some {{viewers have}} presumed that the Pennsylvania Paper & Supply Company's tower, a {{downtown}} Scranton landmark which appears in video footage shot by cast member John Krasinski for the show's opening credits, is the Dunder Mifflin office. The real company, which also sells paper and office supplies, has welcomed the exposure (and increase in business) {{and has a}} ground-floor showroom where it sells both its products and T-shirts with the tower. It plans to add a Dunder Mifflin logo to the circular insets <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower. Mifflin Avenue ends adjacent to the Penn Paper & Supply building.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curved part of the scale.|$|E

5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|While {{performing}} a test run prior to the park opening on July 9, 2013, one of the roller coaster trains became stuck <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lift hill. The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed {{for more than two}} months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the weight distribution on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E
