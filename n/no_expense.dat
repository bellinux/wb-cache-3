5|$|King Neptune {{wants to}} {{celebrate}} his 5,000th birthday at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and the crew spare <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> for the gala, rolling out the red carpet to welcome the royal family. Despite the party itself, the king's spirits are brought down {{by the absence of}} his son, Triton, spoiling the festivities for everyone, especially his wife, Queen Amphitrite. Triton was banished to a cage on the deserted Island in the Sky, until he is ready to be a proper god, having displeased his father with his growing interests in the mortal world.|$|E
5|$|Ashbrook was {{defeated}} {{for re-election in}} the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not end until March 4 of the following year. He was friendly with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republican–Indiana), and persuaded him to schedule {{a hearing on the}} peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as the redesign involved <b>no</b> <b>expense.</b>|$|E
5|$|Offitt's {{membership}} has tired of endless talk, and plans a general strike, {{a fact of}} which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> to the city.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} {{he has worked}} in a factory and been on the dole. During the 31st Dáil, {{he was the only}} TD in Ireland who claimed <b>no</b> <b>expenses,</b> a policy he carried out {{throughout}} his twelve years at local level and maintained at national level.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} provincial Capitol {{grounds of}} Pampanga in San Fernando covered {{an area of}} about 12 hectares. The Capitol was erected in 1907-1908, during the administration of Governor Macario Arnedo and <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> were spared from making {{the seat of the}} local government, truly an attractive tourist attraction in itself.|$|R
60|$|Pedro, who {{of course}} rode {{ahead in the}} {{capacity}} of guide, seemed to possess an unlimited supply of cash, and Lawrence Armstrong had at least sufficient to enable him to bear his {{fair share of the}} expenses of the journey. As for Quashy, being a servant he had <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> to bear.|$|R
5|$|On November 24, 1922, Cather {{wrote to}} a friend, Edwin H. Anderson, {{director}} of the New York Public Library, {{that she was the}} author of the entire book except for the first chapter. Burton J. Hendrick had written the first installment, but it had been based largely on rumor. McClure asked her to complete the series because she was regarded as impartial. For the rest of the installments, she told Anderson, <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> had been spared in verifying Milmine's material. McClure had promoted her to managing editor {{on the basis of the}} work. She ended the letter by asking Anderson to keep the information confidential; she added that had not told the truth about it to anyone before this, but felt that someone ought to know.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{viewed the}} {{partially}} finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's last visit in 1575. Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth {{in a final}} attempt to convince her to marry him, and <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> was spared. Elizabeth brought an entourage of thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages. Leicester entertained the Queen {{and much of the}} neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it probably did not exceed £1,700 in reality. The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay at such a property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 Hastilow {{was elected}} to Stratford-on-Avon District Council where {{he served as a}} {{councillor}} for two years. During that period he claimed <b>no</b> <b>expenses.</b> He was the only Conservative to oppose a 52 per cent council tax increase and also succeeded in committing the local authority to opposing the Labour Party's hunting ban.|$|R
50|$|In {{both the}} 2001 and 2005 {{elections}} the only expenditures by candidates reported to Elections BC were the $100 nomination deposit. The party claimed $5 in expenditures during the 2001 election and <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> during the 2005 election. Regardless {{of the low}} expenditures on elections, the party had accumulated {{over a million dollars}} in assets.|$|R
50|$|Once again, {{there were}} no surprises {{in the race for}} Congress in Delaware County, with James trouncing Welsh, with about 62% of the vote, 137,764 to 84,764. From the expense reports filed with Congress, the local {{campaign}} must have been a bargain also, with James reporting <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> at all, to the Democrat's $804.|$|R
25|$|The most {{spectacular}} vessel {{built by the}} company in this period was the steam yacht Corsair II for the millionaire businessman J. Pierpont Morgan. Designed by Morgan's friend J. Frederic Tams who was told to spare <b>no</b> <b>expense,</b> the lavishly outfitted vessel was the world's largest pleasure ship upon launch in 1890.|$|E
25|$|Whilst many early virginals {{throughout}} Europe {{were left}} in plain wood, they were soon provided with rich decoration, which {{may have contributed to}} the survival of many such instruments. From mouldings on case edges, jackrails and namebattens to adornment with ivory, mother-of-pearl, marble, agate, tortoiseshell or semi-precious stones, not to mention intricate painting, <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> was spared by those who could afford it.|$|E
25|$|The {{church was}} the {{crowning}} achievement of Basil's building program, and he spared <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> to decorate it as lavishly as possible: other churches and {{structures in the}} capital, including the mausoleum of Justinian, were stripped, and the Imperial fleet employed with transporting marble for its construction, {{with the result that}} Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was left unsupported and fell to the Arabs.|$|E
50|$|The mansions {{were large}} and very elaborate, with <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> spared to {{construct}} palaces with Japanese gardens and multiple gates. Each block had {{four to six}} of the mansions, which were surrounded by ditches for drainage. Daimyōs with lesser wealth were allowed to set up their houses, called banchō, {{to the north and}} west of the castle.|$|R

50|$|In 1916, he {{had built}} enough of a fortune from the cycle {{industry}} (see below) that the British Olympic Association ruled that he should get <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> should he be picked for the Olympic Games. The formal reason given {{was that he was}} too old and not worthy of public support. The war ended both his career and the 1916 Olympic Games.|$|R
25|$|The mansion {{which now}} forms the centrepiece {{of the group}} was built by Mr. William Palliser about 1725. <b>No</b> <b>expense</b> was spared in its {{construction}} and decoration, as can still {{be judged by the}} beautifully preserved interior, the polished mahogany and, in one room, embossed leather wallpaper. William Palliser died in 1768 without issue and Rathfarnham House passed to his cousin the Rev. John Palliser, who was rector of the parish.|$|E
25|$|The wedding {{took place}} on 2 July 1839 at the grand church of the Winter Palace. The {{ceremony}} was described in detail by the Marquis de Custine, who visited St Peterburg at that time. He praised the Grand Duchess for her grace, but disliked the Duke of Leuchtenberg. Nicholas I spared <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> for his daughter’s wedding and the festivities lasted for two weeks. The couple remained in Russia, where their seven children {{grew up in the}} circle of the imperial family.|$|E
25|$|The new {{chairman}} Marcelo Teixeira, {{son of former}} chairman Milton Teixeira, tried to prepare Santos for domination in the 21st century. <b>No</b> <b>expense</b> was spared to build a complete squad, with names as Freddy Rincón, Marcelinho Carioca, Edmundo, Márcio Santos, Carlos Germano, Valdo and Carlos Galván. Those big names could not translate their reputation into excellence on the pitch, resulting in a runner-up and a semi-final loss in the state championships of 2000 and 2001. In the national league Santos performed sub-par, with an 18th place in 2000 and a 15th in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} June 2009, Lewis was {{informed}} by the Conservative Partys Scrutiny Panel, after examination of his expenses claims, that [...] "we do not require you to answer any queries about them {{and there is no}} requirement for any repayments to be made", and The Daily Telegraphs subsequent book entitled <b>No</b> <b>Expenses</b> Spared made <b>no</b> reference to any which Lewis had claimed.|$|R
50|$|The motoryacht Thelma IV was {{designed}} by the Swedish yacht designer Carl Gustaf Pettersson. The drawings were created in 1915 for the director of Göteborgs Mekaniska Verkstad, Mr Erik W Flobeck. The yacht was built at Eriksberg. <b>No</b> <b>expenses</b> were spared building the yacht. The hull was built of mahogany, flooring was made of teak and the decks were made of Oregon pine. All fittings were made of bronze and were chrome plated.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} why I {{should be ashamed}} of {{speaking}} the truth," [...] he said, after a momentary hesitation,--"I had no dress suitable for appearing at Court. I am determined to incur <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> which I cannot discharge; and I think you, sir, would not advise me to stand at the palace-door, in person, and deliver my petition, along with those who are in very deed pleading their necessity, and begging an alms." ...|$|R
25|$|Historically, on routes where {{a single}} {{railroad}} {{has had an}} undisputed monopoly, passenger service was as spartan and as expensive as the market and ICC regulation would bear, since such railroads {{had no need to}} advertise their freight services. However, on routes where two or three railroads were in direct competition with each other for freight business, such railroads would spare <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> to make their passenger trains as fast, luxurious, and affordable as possible, as it was considered to be the most effective way of advertising their profitable freight services.|$|E
25|$|Villard {{pushed hard}} for the {{completion}} of the Northern Pacific in 1883. His crews laid an average of a mile and half (2.4km) of track each day. In early September, the line neared completion. To celebrate, and to gain national publicity for investment opportunities in his region, Villard chartered four trains to carry guests from the East to Gold Creek in western Montana. <b>No</b> <b>expense</b> was spared and the list of dignitaries included Frederick Billings, Ulysses S. Grant, and Villard's in-laws, the family of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. On September 8, the Gold Spike was driven near Gold Creek.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, the Fisher Brothers of Fisher Body {{followed}} General Motors to the area. They broke ground on their eponymous Fisher Building in 1927, located across Grand Boulevard from the General Motors Building. The Fisher Brothers also hired Kahn, and spared <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> to construct their headquarters building. The followed this {{up with the}} construction of New Center Building (now the Albert Kahn Building), completed in 1932. The Great Depression, however, forced the Fishers to break off their plans to construct a complex of buildings in New Center, including a grandiose three-towered version of the Fisher building.|$|E

60|$|A {{wonderful}} audience {{last night}} at Wolverhampton. If such a thing can be, they were even quicker and more intelligent than the audience I had in Edinburgh. They were so wonderfully good and were {{so much on the}} alert this morning by nine o'clock for another reading, that we are going back there at about our Bradford time. I never saw such people. And the local agent would take no money, and charge <b>no</b> <b>expenses</b> of his own.|$|R
25|$|Colonel Brush died in January 1778. Margaret then married Edward Wall, {{and with}} Penniman, the family removed to Westminster, Vermont. The {{location}} chosen by {{him for his}} residence {{was one of the}} most beautiful in that section of the fertile valley of the Connecticut River. The settlement in that town was one of the oldest and best cultivated in the State; and the society of that portion of the new district, which had originally been settled as part of the New Hampshire Grants, excelled, as it preceded others, in comforts and refinement. Such was the wealth and position of Mr. Wall, that he spared <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> in the education of his step-daughter, Penniman, who was sent to the capital of New England to complete her education.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 the {{management}} of Blackheath passed by Act of Parliament to the Metropolitan Board of Works. Unlike the commons of Hackney, Tooting Bec and Clapham, Blackheath came to the Metropolitan Board of Works at <b>no</b> <b>expense,</b> because the Earl of Dartmouth agreed to waive his manorial rights. It is held in trust for public benefit under the Metropolitan Commons Act of 1886. It passed to the London County Council in 1889, then to the Greater London Council. When the GLC closed in 1986, responsibility {{was given to the}} two boroughs of Greenwich and Lewisham, where it remains today. The heath itself is not common land, but manorial waste. The freehold is retained mostly by the Manor of Lewisham (owned by the Earl of Dartmouth) and also the Royal Manor of Greenwich (owned by the Crown Estate). The heath's chief natural resource is gravel, and the freeholders retain rights over its extraction.|$|E
25|$|The renowned {{eleventh}} {{edition of}} Encyclopædia Britannica was begun in 1903, {{and published in}} 1910–1911 in 28 volumes, with a one-volume Index. Edited by Hugh Chisholm in London and by Franklin Henry Hooper in New York, the 11th edition {{was the first to}} be published substantially at one time, instead of volume by volume. Its illustrious contributors are legion, including Baden Baden-Powell writing on kite-flying; Arthur Eddington on astronomy; Edmund Gosse on literature and Donald Tovey on music. Sometimes called the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, this edition is still highly regarded for its lucid explanations of scholarly subjects. Being in the public domain, the complete text is freely available online. The 11th edition retained the high scholarship and eminent contributors that marked the 9th edition, but tempered that scholarship with shorter, simpler articles that were more intelligible to lay-readers. Thus, the 9th and 11th editions had 17,000 and 40,000 articles, respectively, although they were roughly equivalent in size. This shift accommodated the American business strategy of popularizing the Britannica for a mass market, while still retaining its quality as a reference work. The high literary and scholarly level of the 11th edition is largely due to the zeal of its owner, Horace Everett Hooper, who held scholarship in high regard and spared <b>no</b> <b>expense</b> to make the 11th edition as excellent as possible.|$|E
