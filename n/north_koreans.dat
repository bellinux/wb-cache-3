5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight on the front lines, eventually preventing the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from the area.|$|E
5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at the Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> could not keep up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Still farther northward in {{the zone}} of the US 38th Infantry the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were also active. At 06:00 on September 3, 300 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{launched}} an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post. This fight continued until September 5. On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} was a two-week battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan {{in which the}} <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were able to gradually push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu-dong.|$|E
5|$|After 2-27th Infantry {{had left}} the Chung-ni area on September 2 in its attack toward G Company, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{attacked}} the 24th Infantry command post and several artillery positions. To meet this new situation, General Kean ordered the remaining battalion of the 27th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George H. DeChow, to attack and destroy the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> operating there.|$|E

5|$|A <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and {{the remnants of the}} task force retreated in disorder.|$|R

5|$|In {{this night}} battle the 64th Field Artillery Battalion, {{supporting}} the 1st Battalion, became {{directly involved in}} the fighting. About 50 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> infiltrated before dawn to A Battery's position and assaulted it. <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> employing submachine guns overran two artillery-machine-gun perimeter positions, penetrating to the artillery pieces at 03:00. There, Captain Andrew C. Anderson and his men fought hand-to-hand combat with the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b> Some of the guns fell temporarily into North Korean hands but the artillerymen repulsed the attack, aided by the concentrations of fire from C Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion nearby, which cut off the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from reinforcements. In defending its guns in this night battle, A Battery lost seven men killed and 12 wounded.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{resumed their}} attack. A {{battalion}} of North Korean troops drove the ROK police out of T'ongyong {{but did not}} hold it long. UN naval forces heavily shelled T'ongyong as three companies of ROK Marines from Koje Island made an amphibious landing near the town. The ROK force then attacked the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> and, supported by naval gun fire, drove them out. The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at T'ongyong lost about 350 men, the survivors withdrew to Chinju.|$|E
5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{then moved}} against Taejon. On July 19, North Korean forces entered Taejon, {{the site of}} the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters.

5|$|The UN {{units were}} able to defeat and repel the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> repeatedly, {{including}} through a coordinated offensive across the entire perimeter. In delaying and pushing back the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> the 25th Infantry Division {{was able to buy}} time for UN forces to counterattack at Inchon, effectively defeating the North Korean Army at the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The Weapons Platoon, after {{becoming}} {{separated from the}} rest of the company, encountered <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> on the trail it was following three times in the night, but in each instance neither side fired, each going on its way. At dawn, the platoon ambushed a group of <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> killing 13 and capturing three <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b> From the body of a North Korean officer the men took a briefcase containing important documents and maps. These showed that Hill 464 was an assembly point for part of the NK 3rd Division in its advance from Hill 518 toward Taegu.|$|E
5|$|An {{encounter}} battle {{developed as}} 3 RAR carried out an aggressive quick attack {{off the line}} of march from the road, with American tanks in support. With fire support from mortars and artillery unavailable due {{to the location of}} US 3/187 RCT being unknown, the Australian attack succeeded nonetheless, and the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were forced to withdraw from the high ground having suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile, 3 RAR's tactical headquarters came under attack and was forced to fight off a group of <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b> Having been forced off the high ground, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were now caught between the advancing Australians and the American paratroopers to the north. Attacking the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from the rear, 3 RAR subsequently relieved the American paratroopers, with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade linked up with them by 11:00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday; however, many of the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. The Australians then proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of straw and shooting the North Korean soldiers they found hiding in them as they attempted to flee. Caught between the American paratroopers and the British and Australians, the North Korean 239th Regiment was practically destroyed. In their first major battle in Korea the Australians had distinguished themselves, and the battalion was later praised for its performance.|$|E

5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves to counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} Schmitt {{established}} radio {{communication with the}} 1st Battalion, 9th infantry. When daylight came Schmitt and his group {{saw that they were}} surrounded by <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b> One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them, formerly held by B Company. Below them, <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units, some of them already several miles eastward. The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group. They first attacked it at 14:00 that afternoon, and were repulsed. That night an estimated company attacked three times, pressing the fight to close quarters, but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter. Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Kouma's patrol {{was then}} ambushed {{by a group}} of <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> dressed in US {{military}} uniforms. Kouma was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw, but he held the Agok site until 07:30 the next morning with his single tank. In the attack against A Company, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> hit the 1st Platoon, which was near Agok, but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward.|$|E

5|$|On August 20, the North Korean {{commands}} distributed operations {{orders to}} their subordinate units. The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{called for a}} simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{to break through the}} lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The easternmost of these was for the NK 12th and NK 5th Divisions break through the ROK Capital Division and ROK 3rd Division to P'ohang-dong and Kyongju.|$|E

5|$|That {{evening the}} <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were {{strongly}} reinforced, attacking the Australian southern flank manned by D Company 3 RAR, and partially penetrating their perimeter.

The following day the Australians advanced to the high ground overlooking Chongju, killing and capturing a number of <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> in skirmishes. That afternoon the town itself was cleared by the remaining elements of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade without opposition.
