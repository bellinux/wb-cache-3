500|$|Peckinpah {{stated that}} one of his goals for this movie was to give the {{audience}} [...] "some idea of {{what it is to be}} gunned down". A memorable incident occurred, to that end, as Peckinpah's crew were consulting him on the [...] "gunfire" [...] effects to be used in the film. Not satisfied with the results from the squibs his crew had brought for him, Peckinpah became exasperated; he finally hollered: [...] "That's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want!</b> That's not what I want!" [...] He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: [...] "THAT'S the effect I want!!" [...] He also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted on each different type of firearm having its own specific sound effect when fired.|$|E
500|$|Along with Anton Robinson, Marcus Browning and Stuart Beavon, Doe {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Weymouth in May 2008. His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008–09 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1–1 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying [...] "I do not {{see it as a}} big deal. It's not like the club has said to me we are putting you on the transfer list because we do not want you anymore", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to [...] "pay a bit of money". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3–2 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; [...] "moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3–0 home defeat.|$|E

5000|$|After portraying Ralph / Rita in The Redd Foxx Show, he was {{completely}} dissatisfied with working on a TV series. In an interview for The Magic Behind the Voices, Adler commented on the experience: [...] "you spend your whole life going, 'God, <b>I</b> just <b>want</b> {{to be in a}} TV show and have a parking space.'

25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to learn.

5000|$|After {{singing with}} the Lancashire Youth Jazz Orchestra and {{performing}} with a jazz trio {{for some time}} Hesketh decided to prioritise her education and studied cultural studies at the University of Leeds, attaining a first-class honours degree.

[...] "It paid me loads of money, but it's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be doing" [...] she said.
