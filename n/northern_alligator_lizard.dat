5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk.

50|$|The animal {{population}} includes birds (bald eagles, owls, belted kingfishers, cliff and northern rough-winged swallows, seagulls, sandpipers, and herons), mammals (black-tailed deer, mink, harbour seals, otters, bats), reptiles (garter snakes and possibly <b>northern</b> <b>alligator</b> <b>lizard),</b> and numerous invertebrates. Surprisingly, the raccoon is absent; {{its failure to}} become established on the island has allowed ground-nesting birds to maintain their populations. Mink is the only native predatory mammal on land. Many mice as well.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Northern</b> <b>Alligator</b> <b>Lizard</b> is live-bearing, {{producing}} up to 15 young (typically 4-5), between June and September. During {{the spring}} breeding season, a male lizard grabs {{on to the}} head of a female with his mouth until she is ready to let him mate with her. They can remain attached this way for many hours, almost oblivious to their surroundings. Besides keeping her from running off to mate with another male, this probably shows her how strong and suitable a mate he is.|$|E

50|$|The Northwest of the United States is {{dominated}} by the Cascade Mountain range and is characterized by mild temperatures averaging 35 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit all year with heavy rainfall ranging from 30 to 150 inches per year. These heavy rains have led to the growth of coniferous forests that include Douglas-fir, western redcedar, western hemlock, grand fir, silver fir, subalpine fir, whitebark pine, Sitka spruce, and Alaska cypress, along with an abundance of thick shrub understory. Along the coastal regions, however, glaciers and rivers dominate, leading to riparian forests that have broadleaf species such as black cottonwood and red alder. Common mammals include Sitka deer, Roosevelt elk, mountain lion, American black bear, Douglas squirrel, red tree vole, and Townsend's chipmunk. Important game birds are ruffed grouse and blue grouse. Other non-game bird species found in this region are winter wren, Townsend's warbler, chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and spotted owl and marbled murrelet which rely on the old growth forests found in this region. The Pacific treefrog, Pacific giant salamander, <b>northern</b> <b>alligator</b> <b>lizard,</b> and rubber boa can also be found here.|$|E
50|$|Cooper Mountain Nature Park {{is located}} {{on the south side of}} the 774 ft tall Cooper Mountain in eastern Washington County. The {{mountain}} is a former volcano in the Tualatin Valley. The park's natural areas include groves of oak trees, wetlands, prairie, ponds, and forested areas. Metro owns the park, but will pay Tualatin Hills Parks and Recreation about $600,000 to maintain the park over a ten-year contract. The 231 acre natural area is surrounded by agricultural lands to the south and urban development on the north. Cooper Mountain is between Oregon Route 10 and Oregon Route 210 south of Beaverton.Amenities at the park include gardens, a nature center building, parking, bike racks, a children's playground, and 3.5 mi of gravel trails. The nature center, called the Nature House, is used for educational programs and includes rest rooms, plus it is partly powered by solar panels. Birds at the park include the red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, bald eagle, western bluebird, several sparrow species, and the olive-sided flycatcher.
