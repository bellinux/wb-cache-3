500|$|Alarmed by the {{participation}} {{of students in the}} demonstration, the state-run Global Times newspaper ran an editorial on 6 July titled [...] "Do not foment youngsters to protest."

40|$|The {{number of}} Internet users is growing {{exponentially}} in China and Chinese <b>netizens</b> are slowly developing social groupings online that influence events and situations in the “real” world. The Chinese government is predictably wary {{of these developments}} as an emerging community of <b>netizens</b> is increasingly becoming aware of its great potential influence. Over {{the past two years}} (2006 and 2007) an uneasy unofficial truce has emerged so that <b>netizens</b> are relatively free to criticize and discuss local issues or events, while the central government suppresses everything it regards as excessive criticism or as an attack against the ruling party.

500|$|The 2012 UN study {{cited by}} the Chinese People's Daily {{reported}} that in Britain 74 percent and in Japan 70 percent of all women between 25 and 29 were single. A similar feature in the People's Daily focused on the reception {{of the concept of}} sheng nu from netizens outside of China, particularly in Asia, specifically Korea, Japan, and India.

30|$|The {{respondents}} in group 3 showed an acute awareness {{of other cultures}} that use similar kinds of humor. This suggests that an awareness of others is a necessary prerequisite for <b>netizens</b> to consider the networked practice of egao a form of resistance. This further implies that the networked practices of <b>netizens</b> have a formative relationship with their perceptions of, and interactions with, egao. The more connected <b>netizens</b> feel, {{the more likely they}} are to perceive egao as an active vehicle for societal or political critique. Again, the perception of the egao is contingent upon its production and dissemination within a particular network rather than the nature of its content. This article therefore posits that scholars should aim to examine the network practices—both on- and offline—of <b>netizens</b> when trying to understand the function of egao in China.|$|R
