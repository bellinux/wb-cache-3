40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{fundamental}} investigations of partial discharge behaviour of typical defects of PE/XLPE-insulated medium <b>voltage</b> cables at <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> with variable shape and frequency. The investigations were started {{because of the}} increasing use of alternative <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> (e. g. VLF 0. 1 Hz) for onsite testing of PE/XLPE insulated medium voltage cables and the increased integration of PD measurement techniques in the on-site testing equipment. The possibility to compare PD measurement results from 50 / 60 Hz AC <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> with the results from alternative <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> is questioned in this work as well as the possibility to transfer the knowledge from 50 / 60 Hz AC <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> measurements to the measurement results obtained from alternative <b>test</b> <b>voltages.</b> (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{seamless}} integration of high-frequency <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> for IPMSM rotor-position estimation in the discrete-time current-controller with fixed sampling frequency of a voltage-source converter. Pulsed <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> are used that don’t interfere with the current samples taken to control the phase currents. For this purpose, an asymmetric pulse-width modulator is applied. As {{a result of this}} strategy, the controller output influences the <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> and consequently the current response from which the rotor position is estimated. Therefore, in this paper, a first strategy is studied in which the applied <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> are computed taking into account the controller output. A second method is discussed as well in which the controller output is slightly delayed so that this output has no influence on the test signals. Despite the disadvantage of a small time delay, compared to the first method, no additional calculations are required to compute the <b>test</b> <b>voltages...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{essential}} {{demand in}} high AC <b>voltage</b> <b>testing</b> is {{the availability of}} a <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> with high qual-ity, which is variable in amplitude and frequency. The power supply should not have any influence on the measurements – even the PD-measurement- and should be able to control a fault of the test objects insulation safely. These demands can be fulfilled using modern IGBT in-verters. Two level voltage source inverters with connected resonant or filter circuits are normally used to generate a high-quality <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> by feedback control.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a recommendation for a <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> to be used for harmonized headlamp photometric specifications. Two separate activities were 1 performed: a survey of expert opinion, and an analysis of published field data on lamp I voltages. 1 The survey dealt with recommendations for <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> under current electrical systems that have a nominal voltage of 12 V, as well as under potential future, higher-voltage systems. Responses were received from 120 experts. The opinions of experts varied widely, both between continents and within continents. The most frequent recommendation for the <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> under the current electrical system was 12. 8 V in North America and 12. 0 V in Europe and Asia, but values between 12. 0 and 13. 5 V found a substantial amount of support on all I continents.

The statistical distribution of partial discharge pattern, which is discussed here includes the mean, deviation, skewness and the kurtosis of the maximum and average discharge level.

40|$|Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{techniques}} used for determining the condition of the cellulose based paper and pressboard components in large oil/paper insulated power transformers. This technique typically makes use of a sinusoidal voltage source swept from 0. 1 mHz to 1 kHz. The excitation <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> source used must meet certain characteristics, such as high output voltage, high fidelity, low noise and low harmonic content. The amplifier used; in the <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> source; must be able to drive highly capacitive loads. This paper proposes that a switch-mode assisted linear amplifier (SMALA) can be used in the <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> source to meet these criteria. A three level SMALA prototype amplifier was built to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposal. The developed SMALA prototype shows no discernable harmonic distortion in the output voltage waveform, or the need for output filters, and is therefore seen as a preferable option to pulse width modulated digital amplifiers. The lack of harmonic distortion and high frequency switching noise in the output voltage of this SMALA prototype demonstrates its feasibility for applications in FDS, particularly on highly capacitive test objects such as transformer insulation systems...|$|R

A specially adapted diagnostic technique has been developed for the application together with test systems of variable fre-quency. Basic research on cable samples with different failures has obviously qualified AC voltage near to the power fre-quency to be the optimum <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> wave shape.

The potassium currents for <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> levels from - 20 to + 85 mV were superposable by translation along the time axis for all conditions tested: (a) with depolarizing conditioning voltages; (b) with hyperpolarizing conditioning voltages; and (c) in normal and in high potassium external media. The only deviations from superposition seen were when the internal sodium concentration was abnormally high and the potassium currents showed saturation at high levels of depolarization. Some restoration toward normal kinetics could be obtained by rapidly repeated depolarizations...|$|R
40|$|Arbitrary Waveform Impedance Spectroscopy (AWIS) {{has been}} {{designed}} as a versatile tool for dielectric material studies. Among diverse features, {{it is capable of}} determining an entire dielectric spectrum from one measurement, provided the <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> is rich enough in harmonics. However, extremely harmonic-rich test signals limit the measurement accuracy due to aliasing. Aliasing is caused by the data acquisition if there are harmonics above the Nyquist frequency. However, anti-alias filters, the customary solution, are preferably avoided when using AWIS due to high precision requirements. A remaining possibility is to control the aliasing by limiting the test signal harmonic content. In this paper we present an optimized waveform, which can be applied in situations where the <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> waveform is not dictated by other requirements. In such cases it enables the use of AWIS for fast dielectric studies under rapidly changing environmental conditions...|$|R

Unfortunately, this is not generally recognized. In the limiting case of only one degree of freedom, all the three types of test statistics, including Gaussian <b>normal</b> <b>test,</b> Student's t-test and Pope's Tau-test, will be invalid for identification of outliers: (1) all the squares of the Gaussian <b>normal</b> <b>test</b> statistic coincide with the goodness-of-fit (global) test statistic, even for correlated observations. Hence, the failure of the global test implies that all the observations will be flagged as outliers, and thus the Gaussian <b>normal</b> <b>test</b> is inconclusive for localization of outliers; (2) the absolute values of the Tau-test statistic are all exactly equal to one, no matter whether the observations are contaminated.

40|$|A {{scheme for}} Built-in-Self-Test (BIST) of analog signals with minimal area overhead, for {{measuring}} on-chip voltages in an all-digital manner {{is presented in}} this thesis. With technology scaling, the inverter switching times are becoming shorter thus leading to better resolution of edges in time. This time resolution is observed to be superior to voltage resolution {{in the face of}} reducing supply voltage and increasing variations as physical dimensions shrink. In this thesis, a new method of observability of analog signals is proposed, which is digital-friendly and scalable to future deep sub-micron (DSM) processes. The low-bandwidth analog <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> is captured as the delay between a pair of clock signals. The delay thus setup is measured digitally in accordance with the desired resolution. Such an approach lends itself easily to distributed manner, where the routing of analog signals over long paths is minimized. A small piece of circuitry, called sampling head (SpH) placed near each <b>test</b> <b>voltage,</b> acts as a transducer converting the <b>test</b> <b>voltage</b> to a delay between a pair of low-frequency clocks. A probe clock and a sampling clock is routed serially to the sampling heads placed at the nodes of analog <b>test</b> <b>voltages.</b> This sampling head, present at each test node consists of a pair of delay cells and a pair of ﬂip-ﬂops, giving rise to as many sub-sampled signal pairs as the number of nodes. To measure a certain analog voltage, the corresponding sub-sampled signal pair is fed to a Delay Measurement Unit (DMU) to measure the skew between this pair. The concept is validated by designing a test chip in UMC 130 nm CMOS process. Sub-mV accuracy for static signals is demonstrated for a measurement time of few milliseconds and ENOB of 5. 29 is demonstrated for low bandwidth signals in the absence of sample-and-hold circuitry. The sampling clock is derived from the probe clock using a PLL and the design equations are worked out for optimal performance. To validate the concept, the duty-cycle of the probe clock, whose ON-time is modulated by a sine wave, is measured by the same DMU.
