40|$|The use of {{language}} is fundamental to law. This paper addresses three reasons why lawyers should use non-discriminatory (and especially non-sexist) language: to promote accuracy in legal writing and speech; to meet current standards of professional integrity and responsibility; and {{to be consistent with}} legal norms of equality and non-discrimination in Canadian law. The paper then examines ways of achieving <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language</b> in English and French in a number of concrete situations. The paper examines the `false generics 2 ̆ 2 of 2 ̆ 2 l 2 ̆ 7 homme 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 man 2 ̆ 2; the problems of gender specific pronouns (a problem which has different implications in English and in French); and the use of a non-sexist vocabulary. Finally, it explores briefly the relationship between <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language</b> and other aspects of equality in the legal profession...|$|E

The authors' goal was to find examples of open and implicit gender discrimination. Where they could not detect any such examples, they analysed {{the way in which the}} advertisements addressed men and women alike. Given the grammar of the German language, it can be difficult to achieve <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language,</b> but there are a number of solutions to this problem. This paper shows how they are applied to job advertisements...|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this study is}} the Convention of the United Nations on the rights of persons with disabilities, which states that participation to social life is a fundamental human right and places great emphasis on the principle of accessibility as a key factor for its achievement. Given that in today’s society information – especially on the web – plays a crucial role in facilitating access to many aspects of daily life, the aim of the study is to assess whether the websites of a number of public facilities take into account e-accessibility, i. e. the particular needs of people with disabilities. A comparison was carried out among 27 websites in three different languages (German, Dutch and Italian) in order to evaluate their accessibility and communicative adequacy, also with regard to the use of <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language.</b> The main hypothesis of the study is that different cultures show different awareness and sensitivity levels towards these issues, with such differences being reflected in the language and design of the websites. If this assumption of cultural differences is true, then translators can play an important social role by importing and disseminating the “best communicative practices”, and contrastive analyses of this kind can provide them with the necessary detailed knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Accessibility of Local Authorities’ Websites: a Comparison Between Germany, Italy and the Netherlands – Abstract Inclusion and {{accessibility}} {{have been important}} issues on the political agenda in many European countries, {{at least since the}} adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006. Although a European Accessibility Act has yet to be enacted, several countries are rapidly moving towards an inclusive society, not only by eliminating physical obstacles, but also by enhancing the accessibility of information and communication. New technologies as well as comprehensibility of discourse make the difference in the field of eaccessibility. Against this background, we will investigate how communicative adequacy and inclusion are attempted in three European countries, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Further, we will discuss to what extent multilingual and intercultural experts, translators included, might play a role in this inclusion process. In a previous study (Magris/Ross in press), we have explored web communication for people with disabilities in these three countries focusing on airport, hospital and library websites, with a special focus on e-accessibility and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language.</b> In the present paper we extend our analysis to city websites and web communication by other local authorities. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of plain and easy-to-read language, with a comparison of the situations in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|This unit {{introduces}} you to {{the topic}} of language and gender. You may wonderwhyit is important to studytherelationships betweenlanguage and gender. Well, consider the following questions: e Do you think many people in our society still hold, perhaps subconsciously, some gender stereotypes -e. g., the ideas that women tend to be better as secretaries and assistants, and mentend to bebetter as managers and leaders, or that womenshould be more polite and modestwhilemen should be more aggressive and assertive? If people still hold some gender stereotypes, what does language have to do with it? Does language help to perpetuate or change such stereotypes? How can we have non-sexist and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language</b> -e. g., language that doesnotperpetuate unfavorableattitudes towards women's abilities, roles and contributions in society? The language we use in our daily life is often taken for granted and we seldom pauseto critically think about it. In this unit you areencouraged to reflect onourlanguage and our language practices to seeif they reflect and perpetuate inequalities between the two sexes. Wealso discuss the question of whether men and women have different speech and communicative styles, and if yes, howand why. Finally we discuss sexist language and introduce the concept of 'symbolic violence', and discuss how we can heighten our awareness of it in the public media. Throughout this unit youwill find aseries ofbulleted questions designed to make you think about theconcepts being discussed and applythem in the Hong Kong context. Youmightfind it helpful to make notes of your ideas, as they will be useful for completing the final activity. postprin...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to identify the strategies adopted {{for the implementation of}} gender-based linguistic reform in four European countries (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom). In addressing this aim, firstly the study explores the recommendations to eliminate discrimination of women and men from language at supranational level in order to determine whether international recommendations have influenced legislation in the four countries. Secondly, the recommendations on non-sexist language in each national context have been reviewed taking into account the structural features of each language. The study shows the diverse linguistic resources that each of the four language systems has in order to achieve <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language</b> and identifies the key recommendations as well as the main promoters of gender-based linguistic reform in each country. The study has found that in all four countries a significant number of measures designed to combat linguistic sexism have been introduced. The investigation also' aims at providing evidence of the adoption of guidelines for the avoidance of sexist language as well as the stages of implementation in each country. To this end, a linguistic analysis of job offers in the four languages has been carried out. This longitudinal study has helped to identify patterns of language usage across the four socia-linguistic settings as well as the preferred strategy in each language. The main finding is that, although there is no consistent strategy regarding the feminisation of occupational nomenclature in the four languages, the common intention has been to make the language of communication gender-inclusive. The study offers a contribution to the existing work in the area of cross-cultural research. Furthermore, the review of similarities and differences between the recommendations for non-sexist language and their implementation in four linguistic settings aims to provide a framework for further research and practical application which can be drawn from the linguistic analysis of naturally occurring data...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{attempts}} to analyse {{the rise and}} use of a new vocabulary (economic buzzwords) related to staff dismissal {{in the new economy}} of the world. In this new economy, the organizational boundaries between states and firms become unclear and a new vocabulary has been conceived in order to express the changes the firms are undergoing. The new rhetoric includes buzzwords like privatization, de-regulation, re-engineering, rightsizing, downsizing, de-layering, quality service or global sourcing. The research is based on the conclusions of bibliographical and direct research of the literature relevant in the field, trying to emphasise the importance of strategic language when it comes to human resources management. Concepts like freedom of speech, politically correct language or <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language</b> are brought to attention and analysed focusing on their importance during periods of change and uncertainty characterising the economic environment nowadays. Two trends are depicted in the paper: the first is that of the supporters of political correctness who attempt to homogenize the language and thought to enhance the self-esteem of minorities. One approach to reaching this goal is to eliminate discriminatory or offensive words and phrases and the substitutions of harmless vocabulary at the expense of economy, clarity, and logic. Another approach is to deconstruct a word or phrase into its component parts, treat the component parts as wholes, and focus on secondary meanings of the component parts. On the other hand, reflecting upon the nature of large-scale organizational restructuring, there are the critics arguing that this type of language is a euphemistic form of phraseology. The analysis starts with the assumption that the economic lexis is not a rigid system of terms. Morphologically, there is a high degree of variety in productive types of compounding which exceeds the possibilities that exist in the common English vocabulary. In this view, four buzzwords (rightsizing, downsizing, re-engineering, de-layering) have been chosen as representative for this process and, also, due to the difficulty of translating them into Romanian. Also, the etymology of these buzzwords is analysed and by this the paper {{attempts to}} find why managers have adopted these as their favourite terms when discussing large-scale organizational restructuring. buzzwords, rightsizing, downsizing, re-engineering, de-layering...|$|E
40|$|Gender-sensitive language, {{gender-neutral}} language, gender-inclusive language, gender-free {{language and}} gender-fair language are terms used in English {{to refer to}} the usage of a tactful and respectful selection of vocabulary devoid of unfounded, unfair and discriminatory reference to women in contrast with men. Sport as a global social phenomenon strives for effort, excellence, fair play, solidarity and respect for all, and tries, among other things connected with these principles, to implement gender-fair policy throughout its domains, language included. The aim of this research was to analyse, both diachronically and synchronically, the usage of gender-fair language in competitive sport {{as well as in the}} scientific journals addressing sport and exercise-related topics. To realize the aim of this research, several relevant sources were inspected. As for competitive sport, first the texts of the Olympic Charter (the name is generally used in reference to all the editions) were analysed from its first edition in the English language, besides French, published in 1930 up to the latest edition published in 2015. Secondly, the set of nine documents published by the International Olympic Committee was scrutinized in terms of gender-fair vocabulary both with respect to diachrony and synchrony of their usage. Thirdly, the set of seven documents published by sports governing bodies were investigated to find out whether they abide by the principle of using gender-fair language. Further, names of sporting events and terms designating a person or persons participating in a sporting event were explored. As regards scientific inquiry, to analyse the policy of abiding by the same principle, i. e. by the principle of using <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>language</b> in scholarly writing, a set of scientific journals that publish articles whose topics are sport-related was selected. The Web of Science Core Collection – Science Citation Index Expanded, an example of a relevant and a highly valued database in which a multitude of scientific publications – sport-related in terms of their topic as well – are indexed, was searched to look into the word choice used to talk about women and men in sport. The analysis has shown that special attention is paid to using genderfair language both in competitive sport and in scientific writing. Although evidence revealed that in some cases gender-fair language is either inconsistently used or better solutions should be sought, sport is indisputably a domain which strives to follow a policy aimed at developing equal opportunities for women and men – using gender-fair language being one of the ways to corroborate this endeavour. Cilj je istraživanja dijakronijski i sinkronijski analizirati uporabu rodno nediskriminirajućega jezika u engleskome jeziku u tekstovima koji se odnose na natjecateljski sport i znanstvenim časopisima koji se bave temama vezanima za sport. U kontekstu natjecateljskoga sporta analiziraju se primjeri rodno (ne) diskriminirajućega rječnika u izdanjima Olimpijske povelje od 1930. do 2015., skup drugih dokumenata koje je objavio Međunarodni olimpijski odbor te skup dokumenata koje su objavile druge međunarodne sportske organizacije i rukovodeća tijela u sportu kako bi se utvrdilo poštuju li načelo uporabe rodno nediskriminirajućega jezika. Slijedi analiza engleskih naziva natjecateljskih disciplina i naziva za osobe koje u njima sudjeluju. Predmet je daljnje analize skup istaknutih znanstvenih publikacija na engleskome jeziku, koje se analiziraju s obzirom na odabir rječnika kojim se koriste kad govore o muškarcima i ženama. Podloga za ovaj dio istraživanja bila je visoko cijenjena citatna baza podataka Web of Science Core Collection – Science Citation Index Expanded. Zaključuje se da se u natjecateljskome sportu, kao i u znanstvenim tekstovima osobita pažnja poklanja uporabi rodno nediskriminirajućega jezika...|$|E
