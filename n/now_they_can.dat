No matter what choices Alex has made up to <b>now,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, they use the network to help create a global surveillance state where communication and the economy are controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E

I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E
25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

500|$|Not {{everyone}} with {{a link to}} the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with [...] "a stick or cane" [...] and how he would not discuss his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that justice had been done, and added that [...] "Carol was a lovely, bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What has been said about her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol." [...] Around the same time, Price said that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he [...] "knew it was her, and knew who had done it", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, {{he said that he was}} [...] "distressed" [...] by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said [...] "It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there." [...] She added that [...] "It is finally justice for Carol." [...] The Park family and Cumbria Constabulary did not comment.|$|E
500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. Which is pretty unrealistic, but it’s what kids can do on the internet <b>now.</b> <b>They</b> <b>can</b> talk to somebody anywhere".|$|E

Some say it is anti-scholastic. Others that it is just a tale copied by Rumi from Sanai – and so on.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike three {{previous}} games, Dream Chronicles’ feature factor called Dream Jewels come with five special powers. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} decode fairy words ("Decipher"), make hidden fairy things visible ("Reveal"), transmute gold into wood ("Transmute"), illuminate dark rooms ("Illuminate"), and create thunder or rain ("Thunder"). In order to activate Dream Jewels, players need to fill them with Dream Pieces which are thrown throughout. And they can also use the [...] "hint power" [...] to find Dream Pieces. At {{the end of the}} game, players earn a high score. The faster how players can complete the game, the more Dream Jewels and Dream Pieces they can find, the fewer times they skip puzzles, the better score they will earn. When players play again under the same name, some of the key items themselves will be in different places the second times around.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2006, Corbin Fisher {{launched}} the website AmateurCollegeSex.com, {{which focused on}} [...] "straight-guy niche content". Brian Dunlap explained the emphasis of the new site, [...] "The guys are straight. This is what they do when the cameras aren’t on, {{so we wanted to}} give surfers a glimpse into that part of who the guys are." [...] The site was created to serve as a complement to Corbin Fisher's site AmateurCollegeMen.com, and Dunlap commented on the business potential of the two sites for webmasters, [...] "Maybe a big portion of their traffic has already signed up to Corbin Fisher. Well, <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> start earning new money off those old surfers. This is an opportunity to promote not just one site, but two. There’s an opportunity to earn two commissions off one referral." [...] By August 2007, AmateurCollegeMen.com had about 500 [...] "solo and hardcore all-male videos". In August 2008 Corbin Fisher described itself as a website offering media of amateur sex between attractive young people at universities. The website explained that most of the models on the site were heterosexual young men.|$|E

Only when the brewer's drayman beats the brewer with a stick shall we see the clear and radiant sunrise of British self-government.
