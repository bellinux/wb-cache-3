Iliescu won the presidential {{elections}} in September 1992 by a clear margin, and his FDSN won the general elections {{held at the}} same time. With parliamentary support from the nationalist PUNR (<b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> of Romanians), PRM (Great Romania Party), and the ex-communist PSM (Socialist Workers' Party), a new government was formed in November 1992 under Prime Minister Nicolae Văcăroiu, an economist. The FDSN {{changed its name to}} Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) in July 1993.|$|E
25|$|Denktaş {{resigned}} {{in the wake}} of the vote, ushering in the pro-settlement Mehmet Ali Talat as his successor. However, the pro-settlement side and Mehmet Ali Talat lost momentum due to the ongoing embargo and isolation, despite promises from the European Union that these would be eased. As a result, the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated. This led ultimately to the pro-independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate, former Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu, winning the presidential elections in 2010. Although Eroğlu and his <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> favours the independence of Northern Cyprus rather than reunification with the Republic of Cyprus, he is negotiating with the Greek Cypriot side towards a settlement for reunification.|$|E
25|$|As time passed, {{it became}} clear that Lozano Díaz had ambitions to replace the {{traditional}} parties with one that he controlled and could use to help prolong his hold on power. He reduced the Council of State to a consultative body, postponed elections, and set about forming his own party, the <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido de Unidad Nacional, PUN). The activities of other parties were limited, and, in July 1956, Villeda Morales and other PLH leaders were suddenly arrested and flown into exile. A few weeks later, the government crushed an uprising by 400 troops in the capital. Public opinion, however, was becoming increasingly hostile to the president, and rumors of his imminent fall had begun to circulate.|$|E

The organisation of the municipality features a 22-member City Council, composed of 8 councilors from the Republican Turkish Party (CTP), 6 from the <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> (UBP), 6 from the Communal Democracy Party, 1 from the Democratic Party (DP-UG) and 1 from the New Cyprus Party (YKP).|$|E
25|$|Operation Leech: Surrounded by Arakanese {{and dense}} forest, Myanmar {{had always been}} a worrisome point for Indian intelligence. India has sought to promote {{democracy}} and install friendly governments in the region. To these ends, RAW cultivated Burmese rebel groups and pro-democracy coalitions, especially the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). India allowed the KIA to carry a limited trade in jade and precious stones using Indian territory and even supplied them weapons. It is further alleged that KIA chief Maran Brang Seng met the RAW chief in Delhi twice. However, when the KIA became the main source of training and weapons for all northeastern rebel groups, R initiated an operation, code named Operation Leech, to assassinate the leaders of the Burmese rebels as an example to other groups. in 1998, six top rebel leaders, including military wing chief of <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> of Arakans (NUPA), Khaing Raza, were shot dead and 34 Arakanese guerrillas were arrested and charged with gunrunning.|$|E

He came in second in the September 1999 election, although Patassé defeated him by a wide margin. Abel Goumba also ran as the candidate of the Patriotic Front for Progress (Front patriotique pour le progrès); a long-time politician, he served as prime minister in the late 1950s and again from March to December 2003, following Bozizé's seizure of power, subsequently becoming vice-president under Bozizé until being dismissed shortly {{after the first round}} of the election. He previously ran for president in 1981, 1993, and 1999; in 1993 he came in second place and was defeated by Patassé in the run-off.

2500|$|Vidkun Quisling proclaimed himself prime {{minister}} and appointed a government with members from the <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party.</b> He was quickly set aside and replaced by Josef Terboven, but reinstated in 1942. The Norwegian Campaign continued in Northern Norway and the government fled to London on 7 June. The German occupation resulted in a brutalization of society and 30,000 people were imprisoned. 55,000 people joined the <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party,</b> which became the only legal party. But the nazification process failed after the Supreme Court resigned and both organized sports and bishops boycotted the new regime. A resistance movement was established and became coordinate from London from 1943. Stokker reports that hostile humour against the Germans helped maintain morale and build a wall against collaboration. Jokes made the rounds dripping with contempt for the oppressors, ridicule of Nazi ideology, stressing the cruelty of the Nazis and mocking their inflated self-image. People on the street asked, [...] "Do you {{know the difference between}} the Nazis and a bucket of manure? The bucket." [...] In Post Office lines they explained, [...] "It's rumored that we're getting new stamps bearing Quisling's likeness, but distribution has been delayed because no one knows which side to spit on." [...] The jokes worked to educate Norwegians about the occupation, and encourage a sense of solidarity. At the time of German surrender on 8 May 1945, there were 360,000 German soldiers in the country.|$|E
50|$|The Swedish <b>National</b> Socialist <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> (Svenska nationalsocialistiska partiet) was a National Socialist {{political}} party in Sweden. The party was {{born out of}} a split in the Swedish National Socialist Party in October 1933, as the Göteborg-based Party Staff (partistaben) of SNSP declared the party leader Birger Furugård expelled from the party. Furugård was however able to isolate the Party Staff faction, and retained a majority of the party membership. The Party Staff regrouped as the Swedish <b>National</b> Socialist <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> (commonly nicknamed SNSP-staben).

The intention was to organize the new party in California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, the New England states, and others where his previous candidacy had proven to have experienced the most success. The party was also eligible for $5.8 million in Federal election funds, but its qualification depended on it being on the ballot in at least ten states; however, it remained unclear if National Unity could actually obtain the funds, or if it needed to be Anderson himself.|$|E

It still hosts mass rallies during political campaigns and the headquarters of the <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party.</b> In the middle of the square stands the Venetian Column, known simply as [...] "the Obelisk" [...] ("Dikiltaş") to the locals and symbolic of the country's government. The column was brought from the ancient city of Salamis by the Venetians in 1550. The coats of arms of six Italian noble families still remains {{at the bottom of the}} column, even though the statue of the lion on it has been replaced with a copper ball.

The candidates that emerged [...] "joyful" [...] from the first round were, according to the newspaper, Akıncı and Özersay. Özersay's high share of votes was especially pointed out as a surprise, given his lack of political history. It was commented that the discontented supporters of the <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> <b>Party</b> (UBP) and Democratic Party (DP) had supported Özersay. The ruling Republican Turkish Party (CTP) was reported to be [...] "in shock" [...] over the failure of their candidate to progress to the second round. The newspaper reported claims that Siber had been the victim of an internal struggle within the party, and that many CTP voters had supported Akıncı. As Eroğlu's votes had seen a great decline from 2010, the results reportedly caused great turmoil and controversy within the UBP and the DP, as well as the CTP, which are the largest parties represented in the parliament. On 26 April, while voting, Prime Minister Yorgancıoğlu announced that the CTP congress to determine the leader of the party, scheduled to take place in October or November, could be rescheduled a few months earlier, and {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the congress.|$|E
