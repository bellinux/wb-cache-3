He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> yet of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet. Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{attended}} dancing academies {{and became}} {{well known for}} her self-styled interpretive dancing skills, traveling across Europe with Max Reinhardt in a show funded by Jewish producer Harry Sokal. Riefenstahl often made almost 700 Reichmarks for each performance and was so dedicated to dancing that she gave filmmaking <b>no</b> <b>thought.</b> She began to suffer a series of foot injuries that led to knee surgery that threatened her dancing career. It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ("The Mountain of Destiny"). She became inspired to go into movie making, and began visiting the cinema to see films and also attended film shows.|$|E
5|$|This {{was the end}} of {{the planned}} mobilisation; <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> had been given pre-war to mobilising the Militia, Yeomanry or Volunteers as formed units for foreign service. 43,000 reservists had been sent {{overseas}} with the regular forcesout of a total of 80,000with the remainder sent overseas as reinforcements and replacements over the first year of the war. The conventional system of posting reservists to their own regiment worked until April 1900, after which it became sometimes necessary to post reservists to different regiments due to heavy losses, and by September 1900 this system had broken down entirely, with the reserves entirely exhausted of men.|$|E

5|$|Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902– 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, {{along with}} his contemporaries John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, {{dominated}} the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had had <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> of a stage career until a production of Hamlet in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 200,112 half {{dollars in}} October 1920, with the excess above the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were shipped to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the profits {{to go to the}} tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, and there was <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. The recession of 1921 began soon after; sales dropped, {{and tens of thousands of}} both dates remained unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons learned}} during the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E

5|$|Welcome to Alflolol (Bienvenue sur Alflolol) brings Laureline's rebellious {{nature to}} the fore; unlike Valérian, {{she has not}} been born and raised by Galaxity and is {{prepared}} not only to question Galaxity's authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in Ambassador of the Shadows (L'Ambassadeur des Ombres), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Valérian and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to take to make ends meet, notably in The Living Weapons (Les Armes Vivantes).|$|E

25|$|An Oil sketch or oil {{study is}} an artwork made {{primarily}} in oil paint {{in preparation for}} a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or modelli, especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting.

Later they were produced as independent works, often with <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> of being expanded into a full-size painting.|$|E
25|$|According to biographer Juhani Suomi, Kekkonen gave <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> to resigning {{until his}} {{physical}} condition began to deteriorate in July 1981.

In April, Koivisto did what {{no one else had}} dared to during Kekkonen's presidency by stating that under the constitution, the prime minister and cabinet were responsible to Parliament, not to the President. He then refused to resign at Kekkonen's request. This is generally seen as the death-knell of the Kekkonen era.|$|E

The car was given the development name 'SM' and was intended chiefly as a styling exercise with essentially <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> given to fitment of mechanical components or to driver ergonomics. The car appeared at the 1972 British Motor Show as an engineless show car.|$|E

25|$|Henosis for Plotinus {{was defined}} in his {{works as a}} {{reversing}} of the ontological process of consciousness via meditation (in the Western mind to uncontemplate) toward <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> (Nous or demiurge) and no division (dyad) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an ascetic character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as immanent, with matter as essential to its being, having no true or transcendential character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical Idealism.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do.

Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} {{behavior}} change, {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual {{may or may not be}} aware of a problem but has <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E

25|$|Since every {{household}} {{was almost}} entirely self-sufficient, {{there was very}} little need for trade. Goods and services were exchanged, but a household's survival did not depend on it. In the course of bringing in various resources, it was natural that a given household would reap a windfall of a particular resource, be it a large harvest of apricots, wheat, or a large bison that was brought back by the hunters, etc. When a household found itself with a plentiful supply of a particular resource, it did not necessarily mean that the surplus would be traded in the modern sense of the word, but rather, the surplus would probably be given away to others in the community who could use whatever resource they had on hand, with <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> of reciprocation or direct realized return {{on the part of the}} gifters. This is the basis of a gift economy, which has been observed in many hunter-gatherer or subsistence farmer cultures, and that was most likely the same with the Cucuteni-Trypillia society, at least during the early period of the culture.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, {{she lost}} her mother, and, as her father had {{in the same year}} been elected member of the Provincial Parliament, necessitating his {{presence}} in Quebec for a considerable portion of the year, the family was, for the time being, broken up; and the above-mentioned uncle, Timothy, sent his son the long winter drive through Vermont and Canadian snowdrifts to bring this favored niece under his own roof. And here, and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, N. H. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family once more about him, in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. She joined him at that place, and in 1837 entered Oberlin College which had recently been established there, at first with <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> of taking a college course of study; but, as her perception of its advantages widened, she dropped her desultory work and, preparing herself in the languages, entered the class of 1844, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to do much of her studying at night. When she neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use of her eyes. In 1845, she received the degree of AB. in 1845.|$|E
25|$|At 5:30pm on 30 May 1940 a {{telephone}} request {{was made by}} the naval officer in charge at Margate that the Lord Southborough be launched and go across the channel to Dunkirk to help in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and the French Army. The lifeboat with her coxswain Edward Parker and her crew aboard headed off to Dunkirk, along with 18 other lifeboats which had been commandeered to help. The Margate crew were one of only three RNLI lifeboat crews used in the evacuation that were allowed to take their own lifeboat across. Many of the others were crewed by Navy ratings. Lord Southborough was second to arrive at the Dunkirk beaches, with the Ramsgate lifeboat Prudential (ON 697) arriving a little before. The two lifeboats spent their first hours on the beaches ferrying soldiers from the shore to larger ships in deeper water off shore. The Lord Southborough has been credited with having brought off 600 military personnel from the beaches of Dunkirk, but the true figure is thought to be far greater than this. 500 of these were conveyed from the beach at La Panne to the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Icarus. The Commanding Officer of the destroyer, Lieutenant Commander E. G. Roper, said of the Lord Southborough’s crew On behalf of every officer and man on this ship, I should like to express to you our unbound admiration for the magnificent behaviour of the crew of the lifeboat Lord Southborough…. The manner in which, with <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> of rest, they brought off load after load of soldiers under continuous shelling, bombing and aerial machine-gun fire will be an inspiration to us all as long as we live. We are proud to be the fellow countrymen of such men. The Lord Southborough’s Coxswain Edward Parker was one of the two lifeboat coxswains who were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their services at Dunkirk the other being Harold Knight coxswain of the Ramsgate Lifeboat.|$|E
