5|$|On April 23, 1926, {{she played}} the title role in a dramatization of Joan of Arc written by her father at Walter Hampden's theater. This {{adaptation}} and her performance were <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> received by critics. It was again produced in 1927, opening on April 12 and {{for a series of}} special morning and afternoon performances at the Edyth Totten Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five {{was adapted}} as an opera by {{composer}} Philip Glass with story-libretto by Lessing, and premiered in German in Heidelberg, Germany in May 1997. The United States premiere in English {{was performed in}} Chicago in June 2001. These productions were <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> received by theatre critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of extant bear {{species is}} shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Yu et al., 2007. The giant panda, followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. The relationships of the other species are <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> resolved, though the polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} is extensive. At least seven hippopotamus bones show unequivocal signs of butchery, suggesting that they survived until humans arrived on Madagascar. The evidence of humans butchering the hippos also suggests their extinction may have been, in part, due to humans. Despite the discovery of many fossils, the hippos of Madagascar are <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> studied, perhaps because researchers are interested {{in some of the}} more exotic megafauna of Madagascar, such as the giant lemurs and the elephant birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Patagosaurus is <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> known, with a 2003 {{revision}} by Oliver Rahut determining {{only a few}} jaws are certainly referrable to it, as opposed to nearly the entire skull. MPEF-PV 1670 shows what the morphology of the adult or subadult skull was like, while MACN CH 933 represents a juvenile individual. Based upon how broad, high and short the adult articulated mandibles of Patagosaurus are, its snout would have been short, high and broad as well, a typical feature of most sauropods.|$|E
5|$|Just Be Free is a demo album {{released}} by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera {{the opportunity to}} use a recording studio and presented her with demo music {{with the understanding that}} they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record and Just Be Free has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E

25|$|Mitochondrial {{translation}} is still <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> understood.
