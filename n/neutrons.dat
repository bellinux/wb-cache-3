5|$|Atoms of {{the same}} element have {{the same number of}} protons, called the atomic number. Within a single element, the number of <b>neutrons</b> may vary, {{determining}} the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and <b>neutrons</b> determine the nuclide. The number of <b>neutrons</b> relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.|$|E
5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion <b>neutrons</b> react {{with a blanket}} of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the <b>neutrons</b> causing fission are no longer {{available}} for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional <b>neutrons,</b> these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy <b>neutrons</b> will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, <b>neutrons</b> from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion <b>neutrons,</b> or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E
5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, <b>neutrons</b> are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these <b>neutrons</b> are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the <b>neutrons</b> are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of <b>neutrons</b> being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E

50|$|Free <b>neutron</b> beams are {{obtained}} from <b>neutron</b> sources by <b>neutron</b> transport. For access to intense <b>neutron</b> sources, researchers {{must go to}} a specialized <b>neutron</b> facility that operates a research reactor or a spallation source.|$|R
5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected {{into the}} environment about twice as many free <b>neutrons</b> as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 <b>neutrons,</b> {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured <b>neutrons</b> escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental <b>neutrons</b> are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the <b>neutrons</b> were captured by seawater in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium also {{releases}} <b>neutrons</b> under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded {{either by}} alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope {{is a key}} component of most radioisotope-powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free <b>neutrons.</b>|$|E

This process {{is referred to as}} <b>neutron</b> spectral adjustment since the preferred approach is to use measured data to adjust <b>neutron</b> spectra provided by <b>neutron</b> physics calculations. The input data consist of the reaction rates based on measured activities, an initial estimate of the <b>neutron</b> flux spectrum, <b>neutron</b> activation cross sections and their associated uncertainties (covariances), and relevant correction factors.

All three systems {{are based on}} <b>neutron</b> interactions with the inspected items and examining the resultant gamma rays to determine the elements being radiated. TNA uses thermal <b>neutron</b> capture to generate the gamma rays. FNA and PFNA use fast <b>neutron</b> scattering to generate the gamma rays. Additionally, PFNA uses a pulsed collimated <b>neutron</b> beam. With this, PFNA generates a three-dimensional elemental image of the inspected item.|$|R
5|$|By definition, any two atoms with an {{identical}} number of protons in their nuclei {{belong to the}} same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of <b>neutrons</b> are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no <b>neutrons</b> (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form, also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two <b>neutrons</b> (tritium) and more than two <b>neutrons.</b> The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson. All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible.|$|E
5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal <b>neutrons</b> that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three <b>neutrons</b> with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those <b>neutrons</b> causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The <b>neutrons</b> released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E
5|$|Each {{chemical}} element {{has a unique}} atomic number (Z) representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of <b>neutrons</b> among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six <b>neutrons</b> as well, but about one per cent have seven <b>neutrons,</b> and a very small fraction have eight <b>neutrons.</b> Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.|$|E

5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of <b>neutrons.</b> Protons and <b>neutrons</b> are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the <b>neutrons</b> have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation <b>neutrons.</b> Such <b>neutrons</b> can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated <b>neutrons</b> {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal <b>neutrons,</b> 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of <b>neutrons</b> in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing <b>neutrons</b> by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, <b>neutrons</b> scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E

5|$|Supernovae are {{the major}} source of {{elements}} heavier than nitrogen. These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of <b>neutrons</b> during the supernova's collapse for elements heavier than iron. Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron. Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of <b>neutrons</b> that occurs at high temperature and high density of <b>neutrons.</b> Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in <b>neutrons</b> and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium. The only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead.|$|E
