Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> their dependents given an allowance. To be closer to their husbands, women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E
5|$|This {{thumb is}} {{typically}} {{interpreted as a}} close-quarter stiletto-like weapon against predators, although it could also {{have been used to}} break into seeds and fruits, or against other Iguanodon. One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.|$|E
5|$|After their {{expulsion}} from Mecca, the Muslims fought the Meccan Quraysh at the Battle of Badr in 624, {{and at the}} Battle of Uhud in 625. Although the Muslims neither won <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> defeated at the Battle of Uhud, their military strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, {{he was unable to}} prevent the Meccan one.|$|E

5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research.

5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl was a {{powerful}} Cape Verde-type hurricane during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the eleventh named storm, eighth hurricane and sixth major hurricane of the 2004 season. Karl formed on September 16, originating from a strong tropical wave that emerged off Africa. It rapidly intensified, becoming a major hurricane on two occasions. Karl peaked as a strong Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on September 21 with 145mph (230km/h) winds. It weakened as it moved northward, becoming extratropical on September 24 in the north Atlantic and becoming absorbed by another system on September 28. The extratropical storm affected the Faroe Islands, but no damage was reported there, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> there any fatalities.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, {{a status}} quo {{agreement}} {{issued by the}} mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the Chacham Bashi. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, Edward Keith-Roach, acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. <b>Nor</b> <b>were</b> Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible modus vivendi had emerged and such screens had been put up {{from time to time}} when large numbers of people gathered to pray.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, {{chief of}} the Western Naval Command, said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship as she had become very {{difficult}} to maintain and no private bidders had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship.

5|$|The accident, {{along with}} other similar events, {{prompted}} the IAEA to re-evaluate {{the effectiveness of the}} radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head, none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> there written warnings in Thai. Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the {{beginning}} and end of the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting with the fact that the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E

5|$|The various Germanic {{states in}} the west all had coinages that imitated {{existing}} Roman and Byzantine forms. Gold continued to be minted {{until the end of}} the 7th century, when it was replaced by silver coins. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier, while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a penny. From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> gold except in Southern Europe. No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted.|$|E
5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} {{that came through}} the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E
5|$|Bath City F.C. is {{the major}} {{football}} team. Bath City gained promotion to the Conference Premier from the Conference South in 2010. Bath City F.C. play their games at Twerton Park. Until 2009 Team Bath F.C. operated as an affiliate to the University Athletics programme. In 2002, Team Bath became the first university team to enter the FA Cup in 120years, and advanced through four qualifying rounds to the first round proper. The university's team was established in 1999 while the city team has existed since before 1908 (when it entered the Western League). However, in 2009, the Football Conference ruled that Team Bath would not be eligible to gain promotion to a National division, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> they allowed to participate in Football Association cup competitions. This ruling led to {{the decision by the}} club to fold {{at the end of the}} 2008–09 Conference South competition. In their final season, Team Bath F.C. finished 11th in the league.|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} norm {{of reaction}} (<b>NoR)</b> <b>is</b> a graphical {{depiction of the}} phenotypic value of some trait of an individual genotype in a population as a function an environmental pa-rameter. NoRs thus depict the phenotypic plasticity of a trait. The topological properties of NoRs for sets of different geno-types {{can be used to}} infer the presence of (nonlinear) geno-type–environment interactions. Although it is clear that many <b>NoRs</b> <b>are</b> adaptive, it is not yet settled whether their evolu-tionary etiology should be explained by selection on the mean phenotypic trait values in different environments or whether there are specific genes conferring plasticity. If the second alternative <b>is</b> true, the <b>NoR</b> <b>is</b> itself an object of selec-tion. Generalized NoRs depict plasticity at the level of popula-tions or subspecies within a species, species within a genus, or taxa at higher levels. Historically, generalized <b>NoRs</b> have rou-tinely <b>been</b> drawn though rarely explicitly recognized as such. Such generalized <b>NoRs</b> can <b>be</b> used to make evolu-tionary inferences at higher taxonomic levels in a way analo-gous to how standard <b>NoRs</b> <b>are</b> used for microevolutionary inferences...|$|R
5|$|Blamey {{felt he had}} no choice, but his {{assumption}} of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, the commander of I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a {{lack of confidence in}} him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, after a series of disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier Arnold Potts of the 21st Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey. <b>Nor</b> <b>were</b> generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled Chester Wilmot's accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.|$|E
5|$|Centralized {{order and}} {{oversight}} among the revolt's armed participants {{was difficult to}} establish because of the diversity and independence of the rebel factions. A meeting of rebel leaders {{was held in the}} Ghouta village of Saqba on 26 November. Sa'id al-'As accused al-Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta, while al-Kharrat alleged that al-Shallash extorted the residents of al-Midan and the Ghouta town of Douma. The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities, increase recruitment of the Ghouta's inhabitants, coordinate military operations under a central command, and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies. The meeting also designated the area between the village of Zabdin and north of the Douma-Damascus road as being part of al-Kharrat's zone of operations. Despite his leading role in the rebels' military efforts, al-Kharrat {{was not included in the}} newly formed rebel leadership council, <b>nor</b> <b>were</b> any of al-Bakri's allies.
