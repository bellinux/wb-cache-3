40|$|Aim: Acinetobacter baumannii is an {{opportunistic}} nosocomial pathogen {{and one of}} {{the most}} important multidrug-resistant microorganisms in hospitals worldwide. A. baumannii most commonly causes ventilator-associated pneumonia and blood stream infections and mortality rates in these infections can reach 35 %. In this study, it was aimed to assess the frequency of Acinetobacter baumannii species which were considered to be causative agents of nosocomial infection and their resistance to antimicrobial agents between January 2009 and November 2014 in our hospital. Material and Method: The diagnosis of nosocomial A. baumannii infection was made according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Identification of the microorganisms isolated from the specimens of the patients and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of them were performed by using VITEK 2 ID-AST automated system. Susceptibilities of amikacin, ampicillin-sulbactam, gentamicin, tobramycin, <b>netilmycin,</b> imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, tigecycline, colistin and co-trimoxazole were investigated in the species. SPSS 19, 0 program was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 308 Acinetobacter species were isolated and these species were obtained more frequently from the clinical samples sent from the intensive care unit (92, 9 %) and deep tracheal aspirate samples (64, 6 %). When all of the species were evaluated, the most efficient antibiotics were determined to be colistin, tigecycline and <b>netilmycin.</b> The susceptibility rates for colistin, tigecycline and <b>netilmycin</b> were determined to be 92, 8 %, 85, 3 % and 82 %, respectively. These are followed by tobramycin with a susceptibility rate of 76, 4 %, gentamicin with a susceptibility rate of 47, 8 % and amikacin with a susceptibility rate of 46, 3 %. Discussion: In our study, colistin, tigecycline and <b>netilmycin</b> are the most effective antibiotics against Acinetobacter species and antimicrobial resistance is seen at a higher rate in the species. Therefore, we consider that it is important to examine its own antibiotic resistance profile by each hospital in order to guide clinician for the empirical treatment of serious infections which can be life-threatening especially like Acinetobacter infections...|$|E

40|$|Background: Peritonitis is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of peritoneal dialysis (PD). We studied the efficacy of imipenem / cilastatin monotherapy {{in the treatment of}} PD-related peritonitis. ◆ Methods: We performed an open-label, randomized control study comparing imipenem / cilastatin monotherapy (treatment group) versus cefazolin plus ceftazidime (control group) in the treatment of PD peritonitis. The result was further compared to a historic group treated with cefazolin plus <b>netilmycin.</b> Outcome measures were primary response rate at day 10 and complete cure rate. ◆ Results:We enrolled 51 patients in the treatment group, 51 in the control group, and identified 96 in the historic group. The primary response rate to the assigned antibiotics was 49. 0 %, 51. 0 %, and 49. 0 % for the treatment, control, and historic groups, respectively (p = 0. 97). The primary response rate allowing for change in antibiotic was 82. 4 %, 90. 2 %, and 82. 3 %, respectively, for the three groups (p = 0. 41). The complete cure rate was 72. 5 %, 80. 4 %, and 82. 3 %, respectively (p = 0. 60). Tenckhoff catheter removal was needed in 6 cases in the treatment group, 6 cases in the control group, and 13 cases in the historic group (p = 0. 90). ◆ Conclusions: We concluded that monotherapy of imipenem / cilastatin has similar efficacy compared to the two standard regimens of cefazolin plus ceftazidime or <b>netilmycin</b> in the treatment of PD peritonitis.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{osteomyelitis}} {{remains one}} of the common problems with the use of orthopaedic implants. Staphylococcus epidermidis is notorious for its biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices {{and is one of the}} most frequent pathogenic agents in chronic osteomyelitis. Cinnamon oil has been proven to be an effective antimicrobial agent against several bacteria, including S. epidermidis. The eradication of S. epidermidis and prevention of biofilm formation on medical devices are desirable outcomes. Objective: To study the antimicrobial effect of cinnamon oil coating on K-wire against S. epidermidis and to quantify the most effective concentration of cinnamon oil coating on the K-wire. Method: The cinnamon oil was divided in ten different concentrations, from 0. 002 % to 1 %, and subsequently applied to the Kirschner wire (K-wire). Its antimicrobial effect was determined by agar well diffusion method (MHA). Cinnamon oil coated K-wires were planted on S. epidermidis inoculated Muller-Hinton Agar (MHA) plate. The size of the zone of inhibition was recorded to the nearest mm, and this was compared to gentamycin, fosfomycin, vancomycin, <b>netilmycin.</b> Result: The cream based 1 % concentration cinnamon oil coating on K-wire showed the strongest antimicrobial effect on S. epidermidis inoculated MHA plate. This was evident especially in the fourth repetition, with an inhibition zone diameter (IZD) of 19 mm. In the 1 % concentration repetitions, the highest mean IZD of the 4 repetitions was 14 mm (intermediate according NCCLS). The mean IZD results demonstrate that cinnamon oil has 46. 3 % of the effectiveness of gentamycin, 49. 1 % of fosfomycin, 59. 6 % of vancomycin, and 43. 4 % of <b>netilmycin.</b> Conclusion: In this in-vitro study, cream based cinnamon oil coating on K-wire is effective against S. epidermidis, though less effective compared to gentamycin, fosfomycin, vancomycin and netilmyci...|$|E

40|$|This {{prospective}} {{case-control study}} was conducted from October 2003 to June 2007 to evaluate risk factors for multidrug resistance among extended-spectrum-b-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. (ESBL-EK) isolates in blood cultures. All adult patients (> 18 years old) whose blood cultures grew ESBL-EK {{during the study period}} were included. An ESBL-EK isolate was defined as MDR if it was resistant to at least one member of following two classes of antibiotics: aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, or <b>netilmycin)</b> and fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin). Case patients were those with a MDR ESBL-EK isolate, and control patients were those with a non-MDR ESBL-EK isolate. A total of 94 bloodstream infections, including 37 (39, 4 %) bloodstream infections with ESBL-producing E. coli and 57 (60, 6 %) with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae,in 86 patients were enrolled. Thirty episodes (31. 9 %) were due to MDR ESBL-EK. The only independent risk factor for MDR ESBL-EK was duration of hospitalization before bacteraemia (OR 3. 88; 95 % CI 1. 55 - 9. 71; p= 0. 004).

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the postsynaptic effects of aminoglycosides on contractions evoked by acetylcholine (ACh), KCl, electrical field stimulation (EFS) and Na(+) - and Ca(2 +) -free Ringer solution with 0. 2 mM Na 2 EDTA (NaFCaFR) in the isolated frog rectus abdominis. Neomycin inhibited contraction elicited by ACh, NaFCaFR, and EFS at the higher frequencies (8 and 10 Hz) but not those elicited by KCl and EFS at the lower frequencies (2, 3 and 5 Hz). D-tubocurarine inhibited ACh-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, drug reduced EFS-evoked contractions to a limited extent. Lower concentrations (10 (- 5), 5 x 10 (- 5), 10 (- 4), 2 x 10 (- 4) and 3 x 10 (- 4) M) but not higher concentrations (4 x 10 (- 4) and 5 x 10 (- 4) M) of methoxyverapamil exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibitory action on NaFCaFR-induced contractions. Similar inhibitions of {{the same type of}} contraction were displayed by aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, <b>netilmycin,</b> gentamycin and amikacin). These results suggest that in addition to their antagonistic action on nicotinic receptors in the frog rectus abdominis, aminoglycosides may exert stabilizing effects on some functional components contributing to contractions at the membrane. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in hospitalised patients. The prevalence of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains including resistance to Carbapenems has been an increasing cause of concern. Hence this study was undertaken to know the resistance pattern of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to various anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and also to detect Metallo β lactamase production in them. Methodology: Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from various clinical samples were tested. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out by Kirby- Bauer method according to CLSI guidelines and detection of Metallo-β-lactamase production was carried out by Imipenem EDTA combined disc method. Results: 125 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. The resistance pattern to various antibiotics were- Amikacin (18. 4 %), Gentamycin (63. 2 %), <b>Netilmycin</b> (32. 8 %), Ceftazidime (74. 4 %), Ciprofloxacin (60 %), Imipenem (21. 6 %), Piperacillin (54. 4 %), Piperacillin+tazobactum (45. 6 %), Polymyxin-B (20 %), Colistin (15. 2 %), Tobramycin (55. 2 %), Levofloxacin (41. 6 %), Carbenicillin (51. 2 %). 21. 6 % of the isolates were resistant to Imipenem and 6 out of 27 i. e 22. 2 % were positive for Metallo β lactamase production.

40|$|Introduction: The {{production}} of Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) {{is one of}} the resistance mechanisms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. There is not much Indian data on the prevalence of MBLs in burns and surgical wards. Materials and Methods: A total of 145 non-duplicate isolates of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species, isolated from pus/wound swabs and endotracheal secretions from burns and surgical wards, were tested for MBL production by modified ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) disc synergy and double disc synergy tests. Results: Prevalence of MBLs was 26. 9 % by both the above tests. All MBL-positive isolates were multidrug resistant. Only 6. 06 % (2 / 33) P. aeruginosa and 16. 67 % (1 / 06) Acinetobacter species were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and <b>netilmycin,</b> respectively. These patients had multiple risk factors like > 8 days hospital stay, catheterization, IV lines, previous antibiotic use, mechanical ventilation, etc. Graft application and surgical intervention were significant risk factors in MBL-positive patients. Overall mortality in MBL-positive patients was 34. 21 %. Conclusion: Emergence of MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species in this hospital is alarming, which reflect excessive use of carbapenems and at the same time, pose a therapeutic challenge to clinicians as well as to microbiologists. Therefore, a strict antibiotic policy and implementation of proper infection control practices {{will go a long way}} to prevent further spread of MBLs. Detection of MBLs should also become mandatory in all hospitals...|$|E
