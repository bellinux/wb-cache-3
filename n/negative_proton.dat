40|$|Information {{about the}} {{molecular}} biology of the uracil carrier of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is now available}} but its properties as a symport are unexplored. We have now studied its proton stoichiometry at pH 6. 5, 4. 8 and 4. 2, in a yeast strain overexpressing the symport and unable to metabolize uracil. After the depletion of cellular ATP, uracil uptake followed an approximately exponential time course to reach a plateau. Proton uptake was then indistinguishable from the basal rate shown in controls without added uracil. It was concluded that more than 87 % of the uracil flux through the system was coupled to symported protons. Because the basal rate was a significant {{fraction of the total}} rate of proton uptake at pH 4. 2 or 4. 8, the ratio of the proton and uracil flows could not be defined uniquely during the initial near-linear phase of uptake. However, the average rate of proton uptake during increasing time intervals up to 120 s was shown to be a linear function of the corresponding average rate of uracil uptake. This relationship, defining approx. 90 % of the eventual uracil uptake, was used to deduce the mean proton stoichiometry as approx. 3 at pH 4. 2, falling to near 2 at pH 6. 5.

40|$|Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) often {{possess a}} <b>negative</b> <b>proton</b> thermal anisotropy, Ap = T⊥,p/T ∥. p - 1 < 0 (T∥, T⊥: {{parallel}} and perpendicular temperatures, respectively) so that right-hand polarized electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (EICWs) may be amplified by a kinetic instability [Famigia et ai, 1998 a]. However, {{in view of}} the low proton beta of ICMEs, several physical parameters, besides Ap, need to be in the right range to excite this instability with significant growth rates. In this paper we present a parametric study of EICWs aimed at identifying those parameters which are most influential in fostering the emission of these waves in ICME scenarios. We analyze here the influence of: (1) thermal and suprathermal protons, (2) thermal alpha particles (αs), and (3) thermal electrons. We solve the dispersion relation of EICWs including protons, αs and electrons, all modeled with bi-Maxwellian distribution functions, and a minority population of suprathermal protons using a kappa function for the velocity component along the field. For physical regimes of ICMEs we find that the instability depends critically on the values of the following parameters: proton beta, proton thermal anisotropy, relative abundance of the suprathermal protons, α-to-proton relative abundance, α-to-proton temperature ratio, α particle thermal anisotropy, electron-to-proton temperature ratio, and thermal anisotropy of electrons. The effect of these parameters on the instability is either direct (when they increase the number of resonant particles) or indirect (when they decrease the phase speed of the wave so that more particles can resonate). Data surveys òn EICWs should take into account the whole set of parameters indicated here, since the expected level of wave excitation results from their combined action. The study may be useful in understanding the considerable level of magnetic fluctuations observed in interplanetary CMEs by the Wind spacecraft. Copyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.

The value of [ [...] . ] for the C-C distance between the cyclopropane and carbonyl groups suggests {{the presence of a}} fairly strong conjugative effect. II. Indirect proton hyperfine interactions in [pi]-electron radicals are first discussed in terms of a hypothetical C H fragment which holds one unpaired [pi]-electron and two [sigma]-C H bonding electrons. Molecular orbital theory and valence bond theory yield almost identical results for the unpaired electron density at the proton due to exchange coupling between the [pi]-electron and the [sigma]-electrons. The unpaired electron spin density at the proton tends to be antiparallel to the average spin of the [pi]-electrons, and this leads to a <b>negative</b> <b>proton</b> hyperfine coupling constant. This theory of indirect hyperfine interaction in the C H fragment is generalized to the case of polyatomic [pi]-election radical systems - e. g., large planar aromatic radicals. In making this generalization there is introduced an unpaired [pi]-electron spin density operator [ [...] . ], where N refers to carbon atom N. Molecular orbital theory without configuration interaction gives zero order spin densities [ [...] . ] which are either positive or zero. If [ [...] . ] is positive, the calculated proton N hyperfine coupling constant is negative, and negative paramagnetic proton nuclear resonance shifts are predicted in such cases. Certain aromatic radicals (e. g., odd-alternate aromatics) contain one or more carbon atoms [ [...] . ] for which the zero order spin density is exactly zero, [ [...] . ]. In such cases [pi]-[pi] configuration interaction gives rise to a first order density at atoms [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], which may be positive or negative, leading to negative or positive hyperfine couplings of the protons [ [...] . ]. A previously proposed linear relation between the hyperfine splitting due to proton N, [ [...] . ], and the unpaired spin density at N, [ [...] . ] is derived using molecular orbital theory without [pi]-[pi] configuration interaction, assuming the [sigma]-[pi] coupling to be first order. It is shown that even when the effects of [pi]-[pi] configuration interaction are included in the calculations, the above simple linear relation is still exact, provided the [pi]-[pi] configuration interaction is treated as a first order perturbation on the [pi]-part of the wave functions and one assumes the excitation energies of the [sigma]-[pi] excited states to be approximately the same...|$|E
40|$|In {{a set of}} 23, 000 cloud-chamber {{photographs}} taken {{in a study of}} penetrating showers, 134 examples of the decay of neutral V-particles, and 18 of the decay of charged V-particles, were observed. An analysis of the 152 examples leads to the following principal conclusions: (1) V-particles result from the impact of mesons and probably also of nucleons, upon nuclei. (2) V-particles are generally produced singly and not in pairs. (3) Two independent kinds of data, one based on measurements of angles and other purely spatial relationships, and the other based on measurements of momentum and specific ionization, lead to the conclusion that more than 80 percent of these neutral V-particles decayed by the production of a heavy positive and a light negative particle. The mass of the heavy positive particle in most instances was consistent with that of a proton, but in a few cases may have been somewhat less. The negative particle appeared most often to be a π-meson, although in a few cases a μ-meson was indicated. In about 7 percent of the cases, the positive particle was light and had a mass consistent with that of a π- or μ-meson. In these cases the mass of the negative particle was not well determined. So far, therefore, in these investigations, there is no direct evidence that a neutral V-particle decays into two π-mesons, or into a positive π-meson and a negatively charged proton, although a few cases may be so interpreted. (4) The data are consistent with the assumption of a two-body decay for a majority of the neutral V-particles, and therefore a rather extensive analysis is given based upon this assumption. (5) The energy release, or Q-value, of the decay of neutral V-particles was computed, on the assumption of a two-body decay, for those cases in which the production of a heavy positive particle was clearly indicated, and where momentum measurements were possible. On the assumption of a decay into a proton and a π- meson, the Q-values obtained ranged from 10 Mev to about 100 Mev. The great majority of cases however, may be described in terms of discrete Q-values at 35 ± 3 Mev, and 75 ± 5 Mev, although, of course, the data are consistent with distributions about these values. For the same set of cases, if the positive particle is assumed to be as light even as 1250 me, and/or the negative particle is assumed to be a μ-meson, the distribution of Q-values is not greatly changed, and the apparent necessity for at least two different Q-values remains. In those few cases mentioned in (3) above, in which the positive particle was light, and in which the mass of the negative particle was undetermined, the energy release, computed {{on the basis of a}} two-body decay, depends upon the assumed identity of the decay products, and is about 100 - 130 Mev for the assumption that two π-mesons are produced, about 50 - 80 Mev for a positive π-meson and a negative τ-meson, and about 30 - 80 Mev for a positive π-meson and a <b>negative</b> <b>proton.</b> (6) The rest mean lifetime of V 0 particles, which appear to yield protons and π [...] mesons as decay products, was found to be 1. 6 × 10 - 10 sec for 26 cases having Q-values greater than 50 Mev, and 2. 9 × 10 - 10 sec for 48 cases having Q-values less than 50 Mev, on the assumption of a two-body decay. In view of the rather poor statistics, the above two lifetimes are consistent with a single value, and lead to an average of 2. 5 ± 0. 7 × 10 - 10 sec. The above lifetimes are not appreciably changed if a multibody decay of the neutral V-particle is assumed. (7) The data are not adequate to distinguish conclusively between a two-body and a multi-body decay, and, therefore, a discussion is also given in terms of a variety of possible decay schemes of the neutral V-particle...|$|E

They cover production at small angles (30 - 210 mrad) and relatively large momenta up to 8 GeV/c as well as large angles (0. 35 - 2. 15 rad) and small momenta (0. 1 - 0. 8 GeV/c). These results are relevant for a detailed understanding of neutrino fluxes in accelerator neutrino experiments, better prediction of atmospheric neutrino fluxes, optimization of a future neutrino factory design and for improvement of hadronic generators widely used by the HEP community in the simulation of hadronic interactions.

40|$|The spin-dependent {{structure}} functions g 1 (x), g 2 (x), g WW 2 (x) and ¯g 2 (x) {{and their}} moments are {{studied in the}} CM bag model. The results show that (i) ∫ 1 0 g 2 (x) dx = 0, i. e. the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule holds, hence g 2 (x) must {{have at least one}} non-trivial zero besides x = 0 and x = 1. (ii) ∫ 1 0 x 2 g 2 (x) dx is <b>negative</b> for the <b>proton,</b> neutron and deuteron. (iii) ∫ 1 0 x 2 g 2 (x) dx is about one order of magnitude smaller than ∫ 1 0 x 2 g 1 (x) dx, hence the twist- 3 matrix element is approximately equal to the twist- 2 matrix element. The results are compared with most recent data and predictions from the MIT bag model, lattice QCD and QCD sum rules...|$|R
