40|$|The ever {{increasing}} complexity of disasters demands utilization {{of knowledge that}} exists outside domains traditionally used in disaster management. To be operationally useful, such knowledge must be extracted, combined with the information generated by the disaster itself, and transformed into actionable knowledge. The process is hampered by the existing, business-oriented approaches to KM, technical issues in access to relevant, multi-domain information/knowledge, and by the executive decision processes based predominantly on historical knowledge. Consequently, as shown by many recent incidents, the management of large scale (mega) disasters is often inefficient and exceedingly costly. The paper demonstrates that integration of modified Information and Knowledge management with the concepts of network-centric operations (NCO) and <b>network-enabled</b> <b>capabilities</b> (NEC), and with Boyd’s OODA Loop-based decision-making in unpredictable and dynamically changing environments may address some of these problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirement}} for enabling network centric warfare through the accommodation of <b>network-enabled</b> <b>capabilities,</b> promoted {{the use of}} service oriented architectures (SOA) within military networks. The initial response of the academic and industrial communities was to utilize standard enterprise SOA. The developed solutions were well adjusted to the strategic domain, where node and network constraints were minimal. Yet, experience gained from the battlefields of the last decade, has proven that the tactical domain imposes a set of unique constraints, that render such solutions inefficient for the tactical edge. The project TACTICS, supported by the European Defense Agency, focuses on the study and development of a SOA dedicated to tactical networks. In this paper we present the designed security service architecture, as developed in accordance to the requirements identified in our earlier studies. Each service is presented as an architectural element within the TACTICS TSI (Tactical Service Infrastructure), aiming to highlight the distinct functionalities of the security infrastructure towards the efficient enforcement of security controls at the tactical edge...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} in information and network technologies, more systems {{began to be}} connected to each other in a network environment and interoperability between them became a crucial requirement. In order to achieve this interoperability, systems should be adapted to more net-centric solutions where the information is shared, rather than stovepipe approaches where the information is for local use only. Although net-centric solutions require sharing the information among different systems in the enterprise, this information should be shared with the trusted parties only but not to every system in the network. Therefore there should be enterprise level security mechanisms which ensure that information is securely shared among the providers and consumers. This {{is one of the most}} important criteria to meet for the utilization of network enabled capability in a trusted manner. This paper will focus on the experiences of NC 3 A C 2 team from its <b>Network-Enabled</b> <b>Capability</b> (NEC) studies with the Integrated Command and Control (ICC) capability and will aim to share the lessons learned with the community especially related to the security issues.

This research outlines a methodology and provides a use case for employing modeling and simulation in the identification of significant factors for network-enabled capabilities. The effort explores the use of the U. S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center's Logistics Battle Command (LBC) model to examine the distribution of capabilities across an organizational structure. It leverages large, space-filling designs of experiments, in conjunction with high performance computing clusters, {{to assess the impact of}} Soldier-level, network-enabled capabilities on transportation terminal node operations within a sustainment base supporting a Joint Force. Further, this research coalesces experimental design and exploratory data analysis to examine 771 variants of the operational scenario. Three network structures are examined, namely, the Hierarchical, Star, and Hierarchical-Star topologies, to quantify the impacts of <b>network-enabled</b> <b>capability</b> on the velocity, reliability, and visibility measures of effectiveness. The results suggest that increasing network-enabled capabilities yields a significant return of investment over the current capabilities. The latter network topologies show that Soldiers performing terminal node cargo operations are better connected, and this leads to more responsive distribution systems. US Army (USA) author...|$|E
40|$|Effective and {{efficient}} cooperation within future military operations increasingly requires {{the sharing of}} information among coalition partners and other organisations, as envisioned by the NATO <b>Network-Enabled</b> <b>Capabilities</b> (NNEC) study. It is therefore necessary that military communication infrastructures can be interconnected to facilitate the information sharing. This information sharing requires {{a high level of}} assurance on the security of interconnections. However {{it is often difficult to}} identify the appropriate security requirements, due to the complexity as a result of the differences between the applicable security policies. The methodology aims to provide a structured approach to define the appropriate security requirements and enable the determination of a balanced set of security measures for an interconnection. By decomposing the interconnection on a conceptual level into smaller parts, compartments can be defined that address a subset of the entire complexity. Between all these compartments as well as the own and other domain Security Policy Enforcement Points (SPEPs) can be defined. The division into compartments is based on the classification level, security policy and operational responsibility for the information. By determining the threat significance, trust level and threats for each individual SPEP specific security requirements and assurance requirements can be defined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{international}} {{defense and}} security community is moving ahead at flank speed {{to realize the}} vision of Network Centric Warfare (NCW; aka <b>Network-Enabled</b> <b>Capability</b> (NEC) and etc). Extensive efforts are being put forth to define, design, and develop many of the technical components of such a capability, to include varieties of networked communications systems, various highly-capable military platforms, and “Service-Oriented Architectures ” for a broad-based enterprise service middleware capability. To varying degrees, the human factors/human engineering community has also engaged in broad studies of “sensemaking” and “shared awareness ” toward understanding some of the information-sharing and information-understanding paradigms put forward in the NCW literature. The tenets of Network Centric Warfare (NCW) intimately revolve about the performance of humans. Those tenets (Ref 1) are expressed as: “A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing in turn enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness. Shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization, and enhances sustainability and speed of command, ie enables new paradigms of C 2. These, in turn, dramatically increase mission effectiveness. ” This assertion {{is the heart of}} the “NCW Value Chain”—arguing that the ultimate payoff of a new environment that allows extensive information-sharing is in the new decision-making dynamics that result. The heart of this statement is in the term “force”, which implies the humans and agents of that force—it is the human/agent hybrid structure that shares information, collaborates, and self-synchronizes to achieve the hoped-for benefits. It is the human/agent team that is involved with and executing the “new paradigms of C 2 ” that NCW hopes to achieve. The new paradigms of C 2 however, will require considerable study to fully understand, since most characterizations of these paradigms depict them as reflecting the behavior of Complex Adaptive System...|$|E
