5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Warriors of Rock challenges one to four local or online players to use special instrument controllers based on guitar, bass, drums, and vocals to simulate the playing of rock music, matching <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> they scroll on-screen with specific actions of the controller to score points and successfully complete songs that are available on-disc, through imports of other Guitar Hero games, or purchasable as downloadable content. Players are awarded star ratings based on their performance; in Warriors of Rock, the typical limit of five stars can easily be surpassed through gameplay-changing powers possessed by the eight in-game characters when they are used. Players can opt to play songs on one of six difficulty levels, from Beginner to Expert (Expert+ on drums), that alter the number of notes and scrolling speed.|$|E
5|$|For the 40th {{anniversary of}} All Things Must Pass, EMI reissued the album in its {{original}} configuration, in a limited-edition box set of three vinyl LPs. Available via participating Record Store Day retailers, with each copy individually numbered, the release took place on 26 November 2010. In what Bergstrom <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> a contrast to the more aggressive marketing campaign run simultaneously by John Lennon's estate, to commemorate Lennon's 70th birthday, a digitally remastered 24-bit version of the album was made available for download from Harrison's official website. The reissue coincided with the Harrison estate's similarly low-key release of the Ravi Shankar–George Harrison box set Collaborations and East Meets West Music's reissue of Raga, the long-unavailable documentary on Shankar that Harrison had helped release through Apple Films in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by one, up to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero: Aerosmiths {{gameplay}} {{is structured}} similarly to the gameplay {{of the other}} games in the series, in which players use a guitar-shaped peripheral to simulate the playing of rock music, hitting fret buttons and strumming in time to <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> they scroll on the screen. The player's performance is tracked through each song; if the player does well they are given a score and a rating of up to five stars; if the player performs poorly, the song may end prematurely and the player will need to try the song again. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties that changes the number and speed of the notes that must be played.|$|E
5|$|In North America (Region 1), {{the series}} was {{released}} by Funimation Entertainment across six DVD volumes containing four episodes each, with English and Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles from September 26, 2006 through April 24, 2007. Similar to the release in Japan, each volume was made available in regular and limited edition versions. The regular editions have standard keep case covers, whereas the limited editions come in digipaks with slipcovers. The limited edition of each volume includes insert booklets and tarot cards that showcase original art and additional series information; the first volume's limited edition comes with a series box. Most of the volumes include cultural and historical <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> well. In November 13, 2007, {{the series was}} released in a complete box set, which includes tarot cards and four limited edition insert booklets. Six days later, Funimation began re-releasing the individual volumes {{as part of its}} value-priced Viridian Collection. On March 23, 2010, the entire series was released in a single Blu-ray collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency first issued during the Civil War. The government accepted these <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{is similar}} to {{previous}} titles in the series. The player hits <b>notes</b> <b>as</b> they scroll towards {{the bottom of the}} screen in time with music to maintain their performance and earn points. To hit notes using the guitar controller, the player hits the strum bar while holding down the corresponding colored fret buttons. If the player uses the standard controller instead of the guitar controller, the correct buttons need to be pressed, but the player is not required to strum. Notes can be sustained, during which the fret button is held until the note is complete, and they can also form two- to four-note chords. The game simulates hammer-ons and pull-offs for sections with a rapid series of notes, allowing the player to forgo strumming on specifically marked notes. Missing a note causes the performance meter to drop. When the meter drops too low, the player fails the song, represented in-game by the band being booed off the stage. A string of 10 consecutive correct notes earns a multiplier to increase the player's score, which can occur up to four times. Special sections, marked by starred notes, can be used to build Star Power. When the player has enough Star Power, they can activate it and further double the scoring multiplier either by tilting the guitar controller vertically or by pressing a specific button on the controller. While Star Power enabled, the performance meter increases more quickly when a correct note is hit, and missing notes have a decreased penalty. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock contains four difficulty levels: Easy, which uses three of the fret buttons; Medium, which makes use of four of the fret buttons; Hard, which uses all five fret buttons; and Expert, which adds no new fret buttons, but increases the number of notes and the general difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two <b>notes,</b> <b>as</b> in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E
