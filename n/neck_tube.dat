The reentrant design provides a long heat path, while the triangular truss structure provides high rigidity in the horizontal plane.

40|$|The {{flow field}} within a {{self-excited}} flexible tube was studied by employing flow visualization, velocity and pressure measurements. Under low positive tansmural pressures at the tube inlet (of {{the order of}} 50 mm H 2 O) the tube was set to an oscillatory motion, the initiation of which was due to a flow asymmetry. Namely, although initially the flow was separated {{from both sides of}} the formed divergent nozzle close to the tube outlet, at an arbitrary instant this became attached to one side, but stayed separated in the remaining part of the nozzle. When this flow asymmetry occurred, the walls approached each other and the <b>tube</b> <b>neck</b> formed there by started oscillating streamwise, setting the tube to an oscillatory motion. During the downstream motion of the <b>tube</b> <b>neck,</b> it was shrunk, causing a twofold increase of the local velocities compared to the inlet ones, which remained almost constant.

Plane strain conditions are assumed to prevail in the axial direction. The polymer {{is characterized by a}} finite strain elastic–viscoplastic constitutive relation and the calculations are carried out using a dynamic finite element program. Numerical results for neck development are illustrated and discussed for tubes of various thicknesses. The sensitivity to the wave number of the thickness imperfections is studied with a focus on comparing a long wave length imperfection and a short wave length imperfection. After some thinning down at the necks, the mode of deformation switches to neck propagation along the circumference of the tube. A case is shown in which the necks have propagated along the entire tube wall, so that network locking in the polymer results in high stiffness against further expansion of the tube. The rate dependence of the necking behavior gives noticeable differences in neck development for slow loading versus fast loading...|$|R

In {{the case of the}} dumbbell-shaped tube, two modes of oscillations exist, one being an antisymmetric mode and the other a symmetric one for pressure variations in the neck, while {{in the case of the}} Sondhauss tube, only a mode corresponding to the antisymmetric one exists due to the boundary condition at the open end. Marginal conditions are sought numerically, not only for the lowest branches of both modes, but also for second higher branches, but they are available only for the lowest branch of the antisymmetric mode. For the Sondhauss tube, marginal conditions are obtained by taking account of radiation into free space. Some discussions are provided in comparison with experiments...|$|R

The main objective is to contrast the effects of prescribing fluid pressure or volume flow rate, in conjunction with axial displacement, on the stress and strain histories experienced by the tube {{and the process of}} bulging. To this end, axisymmetric finite element simulations of free hydroforming (without external die contact) of aluminium alloy tubes are carried out. Hill’s normally anisotropic yield theory along with material properties determined in a previous experimental study [A. Kulkarni, P. Biswas, R. Narasimhan, A. Luo, T. Stoughton, R. Mishra, A. K.

It is found that while prescribed fluid pressure leads to highly non-proportional strain paths, specified fluid volume flow rate may result in almost proportional ones for the predominant portion of loading.

Organelle homeostasis involves dynamic molecular sorting mechanisms {{that are far}} from being understood. In contrast, equilibrium thermodynamics of membrane mixing and sorting, particularly the phase behavior of binary and ternary model membrane mixtures and its coupling to membrane mechanics, is relatively well characterized. Elucidating the continuous turnover of live cell membranes, however, calls for experimental and theoretical membrane models enabling manipulation and investigation of directional mass transport. Here we introduce the phenomenon of curvature-induced domain nucleation and growth in membrane mixtures with fluid phase coexistence. Membrane domains were consistently observed to nucleate precisely at the junction between a strongly curved cylindrical (tube) membrane and a pipette-aspirated giant unilamellar vesicle. This experimental geometry mimics intracellular sorting compartments, because they often show tubular-vesicular membrane regions. Nucleated domains at <b>tube</b> <b>necks</b> were observed to present diffusion barriers to the transport of lipids and proteins. We find that curvature-nucleated domains grow with characteristic parabolic time dependence that is strongly curvature-dependent.

Metal flow and stress state of those four kinds of method are investigated. For the infeed method without mandrel, the metal mainly flows radially at the sinking zone. At the sizing zone, the metal flows axially with small velocity. When a mandrel is used, the axial flow velocity at the sizing zone gets larger. For the recess method, the main deformation area is the forging zone. The metal mainly flows radially at the forging zone with large velocity. Experiments have been carried out.
