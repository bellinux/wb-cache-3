5000|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>gear</b> (equivalent): Most jurisdictions require {{automotive}} transmissions {{to have a}} <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> that decouples {{the engine}} and transmission. The HSD [...] "neutral gear" [...] is achieved by turning the electric motors off. Under this condition, the planetary gear is stationary (if the vehicle wheels are not turning); if the vehicle wheels are turning, the ring gear will rotate, causing the sun gear to rotate as well (the engine inertia will keep the carrier gear stationary unless the speed is high), while MG1 is free to rotate while the batteries do not charge. The owners manual warns that <b>Neutral</b> <b>gear</b> will eventually drain the battery, resulting in [...] "unnecessary" [...] engine power to recharge batteries; a discharged battery will render the vehicle inoperable.|$|E

40|$|<b>Geared</b> <b>neutral</b> {{transmissions}} {{still hold}} {{the promise of}} unparalleled transmission properties. The mechanism {{eliminates the need for}} a starting device and auxiliary clutches and gears for reverse. A very good launch feel without the use of a torque converter should be one of the main benefits. When combined with two clutches, resulting in a two-stage split-torque <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> transmission, the system can be augmented such that very high overdrive ratio's can be obtained, allowing low engine speeds at intermediate engine power levels to reduce fuel consumption. The mode shift can be carried out with a synchronised clutch. One of the main points of concern is the loading of the V-belt-type variator in and around the <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> point. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to address this issue in some de! tail, taking both slip and torque loss into account. Variator control and variator loading in and around the <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> point will be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Combining both {{launch and}} reverse drive {{functions}} with the ratio change {{function in a}} <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> continuously variable transmission (GN-CVT), thus making a launch device like a torque converter and a drive-neutral-reverse set obsolete, is attracting considerable attention. This paper covers modelling and simulation of a V-belt type <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> transmission {{in and around the}} <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> point. Due to the specific nature of the <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> state, conventional driveline simulation models are shown to be inadequate. Experimental results are presented allowing for a more detailed description of the functional properties of the V-belt type variator, especially those related to small amounts of slip between the belt and the pulleys. The measured data will be analyzed to obtain grey model fitting parameters, which allow the data to be used in a simulation program, based on a dynamic driveline model. It will be shown that with a GN-CVT stall and launch performance can be considerably better than that to be achieved with a driveline with torque converter...|$|R
5000|$|SM30 {{locomotives}} had {{two types}} of diesel engine mounted. Wola V-300 and 2DVSa-350 (from 1962) 12-cylinder engines had powers, respectively: [...] <b>Neutral</b> <b>gear</b> rotation is 600 rpm. and rated rev is 1500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The IGR, hub {{revolutions}} per sprocket {{revolution of}} the Speedhub, lies between 0.279 and 1.467 depending on the gear chosen. The Speedhub has a 526&thinsp;% range between the highest and lowest gear. Gear 11, with a ratio of 1.0, is called the <b>neutral</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 1965 the M-3x {{was made}} with the now common P-R-N-D-2-1 shift {{arrangement}} (Park, Reverse, <b>Neutral,</b> Drive, Second <b>gear,</b> First gear). AMC called this [...] "Shift-Command" [...] to differentiate it from the D2/D1 models, since either could be ordered in an AMC/Rambler automobile from 1965-1967.|$|R
50|$|In {{a gearbox}} with <b>neutral</b> between <b>gears,</b> a typical shift {{actually}} involves two gear changes, once into neutral, and {{again into the}} next gear. During any shift, disconnecting drive components via a clutch unloads the engine and transmission of the force from the opposing components. Using the clutch for each shift out of, and then into, each gear is double (de)clutching. Due {{to the absence of}} a neutral spacing, double clutching is ill-advised for sequential gear changes, as in a fully sequential gearbox such as a typical motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|A few cars, {{notably the}} Alfa Romeo Alfetta, Porsche 924, and Chevrolet Corvette (since 1997), sought a more even weight {{distribution}} between {{front and back}} by placing {{the weight of the}} transmission {{at the rear of the}} car, combined with the rear axle to form a transaxle. The clutch was mounted with the transaxle and so the propeller shaft rotated continuously with the engine, even when in <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> or declutched.|$|E
50|$|Both the Saubers of Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutiérrez {{had retired}} after Sutil {{experienced}} an electrical failure and Gutiérrez experienced a gearbox failure, preventing {{him from getting}} out of <b>neutral</b> <b>gear.</b> Ricciardo was having a good race until his third pit-stop, when he was released before his left-front tyre was correctly fastened. He then had to be pushed back into the pits. He then experienced the failure of his front wing, leading {{him to make the}} decision to retire.|$|E

50|$|Transmission {{can also}} be shifted from manual {{transmission}} to automatic transmission. However, the player still needs to shift from <b>neutral</b> to first <b>gear</b> even while in automatic transmission; like in most Formula One games. The maximum number of laps that can be attempted is five. The five-lap rules applies to practice, qualifying, {{in addition to the}} actual race itself.|$|R
5000|$|A Stop & Start {{system was}} {{previously}} {{seen in the}} 1980s, with the Volkswagen Polo [...] "Formel E" [...] and the Volkswagen Golf MKIII [...] "Ecomatic", although this was different in operation; in the Volkswagen system the engine stopped automatically when placed in <b>neutral.</b> Selecting a <b>gear</b> by moving the stick to the left (for first or reverse) activated the starter motor.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{most modern}} {{motorcycles}} use unsynchronized transmissions: their low gear inertias and higher strengths mean that forcing the gears to alter speed is not damaging, and the pedal operated selector on modern motorcycles, with no <b>neutral</b> position between <b>gears</b> (except, commonly, 1st and 2nd), is {{not conducive to}} having the long shift time of a synchronized gearbox. On bikes with a 1-N-2(-3-4...) transmission, it is necessary either to stop, slow down, or synchronize gear speeds by blipping the throttle when shifting from 2nd into 1st.|$|R
50|$|The first {{clockwork}} (spring-drive) {{and live}} steam locomotives ran until out of power, {{with no way}} for the operator to stop and restart the locomotive or vary its speed. The advent of electric trains, which appeared commercially in the 1890s, allowed control of the speed by varying the current or voltage. As trains began to be powered by transformers and rectifiers more sophisticated throttles appeared, and soon trains powered by AC contained mechanisms to change direction or go into <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> when the operator cycled the power. Trains powered by DC can change direction by reversing polarity.|$|E
50|$|The clutch-and-brake system, {{typical for}} lighter vehicles, was {{retained}} only for emergencies. Normally, steering depended on a double differential, Henschel's {{development of the}} British Merritt-Brown system first encountered in the Churchill tank. The vehicle had an eight-speed gearbox, and the steering offered two fixed radii of turns on each gear, thus the Tiger had sixteen different radii of turn. In first gear, at a speed of a few km/h, the minimal turning radius was 3.44 m. In <b>neutral</b> <b>gear,</b> the tracks could be turned in opposite directions, so the Tiger I pivoted in place. There was a steering wheel instead of either a tiller — or, as most tanks had at that time, twin braking levers — making the Tiger I's steering system easy to use, and ahead of its time.|$|E
50|$|The {{design team}} {{set out to}} create a 6 speed {{automatic}} that fits in the same space as a manual gearbox. It measures 358 mm in length and weighs 90 kg. Its combined use of a conventional 5-pinion planetary gearset and a compound Ravigneaux gearset makes it incredibly light and compact. This combination {{is known as a}} Lepelletier arrangement. The shifting of gears is managed by a sophisticated computer programme which oversees a clutch-to-clutch actuation. Gear changes are accomplished by one clutch engaging the instant the clutch from the previous gear disengages. The transmission control module (TCM) is located inside the transmission housing, instead of being located outside it. The advantage of this is to reduce external wiring as well as to provide a constant environment for TCM operation which encourages longevity. One aspect of the advanced nature of the electronics is at idle (along with required foot brake depression on e.g. Opel Astra), it automatically selects <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> to reduce internal temperatures and improve fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|Some {{transmissions}} do {{not allow}} the driver to arbitrarily select any gear. Instead, the driver may only ever select the next-lower or next-higher gear ratio. Sequential transmissions often incorporate a synchro-less dog-clutch engagement mechanism (instead of the synchromesh dog clutch common on H-pattern automotive transmissions), {{in which case the}} clutch is only necessary when selecting first or reverse <b>gear</b> from <b>neutral,</b> and most <b>gear</b> changes can be performed without the clutch. However, sequential shifting and synchro-less engagement are not inherently linked, though they often occur together due to the environment(s) in which these transmissions are used, such as racing cars and motorcycles.|$|R
25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} unsecured mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to <b>Neutral</b> (N) <b>gear</b> in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff. On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|R
5000|$|Most manual {{transmission}} two-wheelers use a sequential gearbox. Most modern motorcycles (except scooters) change gears (of which they increasingly have five or six) by foot lever. On a typical motorcycle either {{first or second}} gear can be directly selected from <b>neutral,</b> but higher <b>gears</b> may only be accessed in order - {{it is not possible}} to shift from second gear to fourth gear without shifting through third gear. A five-speed of this configuration would be known as [...] "one down, four up" [...] because of the placement of the gears with relation to neutral. Neutral is to be found [...] "half a click" [...] away from first and second gears, so shifting directly between the two gears can be made in a single movement.|$|R
50|$|Other {{odd work}} {{in the early years}} of the new company {{included}} in 1924 a 36-seat petrol-fuelled rail vehicle for the Derwent Valley Light Railway. It was based on two Ford Model T chassis fitted with flanged steel tyres and coupled back-to-back, this rail minibus or petrol multiple unit seated 18 in each carriage and was driven from one end only, the rearward-facing car running in <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> with the engine switched off. When worked coupled fuel consumption was stated to be 14.33 mpg and if one unit was run the even more efficient figure of 17.55 mpg was obtained. It wasn't enough to save passenger operations on the line from oblivion however and the units were exported in 1926 to the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDR) in the north-west of Ireland who converted them from standard gauge to 3 ft gauge, lowering the bodies in the process. The CDR thus became the first railway in Ireland to use internal combustion engines and by the time of closure ran all passenger services and a number of freights using Gardner-powered diesel units.|$|E
50|$|Gordon slowed on lap 239 with {{a broken}} fuel-pump and stalled on the backstretch. His {{teammate}} Terry Labonte pushed Gordon back to his pit stall. Johnson had a five-second lead by lap 242. The second round of green-flag pit stops commenced on lap 249 when Biffle made a pit stop for four tires and fuel, and Burton made a similar pit stop nine laps later. Stewart and Edwards avoided making contact while battling for second position on the 259th lap. Kahne spun while entering pit road and stalled after {{he ran out of}} fuel on lap 262; a caution was not needed. Johnson slowed to avoid a collision but missed entering pit road and was required to take another lap at racing speed. After taking his pit stop on the next lap, Johnson was observed exceeding the speed limit upon leaving pit road. After the pit stops, Stewart took over the lead. Stewart reduced his speed on the final lap as he ran out of fuel after leaving turn two; he placed his car into <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> and avoided the use of his brakes by lifting early. Second place driver Mears also ran out of fuel when he reached the final turn, which allowed Stewart to win the race. Martin finished third, Dale Jarrett took fourth, and Burton fifth. Edwards, Kyle Busch, Vickers, Bowyer and Earnhardt rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had a total of eleven cautions and twenty lead changes by thirteen different drivers. Johnson led five times for a total of 105 laps, more than any other competitor. Stewart led once for a total of five laps.|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the fuel}} {{consumption}} {{is a major}} issue in the vehicle industry. In this paper, it is done by formulatinga driving mission of a heavy-duty truck as an optimal control problem and solving it using dynamic programming. The vehicle model includes an engine and a gearbox with parameters based on measurements in test cells. The dynamic programming algorithm is solved by considering four specifictypes of transitions: transitions between the same gear, coastingin <b>neutral</b> <b>gear,</b> coasting with a gear engaged with no fuel injection and transitions involving gear changes. Simulations are performed on a driving cycle commonly used for testing distribution type of driving. In order {{to make sure that the}} truck does not deviate too much from a normal way of driving, restrictions on maximum and minimum allowed velocities are imposed based on statistics from real traffic data. The simulations show that 12. 7 % fuel can be saved without increasing the trip time by allowing the truck to engage <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> and make small deviations from the reference trajectory.

50|$|Operators of 18-wheelers, farm equipment, {{tractors}} and other heavy equipment learn to float the transmission {{in and out}} of gear, beginning with dis-engaging the clutch by pressing the clutch pedal only part way, enough to pull the transmission out of gear, re-engaging the clutch in <b>neutral</b> (between <b>gears</b> by letting the clutch pedal all the way back out) to let the engine revolutions decelerate enough for the idle sprockets to shift, and free gear shafts to slow their revolutions per minute (RPM), then dis-engage the clutch again (by pressing the clutch pedal only part way to the floor) a second time, and float the higher gear into engaging the drive coupling and flywheel and engaging the clutch plates. Professional operators of heavy equipment take extensive safety training before ever learning how to double-clutch. Once an operator is familiar with range, range selector, rpm, velocity, and torque of heavy equipment like an 18-wheeler, he can begin to anticipate when to shift gears. Operators become familiar with ranges of gears. They also learn not to leave their foot on the clutch while driving, because these types of transmissions use the clutch for some very different purposes. The depth the clutch is depressed to the floor will determine what the clutch will be doing as a synchronizing function.|$|R
5000|$|When Kiekhaefer Mercury's top-of-the-line, 80 {{horsepower}} (74 cubic inch) model [...] "Merc 800" [...] {{was introduced}} for 1960, direct reversing as standard equipment was optionally replaced by full forward, <b>neutral</b> and reverse <b>gear</b> shifting, as on Mercury's 2- and 4-cylinder models, and [...] "thru-hub" [...] exhaust was introduced. Previously, {{as with other}} outboard brands and Mercury's smaller models, exhaust exited from a chute {{at the rear of}} the cavitation plate above the propeller. Thru-hub exhaust was claimed to be more efficient by omitting the added drag of an exhaust chute, and using the low pressure area necessarily created by the gear housing and propeller moving through the water to assist in exhaust evacuation. Over the next several years, thru-hub exhaust became a standard feature of all Mercury models, and later was adopted near industry-wide for both outboards and stern-drives.|$|R
40|$|One way {{to predict}} {{and control the}} output torque of a <b>geared</b> <b>neutral</b> CVT {{is to use the}} {{relationship}} between slip in the variator and transmitted belt torque. This relationship {{is often referred to as}} the traction curve. For small slip values, the output torque increases almost linearly with slip. However, at approximately 2 % slip, the maximum output torque is reached. For larger slip values, the output torque shows even a decline. Hence, measuring the traction curve in open loop is not possible. Stability analysis shows that by modifying the plant with a nonlinear feedback control torque depending on the slip, a stable closed loop plant with two new defined inputs is obtained. An open loop input torque at this plant now uniquely defines the slip in the system. The primary shaft angular velocity is controlled using a robust stabilizing controller. This controller is tuned using measured frequency response functions at different slip value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract i A {{vehicular}} driveline {{consists of}} engine, clutch, transmission, shafts, and wheels, which {{are controlled by}} a driveline management system. Experiments and modeling using a heavy truck show that there are significant torsional resonances in the driveline. A linear model with a drive shaft flexibility is able to sufficiently explain the measured engine speed and wheel speed. Engine control for automatic gear shifting is an approach {{at the leading edge}} of technology. A critical step is the controlling of the engine such that the transmission transfers zero torque, whereafter <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> can be engaged. Driveline oscillations is a limiting factor in this system. A model of the transmission torque is developed and a state-feedback controller is used to drive this torque to zero. The result is a possibility to optimize the time needed for a gear shift. Furthermore, <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> can successfully be engaged also when facing load disturbances and initial driveline oscillations. Traditionally in diesel trucks, the engine speed is controlled by a system called RQV. This system has the desired property of a load dependent stationary error, and the undesired property of vehicle shuffle following a change in pedal position. A model based state-feedback controller is derived that actively reduces wheel speed oscillations. The performance and driveability is significantly improved, while maintaining the desired load characteristics for RQV control. In conclusion, the proposed strategies improve performance and driveability in both speed control and gear-shift control. Acknowledgment ii...|$|E
40|$|In many manual transmissions, {{conditions}} for the onset of vibro-impacts from an unloaded gear pair {{are more likely than}} from an engaged set. Although some of the general characteristics of <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> rattle are known, no specific analytical models are available in the literature that can explain interactions between unloaded and loaded gear pairs in the drive rattle mode. For the sake of illustration, a particular problem for a light duty truck is studied in this paper and dynamic interactions are investigated. Some experimental measurements are first presented to define the unloaded gear rattle problem. Linear and non-linear mathematical models of the driveline are developed to understand, quantify and control the rattle problem. Trends predicted by simulations are compared with those observed in experiments. The effects of various gear run-ups and vibratory drag torques are investigated...|$|E
40|$|Saving {{fuel for}} heavy trucks {{travelling}} {{on a highway}} is possible by using the vechicles' weight and the knowledge about the road topography ahead. This {{can be done by}} a Look Ahead Cruise Controller. Such a controller can calculate an optimal driving strategy for the road segment ahead. The Look Ahead Cruise Controller is mostly used on an undulating road with a lot of up-and downhill slopes. Then the controller could increase the vehicle speed before an uphill or select the <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> and let the vehicle roll in a downhill slope in order to save fuel. Particle and nitrogen oxides can have a harmful effect on humans and since these are created in the combustion process of an engine, it is important to limit their presence in the exhaust gas. Therefore the Euro VI legislations are now in effect. They limit the number of particles and amount of nitrogen oxides that can be released from the vehicle. In order to meet these legislation demands the exhaust gas needs to be cleaned. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) can be used to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides. In order for the reduction to work as efficient as possible the catalytic substrate needs to have a high temperature. When the engine of a vehicle is working on a low engine speed and with a low torque demand, the exhaust gas temperature becomes low. This typically occurs when the vehicle is travelling in a downhill slope, either by rolling on <b>neutral</b> <b>gear</b> or rolling using engine brake. Thus the catalytic substrate is cooled, causing the catalytic process to slow down. A common way to avoid this is to let the engine work in a warming mode. However, this mode uses more fuel in order to heat the exhaust gas. The aim of this thesis is {{to find out if the}} cooling of the SCR substrate could have an affect on the optimal driving strategy found by the Look Ahead Cruise Controller...|$|E
50|$|<b>Neutral</b> / No <b>gear</b> (N): This {{disengages}} all gear trains {{within the}} transmission, effectively disconnecting the transmission from the driven wheels, allowing {{the vehicle to}} coast freely under its own weight and gain momentum without the motive force from the engine. Coasting in idle down long grades (where law permits) should be avoided, though, with many transmission designs as the transmission's lubrication pump is commonly driven by the input (engine) side, which may not provide sufficient fluid flow at engine idle speed for high-speed travel. Similarly, emergency towing (with the driven wheels of the disabled and non-running vehicle on the ground) with an automatic transmission in neutral is not permitted by the manufacturer for many vehicles. Manufacturers understand emergency situations and list limitations of towing a vehicle in neutral (usually not to exceed 55 mph and 50 miles). This is the only other selection in which the vehicle's engine may be started.|$|R
5000|$|Mercury's first 6-cylinder engines {{featured}} [...] "direct reversing". Instead {{of a lower}} {{unit with}} forward, <b>neutral</b> and reverse <b>gears,</b> its lower units were more compact, with only drive and driven gears, and no submerged shift mechanism required. Reverse was selected by turning off the engine and restarting it in opposite rotation, and neutral by simply switching off.Mark 75s, like many of their smaller bretrhen, were available in an [...] "H" [...] (high speed) version. Many of these large H engines sported open headers for competition and produced 90 horsepower from 60 cubic inches.

The boats were stopped only for driver changes and standard maintenance. After the record setting run was completed, the motors were torn down and inspected for wear. They were found to be well within factory tolerances. The amazing distance has never been topped, even with modern advancements in outboard technology.|$|R
50|$|The first Tempo moped ever {{manufactured}} was the bicycle-like 1951 Tempo Handy. It {{looked like}} a bicycle, but where the pedals normally would be it carried a Sachs 49 cc, 1 hp engine with pedals and two gears, shifted with the left side twist grip. It had a three-litre gasoline tank and weighed around 28 kilograms. To start the moped, one put the engine in <b>neutral</b> (the start <b>gear)</b> and used the pedals as a kick starter. To pedal the bike, e.g. {{in the event of}} running out of petrol, the clutch lever was kept depressed by means of a small locking device and the transmission put in first or second gear. The engine was stopped by pressing a small switch that grounded the magneto. This moped sold well and was very cheap, but eventually more luxuries were needed and from 1957 Tempo made the rear suspensioned Comfort and Swing (same construction, the latter utilizing a swingarm front fork hence the name.) mopeds using the same engine before introducing the Corvette in 1960. Upgraded versions of the Sachs hand-shifted pedal engine had 1,6 hp and 3 gears.|$|R
