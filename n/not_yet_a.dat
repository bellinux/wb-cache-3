5|$|The Sugar Act {{provoked}} outrage in Boston, {{where it}} was widely viewed {{as a violation of}} colonial rights. Men such as James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, they could not be taxed by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 22, 1910. The drama film was sometimes labeled as a comedy by advertisers. The film had a wide national release and was shown in theaters in North Carolina, South Dakota, Washington, Kansas, Pennsylvania, California,. Though Hawaii was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> state, it was also shown as a new release in July 1912.|$|E
5|$|Although Oklahoma was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see {{its share of}} fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E
5|$|Hassan was {{originally}} interested in association football {{before deciding to}} take up track and field athletics. Despite a lack of training opportunities and facilities, she was {{given the opportunity to}} participate in the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics but, since South Sudan was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> member of the International Olympic Committee, she competed as an Individual Olympic Athlete. She took part in the 400 m, but did not win a medal. She also attended the 2016 African Championships in Athletics, where she was eliminated in the heats of the 200 m event. For the 2016 Summer Games, she was again entered in the women's 200 m, where she was placed in heat four. This heat contained eventual gold medal-winner Elaine Thompson of Jamaica, although it was won by the Ivory Coast's Marie-Josée Ta Lou. Hassan finished eighth and last, although she set a new personal best of 26.99.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. <b>Not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> Cabinet or Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does <b>not.</b> <b>Yet,</b> <b>a</b> number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

5|$|The National Basketball Association {{was still}} {{struggling}} in its 16th season, <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> major sports league and less established than college basketball. The league was hardly national, {{with only one}} team, the Los Angeles Lakers, west of St. Louis. The NBA received low television ratings, and this game was not televised. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) considered not renewing the league's television contract. No members from the New York press were present as reporters were in Florida covering spring training for the New York Yankees and the expansion New York Mets. With few in the media present, the Warriors' publicist was tasked this night with being the stringer for the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Only two photographers were at the game.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines {{by the end of}} 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E
