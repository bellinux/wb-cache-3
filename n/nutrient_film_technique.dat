40|$|The {{design of}} a {{controller}} for water supply and nutrient application in closed growing systems is presented and discussed with reference to <b>nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>techniques</b> in a 150 msuperscript 2 greenhouse. The 'robust design' method aims to distinguish between stability and performance and, in this case, the method deals with uncertainties in the model description of the real process, i. e. variability of flow and seasonal changes. Robust performance and robust stability, as qualities of the controlled process, were shown to be feasible for the control of nutrient application in closed growing systems. Algorithm performance was tested in a simulation procedure and shows very good disturbance suppression, staying well within the pre-set 10 % limits. More standard design procedures {{could lead to a}} stable controlled process but would certainly be more conservative than the robust controller presented...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of plants}} for bioregenerative life support for space {{missions}} was first studied by the US Air Force in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Extensive testing was also conducted from the 1960 s through the 1980 s by Russian researchers {{located at the}} Institute of Biophysics in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, and the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow. NASA initiated bioregenerative research in the 1960 s (e. g., Hydrogenomonas) but this research did not include testing with plants until about 1980, with {{the start of the}} Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) Program. The NASA CELSS research was carried out at universities, private corporations, and NASA field centers, including Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The project at KSC began in 1985 and was called the CELSS Breadboard Project to indicate the capability for plugging in and testing various life support technologies; this name has since been dropped but bioregenerative testing at KSC has continued to the present under the NASA s Advanced Life Support (ALS) Program. A primary objective of the KSC testing was to conduct pre-integration tests with plants (crops) in a large, atmospherically closed test chamber called the Biomass Production Chamber (BPC). Test protocols for the BPC were based on observations and growing procedures developed by university investigators, as well as procedures developed in plant growth chamber studies at KSC. Growth chamber studies to support BPC testing focused on plant responses to different carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations, different spectral qualities from various electric lamps, and <b>nutrient</b> <b>film</b> hydroponic culture <b>techniques...</b>|$|R
40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{attempts}} to denaturalize realist <b>filming</b> <b>techniques</b> {{in order to}} highlight how these techniques shaped and continue to shape racial and political power imbalances. Through examining how racism pervaded {{the foundations of the}} study of anthropology and anthropological filmmaking, I attempt to show how <b>filming</b> <b>techniques</b> produced meanings of race that were nurtured by white male centered ideas of the world. This thesis also demonstrates how realist <b>filming</b> <b>techniques</b> work to challenge racism by analyzing anti-war films about the Vietnam War. The anti-war films present powerful criticism against U. S. centered patriotic views of the Vietnam War and racism against the Vietnamese. While underlining these unique ideological interventions by realist <b>filming</b> <b>techniques,</b> this thesis {{attempts to}} suggest that the realist filmmaking techniques employed in these anti-war films function to perpetuate power imbalanced relationships between American and Vietnamese people even as they challenge racism against the Vietnamese. Lastly, this thesis examines some of the experimental films that attempt to disrupt the realist <b>filming</b> <b>techniques</b> that continue to perpetuate racial power imbalances. As a conclusion, this thesis emphasizes the fluidity of meanings created through filmmaking techniques. Even though white male centered ideas of race persists in realist <b>filming</b> <b>techniques,</b> this study shows that there are powerful visual and historical proofs that realist filmmaking techniques do in fact challenge dominant racial ideology. In sum, this thesis aims to unravel the ideological tendency behind realist <b>filming</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{disease-free}} {{environment that}} is unique to aeroponics, many plants can grow at higher density (plants per square meter) when compared to more traditional forms of cultivation (hydroponics, soil and <b>Nutrient</b> <b>Film</b> <b>Technique</b> NFT).

50|$|A {{greenhouse}} project classroom can be {{built as}} a traditional greenhouse or in a converted classroom to accommodate a hydroponic urban farm and environmental science laboratory. Grade school children grow food while engaging in hands-on learning about nutrition, water resource management, efficient land use, climate change, biodiversity, conservation, contamination, pollution, waste management, and sustainable development. To facilitate this hands-on learning environment, the Greenhouse Project classroom typically includes <b>Nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>technique</b> hydroponic growing systems, Dutch-Bucket systems, Vertical Integrated Growing systems, an aquaponics or fish farm tank, a Rainwater harvesting system, a vermi-composting corner, and a weather station.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of methods {{currently}} utilized (both in low gravity and on Earth) to deliver nutrients to plants. Substrate dependent methods include traditional soil cultivation, zeoponics, agar, and nutrient-loaded ion exchange resins. In addition to substrate dependent cultivation, many methods using no soil have been developed such as <b>nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>technique,</b> ebb and flow, aeroponics, and many other variants. Many hydroponic systems can provide high plant performance but nutrient solution throughput is high, necessitating large water volumes and substantial recycling of solutions, and the control of the solution in hypogravity conditions is difficult at best.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of hydroponic systems. If the {{nutrient}} solution floods the loose growing medium and recedes for aeration, this is an ebb and flow or flood and drain system. Systems that gradually drip solution onto the medium are drip systems. Systems that intermittently spray roots floating in air are called aeroponic systems. If aerated water runs down a channel lined with a film of rooting medium, this is a <b>nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>technique</b> system. A series of tubes intermittently running high flow nutrient solution into the tops of growing containers use a top feed system. Aquaponics, another growing method that is gaining popularity, employs the use of fish water and recirculates that water from the fish holding tank to the growing bed.|$|E

40|$|The {{survey was}} carried out in the Research Centre for the study of food {{products}} quality “HORTINVEST” between 2014 - 2015 using the <b>Nutrient</b> <b>Film</b> Technology (NFT) for the cultivation of lettuce. Three lettuce cultivars were used: Markies, Lollo bionda and Lollo rosa, together with three types of fertilizers: two organic fertilizers and a chemical one. Biometrical measurements on lettuce growth were conducted; also {{at the end of the}} cultivation cycle biochemical measurements were performed in order to assess plant quality. Also correlations between various biometrical parameters and influencing vegetal factors were settled. The results led towards gains in the plant growth rate, in the development of the leaf number and eventually in the production growth. For all lettuce varieties under research the total plant mass was higher due to organic fertilizers in comparison with plants under chemical fertilizer treatment. The plants organically fertilized proved to be superior as to the biochemical quality. Research {{was carried out}} in order to assess the quantitative and qualitative feedback of lettuce cultivated in <b>Nutrient</b> <b>Film</b> Technology (NFT) to various organic fertilizers which might replace chemical fertilizers...|$|R

5000|$|Hydroponics is {{a method}} for growing plants in a water-nutrient {{solution}} {{without the use of}} nutrient-rich soil. It allows researchers and home gardeners to grow their plants in a controlled environment. The most common solution is the Hoagland solution, developed by D. R. Hoagland in 1933. The solution consists of all the essential nutrients in the correct proportions necessary for most plant growth. An aerator is used to prevent an anoxic event or hypoxia. Hypoxia can affect nutrient uptake of a plant because, without oxygen present, respiration becomes inhibited within the root cells. The <b>nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>technique</b> is a hydroponic technique in which the roots are not fully submerged. This allows for adequate aeration of the roots, while a [...] "film" [...] thin layer of nutrient-rich water is pumped through the system to provide nutrients and water to the plant.|$|E
5000|$|String Greenhouse (formerly the Production Greenhouse) - This {{greenhouse}} {{focuses on}} innovative high-density techniques, such as <b>Nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>technique.</b> It also shows off [...] "vertical growing techniques", in which plants are grown on specialized trellises which cause the herbaceous plants to approximate {{the shape and}} structure of trees. One {{of the most famous}} examples of these trees is The Land's [...] "tomato tree", which produced over 32,000 tomatoes in a 16-month period. It was recognized by Guinness World Records as both the largest and most productive tomato plant in the world. Other crops include eggplant, peppers, winged bean, lettuce and snake gourd. Furthermore, cucumbers and pumpkins are grown in the shape of Mickey Mouse through the use of special molds. Much of the produce grown in the String Greenhouse is used in The Garden Grill and Sunshine Seasons, both restaurants in The Land pavilion. In total, over 30 tons of produce are harvested from The Land each year.|$|E
50|$|In continuous-flow {{solution}} culture, {{the nutrient}} solution constantly flows past the roots. It {{is much easier}} to automate than the static solution culture because sampling and adjustments to the temperature and nutrient concentrations can be made in a large storage tank that has potential to serve thousands of plants. A popular variation is the <b>nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>technique</b> or NFT, whereby a very shallow stream of water containing all the dissolved nutrients required for plant growth is recirculated past the bare roots of plants in a watertight thick root mat, which develops {{in the bottom of the}} channel and has an upper surface that, although moist, is in the air. Subsequent to this, an abundant supply of oxygen is provided to the roots of the plants. A properly designed NFT system is based on using the right channel slope, the right flow rate, and the right channel length. The main advantage of the NFT system over other forms of hydroponics is that the plant roots are exposed to adequate supplies of water, oxygen, and nutrients. In all other forms of production, there is a conflict between the supply of these requirements, since excessive or deficient amounts of one results in an imbalance of one or both of the others. NFT, because of its design, provides a system where all three requirements for healthy plant growth can be met at the same time, provided that the simple concept of NFT is always remembered and practised. The result of these advantages is that higher yields of high-quality produce are obtained over an extended period of cropping. A downside of NFT is that it has very little buffering against interruptions in the flow (e.g. power outages). But, overall, it is probably one of the more productive techniques.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nutrient</b> <b>film</b> <b>{{technique}}</b> (NFT) is a hydroponic technique wherein a very shallow {{stream of}} water containing all the dissolved nutrients required for plant growth is re-circulated past the bare roots of plants in a watertight gully, also known as channels. NFT {{was developed in the}} mid 1960s in England by Dr. Alen Cooper. In an ideal system, the depth of the recirculating stream should be very shallow, little more than a film of water, hence the name 'nutrient film'.
