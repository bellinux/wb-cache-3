In all population groups the bifurcated needle technique produced substantial tuberculin sensitivity, which however was significantly inferior to that following intradermal injection.

Under the present circumstances vaccination by bifurcated needle would probably be more expensive than intradermal vaccination...|$|R

The {{results indicate that the}} bifurcated needle technique is superior to the rotary lancet technique <b>for</b> both primary <b>vaccination</b> and revaccination, the percentage of major reactions in revaccinations in which the bifurcated needle technique was used being significantly higher, irrespective of the vaccine dilution. However, the proportion of major reactions decreased gradually in both techniques with the greater dilution of the vaccine...|$|R

40|$|The Pan American Health Organization {{recently}} developed a practical guide for evaluating missed opportunities <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> among children aged < 520 years.

5000|$|Eric's mother, Kitty, {{typically}} supports Eric {{against the}} wishes {{of her husband and}} she often scolds Red for being too hard on him. However, she also does not consider Eric to be a man and often refers to him as her [...] "precious little baby boy." [...] Eric appreciates his mom's support but her overblown displays of affection often leave him feeling embarrassed. At times, Kitty's love for Eric borders on Hitchcockian. His mother is often insecure about being replaced by Donna as the woman in Eric's life. Their rivalry is played up in many episodes (often comically, but sometimes to the point of it being problematic). In theory, she's okay with a sexual relationship between Donna and Eric (even pressing the two to discuss it with her); however, in reality, she goes into a depression after learning that Eric and Donna had sex and considers Donna a harlot who has stolen her baby boy away from her. Eric reassured Kitty that he would always need her because, [...] "Red's going to be riding his ass {{for the rest of his}} life". When Eric tells his parents about his plan to spend a year teaching in Africa, his mother is less than thrilled. This is most notably and comically presented when, the morning after his announcement, Kitty fixes everyone at the breakfast table a smiley-face breakfast with eggs and bacon and then hands Eric a plain pancake and says, [...] "nothing smiling up at you, nothing". Even with a couple of days before his departure, Kitty reveals that she hid mailed notifications that Eric must receive certain vaccinations before he can leave. Eric protests his mom's actions but she still tries to dissuade him, stating that the <b>needles</b> used <b>for</b> the <b>vaccinations</b> are [...] "as big as sausages" [...] and [...] "will hurt a lot." ...|$|R

40|$|Background Inadequate {{levels of}} {{immunization}} against childhood diseases remain a significant {{public health problem}} in resource-poor areas of the globe. Nonetheless, the reasons <b>for</b> incomplete <b>vaccination</b> and non-uptake of immunization services are poorly understood. This study aimed at finding out the reasons for non-vaccination and the magnitude of missed opportunities <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> in children {{less than two years}} of age in a rural area in southern Mozambique. Methods Mothers of children under two years of age (N = 668) were interviewed in a cross-sectional study. The Road-to-Health card was utilized to check for completeness and correctness of vaccination schedule as well as for identifying the appropriate use of all available opportunities <b>for</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The chi-square test and the logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results We found that 28. 2 % of the children had not completed the vaccination program by two years of age, 25. 7 % had experienced a missed opportunity <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> and 14. 9 % were incorrectly vaccinated. Reasons <b>for</b> incomplete <b>vaccination</b> were associated with accessibility to the vaccination sites, no schooling of mothers and children born at home or outside Mozambique. Conclusion Efforts to increase vaccination coverage should take into account factors that contribute to the incomplete vaccination status of children. Missed opportunities <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> and incorrect vaccination need to be avoided in order to increase the vaccine coverage for those clients that reach the health facility, specially in those countries where health services do not have 100 % of coverage...|$|R
