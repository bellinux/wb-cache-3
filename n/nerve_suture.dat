40|$|In adults, {{the outcome}} of <b>nerve</b> <b>suture</b> and nerve {{autograft}} remains generally unsatisfactory. FK 506 (tacrolimus), an immunosuppressant drug used in transplantation, {{has been reported in}} animal studies to enhance nerve regeneration.

The present Phase II experiment investigated the tolerance to FK 506 after <b>nerve</b> <b>suture</b> or autograft, and the potential effects of the drug on axonal regeneration. Following strict criteria, five patients were included in this study. Within 7 days of nerve repair (median, ulnar and sciatic transections), patients received FK 506 (aiming for blood concentrations between 5 and 8 ng/ml) for a total duration of 60 days. The patients were carefully followed with clinical and biological monitoring in order to detect side-effects. A clinical and electrophysiological assessment of the effect of FK 506 on nerve regeneration was conducted. No undesirable side-effect was observed during or after FK 506 treatment, but one non-compliant patient discontinued treatment. There was no evident improvement of sensory, motor or functional recovery {{at the end of the}} follow-up period (average duration 39. 8 months), as compared to the expected clinical result without treatment.

40|$|Lesions of {{peripheral}} nerves, {{especially those}} serving important motor effectors and sensitive areas, {{such as those}} in the upper extremities, can be extremely crippling. Not surprisingly, surgical repair of such lesions has been attempted for many decades, but {{it was not possible to}} claim consistent succes until many lessons had been learned by trial and error. One of the more important facts emerging was that end-to-end sutures could only be expected to yield functional recovery if the anastomosis was not subjected to axial tension. Extreme measures, including extensive nerve mobilisation, re-routing, limb flexion, nerve stretching and even bone shortening were applied to facilitate <b>nerve</b> <b>suturing.</b> Using these measures, Seddon (1947, 1954) achieved success in 71 % of his cases and Woodhall and Beebe (1956) in 74. 8 % of their cases drawn from their Second World War Experience, although the anastomosis was not always free from tension. The cases described included a number in which the posttraumatic defect between the two ends of the nerves exceeded 20 centimeters. In such cases, end-to-end anastomosis without tension is out of the question and recovery is not always possible.

Study Design The relationship of USLS sutures to the ureters, rectal lumen, and sidewall neurovascular structures was examined in 15 unembalmed female cadavers. Results: The mean distance of the proximal sutures to the ureters and rectal lumen was 14 mm (range, 0 - 33) and 10 mm (range, 0 - 33), respectively. The mean distance of the distal sutures to the ureters was 14 mm (range, 4 - 33) and to the rectal lumen 13 mm (range, 3 - 23).

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} in adult dogs {{in order to}} study our reported observation of normal nerve fibres in the intermediate and distal segments of nerves completely separated from the proximal stump {{for more than six}} months.

It seems, therefore, that these fibres of normal appearance must have arisen from a source other than the proximal ulnar nerve stump, neighbour nerves or "Nervi-vasorum".

Study Design: Prospective case series. Methods: Functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) was performed during lip and tongue movement using a block or an event-related design. Results: Despite the presence of some intersubject variability, the following general brain activation patterns were revealed: As expected, lip movements after FNIG led to selective brain activation in the original facial motor cortex, and lip movements after HFA were associated with activation in the hypoglossal motor cortex. Following HFJA, lip movements resulted in overlapping activation encompassing both the original facial and the hypoglossal motor cortex, but tongue movements led solely to strong activation within the original hypoglossal motor cortex. In contrast, tongue movements after HFA were associated with strong activation in the original hypoglossal motor cortex and weaker activation in the facial motor cortex. Conclusions: Direct facial nerve repair (FNIG) leads to restoration of the original cortical activation.

The research in this topic has been growing ever since and numerous nerve repair techniques have evolved throughout the years. Due to our greater understanding of nerve injuries and repair we now distinguish between central and peripheral nervous system. In this review, we have chosen to concentrate on peripheral nerve injuries and in particular those involving the hand. There are no reviews bringing together and summarizing the latest research evidence concerning the most up-to-date techniques used to improve hand function. Therefore, by identifying and evaluating all the published literature in this field, we have summarized all the available information about the advances in peripheral nerve techniques used to improve hand function.

Electrophysiological nd morphological evaluation was carried out 40 weeks after operation. Despite lengthening the graft, and having four anastomoses instead of two, this manoeuvre enhanced nerve regeneration over each gap studied and for the 1. 5 cm gaps compared favourably with perfect match nerve autografts. In addition, a number of grafts were examined at 7 and 14 days by S l 00 immunohistochemistry. Schwann cell migration was seen to proceed both proximally and distally from the intermediate segment at a rate similar to that from the distal stump. It is concluded that sandwich grafts may prove to be effective alternatives to cutaneous nerve grafts for peripheral nerve reconstruction.

The initial delay period was reduced to 0. 87 days as compared to 2. 31 days for nerves repaired immediately (controls). The seven day and ten day delayed repair had similar effects but they also showed a decrease of the regeneration rate. The regeneration rate was not affected except for these two time points.

40|$|The {{grasping}} {{functions of}} a hand are dependent, not only upon mobility and strength, {{but also on the}} ability of the fingers to feel what they are holding, how they are holding it and how strongly they are holding it.

40|$|Multiple {{secondary}} grafting procedures may {{be necessary}} in cases of complete or partial amputation of the lower limb if {{the aim is to}} preserve the initial limb length. The traditional concept of staged reconstruction often leads to a prolonged hospitalisation and a high complication rate, especially in cases with segmental nerve defects of more than one major nerve and severe skin loss. To minimize multiple secondary operations of soft tissue and bone, we have developed the concept of primary shortening with secondary limb lengthening. We perform a primary shortening of the amputation stump and the severed limb at the time of replantation, in order minimize the skin defect and to undertake a primary wound closure and/or primary <b>nerve</b> <b>suture.</b> Six to 12 months after replantation, secondary limb lengthening is started, using an external or internal distraction device.

In the present study we reported the results obtained eighteen months after transplantation. PATIENT AND METHODS: The recipient was a 33 -year old man suffering from a traumatic amputation of both hands in 1996. Surgery included procurement of the upper extremities from a 18 -year old multiorgan cadaveric donor, preparation of the graft and recipient's stumps, transplantation of the hands, which included bone fixation, arterial and venous anastomoses, <b>nerve</b> <b>suture,</b> joining of tendons and muscles, and skin closure. Immunosuppressive protocol included tacrolimus, prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil. An intensive rehabilitation program was performed.

RESULTS: No surgical complications, infectious complications and graft-versus-host-disease occurred. Two episodes of acute skin rejection were demonstrated and they were completely reversed increasing steroid dose. Nerve regeneration and cortical reorganization were shown.

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of suturable platelet-rich plasma (PRP) membrane to promote peripheral nerve regeneration after neurotmesis and neurorraphy. Methods A total of 36 rats were used: 32 animals underwent surgery and were split in two groups. An interim sacrifice was performed at 6 weeks postsurgery and final sacrifice at 12 weeks; four animals did not sustain nerve injury and served as control. Clinical, electromyographic (EMG), gross, and histological changes were assessed. The EMG signal was evaluated for its amplitude and frequency spectrum. Number of regenerating fibers, their diameter, and myelin thickness were histologically analyzed. Results Both EMG parameters showed a significant (p < 0. 05) effect of treatment at 6 and 12 weeks postsurgery. At 6 weeks, the fiber density was statistically different between treated and untreated animals with a higher observed density in treated nerves. No difference in fiber density was observed at 12 weeks postsurgery. The distribution of fiber diameters showed an effect at 12 weeks when only the sections of the <b>nerves</b> <b>sutured</b> with PRP showed fibers with diameters greater than 6 μm. Discussion Our data show that the application of a PRP fibrin membrane around the neurorraphy improves the nerve regeneration process in a rat sciatic nerve model.

Whether expression of IAPP is altered by nerve injury with or without regeneration was investigated in adult rats subjected to unilateral sciatic axotomy; IAPP and CGRP expression were determined by quantitative in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry at days 3, 10 and 30 after axotomy. In ipsilateral L 4 -L 5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG), the percentages of nerve cell profiles labelled for IAPP and CGRP mRNA were reduced at all time points studied.

For Group 2, a simple neurorraphy was performed. For Group 3, a 4 mm long graft was employed and Group 4 served as control. Ninety days after, reoperation, latency of motor action potentials recording and axonal counts were performed. Inter-group comparison was done by means of ANOVA and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: The mean motor latency for the simple suture (2. 27 ± 0. 77 ms) was lower than for the other two surgical groups, but lower than among controls (1. 69 ± 0. 56 ms). Similar values were founding in both group 1 (2. 66 ± 0. 71 ms) and group 3 (2. 64 ± 0. 6 ms). When fibers diameters were compared a significant difference was identified between groups 2 and 3 (p= 0. 048). Conclusion: Good results can be obtained when suturing a nerve employ with epineural anchoring stitches. However, more studies are needed before extrapolating results to human nerve sutures.

40|$|The {{most common}} causes for {{surgical}} procedures involving peripheral nerves are injuries and carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel decompression surgery consists in cutting the transverse carpal ligament thereby releasing the nerve entrapped by this ligament. Following the procedure, pain symptoms should subside immediately. If the patient complains about pain {{that does not}} subside with time, it is necessary to conduct a diagnostic process. Until recently, electrophysiological tests, which determine the ability to conduct impulses, have been the gold standard. In the recent years, however, ultrasound examinations with the use of high-frequency transducers, which precisely specify the cause of postoperative complications, have been used {{more and more often}} as the first choice examination. Such an examination also enables assessment of the adjacent tissues which may be the source of persisting symptoms. This facilitates designing proper treatment. In the case of posttraumatic changes in the nerves, the neurological status (the return of sensation and motor function of the muscles innervated by a given nerve trunk) depends on the time from the procedure since nerve tissue regenerates gradually. If the healing process is incorrect, “a neuroma-in-continuity” may form when the regenerate does not penetrate to the peripheral stump and forms a chaotic scar at the reconstruction level. An ultrasound examination enables assessment of the <b>nerve</b> <b>suturing</b> site in terms of nerve trunk continuity restoration, identification of neuromas and control of their growth. Moreover, it enables adhesions to be diagnosed. Based on the interview, clinical examination as well as neurophysiological and ultrasound examinations in posttraumatic or postoperative neuropathies, one can precisely plan the management, i. e. decide whether a wait-and-see attitude should be assumed or a surgical procedure should be conducted as soon as possible...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE Recovery from {{facial nerve}} transection is {{typically}} poor, but daily mechanical {{stimulation of the}} face in rats {{has been reported to}} remarkably enhance functional recovery after facial <b>nerve</b> transection and <b>suture</b> repair. This phenomenon needs additional investigation because of its important clinical implications. OBJECTIVE To determine whether automated mechanical stimulation of the whisker pad improves whisking recovery after facial nerve transection and repair in a rat model. DESIGN AND SETTING Sixty-one rats underwent unilateral facial <b>nerve</b> transection and <b>suture</b> repair and were randomized into 8 groups. Six groups received daily automated whisker or whisker pad mechanical stimulation including 0. 5 -, 1. 5 -, and 8. 0 -Hz patterns. Two control groups received restraint without stimulation. Treatment started on postoperative day 8, occurred 5 days per week, and lasted throughout 15 weeks of recovery. Whisking amplitude, velocity, and acceleration were quantified weekly for 15 weeks. INTERVENTIONS Unilateral facial <b>nerve</b> transection, <b>suture</b> repair, and, for 6 groups, daily automated whisker or whisker pad mechanical stimulation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quantification of whisking amplitude, velocity, and acceleration. RESULTS Rats receiving the low frequencies of stimulation of the whiskers or whisker pad did not demonstrate enhanced whisking recovery, and rats receiving stimulation at 8. 0 Hz showed significantly worse whisking recovery compared with controls and previously published groups receiving lower dose manual stimulation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although daily manual whisker pad stimulation has been shown to enhance whisking recovery, rats in this study did not demonstrate improved whisking recovery after automated mechanical stimulation across a wide range of driving frequencies. Moreover, faster stimulation (8. 0 Hz) was actually detrimental to recovery. Further work is needed to understand the relationship between stimulation patterns and the physiologic mechanisms underlying improved or worsened functional outcomes after facial nerve transection and repair.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Objective of {{this study}} was to analyze fifteen months after surgery the {{sensorimotor}} recovery of the first human double hand transplantation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: As for any organ transplantation the success of composite tissue allografts such as a double hand allograft depends on prevention of rejection and its functional recovery. METHODS: The recipient was a 33 -year-old man with bilateral amputation. Surgery included procurement of the upper extremities from a multiorgan cadaveric donor, preparation of the graft and recipient's stumps; then, bone fixation, arterial and venous anastomoses, <b>nerve</b> <b>sutures,</b> joining of tendons and muscles and skin closure. Rehabilitation program included physiotherapy, electrostimulation and occupational therapy. Immunosuppressive protocol included tacrolimus, prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil and, for induction, antithymocyte globulins and then CD 25 monoclonal antibody were added. Sensorimotor recovery tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were performed to assess functional return and cortical reorganization. All the results were classified according to Ipsen's classification. RESULTS: No surgical complications occurred. Two episodes of skin acute rejection characterized by maculopapular lesions were completely reversed increasing steroid dose within 10 days. By fifteen months the sensorimotor recovery was encouraging and the life quality improved. fMRI showed that cortical hand representation progressively shifted from lateral to medial region in the motor cortex. CONCLUSION: Even though at present this double hand allograft, treated using a conventional immunosuppression, allowed to obtain results at least as good as those achieved in replanted upper extremities, longer follow-up will be necessary to demonstrate the final functional restoration...|$|R
