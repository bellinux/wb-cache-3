5|$|A {{total of}} 95 {{percent of the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is rural. The remaining 5 percent is suburban or urban. Twenty-seven percent of the streams in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are near surface-mining operations and 73 percent are <b>not.</b> <b>Most</b> developed land tends to {{be located in the}} southern part of the watershed, while most undeveloped land is in the northern part of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches; many, if <b>not</b> <b>most,</b> {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Many, if <b>not</b> <b>most</b> Mauritians {{are unaware}} of the {{existence}} of such a graveyard in Mauritius. Each grave recalls the story of deportee life in an alien country, the result of mass deportation from Haifa by the British of refugees who escaped Nazi barbarity, only to find themselves in jail in a tiny British island colony where they died of disease instead of creating new lives for themselves in Palestine/Israel.|$|E
5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if <b>not</b> <b>most,</b> of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of finely divided beryllium (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where beryllium is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid beryllium metal does not carry the same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented. Workers handling finished beryllium pieces are routinely advised {{to handle them}} with gloves, both as a precaution and because many if <b>not</b> <b>most</b> applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as fingerprints.|$|E

5|$|So {{immigrants}} who had newly acquired land were not enfranchised as were <b>not</b> <b>most</b> {{of the rural}} ethnically Polish farmers, who still held land by way of lease or feudal fief only like serfs or vassals of their landlords, unlike Prussia proper where serfdom had been abolished in 1807 and 1810. Immigrant farmers from the Holy Roman Empire (such as the Bambrzy) or later from member states of the German Confederation, had usually remained free peasants, causing their stronger representation within the eight members elected by peasants, {{of a total of}} 48. With regard to ethnicity, most of the nobility representatives were Polish, peasantry representatives were balanced, and the townsfolk representatives were mostly German. The first sejm included 22 Poles and 26 Germans, and most of the subsequent elections produced an almost even split between the Poles and the Germans. A major issue of the Sejm was the abolition of serfdom, which would enlarge the number of Polish speaking landowners and after ten years allow their participation in Sejm elections.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{representatives of}} various ethnic {{minorities}} have enjoyed a successful political career in Iran. For example Ali Khamenei the current Supreme Leader is half Azeri and Ali Shamkhani the former defense minister is Arab. Many, if <b>not</b> <b>most,</b> {{members of the}} national cultural and political elite have mixed ethnic roots.

25|$|Not {{to be left}} out, the German {{areas to}} the west of the Rhine had already gone through a process of {{separation}} of church and state in line with a radical secularization after annexation by revolutionary and Napoleonic France in 1794.

25|$|Many, if <b>not</b> <b>most,</b> {{transitive}} and intransitive verbs {{share common}} roots, though their derivation is often unpredictable.
