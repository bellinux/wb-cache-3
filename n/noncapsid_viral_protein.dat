40|$|A poliovirus-specific RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} {{was isolated}} from a cytoplasmic extract of infected HeLa cells and {{was shown to}} copurify with a single virus-specific protein. The polymerase was isolated from cells labeled with [35 S]-methionine and was fractionated from other soluble cytoplasmic proteins by ammonium sulfate precipitation, phosphocellulose chromatography, gel filtration on Sephacryl S- 200, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite. The activity of the enzyme was measured by using either polyadenylic acid or poliovirion RNA as a template {{in the presence of}} an oligouridylic acid primer. A single virus-specific protein that had an apparent molecular weight of 63, 000 (p 63) was found to copurify with this activity. Host-coded proteins were present in reduced molar amounts relative to p 63. <b>Noncapsid</b> <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> 2 (NCVP 2) and other viral proteins were clearly separated from p 63 by gel filtration on Sephacryl S- 200. Polymerase activity coeluted from the column precisely with p 63. NCVP 2 was totally inactive as an RNA polymerase and did not stimulate the polymerase activity of p 63. The purified enzyme sedimented at about 4 S on a glycerol gradient and thus appeared to be a monomer of p 63. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the polymerase protein indicated that it had an isoelectric point of about 7. 5. Thus, the viral polypeptide, p 63, as defined by the above physical parameters, is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that can copy poliovirion RNA when oligouridylic acid is used as a primer...|$|E

40|$|Seventeen {{bacteriophage}} φ 29 proteins {{were detected}} in ultraviolet light-irradiated Bacillus subtilis by autoradiography of polyacrylamide slab gels. The appearance of φ 29 proteins occurred either before or concomitantly with viral DNA replication. <b>Viral</b> <b>proteins</b> detected {{early in the}} infectious cycle consisted of nine polypeptides ranging from 5, 200 daltons to 54, 000 daltons. Two of the early proteins were identified as, respectively, the major capsid protein and the protein comprising the filaments which extend {{from the head of}} the virus. Late φ 29 proteins were composed of eight polypeptides ranging from 14, 000 daltons to 95, 000 daltons. Only three late proteins were noncapsid proteins. Among the early proteins, six were synthesized at diminishing rates late in the infectious cycle. One of the early proteins (protein 12) lacked histidine, whereas two (proteins 10 and 15) lacked tryptophan. Among the 17 proteins detected, 10 were <b>viral</b> <b>noncapsid</b> <b>proteins.</b> The amount of viral genetic information required to code for the 17 proteins detected in these experiments (81 % of the potential genetic information of φ 29 DNA) compares favorably with the genetic information detected as mRNA in a previous report, 85 % of the potential information on the φ 29 chromosome...|$|R

40|$|Globally, over 170 {{million people}} (ca. 3 % of the World’s population) are {{infected}} with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which can cause serious liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, evolving into subsequent health problems. Driven {{by the need to}} detect the presence of HCV, as an essential factor in diagnostic medicine, the monitoring of <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> has been of great interest in developing simple and reliable HCV detection methods. Despite considerable advances in <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> detection as an HCV disease marker, the current enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based detection methods using antibody treatment have several drawbacks. To overcome this bottleneck, an RNA aptamer become to be emerged as an antibody substitute in the application of biosensor for detection of <b>viral</b> <b>protein.</b> In this study, we demonstrated a streptavidin-biotin conjugation method, namely, the RNA aptamer sensor system that can quantify <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> with detection level of 700 pg mL− 1 using a biotinylated RNA oligonucleotide on an Octet optical biosensor.

40|$|Early {{studies of}} HIV {{infection}} dynamics suggested that virus-producing HIV-infected cells {{had an average}} half-life of approximately 1 day. However, whether this average behavior is reflective {{of the dynamics of}} individual infected cells is unclear. Here, we use HIV-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) constructs and flow cytometry sorting to explore the dynamics of cell infection, <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production, and cell death in vitro. By following the numbers of productively infected cells expressing EGFP over time, we show that infected cell death slows down over time. Although infected cell death in vivo could be very different, our results suggest that the constant decay of cell numbers observed in vivo during antiretroviral treatment could reflect a balance of cell death and delayed <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production. We observe no correlation between <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production and death rate of productively infected cells, showing that <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production {{is not likely to be}} the sole determinant of the death of HIV-infected cells. Finally, we show that all observed features can be reproduced by a simple model in which infected cells have broad distributions of productive life spans, times to start <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production, and <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production rates. This broad spectrum of the level and timing of <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production provides new insights into the behavior and characteristics of HIV-infected cells...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} current anti-influenza weapons, vaccination and antiviral drugs, can be rapidly rendered fully ineffective {{thanks to the}} virus’s high mutational rate, which produces viruses exhibiting new antigenic properties and structural proteins insensitive to the drug’s mechanism of action. One attractive alternative is to develop drugs that modulate the activity of cellular systems either required for viral growth or able to neutralize viral growth. Here we demonstrate that the cellular SUMOylation system, a post-translational modification involving the conjugation of the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) to specific protein targets using a Ubiquitin-like enzymatic cascade, interacts closely with influenza virus during infection and therefore provides new targets {{for the development of}} anti-influenza therapeutics targeting cellular components. Briefly, in vitro SUMOylation assays performed using in vitro synthesized <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> demonstrated that most influenza <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> are readily SUMOylated in vitro and therefore constitute potential SUMO targets. Transfection experiments leading to the over-expression of specific <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> in {{the presence or absence of}} various recombinant DNA constructs designed to modulate the activity of the cellular SUMOylation system demonstrated that various <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> are also SUMOylated when over-expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, experiments performed using recombinant adenoviruses able to modulate the activity of the cellular SUMOylation system demonstrated the SUMOylation of specific <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> during influenza infection. Finally, this study characterizes the SUMOylation of the nonstuctural <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> NS 1 A, the best SUMO target of all the <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> produced during infection, explores some of the potential effects exerted by SUMOylation on the functions of this <b>viral</b> <b>protein,</b> and introduces the use of “artificial SUMO ligases” as an innovative method to increase the SUMOylation of specific targets in the cell and facilitate the characterization of the effects mediated by SUMOylation on protein function.
