40|$|This article {{examines}} young adult migration from <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>counties</b> to either different <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>counties</b> or to metropolitan areas. The {{results show that}} expected gains in initial earnings provide young entrants to the labor force with a marked incentive to migrate from their <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>counties</b> of origin. Initial earnings gains stem, in part, from higher returns to schooling in both metropolitan areas and other <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>counties.</b> The propensity to migrate is also sensitive to the costs of migration, which, in turn, are correlated with paternal education and the local presence of extended family.

5|$|Historically Bournemouth {{was part}} of Hampshire, with {{neighbouring}} Poole, just {{to the west of}} the border, in Dorset.
