5|$|As Japan {{began to}} re-establish itself diplomatically, the Hinomaru {{was used as}} a {{political}} weapon overseas. In a visit by the Emperor Hirohito and the Empress Kōjun to the Netherlands, the Hinomaru was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that either he be sent home to Japan or tried for the deaths of Dutch prisoners of war during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a <b>new</b> <b>Status</b> of Forces Agreement being negotiated between U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the red flag of revolt.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its <b>new</b> <b>status,</b> environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

Their 2014 album, Foundations of Burden, was also awarded Best <b>New</b> Music <b>status</b> by Pitchfork.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the <b>new</b> <b>status</b> of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|Frederick II, {{ruler of}} the Holy Roman Empire in the 13th century, {{realised}} that his dynasty was losing its power and granted freedoms to many cities {{in order to keep}} their allegiance. These cities became Free imperial cities and Sélestat became one of them in 1217. Under the <b>new</b> <b>status</b> Sélestat was able to build city walls and collect taxes on its own. Its serfs and settlers were freed. The German monarch Adolf of Nassau granted Sélestat a constitution in 1292. It was amended many times but it regulated local politics until 1789. Although the <b>new</b> <b>status</b> favoured trade and prosperity, free cities in Alsace were afraid {{that they would not be}} defended by imperial forces if a conflict was to occur. So they decided to form an alliance called the Decapolis in 1354, which comprised ten cities: (Haguenau, Colmar, Wissembourg, Turckheim, Obernai, Kaysersberg, Rosheim, Munster, Sélestat and Mulhouse). The seat of the alliance was in Haguenau but its archives were kept in Sélestat. Because the town was the most centrally located, it often hosted meetings of the association.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitutional}} amendment gave autonomy {{to the city}} of Buenos Aires, allowing it to sanction local laws and elect its own mayor, who was previously appointed {{by the president of the}} nation. De la Rúa was the first mayor elected in this manner, defeating the previous mayor Jorge Domínguez. During his term of office he created or reformulated several institutions to fit the <b>new</b> <b>status</b> of the city, as required by the national constitution and the recently approved Constitution of Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|The stated {{reason for}} the move was a {{campaign}} promise of Kiribati President Teburoro Tito to eliminate the confusion of Kiribati straddling the Date Line and therefore being constantly in two different days. However, Kiribati officials were not reluctant to attempt {{to capitalize on the}} nation's <b>new</b> <b>status</b> as owners of the first land to see sunrise in 2000. Other Pacific nations, including Tonga and New Zealand's Chatham Islands, protested the move, objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see dawn in the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|English was the {{official}} language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use of}} the Malay language in Sarawak. In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an official language of Sarawak. This <b>new</b> <b>status</b> given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay. In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an official language.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his <b>new</b> <b>status,</b> the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the truth was that Montagu had already lost the use of one of his eyes in a tournament.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their <b>new</b> <b>status,</b> Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E
5|$|Fighting the Veleti {{from the}} {{beginning}} of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany. The alliance was natural at this point, because the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when Wichmann, this time leading forces of the Volinians, was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law Boleslaus, had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his Italian policies. This <b>new</b> <b>status</b> allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent bishopric. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older. The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with Margrave Hodo that followed in the Battle of Cedynia of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of Pomerania. Wolin however remained autonomous and pagan. Kołobrzeg, where a strong gord was built around 985, was probably the actual center of Piast power in Pomerania. Before, a Scandinavian colony in Bardy-Świelubie near Kołobrzeg functioned as the center of this area. The western part of Mieszko controlled Pomerania (the region referred to by Polish historians as Western Pomerania, roughly within the current Polish borders, as opposed to Gdańsk Pomerania or Pomerelia), which became independent of Poland during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005, when Poland was ruled by Mieszko's son Bolesław.|$|E
5|$|Under the magnates {{were the}} barons, who held {{increasingly}} nominal feudal tenures of which an important vestige {{was the right}} to hold baronial courts, which could deal with both matters of land ownership and interpersonal offences, including minor acts of violence. Also important were the local tenants-in-chief, who held legally held their land directly from the king and who by this period were often the major local landholders in an area. In this period, as feudal distinctions declined, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged {{to form a new}} identifiable group, the lairds. This group was roughly equivalent to the English gentlemen. Just as the magnates saw themselves as the king's natural counsellors, so the lairds advised and exerted influence over the dukes and earls. The lairds were often the most important individual in a local community. They ran baronial courts, acted as sheriffs-depute, sat on local assizes and were called in as private arbitrators. In the course of the sixteenth century they would acquire a role in national politics, gaining representation in Parliament and playing {{a major role in the}} Reformation crisis of 1560. As a result of the Reformation and the creation of a Presbyterian Kirk, their position in local society was enhanced. They often gained the <b>new</b> <b>status</b> of elder and greater oversight of the behaviour of the local population through the disciplinary functions of kirk sessions.|$|E
