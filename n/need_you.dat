5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t <b>need</b> <b>you</b> seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I <b>need</b> <b>you</b> to go to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E

"Fly Like a Bird" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, first released on February 13, 2006 by Island Records as the sixth single from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Written and produced by Carey and James [...] "Big Jim" [...] Wright, the song is influenced by Gospel, soul, and R music genres. Its arrangement is built on piano chords and guitar melodies, and features Carey's pastor Clarence Keaton, who recites two Biblical verses during the song's introduction and bridge. Carey described [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] as the most personal and religious track from The Emancipation of Mimi, with its lyrics featuring a veritable prayer to God: [...] "Fly like a bird, take to the sky, I <b>need</b> <b>you</b> now Lord, carry me high!".|$|E

500|$|Before late 1958, {{rather than}} unified pop and country singles charts, Billboard {{had as many}} as four charts for each, {{separately}} ranking records according to sales, jukebox play, jockey spins (i.e., airplay), and, in the case of pop, a general [...] "Top 100".
