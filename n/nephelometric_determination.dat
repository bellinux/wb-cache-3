40|$|Objective - To {{correlate}} {{blood pressure}} and inflammatory markers with urine albumin analysed with a point-of-care testing (POCT) instrument, <b>nephelometric</b> <b>determination</b> of albumin and creatinine related urine albumin in elderly males. Methods and Results - The study population consisted of 103 diabetic and 603 nondiabetic males (age 77 years) in a cross-sectional study in central Sweden. We analyzed urine albumin with a HemoCue® Urine Albumin POCT instrument and a ProSpec® nephelometer and creatinine related urine albumin. There were strong correlation between both systolic and diastolic {{blood pressure and}} all three urine albumin methods (p< 0. 0001). There were also significant correlations between the different urine albumin measurements and SAA, hsCRP and IL- 6. Conclusions - Hypertension has a strong impact on hyperfiltration in diabetic and nondiabetic elderly males...|$|E
40|$|Looks of beer is an {{important}} factor which is associated with high clarity. Clarity of beer is a basic precondition of its good marketability and consumer satisfaction. Beer filtration is ideal tool to create required optical properties. There is a high accent on this operation in brewery and minibrewery. The process of filtering removes unwanted haze-active substances in order to increase clarity and overall stability of beer. Objective method to expressing clarity of beer is <b>nephelometric</b> <b>determination</b> of turbidity, which is highly sensitive and achieved by reliable results directly in the units used to express the turbidity values in beer. The objective of our study was to measure haze before and after filtration in various types of beer with different length of lagering. Kieselguhr was used as filtration material. Haze of beer was measured by haze meter in determination under 2 angles and values were expressed in European Brewery Convention units directly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Microalbuminuria is {{associated}} with hypertension and is a strong risk factor for subsequent chronic disease, both renal and coronary heart disease (CHD), Presently there are several methods available for measurement of microalbuminuria. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate if the three different methods gave similar information or if one of the assays were superior to the others. Blood pressure, inflammatory markers and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity were correlated with urine albumin analysed with a point-of-care testing (POCT) instrument, <b>nephelometric</b> <b>determination</b> of albumin and albumin/creatinine ratio in elderly males. The study population consisted of 103 diabetic and 603 nondiabetic males (age 77 years) in a cross-sectional study. We analyzed urine albumin with a HemoCue ® Urine Albumin POCT instrument and a ProSpec ® nephelometer and albumin/creatinine ratio. There were strong correlations between both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and all three urine albumin methods (p < 0. 0001). There were also significant correlations between the different urine albumin measurements and serum amyloid A component, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin- 6. The three different urine albumin methods studied provided similar information in relation to cardiovascular disease. There was a strong correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure and microalbuminuria in both the whole study population and in nondiabetic males emphasizing the role of hypertension in glomerular damage. The good correlation between the studied urine albumin measurements show that all three methods can be used for monitoring urine albumin excretion...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the levels of}} alpha- 1 antitrypsin (AAT) {{and the presence of}} S and Z alleles in patients with chronic respiratory symptoms. Patients with chronic cough and dyspnea were submitted to clinical evaluation, pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography, <b>nephelometric</b> <b>determination</b> of AAT and determination of S and Z alleles by polymerase chain reaction. Smoking and AAT levels were considered the dependent variables. Of the 89 patients included in the study, 44 were female. The mean age was 51. 3 +/- 18. 2 years. The S and Z alleles were detected in 33. 3 % and 5. 7 %, respectively, and the gene frequency was 0. 16 and 0. 028, respectively. Two patients were SZ heterozygotes (AAT levels 141 mg/dL (normal, Group 2, n = 57). The frequency of smokers was the same in both groups, although tobacco intake was greater in Group 2. The S allele was present in 13 and 14 patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, whereas the Z allele was present in 2 and 1 patient in the same groups. There was no difference in the results of pulmonary function tests or in the frequency of bronchiectasis or emphysema between the two groups. Spirometric values and AAT levels were similar in smokers and nonsmokers. Bronchiectasis was more common in nonsmokers, and emphysema was more common in smokers. Thirty patients presented AAT levels lower than the mean values found in patients with the MM or MS genotype, and this fact could not be explained by an increased frequency of S and Z alleles...|$|E

The patients were divided into groups based on AAT level: ≤ 89 mg/dL (deficiency, no group); 90 - 140 mg/dL (intermediate, Group 1, n = 30); and ≥ 141 mg/dL (normal, Group 2, n = 57).

40|$|The {{quantification}} of urinary monoclonal component (UMC), usually as κ or λ light chain, is used {{to monitor}} therapeutic response in multiple myeloma patients (Katzmann JA et al, 2011 Clin Chem 57; 12 : 1687). The recommended method is an estimation based on the percentage of UMC identified on the densitometric scan of the electrophoretic separation of total urinary proteins (TUP); however TUP quantification may give different results when different total protein assays are used. To overcome this limitation we tested another approach based on <b>nephelometric</b> <b>determination</b> of urinary albumin (AlbU), which always visible on the immunofixation gel, to obtain another UMC estimations by comparing the two areas of AlbU and UMC. Twenty urinary samples from multiple myeloma patients showing monoclonal bands on immunofixation were selected, with TUP values, quantified by the automated benzethonium chloride method, ranging from 1. 4 to 1800 mg/dl. A densitometric scan of the gel by the software ImageJ was performed and the areas of UMC and AlbU were estimated. Two different calculations of UMC were then performed: one referred to the TUP {{and the other one}} to the AlbU. On the same samples urinary light chains κ or λ (ULC) were also directly determined by nephelometry. We found a good correlation between the values calculated by using TUP and AlbU (r= 0. 9368), TUP and ULC (r= 0. 9560), ULC and AlbU (r= 0. 9605), but the ULC determined by nephelometry were always higher than the estimated values, even if the degree of overestimation was highly variable, confirming the discrepancy between methods. It is worth to note that in the samples where elevated values of UMC were estimated with TUP (> 50 mg/dl), AlbU based calculation restituted far lower values than ULC determination, likely due to the saturation of the protein staining on the electrophoretic gel...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Determinar a concentração de alfa 1 -antitripsina (AAT) e a prevalência dos alelos S e Z em indivíduos sintomáticos respiratórios crônicos. MÉTODOS: Pacientes com tosse crônica e dispnéia foram submetidos à avaliação clínica, espirometria, tomografia computadorizada de tórax, dosagem de AAT por nefelometria e pesquisa das mutações S e Z por reação em cadeia da polimerase. Foram consideradas como variáveis dependentes a concentração de AAT e o tabagismo. RESULTADOS: Dos 89 pacientes incluídos no estudo (44 mulheres; idade média, 51, 3 ± 18, 2 anos), os alelos S e Z foram detectados em 33, 3 % e 5, 7 %, respectivamente, com freqüência gênica dos alelos S e Z de 0, 16 e 0, 028. Dois pacientes tinham genótipo SZ (AAT 141 mg/dL (normal, Grupo 2, n = 57). A freqüência de fumantes foi igual nos dois grupos, com carga tabágica maior no Grupo 2. O alelo S estava presente em 13 e 14 pacientes dos Grupos 1 e 2, respectivamente, enquanto que o alelo Z estava presente em 2 e 1 paciente dos mesmos grupos. Não houve diferença nos testes de função pulmonar, nem na freqüência de bronquiectasias ou enfisema entre os dois grupos. Os valores espirométricos e as concentrações de AAT foram similares entre fumantes e não-fumantes. Bronquiectasias foram mais freqüentes entre os não fumantes, e enfisema foi mais freqüente entre os fumantes. CONCLUSÕES: Trinta pacientes apresentaram níveis de AAT abaixo da média esperada para os genótipos MM e MS, e este fato não pode ser explicado por uma freqüência maior dos alelos S e Z.
