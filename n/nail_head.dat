25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail {{pull out of the}} frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing.

5000|$|The problem recurred when vessels were {{sheathed}} in copper to reduce marine weed accumulation and protect against shipworm. In an experiment, the Royal Navy in 1761 had tried fitting {{the hull of}} the frigate HMS Alarm with 12-ounce copper plating. Upon her return from a voyage to the West Indies, {{it was found that}} although the copper remained in fine condition and had indeed deterred shipworm, it had also become detached from the wooden hull in many places because the iron nails used during its installation [...] "...were found dissolved into a kind of rusty Paste". To the surprise of the inspection teams, however, some of the iron nails were virtually undamaged. Closer inspection revealed that water-resistant brown paper trapped under the <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> had inadvertently protected some of the nails: [...] "Where this covering was perfect, the Iron was preserved from Injury". The copper sheathing had been delivered to the dockyard wrapped in the paper which was not always removed before the sheets were nailed to the hull. The conclusion therefore reported to the Admiralty in 1763 was that iron should not be allowed direct contact with copper in sea water.|$|E
5000|$|Typically {{the head}} {{will be made}} of steel and the handle of wood. Light weight {{titanium}} heads with longer handles allow for increased velocity, resulting in greater energy delivery, while decreasing arm fatigue and risk of carpal tunnel syndrome [...] The milled face of the head consists of a waffle-like grid of small four sided pyramids. Nails typically used for framing have a grid of intersecting raised metal lines {{on the head of}} the nail. The raised marks on the head of the hammer grip this grid, which helps to prevent the hammer from sliding off the <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> when striking a nail. Since the frame typically will not be seen on the finished house, the inevitable marring of wood surfaces by the milled hammer face is not an issue. A hammer with a smooth striking surface is known as a finishing hammer and is used where marring of the wood is to be avoided for cosmetic reasons. Some framing hammers have a magnetized slot along the top edge of the striking surface to hold a nail. This allows the nail to be placed and driven quickly with just one hand.|$|E
40|$|Soil nailing {{has been}} one of the most popular {{techniques}} for improving the stability of slopes, in which rows of nails and a structural grillage system connecting <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> are commonly applied. In order to examine the spatial-reinforcement effect of soil nails in slopes, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical model has been developed and used to back-analyze a field test slope under surcharge loading. Incremental elastoplastic analyses have been performed to study the internal deformation within the slope and the development of nail forces during the application of top surcharge loads. Different treatments of the grillage constraints at <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> have been studied. It is shown that the numerical predictions compare favorably with the field test measurements. Both the numerical and the field test results suggest that soil nails are capable of increasing the overall stability of a loose fill slope for the loading conditions considered in this study. The axial force mobilization in the two rows of soil nails presents a strong dependence on the relative distance with the central section. With the surcharge loads increased near the bearing capacity of the slope, a grillage system connecting all the <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> can affect the stabilizing mechanism to a notable extent...|$|R

50|$|In 1776 Alarm was resurveyed. It {{was soon}} {{discovered}} that the sheathing had become detached from the hull in many places because the iron nails which {{had been used to}} fasten the copper to the timbers had been ‘much rotted’. Closer inspection revealed that some nails, which were less corroded, were insulated from the copper by brown paper which was trapped under the <b>nail</b> <b>head.</b> The copper had been delivered to the dockyard wrapped in the paper which was not removed before the sheets were nailed to the hull. The obvious conclusion therefore, and the one which had been highlighted in a separate report to the Admiralty in as early as 1763, was that iron should not be allowed direct contact with copper in a sea water environment if severe corrosion of the iron was to be avoided. Later ships were designed with this in mind. The Admiralty had largely suspended the programme of fitting ships with copper sheathing after the 1763 report, and had not shown any further interest in developing effective copper sheathing until 1775. In the meantime the copper sheathing was removed from Alarm, and several other test vessels until an effective solution to the corrosion problem could be developed.|$|E
50|$|Soil nailing is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by pumping grout down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated soil <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|E

50|$|The {{protective}} {{nature of}} asphalt shingles primarily {{comes from the}} long-chain hydrocarbons impregnating the paper. Over time in the hot sun, the hydrocarbons soften and when rain falls the hydrocarbons are gradually washed out of the shingles and down onto the ground. Along eaves and complex rooflines more water is channeled so in these areas the loss occurs more quickly. Eventually {{the loss of the}} heavy oils causes the fibers to shrink, exposing the <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> under the shingle flaps. The shrinkage also breaks up the surface coating of sand adhered {{to the surface of the}} paper, and eventually causes the paper to begin to tear itself apart.

30|$|With {{the recent}} concern toward wood {{utilization}} in large-scale structures, increasing the strength performance of structural elements is important. Developing structural elements using board materials {{is one of}} the measures to increase the strength performance. A high-performance nailed joint to resist shear loading is necessary to increase the strength performance of wooden structural elements using board materials. This study was conducted {{in order to understand the}} shear properties of nailed joints intended for large-scale structures. Shear tests were conducted with nailed joints using structural plywood, medium density fiberboard, or particleboard. The yield resistance was determined from experimental load-slip displacement curves, and was also calculated using European yield theory (EYT). Consequently, the nailed joint specimens using MDF showed an experimental yield resistance higher than those using structural sugi plywood. The nailed joint specimens using PB also showed a high value similar to that of the joints using structural karamatsu plywood. The yield resistance of most of the joint specimen series calculated using European yield theory showed slightly higher values than the experimental yield resistance. This study observed the deformation behavior around nail the head under shear loading. No deformation was observed from the appearance at the initial region of the test. The <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> started a rotational deformation when the joint started yielding. Moreover, the side panel became partially embedded. The <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> was completely embedded at the maximum load of the specimen. Nail pull-out from the base material was not remarkably evident.
