40|$|Habit {{surveys have}} been {{conducted}} to identify people who make use of foodstuffs collected from the wild (free foods) in two areas of the UK: {{in the area around}} Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, where levels of <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in soil were expected to be typical of the UK, and in the vicinity of Okehampton in Devon, where levels were known to be elevated. Individuals who make regular use of these foodstuffs were specifically identified, so that an estimate of typical and higher than average consumption rates could be derived. The <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides</b> of interest were " 2 " 1 " 0 Po, " 2 " 1 " 0 Pb, " 2 " 3 " 4 U, " 2 " 3 " 5 U, " 2 " 3 " 8 U, " 2 " 3 " 0 Th, " 2 " 3 " 2 Th and " 2 " 2 " 6 Ra. Samples of important foodstuffs were collected and the radionuclides of interest determined. The consumption rates were combined with the measured activity concentrations and published dose coefficients to estimate doses to average and higher than average consumers. These doses were compared with estimated doses reported in the Food Standards Agency's ongoing monitoring programme and with average doses to the population of the UK reviewed by NRPB. In total, 400 people were identified and between them they collected 54 different types of free food. Blackberries were by far the most common species collected, although various types of mushroom and nuts were also popular. On average, each collector from around Chipping Norton collected 2. 1 different foods, and each from around Okehampton collected 2. 2. On the basis of the habit survey, therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that any site, nuclear or otherwise, chosen for habit surveys, whether for radiological purposes or for any other contaminant, could have substantial numbers of people collecting free foods. In addition, the pattern of foods collected was very similar to previous studies, indicating similarities across England and Wales. Doses from the consumption of free foods were estimated. The annual doses estimated to have been received by a typical consumer of all the free foods collected were about 29 #mu#Sv and 156 #mu#Sv for the areas around Chipping Norton and Okehampton respectively. The corresponding doses to a higher than average consumer of the two most significant foodstuffs from each area were estimated to be 84 #mu#Sv and 273 #mu#Sv. The estimated doses to those people collecting free foods around Chipping Norton were low compared with those due to the consumption of <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in regional diet. However, estimated doses to people who collected free foods around Okehampton were comparable with those implied from consumption of regional diet. Hence, when assessments of doses from the food chain are required in such areas, then the collection of free foods should be taken into account.

40|$|<b>Naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides,</b> such {{as those}} of the uranium and thorium series, as well as {{artificial}} radionuclides, are accumulated in plants generally in low concentrations. Summer vegetation fires release these natural and man-made radionuclides into the atmosphere. Concentrations of uranium isotopes 238 U, 235 U, 234 U, 232 Th, 230 Th, 226 Ra, 210 Pb and 210 Po were measured in smoke from wild vegetation fires. It is shown that radionuclide concentrations in smoke particles are enhanced about 100 times in comparison with the vegetation of the area and with reference aerosols. Smoke particles were particularly enriched in 210 Po, and displayed 210 Po/ 210 Pb activity concentration ratios always above unity and up to 12, while in common aerosols 210 Po/ 210 Pb is always < 1. Inhaled smoke particles from vegetation and forest fires may contribute to enhanced radiation doses in the human lung...|$|E
40|$|Mining {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{elevation}} of <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclide</b> material (NORM) concentrations on the Earth’s surface. The aim of this study was to evaluate the human risk associated with exposure to NORMs in soils from mine tailings around a gold mine. A broad-energy germanium detector was used to measure activity concentrations of these NORMs in 66 soil samples (56 from five mine tailings and 10 from the control area). The RESidual RADioactivity (RESRAD) OFFSITE modeling program (version 3. 1) was then used to estimate the radiation doses and the cancer morbidity risk of uranium- 238 (238 U), thorium- 232 (232 Th), and potassium- 40 (40 K) for a hypothetical resident scenario. According to RESRAD prediction, the maximum total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) during 100 years was found to be 0. 0315 mSv/year at year 30, while the maximum total excess cancer morbidity risk for all the pathways was 3. 04 × 10 − 5 at year 15. The US Environmental Protection Agency considers acceptable for regulatory purposes a cancer risk in the range of 10 − 6 to 10 − 4. Therefore, results obtained from RESRAD OFFSITE code has shown that the health risk from gold mine tailings is within acceptable levels according to international standards...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of the {{structural}} arrangement of human bone marrow samples taken from adults and fetuses at autopsy, in order to provide estimates of dose to putative target cells for leukaemia induction from <b>naturally-occurring</b> alpha-emitting <b>radionuclides.</b> Thin sections of adult bone samples used with image analysis provided a template of the actual spatial distribution of marrow and fat cells within the trabecular spaces of rib, vertebra and femur. Estimates of equivalent dose to adult marrow from " 2 " 2 " 2 Rn in fat cells ranged from 34 - 146 #mu#Sv y"-" 1 for ages 16 - 96 years in rib and vertebra at the average UK domestic radon exposure of 20 Bq m"-" 3. Monoclonal antibody CD 34 was used to identify progenitor cells in thin sections of fetal bone marrow sections. The size, number and spatial distribution of the CD 34 "+ cells were characterised using light microscopy. In mid- and late gestation, 24 % and 43 % of CD 34 "+ cells respectively, were within alpha-particle range of " 2 " 1 " 0 Pb-supported " 2 " 1 " 0 Po at bone surfaces in fetal vertebra. In addition, marrow at the periphery of fetal vertebral sections was 6. 5 times richer in CD 34 "+ cells than marrow at the centre of the section. Equivalent dose from " 2 " 1 " 0 Pb-supported " 2 " 1 " 0 Pb was estimated as 9 #mu#Sv for the second and third trimesters together, based on measured activity concentrations corrected for the effects of small sizes of trabecular spaces (Purnell et al, 1999). Total alpha-radiation dose to fetal bone marrow from natural alpha-emitters was estimated as 28 #mu#Sv. Based on current NRPB risk factors and LRF leukaemia incidence statistics, this dose estimate suggests that about 1 % of ALL cases per year will be due to in utero natural high-LET radiation to the fetal bone marrow.

40|$|Radon is a gas {{produced}} by the radioactive decay of the element radium. • Radon itself is radioactive, losing an alpha particle and forming the element polonium. • Each of the three <b>naturally-occurring</b> series-decaying <b>radionuclides</b> releases radon (only the uranium- 238 series contributes significantly to the hazard). • Uranium is everywhere (soils, building materials, etc.) • Uranium decays eventually to radium. • Radium, the parent of radon is very soluble. • Therefore radon is also everywhere. The major source of radon is the soil, but ground water, natural gas, and building materials also contribute. What is the Hazard? • The half-life of radon is only 3. 8 days. • It is the daughter products of radon decay that are more of a health risk. • Polonium, bismuth, and lead (among others) are {{produced by}} radon decay {{in the air and}} in the lung. • Alpha particles are released in the decay of the radon daughters. The biological effects of very low doses of alpha particles are uncertain (extrapolated from high doses to miners). Radon Page 1 of 22 Radon History: • As early as the 1500 s an unusually high mortality from respiratory disease (“black lung disease”) was documented among underground metal miners in the Erz Mountains of Eastern Europe. In the 1800 s pulmonary malignancy was documented in miners from that area, and in the early 20 th century shown to be primary carcinoma of the lung. • Rutherford and Owens studying the “emanations from thorium ” in 1899 wrote “the radiation from thorium was not constant but varied in a most capricious manner”. Rutherford made the key observations that “the emanation…acts like an ordinary gas ” and that “ … the intensity of the radiation has fallen to one half of its value after an interval of about one minute. ” Rutherford and Owens had discovered radon- 220 (thoron), half life 51 sec. • Pierre and Marie Curie, studying the emanations from radium in 1899, concluded that “ [...] it stayed radioactive for several days. ” The Curies had detected radon- 222, half life 3. 8 days, but they still had doubts as to whether the activity was really {{in the form of a}} gas...|$|R
40|$|An aerial {{radiological}} {{survey was conducted}} over areas of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) and the immediate surrounding area, during the period July 7 through 20, 1994. The survey was conducted to measure and map the gamma radiation in the area. This mission was the first aerial radiation survey conducted at WPAFB. In the surveyed area, five small localized sources of gamma radiation were detected which were atypical of <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides.</b> On WPAFB property, these sources included a radiation storage facility in Area B (krypton- 85) and an ash pile near the Area C flight line (low energy gamma activity). In the area covered outside WPAFB boundaries, sources included cesium- 137 in excess of worldwide fallout over a landfill in a northern Dayton industrial area, an X-ray radiography source over a steel plant in the same industrial area, and a mixture of cesium- 137 in excess of worldwide fallout and possibly iridium- 192 in an area near Crystal Lakes, Ohio. The naturally-occurring gamma emitters (uranium- 238 and progeny, thorium and progeny, and potassium- 40) were detected in the remaining area with a total exposure rate range of 4 to 16 {mu}R/h; this range is typical of that found in the United States, 1 to 20 {mu}R/h...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an {{investigation}} of the U- 238 /Th- 234 parent/daughter pair in the nearshore environments of Lake Michigan show that short-lived, <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides</b> are useful in determining the time scales of sediment transport processes on the orders of days to weeks. While the long term, depositional sink for some new particles entering the lake, either from rivers or shoreline erosion, has been well documented, the aggregate time scale of the processes by which these particles move from source to sink is not well quantified. These relatively “new ” particles may undergo numerous episodes of resuspension and redeposition before making their way through the coastal margin and entering the long term focusing processes active in the depositional basins of the lake. These episodic events can be large in scale and magnitude, resuspending as much or more material than is permanently deposited in the lake on an annual basis. Th- 234, a particle reactive radionuclide with a 24 day half-life, would appear to be well suited as a tracer for following rapid particle movement, particle residence times in the overlying water, and alongshore transport processes. The remotely operated vehicle (ROV) deployed technique for collection of surface sediments residing in non-depositional (hard bottom) lakebeds and some preliminary time series results for transient excess Th- 234 inventories in the nearshore of Lake Michigan are described...|$|E
40|$|<b>Naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides</b> (uranium, radium, and radon), major {{dissolved}} constituents, {{and trace}} elements were investigated in fresh groundwater in 117 wells in fractured crystalline rocks from the Piedmont region (North Carolina, USA). Chemical variations show a general transition between two water types: (1) slightly acidic (pH 5. 0 - 6. 0), oxic, low-total dissolved solids (TDS) waters, and (2) near neutral, oxic to anoxic, higher-TDS waters. The uranium, radium, and radon levels in groundwater associated with granite (Rolesville Granite) are systematically higher than other rock types (gneiss, metasedimentary, and metavolcanic rocks). Water chemistry plays a secondary role on radium and radon distributions as the 222 Rn/ 226 Ra activity ratio is correlated with redox-sensitive solutes such as dissolved oxygen and Mn concentrations, {{as well as}} overall dissolved solids content including major divalent cations and Ba. Since 224 Ra/ 228 Ra activity ratios in groundwater are close to 1, we suggest that mobilization of Ra and Rn is controlled by alpha recoil processes from parent nuclides on fracture surfaces, ruling out Ra sources from mineral dissolution or significant long-distance Ra transport. Alpha recoil is balanced by Ra adsorption that is influenced by redox conditions and/or ion concentrations, resulting in an approximately one order of magnitude decrease (~ 20, 000 to ~ 2000) in the apparent Ra distribution coefficient between oxygen-saturated and anoxic conditions and also across the range of dissolved ion concentrations (up to ~ 7  mM). Thus, the U and Th content of rocks is the primary control on observed Ra and Rn activities in groundwater in fractured crystalline rocks, and in addition, linked dissolved solids concentrations and redox conditions impart a secondary control. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Problem statement: Forest {{fires are}} {{especially}} frequent around the Mediterranean Sea basin {{in the summer}} period and {{might be able to}} release <b>naturally-occurring</b> and man-made <b>radionuclides</b> from plant biomass and inject them into the atmosphere. The impact of this radioactivity on populations was not investigated before. Approach: Radionuclide analysis was performed in plants, in smoke from plant burning and in cigarette smoke to determine radionuclide concentrations by alpha spectrometry. Results: Concentrations of 210 Pb and 210 Po in trees such as olive trees, showed low concentrations in roots, trunk and leaves and minor translocation of radionuclides from the root to aerial parts. Soil to plant transfer ratios for 210 Po and 210 Pb in several plants were in the range from 10 - 4 to 10 - 2. Radionuclides from atmospheric depositions may be accumulated in plants by foliar uptake and for 210 Pb this seems the main pathway, with plant aerial parts displaying 210 Po/ 210 Pb ratios around 0. 1, which is similar to the radionuclide ratios determined in atmospheric depositions. Experimental burning of wood from several tree species showed enhanced radionuclide concentrations in smoke compared to plant materials. Investigation of 210 Po release from tobacco leaves used in cigarettes, showed especially enhanced concentrations of this radionuclide in the cigarette smoke particles. Conclusion: Radionuclide concentrations in cigarette smoke expose the lung tissues of regular smokers to high concentrations of 210 Po that were considered carcinogenic. Although radionuclide concentrations in other plants analyzed were generally lower than in tobacco, globally the radionuclide activity in the plant biomass is elevated. Inhaled smoke particles from forest fires are likely to contribute to enhanced radiation doses in the human lung...|$|R
40|$|Polonium (210 Po), {{the most}} {{volatile}} of <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in plants, was analysed in three common brands of cigarettes produced in Portugal. The analyses were carried out on the unburned tobacco contained in cigarettes, on the ashes and butts of smoked cigarettes and on the mainstream smoke. 210 Po in tobacco displays concentrations ranging from 3 to 37 mBq g– 1, depending upon the cigarette brand. The 210 Po activity remaining in the solid residue of a smoked cigarette varied from 0. 3 to 4. 9 mBq per cigarette, and the 210 Po in the inhaled smoke varied from 2. 6 to 28. 9 mBq. In all brands of cigarettes tested, a large fraction of the 210 Po content is not inhaled by the smoker and it is released into the atmosphere. Part of it may be inhaled by passive smokers. Depending upon the commercial brand and upon {{the presence or absence}} of a filter in the cigarette, 5 to 37 % of the 210 Po in the cigarette can be inhaled by the smoker. Taking into account the aver-age 210 Po in surface air, the smoker of one pack of twenty cigarettes per day may inhale 50 times more 210 Po than a non smoker. Cigarette smoke contributes with 1. 5 % to the daily rate of 210 Po absorption into the blood, 0. 39 Bq d– 1, and, after systemic circulation it gives rise to a whole body radiation dose in the same proportion. However, in the smoker the deposition of 210 Po in the lungs is much more elevated than normal and may originate an enhanced radiation exposure. Estimated dose to the lungs is presented and radiobiological effects of cigarette smoke are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The new {{phosphogypsum}} (PG) {{waste management}} policy allowed {{to reduce the}} negative environmental impact of this residue by finding better alternatives uses with an extremely limited radiological impact. Building material {{could be one of}} these alternatives that could lead to the production of final products with good mechanical properties and very limited radionuclides content. The optimization of the radioactive levels in the building materials when PG is used for its production requires the previous knowledge of the content of naturally occurring radionuclides in the PG waste. This article aims the radioactive characterization of two different PG sources (from Spain (Fertiberia S. A., Huelva) and Tunisia (Sfax), before being incorporated in building materials. For this purpose, the natural selected radionuclides content belonging to uranium and thorium decay series and 40 K was determined, by means of two different methods: i) gamma spectrometry with high-purity germanium detectors and ii) laser-induced kinetic phosphorimetry (KPA- 11 Chemcheck Instruments Inc., Richland, WA). Also, the semiquantitative chemical composition, the mineralogical study and the morphological aspect of the PG samples were analysed. The results obtained from both techniques show that 226 Ra and 210 Po are the main source of the radioactivity in both studied PG samples. However, PG samples from Tunisia present low natural radionuclide levels (30. 7 Bq?kg– 1 average value for 238 U, 188 Bq?kg– 1 (226 Ra), 163 Bq?kg– 1 (210 Pb), 12. 4 Bq?kg– 1 (232 Th)) compared to the level of natural radionuclides in PG samples from Huelva (102 Bq?kg– 1 average value for 238 U, 520 Bq?kg– 1 (226 Ra), 881 Bq?kg- 1 (210 Pb) and 8 Bq?kg- 1 (232 Th).

40|$|Adsorption to sinking {{particulate}} matter, {{known as}} scavenging, {{is an important}} yet elusive term in the budgets of many bioactive and contaminant trace metals in the ocean. Scavenging is also involved in the cycling of other trace metals used in ocean sediments to learn about ocean processes, such as circulation rates or biological productivity, of the geologic past. This dissertation is an oceanographic exploration of the <b>naturally-occurring</b> <b>radionuclides</b> 230 Th, 232 Th and 231 Pa aimed to better understand how their scavenging behavior can be utilized to trace chemical flux in the modern and the past ocean. While 230 Th and 231 Pa are produced by the radioactive decay of uranium dissolved in seawater, 232 Th {{is added to the}} ocean via the input of continental material. Removal of Th by scavenging should be equivalent for both Th isotopes based on chemical principles. I use measured 232 Th inventories from the North Pacific water column and apply a removal rate based on 234 U: 230 Th disequilibria to estimate the flux of dissolved trace elements, such as the micro-nutrient Fe, to the ocean through the deposition of mineral dust (Chapter 2). Results from this study also raise the possibility of differing chemical behavior of the two Th isotopes in shallow water (< 500 m depth) related to size-partitioning between truly dissolved and colloidal phases. Finally, results from the U. S. GEOTRACES North Atlantic Transect are used to investigate the relationship between 231 Pa and 230 Th in the water column and several of their proposed paleoceanographic purposes. The accuracy of 230 Th as a proxy for constant sediment flux can be directly quantified to 40 ± 10 % with observations of boundary scavenging near the coast of Northwest Africa (Chapter 4). The 231 Pa/ 230 Th ratio in the water column is not clearly controlled by either ocean ventilation (Chapter 4) or particle composition (Chapter 5) alone. Near-bottom enhanced scavenging of both isotopes is also occurring over large regions, in benthic layers of resuspended sediments and in a hydrothermal plume emanating from the mid-Atlantic ridge. These novel observations must be reconciled in a new conceptual model, likely requiring future numerical modeling work, in order to clarify the use of the 231 Pa/ 230 Th ratio as a proxy for the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation...|$|E
