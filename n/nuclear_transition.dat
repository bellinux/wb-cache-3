25|$|If the {{emitting}} and absorbing nuclei were in identical chemical environments, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transition</b> energies {{would be}} exactly equal and resonant absorption would be observed with both materials at rest. The difference in chemical environments, however, causes the nuclear energy levels to shift {{in a few}} different ways, as described below. Although these energy shifts are tiny (often less than a micro-electronvolt), the extremely narrow spectral linewidths of gamma rays for some radionuclides make the small energy shifts correspond to large changes in absorbance. To bring the two nuclei back into resonance {{it is necessary to}} change the energy of the gamma ray slightly, and in practice this is always done using the Doppler effect.|$|E

40|$|Some {{features}} of quantum optics related to inversionless amplification are translated to nuclear systems. Nuclei and <b>nuclear</b> <b>transitions</b> differ {{in several ways}} from atomic systems: gamma radiation has a much shorter wavelength (of the order of lattice-distances), <b>nuclear</b> <b>transitions</b> are many orders of magnitude weaker than atomic ones (making nuclear pumping extremely hard), no coherent gamma-ray sources are available to produce bichromatic gamma radiation. All this makes {{it very hard to}} merely translate quantum optical results to nuclear systems.

Second, we show that the interference effects may appear in X-ray radiation at the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transitions</b> under {{the condition of the}} nuclear level anti-crossing. This effects are similar to electromagnetically induced transparency, which has been widely studied earlier at the electronic transitions in optics. We also suggest a new technique for inhomogeneous line narrowing at <b>nuclear</b> <b>transitions.</b> This technique is based on the combined action of RF and DC fields and adopted to be applied in the M?ossbauer spectroscopy. Numerical simulation of a simple model with the dipole-dipole interaction is presented in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the technique.

5000|$|The Mössbauer Effect is {{a process}} in which a nucleus emits or absorbs gamma rays without loss of energy to a nuclear recoil. It was {{discovered}} by the German physicist Rudolf L. Mössbauer in 1958 and has proved to be remarkably useful for basic research in physics and chemistry. It has been used, for instance, in precisely measuring small energy changes in nuclei, atoms, and crystals induced by electrical, magnetic, or gravitational fields. In a transition of a nucleus from a higher to a lower energy state with accompanying emission of gamma rays, the emission generally causes the nucleus to recoil, and this takes energy from the emitted gamma rays. Thus the gamma rays do not have sufficient energy to excite a target nucleus to be examined. However, Mössbauer discovered {{that it is possible to}} have transitions in which the recoil is absorbed by a whole crystal in which the emitting nucleus is bound. Under these circumstances, the energy that goes into the recoil is a negligible portion of the energy of the transition. Therefore the emitted gamma rays carry virtually all of the energy liberated by the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transition.</b> The gamma rays thus are able to induce a reverse transition, under similar conditions of negligible recoil, in a target nucleus of the same material as the emitter but in a lower energy state. In general, gamma rays are produced by nuclear transitions from an unstable high-energy state, to a stable low-energy state. The energy of the emitted gamma ray corresponds to the energy of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transition,</b> minus an amount of energy that is lost as recoil to the emitting atom. If the lost [...] "recoil energy" [...] is small compared with the energy linewidth of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transition,</b> then the gamma ray energy still corresponds to the energy of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transition,</b> and the gamma ray can be absorbed by a second atom of the same type as the first. This emission and subsequent absorption is called resonant fluorescence. Additional recoil energy is also lost during absorption, so in order for resonance to occur the recoil energy must actually be less than half the linewidth for the corresponding <b>nuclear</b> <b>transition.</b>|$|E

The relevant matrix elements for ^ 8 Be^*(1 ^+) → ^ 8 Be (0 ^+) transitions are calculated using ab initio methods with inter-nucleon forces derived from chiral effective field theory and the in-medium similarity renormalization group. We find that the emission of a light axial vector with mass m_X ≃ 17 MeV can account for the anomaly seen in the 1 ^+→ 0 ^+ isoscalar transition together with {{the absence of a}} significant anomaly in the corresponding isovector transition.

40|$|In {{the course}} of this Thesis the mutual control between x-rays and <b>nuclear</b> <b>transitions</b> is {{investigated}} theoretically. In the first Part, we study the nuclear photoexcitation with the highly brilliant and coherent x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). Apart from amplifying the direct resonant interaction with <b>nuclear</b> <b>transitions,</b> the super-intense XFEL can produce new states of matter like cold, high-density plasmas where secondary nuclear excitation channels may come into play, e. g., nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC). Our results predict {{that in the case of}} ^ 57 Fe targets secondary NEEC can be safely neglected, whereas it is surprisingly the dominating contribution (in comparison to the direct photoexcitation) for the XFEL-induced ^ 93 mMo isomer triggering. Based on these case studies, we elaborate a general set of criteria to identify the prevailing excitation channel for a certain nuclear isotope. These criteria may be most relevant for future nuclear resonance experiments at XFEL facilities. On the opposite frontier, the interplay between single x-ray photons and <b>nuclear</b> <b>transitions</b> offer potential storage and processing applications for information science in their most compact form. In the second Part of this Thesis, we show that nuclear forward scattering off ^ 57 Fe targets can be employed to process polarization-encoded single x-rays via timed magnetic field rotations.

5000|$|The {{distinction}} between X-rays and gamma rays is partly based on sources: the photons generated from nuclear decay or other nuclear and subnuclear/particle process, are always termed gamma rays, whereas X-rays are generated by electronic transitions involving highly energetic inner atomic electrons. In general, nuclear transitions {{are much more}} energetic than electronic transitions, so gamma-rays are more energetic than X-rays, but exceptions exist. By analogy to electronic transitions, muonic atom transitions are also said to produce X-rays, even though their energy may exceed , whereas there are many (77 known {{to be less than}} [...] ) low-energy nuclear transitions (e.g., the [...] <b>nuclear</b> <b>transition</b> of thorium-229), and, despite being one million-fold less energetic than some muonic X-rays, the emitted photons are still called gamma rays due to their nuclear origin.|$|E
50|$|Nuclear {{stability}} {{is limited to}} those combinations of protons and neutrons described by the chart of the nuclides, also called the valley of stability. The boundaries of this valley are the neutron drip line on the neutron rich side, and the proton drip line on the proton-rich side.
