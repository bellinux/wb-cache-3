40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the dimensions {{and depth of}} the right internal jugular vein (RIJV) in low birth weight <b>newborns</b> by ultrasound and assess the differences in weight and {{determine the}} relationship of the vein with the carotid artery. Method: We performed a vascular assessment of the RIJV in 100 low birth weight <b>newborns.</b> The subjects were divided into three groups, low birth weight (LBW) <b>newborns,</b> 52500 g; very low birth weight (VLBW) <b>newborns,</b> 51500 g; and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) <b>newborns</b> 51000 g. Results: Of the <b>newborns,</b> 39 % had LBW, 33 % had VLBW, and 28 % had ELBW. The medians were gestational age 31 weeks, weight 1300 g, anteroposterior diameter of the RIJV 2. 2 mm, and the distance from the skin–RIJV 3. 6 mm. In LBW <b>newborns,</b> the median anteroposterior diameter of RIJV was 2. 7 mm; in LBW <b>newborns</b> 2. 2; in ELBW <b>newborns</b> 1. 9 (p 50. 001); the median distance from skin to RIJV for LBW <b>newborns</b> was 4. 1 mm; for VLBW <b>newborns,</b> 3. 6 and for ELBW <b>newborns</b> 2. 9 (p 50. 01); differences that were statistically significant.

40|$|Umbilical artery {{catheterization}} is {{the standard}} procedure for arterial access in neonatal intensive care units. An umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) needs to be placed accurately during the initial insertion because malpositioning increases catheter-related complications and subsequent repositioning exposes <b>newborns</b> to unnecessary handling, further radiologic exposure, and {{an increased risk of}} infection. To measure the UAC insertion length in <b>newborns,</b> we compared the conventional practice (i. e., the Dunn method) with a new formula: Wright's formula. Methods: The study enrolled 119 <b>newborns.</b> A nomogram derived from Dunn was used during the first study period and the new formula devised by Wright (4  × birth weight +  7  cm) was used during the second study period. The catheter tip position on the initial radiograph was evaluated as correct (i. e., T 6 –T 10), overinsertion (i. e., T 10). Results: The demographic profiles were not different between the two groups, which included sex; birth weight; and the number of preterm births, low-birth-weight (LBW) newborns, and very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) <b>newborns.</b> When using Wright's formula and the Dunn method, 83 % of <b>newborns</b> and 61 % of <b>newborns,</b> respectively, received a correct insertion (p <  0. 05). The success rate for positioning the UAC tip between T 7 and T 8 was approximately two-fold higher when using Wright's formula than when using the Dunn method. In particular, the rate of correct insertion was significantly higher with Wright's formula in term <b>newborns,</b> LBW <b>newborns,</b> VLBW <b>newborns,</b> and small for gestational age (SGA) <b>newborns</b> (p <  0. 05); however, the rate of overinsertion with the Dunn method was much higher in term <b>newborns,</b> LBW <b>newborns,</b> VLBW <b>newborns,</b> and SGA <b>newborns</b> (p <  0. 05). Conclusion: The use of Wright's formula overall results in superior correct placement of the UAC tip.

40|$|Background Significant {{immunomodulatory}} {{effects have}} been described as result of cigarette smoking in adults and pregnant women. However, the effect of cigarette smoking during pregnancy on the lymphocyte subpopulations in <b>newborns</b> has been discussed, controversially. Methods In a prospective birth cohort, we analyzed the peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations of smoking (SM) and non-smoking mothers (NSM) and their <b>newborns</b> and the replicative history of neonatal, mostly naive CD 4 [*]+[*]CD 45 RA[*]+[*]T cells by measurements of T-cell-receptor-excision-circles (TRECs), relative telomere lengths (RTL) and the serum cytokine concentrations. Results SM had higher lymphocyte counts than NSM. Comparing SM and NSM and SM <b>newborns</b> with NSM <b>newborns,</b> no significant differences in proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were seen. Regardless of their smoking habits, mothers had significantly lower naive T cells and higher memory and effector T cells than <b>newborns.</b> NSM had significantly lower percentages of CD 4 [*]+[*]CD 25 ++ T cells compared to their <b>newborns,</b> which was not significant in SM. There were no differences regarding cytokine concentrations in <b>newborns</b> of SM and NSM. However, NSM had significantly higher Interleukin- 7 concentrations than their <b>newborns.</b> Regardless of smoking habits of mothers, <b>newborns</b> had significantly longer telomeres and higher TRECs than their mothers. <b>Newborns</b> of SM had significantly longer telomeres than <b>newborns</b> of NSM.

40|$|Background: Morbidity and {{mortality}} rates of {{low birth weight}} (LBW) <b>newborns</b> at term are higher than rates in normal birth weight (NBW) <b>newborns.</b> LBW <b>newborns</b> {{are at greater risk}} to acquire recurrent bacterial and viral infections during their first few weeks of life possibly as an outcome of compromised innate immune functions. As adaptive immunity is in a naive state, increased risk of infection of LBW as compared to NBW <b>newborns</b> may reflect impairments in innate immunity. Methodology: To characterize the increased susceptibility to infections in LBW <b>newborns</b> we used microarray technology to identify differences in gene expression in LBW <b>newborns</b> (n = 8) compared to NBW <b>newborns</b> (n = 4) using cord blood. The results obtained from the microarray study were validated on a larger number of samples using real time RT-PCR (LBW = 22, NBW= 18) and western blotting (LBW = 12, NBW= 12). The Interferome database was used to identify interferon (IFN) signature genes and ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways and biological functions associated with the differentially expressed genes in LBW <b>newborns.</b> ELISAs for IFNs and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were performed in both LBW and NBW <b>newborns</b> and in adults (LBW= 18, NBW= 18, Adults = 8).

Patients and Methods: <b>Newborns</b> with a gestational age of ≥ 34 week delivered by normal vaginal delivery (NVD) or cesarean section (CS) were included.
