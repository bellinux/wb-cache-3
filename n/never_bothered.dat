5|$|According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his {{interest}} in arts and literature, and <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of epigrammatic expression, suggest {{that he was in}} fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.|$|E
5|$|This {{can be used}} {{to derive}} the {{correlation}} of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation of a pair of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Street {{crime was}} {{prevalent}} in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station {{to deal with}} law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, prostitution, and drunkenness became significant problems. Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. Because {{there was so much}} street violence, city police <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers killed in the war were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots.|$|E

5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E

25|$|Gustavus Adolphus shared Maria Eleonora's {{interest}} in architecture and {{her love of}} music, while she was sentimentally devoted to her husband. Often, she lamented that she never had her hero for herself. Foreign ambassadors found her gracious and beautiful and she had good taste, although her character showed some extravagant traits. Maria Eleonora had a definite liking for entertainment and sweetmeats, and she soon succumbed to the current fashionable craze for buffoons and dwarfs. She spoke French, the court language of the age, but <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to learn to write German or Swedish correctly.|$|E
25|$|Recto's {{leadership}} was the curious kind that only finds fulfillment from {{being at the}} periphery of power, and not from being its fulcrum. It was the best occupation suited to the satirist that he was. His success at the polls would be limited, his ability to mold the minds of his contemporaries was only excelled by Rizal's...But he was admired for his intellect and his dogged determination to never let the opposition be bereft of a champion, still his opposition was flawed. For it was one that <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to transform itself into an opposition capable of taking power.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Portuguese took {{advantage}} of the Catalan revolt to declare their own independence in 1640. The 60 years of union between Portugal and Spain were not happy. The Portuguese fluent Philip II visited the country twice, but Philip III only once, in a short formal visit, and Philip IV <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to. The Spanish, hard pressed elsewhere, were blamed for inadequately protecting Portugal's overseas colonies from the Dutch (who annexed part of Brazil), and in a time of economic downturn, the Spanish colonies did not enjoy having to trade and compete with their Portuguese counterparts. Moreover, Portugal's autonomous status as an equal in the union went into decline after Philip II and was treated increasingly in the great councils of state as a province. After Portugal declared independence and chose the Duke of Braganza as King John IV, Spain was distracted with a Revolt in Andalusia and thus chose to not do anything about it.|$|E
25|$|Though Knoop {{of course}} {{had been only}} four {{at the time of}} the battle, so he had no {{personal}} knowledge, he could avail himself of the recollections of many Dutch veterans who had been there, and as a general-staff member he had access to the after-battle reports the Dutch units had made within two days after the battle ended. (These archived reports could have been made available to Siborne, and in one case he appears to have been in actual possession of one, but he <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to consult them). As a trained historian, Knoop now started to research these sources and wrote a detailed repudiation of Siborne's book based on all these sources. This book (published with the explicit consent of King William II as a semi-official rebuttal), was received with much enthusiasm in Dutch military circles. When soon thereafter there was a false rumor in the Dutch press that captain Siborne was on his way to demand satisfaction, no less than six officers of horse-artillery spontaneoulsy offered to act as Knoop's seconds, if necessary. But Siborne stayed safely in England.|$|E
25|$|Jungner {{had invented}} a nickel–iron battery {{the same year}} as his Ni-Cad battery, but found it to be {{inferior}} to its cadmium counterpart and, as a consequence, <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> patenting it. It produced a lot more hydrogen gas when being charged, meaning it could not be sealed, and the charging process was less efficient (it was, however, cheaper). However, Thomas Edison picked up Jungner's nickel-iron battery design, patented it himself and sold it in 1903. Edison wanted to commercialise a more lightweight and durable substitute for the lead-acid battery that powered some early automobiles, and hoped that by doing so electric cars would become the standard, with his firm as its main battery vendor. However, customers found his first model to be prone to leakage and short battery life, and it did not outperform the lead-acid cell by much either. Although Edison was able to produce a more reliable and powerful model seven years later, by this time the inexpensive and reliable Model T Ford had made gasoline engine cars the standard. Nevertheless, Edison's battery achieved great success in other applications such as electric and diesel-electric rail vehicles, providing backup power for railroad crossing signals, or to provide power for the lamps used in mines.|$|E

500|$|Lat's artistic {{skills were}} {{cultivated}} from youth and self-taught. [...] The cartoonist believes he inherited the talent and interest from his father, who doodled {{as a hobby}} and was notorious for his sense of humour as the [...] "village jester". [...] Lat says his siblings were also gifted in drawing, but they <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to develop their talents. [...] His parents actively encouraged him to develop his artistic skills, although his father occasionally {{told him not to}} make a career of it. [...] He also received encouragement from outside his family; Lat's primary school teacher Mrs Moira Hew (the inspiration for one of his characters, the Butterfly-Glassed Lady), helped nurture his gift, frequently asking him to illustrate lessons in class. [...] Her teachings expanded Lat's mind and made him more receptive to ideas that looked beyond his kampung.|$|E
500|$|After his mother's {{death when}} he was 18, Gibson left school without graduating and became very {{isolated}} for a long time, traveling to California and Europe, and immersing himself in the counterculture. In 1967, he elected to move to Canada in order [...] "to avoid the Vietnam war draft". At his draft hearing, he honestly informed interviewers that his intention in life was to sample every mind-altering substance in existence. Gibson has observed that he [...] "did not literally evade the draft, as they <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> drafting me"; after the hearing he went home and purchased a bus ticket to Toronto, and left {{a week or two}} later. In the biographical documentary No Maps for These Territories (2000), Gibson said that his decision was motivated less by conscientious objection than by a desire to [...] "sleep with hippie chicks" [...] and indulge in hashish.

The opening and closing choruses of Let It Go end with a sly, spat-out refrain: 'The cold <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> me anyway!' You go, girl." [...] Nasim Asl of The Oxford Student continued, [...] "Menzel, especially, steals the show with her performance of 'Let It Go'. Her Wicked-esque belting out works perfectly with such an incredible animated sequence—the building of the ice castle really demonstrates the prowess of Disney animation, and results in, arguably, {{one of the most}} spectacular power ballads seen by any animated character, ever." ...|$|E

500|$|The armored {{task force}} fared little better, losing {{many of its}} {{vehicles}} to [...] breakdowns or ambushes. During the retreat, the task force lost 60 percent of its tanks and half of its APCs. It also abandoned 54 105mm and 28 155mm howitzers. This equipment then had to be destroyed by U.S. aircraft {{in order to prevent}} its capture and reuse by the PAVN. Covering the retreat on Route 9 was the 1st Armored Brigade, which had been assigned to the ARVN Airborne Division. When informed by a prisoner that two North Vietnamese regiments waited in ambush ahead, the commander of the brigade, Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, notified General Đống of the situation. The Airborne commander airmobiled forces in and cleared the road, but <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> to inform Colonel Luat. In order to avoid destruction on Route 9, Luat then ordered the column to abandon the road only five miles from the South Vietnamese border and plunged onto a jungle trail looking for an unguarded way back.|$|E
500|$|In July 1935, Le Mesurier {{was hired}} by the Oldham {{repertory}} company, based at the Coliseum Theatre; his first appearance with them was in a version of the Wilson Collison play, Up in Mabel's Room; he was sacked after one week for missing a performance after oversleeping. In September 1935, he moved to the Sheffield Repertory Theatre to appear in Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, and also played Malvolio in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Le Mesurier later commented on the slow progress of his career: [...] "had I known {{it was going to take}} so long, I might well have given the whole thing up". In 1937 he joined the Croydon Repertory Theatre, where he appeared in nine productions in 1936 and 1937. During this period Le Mesurier changed his professional name from John Halliley to John Le Mesurier; his biographer Graham McCann observes that [...] "he <b>never</b> <b>bothered,</b> at least in public, to explain the reason for his decision". Le Mesurier used his new name for the first time in the September 1937 production of Love on the Dole.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} {{head when}} Ernest {{returned}} for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The 50-years-younger prince settled things with what Albert described as a [...] "strong push", and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred {{on the grounds that they}} might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, [...] "When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they <b>never</b> <b>bothered</b> me." [...] Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, [...] "Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs." [...] This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, [...] "No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!" [...] The Queen also recorded that though King Ernest greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak.|$|E
