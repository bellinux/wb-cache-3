30|$|The {{sequences}} for {{the assessment}} should be selected from terrestrial broadcasting content because of the issues discussed above. However, {{it is not easy}} to find appropriate sequences in actual broadcasting content. The appropriate sequences must have very high frequency elements that are details in images that have <b>no</b> <b>panning.</b> Since panning causes motion blur in the whole image on the display, there are no high-frequency elements in the image at all. Blurry video sequences are thus of no use to assessments seeking to determine how high the resolution of an image is on a display. In accordance with the above considerations, we recorded various pieces of terrestrial HDTV broadcasting content onto a Blu-ray Disc (BD) player (capable of showing 1, 920 × 1, 080 i/ 59.94 -Hz HDTV video) and conducted many subjective assessments on them in order to select the appropriate sequences. Five sequences, each lasting from 10 to 15 s, were selected. The sequences are described in Section 3.2.|$|R

The model reproduces observed <b>NO</b> and <b>PAN</b> concentrations {{to within a}} factor of 2 {{for a wide range}} of tropospheric regions including the upper troposphere but tends to overestimate HNO 3 concentrations in the remote troposphere (sometimes several fold). This discrepancy implies a missing sink for HNO 3 that does not lead to rapid recycling of NO x; only in the upper troposphere over the tropical South Atlantic would a fast conversion of HNO 3 to NO x improve the model simulation for NO x. Observed concentrations of acetone are reproduced in the model by including a large biogenic source (15 Tg C yr - 1), which accounts for 40 % of the estimated global source of acetone (37 Tg [...] ...|$|R
