5|$|The {{presence}} of outlying records at Kaltukatjara (south-western Northern Territory), Mount Isa (<b>north-western</b> Queensland) {{and the area}} south of Bourke (<b>north-western</b> New South Wales) indicate that the bristle-faced free-tailed bat may have a greater distribution in the arid and semi-arid regions of NSW, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia than available records indicate. However its range and status remain relatively poorly known. In 2008 it had been recorded at 26 localities and few additional locations have been recorded in subsequent years.|$|E

5|$|On 11March 1944, No.84 Squadron was hurriedly redeployed to <b>North-Western</b> Area {{to replace}} the Supermarine Spitfires of No.1 Wing, which had been {{despatched}} to Perth {{in response to a}} feared Japanese naval attack. No attack took place, and No.84 Squadron returned to Horn Island less than two weeks later. On 17May, the squadron departed Horn Island for Townsville, and was subsequently reduced to cadre. No.7 Squadron continued operations in the Dutch East Indies from Higgins, generally in conjunction with other forces such as B-25 Mitchells from <b>North-Western</b> Area, before its tasking was reduced in August pending transfer to No.71 Wing in New Guinea. No.23 Squadron was equipped with A-31 Vengeance dive bombers and undertook army-cooperation duties out of Higgins until being declared non-operational in June. That month, a squadron leader from North-Eastern Area Command arrived at No.75 Wing headquarters to investigate Vengeance accidents and unserviceability; on departure his Vengeance crash-landed on the beach at Princess Charlotte Bay and the crew had to be rescued by an aircraft of No.9 Squadron. No.23 Squadron was subsequently re-equipped with B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and transferred to <b>North-Western</b> Area.|$|E

25|$|Up to 1899, Northern Rhodesia {{outside of}} Barotseland was governed {{according}} to the Order-in-Council of 9 May 1891, which did not fix clear boundaries to the area involved.

The former was recognised as British territory by the Barotseland and <b>North-Western</b> Rhodesia Order-in-Council of 1899 and the later by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order-in-Council of 1900. Both Orders-in-Council regularised {{the position of the}} BSAC Administrators, the first of whom for North- Eastern Rhodesia was appointed in 1895.
