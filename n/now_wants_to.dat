Oscar <b>now</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{join forces with}} his brother, Benjamin, to construct a cotton mill. They need an additional $75,000 and approach Regina, asking her {{to invest in the}} project. Oscar initially proposes marriage between his son Leo and Regina's daughter Alexandra—first cousins—as a means of getting Horace's money, but Horace and Alexandra are repulsed by the suggestion. Horace refuses when Regina asks him outright for the money, so Leo, a bank teller, is pressured into stealing Horace's railroad bonds from the bank's safe deposit box.|$|E
25|$|The Roman general Messala and {{his troops}} {{have come to}} track down the British king Arvire and bring him captive to the Emperor Claudius in Rome. Princes Irvin and Vellinus enter and tell the Romans their search is in vain: in his hiding place on Mona, Arvire can never be caught. Messala replies that Arvire might be taken by cunning and asks the princes to help him: their mother, Queen Élfrida, has already become an ally of Rome. Vellinus agrees to betray Arvire, {{although}} Irvin is outraged at his brother's behaviour. The brothers leave as the Druids arrive to perform their sacred ritual. Modred, the Chief Druid, says they must do all they can to protect Arvire from the Romans. Arvire enters, accompanied by his daughter Évélina. Arvire is in despair: after his defeat in battle, the Romans captured his wife. Some of the Druids bring in Irvin and Vellinus, whom they have found lurking nearby. Vellinus says they have come with news from their mother, the Queen of Lenox, who <b>now</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> aid Arvire against the Romans. They must bring Arvire back with them to lead the army. Vellinus even claims that he himself has fought the Romans and freed Arvire's wife. Arvire is delighted and eagerly leaves with Vellinus.|$|E

He is {{divorced}} from her mother, and wants to put Twilight into the time capsule to impress her. Leslie <b>now</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> include it, but Ben (Adam Scott) says if she makes one exception, everyone will want their own item in the capsule. Leslie decides to hold a public meeting so all citizens can make suggestions for capsule items. The meeting descends into chaos when the participants argue over what to include and make absurd suggestions, like human ashes and dead cats. Conservative activist Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) argues Twilight should not be included because it is too anti-Christian, while a civil liberties organization member says that the book isn't suitable because it is pro-Christian. Leslie tries to compromise by making multiple time capsules, but she ultimately decides to stick to one capsule and include nothing except a video recording of the meeting, which she said represents Pawnee because it shows [...] "a {{lot of people with}} a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in". Ben, a visiting state auditor, says he thinks the residents of Pawnee are strange, but he is impressed by their passion.|$|E

2500|$|Bernard takes {{a holiday}} with Lenina outside the World State to a Savage Reservation in New Mexico, {{in which the}} two observe natural-born people, disease, the aging process, other languages, and {{religious}} lifestyles for the first time. (The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the Anasazi, including the Puebloan peoples of Acoma, Laguna and Zuni.) Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She too visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow-holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard's boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda's lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only two books in her possession: a scientific manual and the complete works of Shakespeare. Ostracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, especially the tragedies of Othello, Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet. Linda <b>now</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> return to London, and John too wants to see this [...] "brave new world". Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back.
