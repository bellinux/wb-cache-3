We have cloned 97 <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> and characterized 10 Nef proteins from autopsy brain and lymphoid tissues from 2 patients with AIDS and HIV- 1 -associated dementia. Distinct compartmentalization of brain versus lymphoid <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> was demonstrated within each patient. CD 4 and MHC-I downregulation were conserved in all tissue-derived Nefs. However, MHC-I downregulation by brain-derived Nefs was weaker than downregulation by lymphoid-derived Nefs. The motifs KEEE- or EKEE- at the PACS- 1 binding site represented brain-specific signature patterns in these 2 patients and contributed to the reduced MHC-I downregulation activity of brain-derived Nefs from these patients. Pak 2 association was highly variable in Nefs from both patients. Three of 10 tissue-derived Nefs coimmunoprecipitated activated Pak 2, with strong association demonstrated for only 2 Nefs. The ability of Nef to associate with activated Pak 2 did not correlate with brain or lymphoid tissue origin. <b>Nef</b> <b>genes</b> from viruses isolated from brain by coculture with PBMC were not closely related to sequences amplified directly from brain tissue, suggesting that viral selection or adaptation occurred during coculture.

The function of HIV- 1 group M subtype B nef alleles has been extensively studied, {{and a variety of}} in vitro activities believed to be important for viral pathogenesis have been established. However, the function of nef alleles derived from naturally simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -infected chimpanzees, the original host of HIV- 1, or from the HIV- 1 N and O groups resulting from independent zoonotic transmissions remains to be investigated. In the present study we demonstrate that SIVcpz and HIV- 1 group N or O nef alleles down-modulate CD 4, CD 28, and class I or II MHC molecules and up-regulate surface expression of the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Furthermore, the ability of Nef to interact with the p 21 -activated kinase 2 was generally conserved. The functional activity of HIV- 1 group N and O <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> did not differ significantly from group M nef alleles.

40|$|Nef is a {{multifunctional}} accessory protein of primate lentiviruses. Recently, it {{has been}} shown that the ability of Nef to downmodulate CD 4, CD 28, and class I major histocompatibility complex is highly conserved between most or all primate lentiviruses, whereas Nef-mediated downregulation of T-cell receptor-CD 3 was lost in the lineage that gave rise to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Whether or not other Nef activities are preserved between different groups of primate lentiviruses remained to be determined. Here, we show that <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> from a large variety of HIVs and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) enhance virion infectivity and stimulate viral replication in human cells and/or in ex vivo infected human lymphoid tissue (HLT). Notably, nef alleles from unpassaged SIVcpz and SIVsmm enhanced viral infectivity, replication, and cytopathicity in cell culture and in ex vivo infected HLT as efficiently as those from HIV- 1 and HIV- 2, their human counterparts. Furthermore, <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> from several highly divergent SIVs that have not been found in humans were also highly active in human cells and/or tissues. Thus, most primate lentiviral Nefs enhance virion infectivity and stimulate viral replication. Moreover, our data show that SIVcpz and SIVsmm Nefs do not require adaptive changes to perform these functions in human cells or tissues and support the idea that nef alleles from other primate lentiviruses would also be capable of promoting efficient virus spread in humans...|$|R

As an attempt to elucidate the function of nef, we characterized the nucleotide and corresponding protein sequences of naturally occurring <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> obtained from several HIV- 1 -infected individuals. A consensus Nef sequence was derived and used to identify several features that were highly conserved among the Nef sequences. These features included a nearly invariant myristylation signal, regions of sequence polymorphism and variable duplication, a region with an acidic charge, a (Pxx) 4 repeat sequence, and a potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site. Clustering of premature stop codons at position 124 was noted in 6 of the 54 Nef sequences. Further analysis revealed four stretches of residues that were highly conserved not only among the patient-derived HIV- 1 Nef sequences, but also among the Nef sequences of HIV- 2 and the SIVs, suggesting that Nef proteins expressed by these retroviruses are functionally equivalent. The "Nef-defining" sequences were {{used to evaluate the}} sequence alignments of known proteins reported to share sequence similarity with Nef sequences and to conduct additional computer-based searches for similar protein sequences.

Analysis of the sequences deposited in the Los Alamos HIV sequences database (www. hiv. lanl. gov) indicated that the most frequent motif at the MHC- 1 downregulation site in the subtype B strain is R(86 %) A(64 %) E(82 %) (n = 1040) and R(78 %) T(74 %) E(56 %) in the subtype C strain (n = 549). Conversely, the Brazilian subtype B isolates presented the motif R(81 %) T(62 %) E(67 %) at this site (n = 64).

40|$|Objectives: Evaluation of {{sequence}} {{evolution as}} well as structural defects and mutations of the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> in relation to disease progression in infected children. Design: We examined {{a large number of}} nef alleles sequentially derived from perinatally HIV- 1 -infected children with different rates of disease progression: six non-progressors (NPs), four rapid progressors (RPs), and three slow progressors (SPs). Methods: Nef alleles (182 total) were isolated from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sequenced and analysed for their evolutionary pattern, frequency of mutations and occurrence of amino acid variations associated with different stages of disease. Results: The evolution rate of the <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> apparently correlated with CD 4 + decline in all progression groups. Evidence for rapid viral turnover and positive selection for changes were found only in two SPs and two RPs respectively. In NPs, a higher proportion of disrupted sequences and mutations at various functional motifs were observed. Furthermore, NP-derived Nef proteins were often changed at residues localized in the folded core domain at cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes (E- 105, K- 106, E- 110, Y- 132, K- 164, and R- 200), while other residues outside the core domain are more often changed in RPs (A(43)) and SPs (N- 173 and Y- 214).

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of gross deletions {{in the human}} immunodeficiency virus <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> (gΔnef) is associated with long-term nonprogression of infected patients. Here, we investigated how quickly genetic defects in the <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> are associated with Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) intake in 10 long-term slow progressors. Methods: This study was divided into three phases over a 20 -yr period; baseline, KRG intake alone, and KRG plus {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (ART). <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> amplicons were obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR from 10 long-term slow progressors (n =  1, 396), and nested PCR from 36 control patients (n =  198), and 28 ART patients (n =  157), and these were then sequenced. The proportion of gΔnef, premature stop codons, and not in-frame insertion or deletion of a nucleotide was compared between three phases, control, and ART patients. Results: The proportion of defective nef genes was significantly higher in on-KRG patients (15. 6 %) than in baseline (5. 7 %), control (5. 6 %), on-KRG plus ART phase (7. 8 %), and on-ART patients (6. 6 %; p <  0. 01).

We and others have previously shown that expression of Nef in cells bearing surface CD 4 results in a sustained decrease in surface CD 4 expression. This was demonstrated for Nef from two laboratory strains of HIV- 1, Bru and SF 2. Because both of these isolates were passaged in vitro prior to molecular cloning and in vitro passage can result in mutations which might alter <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> function, we have analyzed two primary isolates of Nef {{for their ability to}} suppress cell surface CD 4 expression. The nef genes of HIV- 1 isolates from two patients with fewer than 200 CD 4 + T cells per mm 3 of blood were introduced into human and mouse T-cell lines by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Expression of Nef from both isolates correlated with a decrease in surface expression of both human and mouse CD 4. To determine whether the ability to suppress surface CD 4 expression is a general function of Nef, we also tested an artificially generated consensus <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> derived from analysis of 54 patient isolates of HIV- 1.

From phylogenetic analysis, it was concluded that part of the non-recombinant <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> might have actually been amplified from mosaic viruses: CRF 06 _cpx, CRF 14 _BG, and a new envA/nefJ recombinant. While comparing all the putative Nef sequences, significant amino acid sequence variability was observed. However, most of the described nef functional motifs were relatively well conserved in the majority of the sequences analyzed and numerous amino acid changes fell outside these regions. The results presented unambiguously endorse the high level of complexity of HIV- 1 epidemics in Portugal...|$|R
30|$|There was {{agreement}} among the analytic tools in inferring subtypes and recombination patterns {{for some of the}} genes regions and not for others. For example, jPHMM indicated the presence of subtype A 1 sequences in the IN gene in addition to subtype C sequences; and also the presence subtype K sequences in the pol gene. The jPHMM indicated the presence of subtype J sequences in the pol gene in contrast to CRF 11 _cpx indicated by phylogenetic analysis and REGA. This discrepancy can however be reconciled in that subtype J sequences constitute a significant component of CRF 11 _cpx viruses. Consequently, the indication by phylogenetic analysis, REGA and Simplot tools of the presence of CRF 11 _cpx sequences in the pol gene, in addition to the assignment of the gag, env and <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> to subtype C overwhelmingly suggests that virus 08 MB 26 ZA harboured HIV- 1 subtype C and HIV- 1 CRF 11 _cpx sequences.|$|R
40|$|Deletion of the <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> from macaque simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIVmac) attenuates {{its ability to}} cause disease. Pathogenic viruses occasionally emerge in macaques infected with Nef-deleted SIVmac, with some genetic determinants mapping to the envelope (env) gene. An intriguing new study shows that these changes endow Env with a Nef-like ability to counteract tetherin/BST 2 (Serra-Moreno et al., 2011) ...|$|E
40|$|During {{productive}} {{infection of}} human T lymphocytes in cell culture, {{the expression of}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is temporally regulated by virus-encoded regulatory proteins. Among these Nef, whose function has not been clearly elucidated, is thought to alter CD 4 ÷ T cells. We examined {{the possibility that the}} nefgene interferes with the translation process in a ceU-free system. The results demonstrate that the <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> product mediates an inhibitory effect on protein syn-thesis. Conversely, the use of antisense nefmRNA did not affect translation. Further observations suggest that this inhibitory effect is an inherent property of the <b>nef</b> <b>gene</b> product itself and not of its mRNA. The data show that the translational repression directed by Nef is a general phenomenon, acting on its own and on other messengers used as reporter mRNAs. We propose that, as a consequence, Nef can {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of AIDS...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the infectivities and replicative capacities {{of a large}} panel of variants of the molecular human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) NL 4 - 3 clone that differ exclusively in the V 3 region of the viral envelope glycoprotein and the <b>nef</b> <b>gene.</b> Our results demonstrate that Nef enhances virion infectivity and HIV- 1 replication independently of the viral coreceptor tropism...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{several recent}} AIDS vaccine {{strategies}} have protected rhesus macaques against a pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) 89. 6 P challenge, similar approaches have provided only modest, transient reductions in viral burden after challenge with virulent, pathogenic SIV, {{which is more}} representative of HIV infection of people. We show here that priming with replicating adenovirus recombinants encoding SIV env/rev, gag, and/or <b>nef</b> <b>genes,</b> followed by boosting with SIV gp 120 or an SIV polypeptide mimicking the CD 4 binding region of the envelope, protects rhesus macaques from intrarectal infection with the highly pathogenic SIVmac 251. Using trend analysis, significant reductions in acute-phase and set point viremia were correlated with anti-gp 120 antibody and cellular immune responses, respectively. Within immunization groups exhibiting significant protection, a subset (39 %) of macaques have exhibited either no viremia, cleared viremia, or controlled viremia {{at the threshold of}} detection, now more than 40 weeks postchallenge. This combination prime-boost strategy, utilizing replication competent adenovirus, is a promising alternative for HIV vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAttempts {{to define}} the genetic {{determinants}} required for efficient growth of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) in monocyte-macrophages were made by constructing chimeras between two infectious clones of HIV- 1 (HXB 2 and LW/C), which despite only minor differences in their DNA sequence have striking differences in cell tropism. Although both of them replicate efficiently in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HXB 2 replicates extensively in permanent T cell lines but poorly in primary monocyte macrophages (T cell line tropic); {{the reverse is true}} for LW/C (macrophage tropic). The envelope proved to contain the major determinants of macrophage tropism. However, tropism determinants appeared to be scattered along the envelope. In particular, the V 3 loop alone appeared to be neither necessary nor sufficient for growth in macrophages. Both vpr and <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> appeared to play a less significant role to improve viral replication in macrophages, but only {{in the presence of the}} proper envelope sequences. HIV- 1 macrophage tropism thus appears to result from the contribution of several different determinants...|$|R
40|$|Efficient HIV {{vaccines}} have {{to trigger}} cell-mediated immunity directed against various viral antigens. However {{little is known}} about the breadth of the response induced by vaccines carrying multiple proteins. Here, we report on the immunogenicity of a construct harbouring a fusion of the HIV- 1 IIIB gag, pol and <b>nef</b> <b>genes</b> (gpn) designed for optimal safety and equimolar expression of the HIV proteins. The attenuated poxviruses, MVA and NYVAC, harbouring the gpn construct, induced potent immune responses in conventional mice characterised by stimulation of Gpn-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells and cytotoxic T cells. In HLA-A 2 transgenic mice, recombinant MVA elicited cytotoxic responses against epitopes recognised in most HLA-A 2 + HIV- 1 -infected individuals. We also found that the MVA vaccine triggered the in vitro expansion of peripheral blood cells isolated from a HIV- 1 -seropositive patient and with similar specificity as found in immunised HLA-A 2 transgenic mice. In conclusion, the synthetic HIV polyantigen Gpn delivered by MVA is immunogenic, efficiently processed and presented by human MHC class I molecules...|$|R
