5|$|Throughout the Midland Alliance's 20-year existence, the Regional League has {{accepted}} and, after the Midland League was re-formed, continues to accept applications for membership from successful teams in smaller local leagues within its catchment area. Leagues whose clubs {{have joined the}} Regional League include the Shropshire County League, the Herefordshire League, the Wolverhampton Combination, and the Kidderminster & District League. Several ambitious local Sunday league teams have also switched to Saturday play and entered the league. Bewdley Town, Bromyard Town and Ellesmere Rangers have all joined from county leagues since 1994 and subsequently gone on to gain promotion to the Premier Division. Regional League teams could also theoretically be relegated to the local leagues but in practice this almost <b>never</b> <b>happens.</b> The only teams in recent history to drop down to a county league have been Leominster Town, Kington Town and Hinton, who dropped down to the Herefordshire League in 2004, 2006 and 2007 respectively, although all three clubs resigned voluntarily in favour of playing in a more local league {{as opposed to being}} relegated due to finishing {{at the bottom of the}} table.|$|E

25|$|In {{representations}} of the Solar System, {{it is common to}} draw the trajectory of Earth {{from the point of view}} of the Sun, and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth. This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun's perspective. Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30km/s), this <b>never</b> <b>happens.</b> There are no rearward loops in the Moon's solar orbit.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{was quite}} easy to stack {{interconnections}} (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other—which almost <b>never</b> <b>happens</b> in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.|$|E
25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery <b>never</b> <b>happens.</b> The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E

[...] On May 5, 2015, Dave Magley, head coach and general manager of the Brampton A's during the season, was appointed by the league's Board of Governors to lead the investigation. He had already conducted interviews and spoken to representatives from both teams involved in the brawl. Magley also said that he would consider assuming the position of commissioner if he was approached, succeeding Paul Riley, who was fired in January 2015. Vito Frijia was named league spokesman during the investigation.|$|E
500|$|In his conclusion, Smith states {{his belief}} that modern {{politicians}} and military leaders use force where it has no utility and commit military forces without fully defined political and strategic objectives. He believes that politicians and generals remain in the mindset of industrial war, which leads them {{to prepare for a}} decisive confrontation that <b>never</b> <b>happens,</b> and he condemns them for failing to recognise the shift in the way wars are fought. Discussing humanitarian interventions, such as those in the Balkans, Smith does not argue against intervention, but believes that the intervention must be based on a full understanding of the conflict and a clear strategy with defined objectives. According to Smith, [...] "no act of force will ever be decisive" [...] because the aim of modern conflicts is to win the will of the people, which will not be achieved by battlefield victory alone. He argues that whereas, in the industrial war paradigm, war led to victory and thus to peace, in the modern paradigm confrontation leads to conflict, which then reverts to confrontation. He asserts that force {{is only part of the}} solution to modern conflicts; they require complex political and military solutions, which will subdue but not necessarily permanently end the conflict.|$|E

District of Columbia representative Eleanor Holmes Norton sent a letter to Pierson requesting a meeting to discuss the Gonzalez incident as well as other security breaches at the White House, saying: [...] "Before any action is taken, the first step must be to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the White House breach. The next step is to recognize that the area in front of the White House, including Lafayette Park, is a First Amendment area, which must not be taken away from District of Columbia residents and the millions of other Americans who visit each year." [...] New York representative Peter T. King said the incident was [...] "absolutely inexcusable", adding: [...] "This demands a full investigation, an investigation as to what happened, why it happened and what's being done to make sure it <b>never</b> <b>happens</b> again". Utah representative Jason Chaffetz said the incident was [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] and was just one of several security failings at the White House. Chaffetz said [...] "the Secret Service leadership has a lot of questions to answer", adding incredulously [...] "Was the door open?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Next, {{the choice}} of pole ratio τ1/τ2 {{is related to the}} phase margin of the {{feedback}} amplifier. where the gain flips sign, and this <b>never</b> <b>happens</b> in a two-pole system. If we know f180 for the amplifier at hand, the gain margin can be found approximately, but f180 then depends on the third and higher pole positions, as does the gain margin, unlike the estimate of phase margin, which is a two-pole estimate. [...] The procedure outlined in the Bode plot article is followed. Figure 5 is the Bode gain plot for the two-pole amplifier in the range of frequencies up to the second pole position. The assumption behind Figure 5 is that the frequency f0dB lies between the lowest pole at f1=1/(2πτ1) and the second pole at f2=1/(2πτ2). As indicated in Figure 5, this condition is satisfied for values ofα≥1.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2009, Google countered ongoing critics {{by stating}} that its {{scanning}} of books and putting them online would protect the world's cultural heritage; Google co-founder Sergey Brin stated, [...] "The famous Library of Alexandria burned three times, in 48BC, AD273 and AD640, as did the Library of Congress, where a fire in 1851 destroyed two-thirds of the collection. I hope such destruction <b>never</b> <b>happens</b> again, but history would suggest otherwise." [...] This characterization was rebuked by Pam Samuelson, UC Berkeley Professor of Law saying [...] "Libraries everywhere are terrified that Google will engage in price-gouging when setting prices for institutional subscriptions to GBS contents ... Brin forgot to mention another significant difference between GBS and traditional libraries: their policies on patron privacy. ... Google has been unwilling to make meaningful commitments to protect user privacy. Traditional libraries, by contrast, have been important guardians of patron privacy." [...] Others have denounced the settlement for neglecting to protect reader privacy.|$|E
2500|$|There are two inequivalent B12 icosahedra, I1 and I2, {{which are}} {{constructed}} by the B1–B5 and B8–B12 sites, respectively. A [...] "tube" [...] is another characteristic structure unit of ScB17C0.25. It extends along the c-axis and consists of B13, B14, B17 and B18 sites where B13 and B14 form 6-membered rings. B17 and B18 sites also form 6-membered rings; however, their mutual distances (0.985 Å for B17 and 0.955 Å for B18) are too short for a simultaneous occupation of the neighboring sites. Therefore, boron atoms occupy 2nd neighbor site forming a triangle. The occupancies of B17 and B18 sites should be 50%, but the structure analysis suggests larger values. The crystal structure viewed along the a-axis {{is shown in figure}} 20, which suggests that the ScB17C0.25 is a layered material. Two layers, respectively {{constructed by the}} icosahedra I1 and I2, alternatively stack along the c-axis. However, the ScB17C0.25 crystal is not layered. For example, during arc-melting, ScB17C0.25 needle crystals violently grow along the c-axis – this <b>never</b> <b>happens</b> in layered compounds. The crystal structure viewed along the c-axis is shown in figure 21a. The icosahedra I1 and I2 form a ring centered by the [...] "tube" [...] shown in figure 21b, which probably governs the properties of the ScB17C0.25 crystal. B/C15 and B/C16 mixed-occupancy sites interconnect the rings. A structural similarity can be seen between ScB17C0.25 and BeB3.|$|E
