A crown graph is formed by removing a perfect matching from a complete bipartite graph Kn,n; it has 2n vertices of two colors, and each vertex of one color is connected to {{all but one of}} the vertices of the other color. In the case of the ménage problem, the vertices of the graph represent men and women, and the edges represent pairs of men and women who are allowed to sit next to each other.

Some structures operate under the safe-life design principle, where an extremely low level of risk is accepted {{through a combination of}} testing and analysis that the part will ever form a detectable crack due to fatigue during the service life of the part. This is achieved through a significant reduction of stresses below the typical fatigue capability of the part. Safe-life structures are employed when the cost or infeasibility of inspections outweighs the weight penalty and development costs associated with safe-life structures. [...] An example of a safe-life component is the helicopter rotor blade.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} thesis is to predict the response of inelastic materials under {{a large number of}} cycles, while simulating a much smaller number. For coupled viscoelastic-viscoplastic (VE-VP) homogeneous solids subjected to large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycles,</b> a two-scale time homogenization formulation and the corresponding algorithms are proposed. The main aim is to predict the long time response while reducing the computational cost considerably. The method is based on the definition of macro and micro-chronological time scales, and on asymptotic expansions of the unknown variables. First, the VE-VP constitutive model is formulated based on a thermodynamical framework. Next, the original VE-VP initial-boundary value problem is decomposed into coupled micro-chronological (fast time scale) and macro-chronological (slow time-scale) problems. The former is purely VE, and solved once for each macro time step, whereas the latter problem is nonlinear and solved iteratively using fully implicit time integration. For micro-scale time averaging, one-point and multi-point integration algorithms are developed. Several numerical simulations on uniaxial and multiaxial cyclic loadings illustrate the computational efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed methods. For composite materials, a multiscale computational strategy is proposed for the analysis of structures, which are described at a refined level both in space and in time. The proposal is applied to two-phase VE-VP composite materials subjected to large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycles.</b> The main aim is to predict the effective long time response while reducing the computational cost considerably. The proposed computational framework is a combination of the mean-field space homogenization based on the generalized incrementally affine formulation for VE-VP composites, and the asymptotic time homogenization approach for coupled VE-VP homogeneous solids under large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycles.</b> The time homogenization method is based on the definition of micro- and macro-chronological time scales, and on asymptotic expansions of the unknown variables. Firstly, the original anisotropic VE-VP initial-boundary value problem of the composite material is decomposed into coupled micro-chronological (fast time scale) and macro-chronological (slow time-scale) problems. The former corresponds to a VE composite, and is solved once for each macro time step, whereas the latter problem is a nonlinear composite and solved iteratively using fully implicit time integration. Secondly, mean-field space homogenization is used for both micro- and macro-chronological problems to determine the micro- and macro-chronological effective behavior of the composite material. The response of the matrix material is VE-VP with J 2 flow theory assuming small strains. The formulation exploits the return-mapping algorithm for the J 2 model, with its two steps: viscoelastic predictor and plastic corrections. The proposal is implemented for an extended Mori-Tanaka scheme for a number of polymer composite materials subjected to large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycles.</b> An extension of the two-scale time homogenization approach to VEVP homogeneous materials coupled with ductile damage (VE-VP-D) under large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> is proposed. An asymptotic approach allows to decouple the boundary problem into macro-chronological and micro-chronological problems. A different multiscale decomposition is introduced to account for irreversible inelastic deformation. The method is applied to the fatigue of thermoplastic polymers.
