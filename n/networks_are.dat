40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} constructing bearing rigid networks in arbitrary dimensions. We first show that the bearing rigidity of a <b>network</b> <b>is</b> a generic property that is critically determined by the underlying graph of the network. A new notion termed generic bearing rigidity is defined for graphs. If the underlying graph of a <b>network</b> <b>is</b> generically bearing rigid, then the <b>network</b> <b>is</b> bearing rigid for almost all configurations; otherwise, the <b>network</b> <b>is</b> not bearing rigid for any configuration. As a result, the key to construct bearing rigid <b>networks</b> <b>is</b> to construct generically bearing rigid graphs. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to prove that Laman graphs, which can be generated by the Henneberg construction, are generically bearing rigid in arbitrary dimensions. As a consequence, if the underlying graph of a <b>network</b> <b>is</b> Laman, the <b>network</b> <b>is</b> bearing rigid for almost all configurations in arbitrary dimensions.
