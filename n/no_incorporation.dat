A number of researchers have hypothesized that abiotic <b>NO</b> 3 <b>incorporation</b> into soil organic matter might be responsible for this phenomenon, however stud-ies have been limited to a few temperate forest sites. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine if abiotic <b>NO</b> 3 – <b>incorporation</b> is important across a wide range of soil types. We collected 44 soils from a number of different ecosystem types in North and South America and measured the extent of abiotic <b>NO</b> 3 – <b>incorporation.</b> Significant abiotic nitrate incorporation did not occur in any of the soils examined. We show that the apparent abiotic incorporation observed in previous studies is likely the result of iron interference with NO 3 – measurements.
