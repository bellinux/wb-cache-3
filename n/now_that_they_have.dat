25|$|Of {{the various}} {{resulting}} 1984 spinoffs, only BellSouth actively used and promoted the Bell name and logo during its entire history, from the 1984 break-up to its merger {{with the new}} AT in 2006. Similarly, cessation of using either the Bell name or logo occurred {{for many of the}} other companies more than a decade after the 1984 break-up as part of an acquisition-related rebranding. The others have only used the marks on rare occasions to maintain their trademark rights, even less <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> adopted names conceived long after divestiture. Examples include Verizon, which still used the Bell logo on its trucks and payphones until it updated its own logo in 2015, and Qwest, formerly US West, which licenses the Northwestern Bell and Mountain Bell names to Unical Enterprises, who makes telephones under the Northwestern Bell name.|$|E

As tradition ever since, Arsenal goalkeepers have always washed their jerseys before each game. The Arsenal captain, Buchan, praised the Cardiff team saying [...] "My congratulations to Cardiff City on being the first club in history to take the Cup out of England. We did our very utmost to prevent them from doing so, but we did not succeed. As, however, the trophy is gone to Cardiff, there is no one who more heartily congratualtes them than the captain of the losers. Cardiff played an honest, clean game, each member of the team obviously striving to do his utmost and my final works are Good luck to the City and good luck to Wales and its Association football <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the Cup." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, the United States and France, {{pressured}} Armenia and Azerbaijan {{to agree}} on the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh. In September, Ter-Petrosyan stated his support of the [...] "step-by-step" [...] proposal, which included the return of the territories outside the NKAO borders. Ter-Petrosyan argued the normalization of relations with Azerbaijan and, therefore, the opening of the border with Turkey {{was the only way to}} significantly improve Armenia's economy. After the plan was publicized, he came up against strong opposition. The issue was [...] "important to the Armenians because of historical and psychological factors. After having been losing territories for centuries, the Armenians are reluctant to 'lose' Karabakh <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> won a war against Azerbaijan." [...] According to political scientist Vicken Cheterian, [...] "By calling for major concessions on Karabakh, Ter-Petrosyan was antagonizing the last forces that supported his rule, the army and the Karabakh elite, at a time when his popularity within the Armenian society was at its lowest." ...|$|E

500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{compared it}} to the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip", but said [...] "Camping" [...] was [...] "somewhat more of a placeholder". Kandell compared the characters' pressure to meet the city's expectations to those the show faces <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been renewed for a fourth season. ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas called it [...] "a fun episode, but also one that felt like sort of a pause, a chance to reset the pins". He compared the pressure on Leslie {{to come up with}} an idea on the harvest festival to pressure on the show's writing staff to follow up on the harvest festival story arc. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called it funny and charming, but also a low point in the season following seven excellent episodes. He said it depended too much on the show's romantic relationships, which he feels are growing stale, although he praised Rashida Jones's performance and the focus on the strong platonic relationship between Leslie and Ron.|$|E
500|$|As major Hollywood {{studios and}} audiences both become savvy to cult films, {{productions}} once limited to cult appeal have instead become popular hits, and cult directors have become hot properties known for more mainstream and accessible films. [...] Remarking {{on the popular}} trend of remaking cult films, Claude Brodesser-Akner of New York magazine states that Hollywood studios have been superstitiously hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia. [...] Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> finally become successful and mainstream, are too slick to attract a proper cult following, lack context, or are too easily found online. [...] In response, David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films, often using illegal distribution methods, which preserves the outlaw status of cult films. [...] Virtual spaces, such as online forums and fan sites, replace the traditional fanzines and newsletters. [...] Cult film fans consider themselves collectors, rather than consumers, as they associate consumers with mainstream, Hollywood audiences. [...] This collecting can {{take the place of}} fetishization of a single film. [...] Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like Rocky Horror, academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings. [...] Koven also identifies television shows, such as Twin Peaks, as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture. David Lynch himself has not ruled out another television series, as studios have become reluctant to take chances on non-mainstream ideas. [...] Despite this, the Alamo Drafthouse has capitalized on cult films and the surrounding culture through inspiration drawn from Rocky Horror and retro promotional gimmickry. [...] They sell out their shows regularly and have acquired a cult following of their own.|$|E
