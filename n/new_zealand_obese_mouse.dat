40|$|Dysregulation of {{fatty acid}} {{oxidation}} plays {{a pivotal role}} in the pathophysiology of obesity and insulin resistance. Medium- and short-chain- 3 -hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (SCHAD) (gene name, hadh) catalyze the third reaction of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation cascade, the oxidation of 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3 -ketoacyl-CoA, for medium- and short-chain fatty acids. We identified hadh as a putative obesity gene by comparison of two genome-wide scans, a quantitative trait locus analysis previously performed in the polygenic obese <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> and an earlier described small interfering RNA-mediated mutagenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. In the present study, we show that mice lacking SCHAD (hadh(-/-)) displayed a lower body weight and a reduced fat mass in comparison with hadh(+/+) mice under high-fat diet conditions, presumably due to an impaired fuel efficiency, the loss of acylcarnitines via the urine, and increased body temperature. Food intake, total energy expenditure, and locomotor activity were not altered in knockout mice. Hadh(-/-) mice exhibited normal fat tolerance at 20 C. However, during cold exposure, knockout mice were unable to clear triglycerides from the plasma and to maintain their normal body temperature, indicating that SCHAD {{plays an important role in}} adaptive thermogenesis. Blood glucose concentrations in the fasted and postprandial state were significantly lower in hadh(-/-) mice, whereas insulin levels were elevated. Accordingly, insulin secretion in response to glucose and glucose plus palmitate was elevated in isolated islets of knockout mice. Therefore, our data indicate that SCHAD is involved in thermogenesis, in the maintenance of body weight, and in the regulation of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion.

40|$|Blood {{vessels are}} dynamic miniorgans, which have several {{mechanisms}} of regulation. The old paradigm described the endothelium {{as a main}} regulator of vascular homeostasis through the release of vasoregulators. 1 Twenty-five years ago, Soltis and Cassis 2 introduced a new prototype of vessel regu-lation by demonstrating a decreased response of rat thoracic aorta rings to the vasoconstrictor norepinephrine in the pres-ence of the perivascular fat. These pioneering studies, which reversed the trend to disregard adipose tissue around vessels, led to the eventual discovery of adipocyte-derived relaxing fac-tor (ADRF). 3 – 5 ADRF {{has been shown to}} inhibit the vasocon-striction of several humoral agents; however, its identity is still under study and it is likely that> 1 factor (molecule) represents ADRF. In obesity and hypertension, the actions of ADRF seem to be disturbed, thus contributing to a periadventitial vascular dysfunction. 6 – 8 This is indeed important in humans because severely obese patients who undergo bariatric surgery have a great improvement in the function of their perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). 9 The mechanism of action of ADRF relies on the opening of smooth muscle K+ channels, in particular, members of the voltage-gated (K v) K+ family. 3 Furthermore, recent stud-ies have helped to further delineate subclasses of the K v family as the potential critical mediators of the ADRF effects, namely K+ channels, which display pharmacological properties of (K v 7) KCNQ channels. 5 In addition, pharmacological openers of KCNQ channels mimic the effects of ADRF in a hyperten-sive rat model (spontaneously hypertensive rats) {{as well as in the}} <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese</b> <b>mouse</b> model of metabolic syndrome. 6 This short review will highlight the different mediators released from PVAT, which have an influence on the vascular tone of the arterial blood vessels.

One {{of the models}} to study the obesity and its entanglements is the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese</b> <b>mice</b> model. Aim {{of this study was}} to check the effect of high fat diet on changes in biochemical parameters as well as on process of angiogenesis in NZO mice. Methods NZO mice were fed with standard (ST) or high fat (HF) diet for seven weeks. Body weight and serum biochemical parameters were monitored. The PECAM 1 positive vessel-like structures immunostaining, as well as the gene expression of the matrigel penetrating cells by microarray (confirmed by real-time PCR method) were analyzed. Results Mice fed with HF diet developed obesity. Number of newly created vessels with lumen was correlated with hyperglycemia and animal weight gain. The number of PECAM 1 positive cells in matrigel tended to increase during HF diet. Microarray results revealed changes in gene expression (activation of the oxidative stress and insulin resistance, inhibition of apoptosis and cell differentiation), however without markers of endothelial cell network maturation.

Diabetes-susceptible <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese</b> <b>mice</b> were either 10 % calorie restricted (CR) or fasted every other day (IF), and compared to ad libitum (AL) fed control mice. AL mice showed a diabetes prevalence of 43 %, whereas mice under CR and IF were completely protected against hyperglycemia. Proteomic analysis of hepatic lipid droplets revealed significantly higher levels of PSMD 9 (co-activator Bridge- 1), MIF (macrophage migration inhibitor factor), TCEB 2 (transcription elongation factor B (SIII), polypeptide 2), ACY 1 (aminoacylase 1) and FABP 5 (fatty acid binding protein 5), and a marked reduction of GSTA 3 (glutathione S-transferase alpha 3) in samples of CR and IF mice. In addition, accumulation of diacylglycerols (DAGs) was significantly reduced in livers of IF mice (P= 0. 045) while CR mice showed a similar tendency (P= 0. 062). In particular, 9 DAG species were significantly reduced in response to IF, of which DAG- 40 : 4 and DAG- 40 : 7 also showed significant effects after CR. This was associated with a decreased PKCε activation and might explain the improved insulin sensitivity.

40|$|Obesity-induced {{hypertension}} is {{the most}} common cause of secondary hypertension in humans. The underlying mechanisms of increased systemic arterial resistance are not fully understood. In this thesis, the role of Kv channel subtype KCNQ in the regulation of vascular tone by periadventitial fat tissue (PVAT) was analyzed (1), as well as the role of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) (2) and Spinophilin (SPL) as regulator of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (3) in the control of vascular tone. The experiments focused on the enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), which catalyzes the formation of H 2 S from L-cysteine in PVAT, and novel KCNQ channel openers. Isometric contractility measurements were performed on sytemic arteries of rats and mice. Blood pressure was assessed by telemetry in mice. KCNQ channel opening proved to be a powerful mechanism for inducing vasorelaxation of systemic arteries in rats and mice. The channels also play an important role in the paracrine regulation of vascular tone by PVAT. A partial modulation by H 2 S seems to be present, as the paracrine effects could be mimicked by synthetic KCNQ channel openers in conditions of reduced H 2 S release. Synthetic KCNQ channel openers also reduced systemic blood pressure in normotensive and <b>obese</b> (<b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese)</b> <b>mice.</b> CSE-H 2 S seems to modulate the ADRF effect only in rat, but not in mouse aorta.

A genome-wide scan identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 associated with defective glucose-mediated insulin secretion.

The NZO Abcc 8 allele was associated with a ~ 211 bp deletion in its transcript and reduced expression of SUR 1. Transgenic NZO mice were generated that expressed the WT Abcc 8 /Kcnj 11 genes and displayed significant improvements in early-phase glucose-mediated insulin secretion and glucose tolerance, confirming Abcc 8 as a causative gene. Importantly, we showed that despite improving β-cell function in the NZO transgenic mice, there was no enhancement of insulin sensitivity or body weight.

Groups of normal (normoglycemic/normoinsulinemic), insulin-resistant (normoglycemic/hyperinsulinemic) and diabetic (hyperglycemic/hypoinsulinemic) mice were identified. Parental SJL-mice were used as control. Mice received high fat or standard diet. At 22 weeks, mice were killed and RNA isolated from liver. Differential gene expression of genes chosen for various reasons (array-analysis, literature search and gene localization near a diabetogenic locus) was assessed by Northern and Dot blotting. The data indicate that 1) insulin resistance is associated with increased expression of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and in fatty acid oxidation, whereas 2) gluconeogenic enzymes are not repressed, 3) high fat diet enhanced lipid synthesis, 4) several enzymes display sex dimorphism (SCPx, PLTP, Hsd 3 b 5). The gene expression in insulin resistance reflects a dissociation of the effects of insulin on genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in liver: insulin-resistant hepatic glucose production causes hyperinsulinemia, which then enhances lipogenesis and thus further aggravates insulin resistance in a circulus vitiosus.

The characterization of a subcongenic line carrying 14. 2 Mbp of Nob 3. 38 with a polymorphic region of 4. 4 Mbp indicates that the microdeletion and/or other polymorphisms in its proximity alter body weight, voluntary activity, and exploration.

Analysis of the 10 genes in the critical interval by sequencing, qRT–PCR, and RACE–PCR revealed a striking allelic variance of Zfp 69 encoding zinc finger domain transcription factor 69. In NZO and C 57 BL/ 6 J, a retrotransposon (IAPLTR 1 a) in intron 3 disrupted the gene by formation of a truncated mRNA that lacked the coding sequence for the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) and Znf-C 2 H 2 domains of Zfp 69, whereas the diabetogenic SJL, NON, and NZB alleles generated a normal mRNA. When combined with the B 6.

Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, assessed by pressurized myography, was impaired in NZO mice, not affected by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of endothelial NO synthase, and improved by the antioxidant Tempol, suggesting reduced NO bioavailability and increased oxidative stress. Dimer:monomer ratio of endothelial NO synthase was decreased in NZO mice compared with <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> black mice, suggesting endothelial NO synthase uncoupling. Furthermore, vascular superoxide and peroxynitrite production was increased, as well as adhesion molecule expression.

Obesity and hyperglycemia in the (NZO×B 6) F 2 intercross population were predominantly due to a broad quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 1 (Nob 3; logarithm of the odds score 16. 1, 16. 0, 4. 0 for body weight, body fat, and blood glucose, respectively), producing a difference between genotypes of 12. 7 or 5. 2 g of body weight and 12. 0 or 4. 0 g of body fat in females or males, respectively. In addition, significant QTL on chromosomes 3 and 13 and suggestive QTL on chromosomes 4, 6, 9, 12, 14, and 19 contributed to the obese phenotype. Distal chromosome 5 was significantly linked with plasma cholesterol (LOD score 10. 7). Introgression of two segments of Nob 3 into B 6 confirmed the adipogenic effect of the QTL and suggested the presence {{of at least one}} causal gene.

Approximately 50 % of NZO/HlLt males develop a chronic insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes syndrome associated with 2 unusual features: the presence of B lymphocyte–enriched peri-insular infiltrates and the development of anti-insulin receptor autoantibodies (AIRAs). To establish the potential pathogenic contributions ofBlymphocytes and AIRAs in this model, a disrupted immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (Igh- 6) congenic on the NZB/BlJ background was backcrossed 4 generations into the NZO/HlLt background and was then intercrossed to produce mice that initially segregated for wild-type versus the mutant Igh- 6 allele and thus permitted comparison of syndrome development. A new flow cytometric assay (AIRA binding to transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mouse insulin receptor) showed IgM and IgG subclass AIRAs in serum from Igh- 6 intact males, but not in Igh 6 null male serum. However, the absence of B lymphocytes and antibodies distinguishing mutant from wild-type males failed to significantly affect diabetes-free survival. The Igh 6 nullmales gained weight less rapidly than wild-type males, probably accounting for a retardation, but not prevention, of hyperglycemia. Thus, AIRA and the Blymphocyte component of the peri-insulitis in chronic diabetics were not essential either to development of insulin resistance or to eventual pancreatic beta cell failure and loss.

We tested whether replenishment of dietary BCAAs to an AA-diluted (AAD) diet is sufficient to reverse the glucoregulatory benefits of dietary PD. Methods: We conducted AA profiling of serum from healthy humans and lean and high fat-fed or <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>obese</b> (NZO) <b>mice</b> following dietary PD. We fed wildtype and NZO mice one of three amino acid defined diets: control, total AAD, or the same diet with complete levels of BCAAs (AAD + BCAA). We quantified serum AAs and characterized mice in terms of metabolic efficiency, body composition, glucose homeostasis, serum FGF 21, and tissue markers of the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTORC 1 signaling. Results: Serum BCAAs, while elevated in serum from hyperphagic NZO, were consistently reduced by dietary PD in humans and murine models. Repletion of dietary BCAAs modestly attenuated insulin sensitivity and metabolic efficiency in wildtype mice but did not restore hyperglycemia in NZO mice. While hepatic markers of the ISR such as P-eIF 2 α and FGF 21 were unabated by dietary BCAA repletion, hepatic and peripheral mTORC 1 signaling were fully or partially restored, independent of changes in circulating glucose or insulin.

During OGTTs, glucose clearance was normal but insulin levels were significantly higher in the B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) than in control mice. The liver fat content and plasma triacylglycerol levelswere significantly increased in B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) andNZO/B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) mice on a high-fat diet compared with controls.

Nob 1 contributed to higher body weight and insulin resistance (LOD-score for BMI > 11). The effect of Nob 1 on body weight and insulin resistance was enhanced by a high fat diet. Although a sole effect of the leptin receptor variant of the NZO mouse (LeprA 720 T/T 1044 I) on the development of obesity could not be observed, LeprNZO significantly contributed to higher body weight in combination with Nob 1. Furthermore, Nob 1 accelerated and aggravated the development of diabetes in carriers of the diabetogenic Nidd/SJL allele. The synergistic effects of the susceptibility locus for hyperglycemia and islet cell failure Nidd/SJL, and the obesity locus Nob 1 accounted for 90 % of the diabetes observed in the backcross population. The combined effects were dependent on a high dietary fat content. The data indicate that the decompensation of glucose homeostasis in the NZO mouse reflects the synergistic effects of diabetes (Nidd/SJL) and obesity genes (Nob 1). A susceptibility locus for hypercholesterolemia, but not obesity, insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, was located 44 cM distal from Nob 1 on the mouse chromosome 5 near D 5 Mit 244. Homozygous male and female carriers of the responsible NZO allele exhibited significantly elevated cholesterol levels. Although the cholesterol levels of mice raised on a standard diet were significantly lower compared to animals fed a high fat diet, the absolute effect of Chol 1 /NZO was not altered by the dietary fat content. It is suggested that the responsible gene is involved in the cholesterol metabolism...|$|R
40|$|<b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese</b> (NZO) <b>mice</b> {{exhibit a}} {{polygenic}} syndrome of morbid obesity, insulin resistance, and arterial hypertension that resembles the human metabolic syndrome. In addition, adult NZO-males are severely hyperglycemic and hypoinsulinemic. In order to localize the genes {{responsible for this}} polygenic syndrome, an outcross model of NZO mice with the lean, arteriosclerosis-resistant SJL strain was established. A total of 400 male backcross mice were monitored over a time period of 22 weeks (increment of body weight and body mass index, blood glucose, serum insulin, serum lipids). In a genome wide scan with more than 100 polymorphic microsatellite markers, a significant susceptibility locus (Nidd/SJL, LOD score > 8) for hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia was identified on the distal end of chromosome 4. This SJL-derived locus was responsible for a major part (60 %) of the total prevalence of diabetes in the backcross population, apparently concealing the effects of other NZO-derived diabetogenic genes. Nidd/SJL leads to a histologically detectable destruction of the b-cells in the islets of Langerhans. However, the diabetogenic allele does not affect obesity or serum insulin levels prior to the onset of diabetes. The allele appears to lower the threshold of obesity required {{for the development of}} the type 2 diabetes-like syndrome, and accelerates the onset of diabetes in mice with rapid weight gain. In the male backcross population, a high fat diet significantly enhanced the development of obesity as well as the diabetogenic effects of Nidd/SJL (difference in body weight approx. 12 g, onset of diabetes approx. 5 weeks earlier). A second diabetogenic locus (Nidd/NZO) was identified on mouse chromosome 15. The NZO-derived Nidd/NZO-allele seems to interact with Nidd/SJL in an additive manner; the combined effects of both alleles explain almost 90 % of the total prevalence of diabetes observed in the backcross. In conclusion, the present data localize a gene variant which, when present on an obese background, is responsible for a type 2 diabetes-like hyperglycemia. Furthermore, obesity and insulin resistance are required, but not sufficient, to produce diabetes in this mouse model. Additional diabetes genes which selectively cause b-cell degeneration are necessary for the type 2 diabetes-like decompensation of glucose homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|The {{vascular}} tone of peripheral resistance arteries {{regulates the}} systemic blood pressure. An increased systemic vascular resistance leads to arterial hypertension. The present dissertation {{deals with the}} novel mechanisms of regulation of small arteries {{to better understand the}} genesis of hypertension. In the present project has been clarified whether 1) the ATP-dependent potassium channel Kir 6. 1 and its regulators, the sulfonylurea receptor 2 and phosphodiesterase 3 A play a role in autosomal dominant hypertension and brachydactyly in humans, 2) adipocyte-derived relaxing factor (ADRF) plays a role in hypertension modell of genetically obese animal 3) and TRPC 1, a functional component of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDHF) KCa channel signal complex regulates the vascular function and blood pressure. In 1) a Turkish family with autosomal-dominant hypertension and brachydactyly was investigated. With interphase FISH a deletion, reinsertion and inversion in chromosome 12 has been found, the identified candidate genes for hypertension were: ATP-sensitive potassium channel Kir 6. 1 and its regulators, the sulfonylurea receptor 2 and phosphodiesterase 3 A. High levels of PDE 3 A mRNA were measured in the samples from three affected vessel. Three other affected patients showed normal parameters. Forearm infusion studies showed no differences in the responses to diazoxide, isoproterenol or milrinone. The results cast doubt on the role of Kir 6. 1 and SUR 2. The differences in the expression of PDE 3 A and responses to milrinone are probably the consequences of high blood pressure. In 2) were ADRF and adiponectin in Sprague-Dawley rats, wild-type and adiponectin gene-deficient mice (APN 1 -/ -) and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese</b> (NZO) <b>mice</b> tested. The results show that adiponectin is a novel humoral vasodilator, that Kv channels opens. It has been proven that ADRF shows a malfunction in NZO mice and ADRF with adiponectin not identical is. In 3) endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilations, KCa channel currents and smooth muscle contractility in TRPC 1 gene-deficient mice (TRPC 1 -/ -) were examined. The results demonstrate that TRPC 1 is a negative regulator of endothelial KCa channel dependent EDHF-type vasodilatation. Through this mechanism, TRPC 1 {{plays an important role in}} the systemic regulation of blood pressure. Our hypothesis is that TRPC 1 is a functional component of EDHF-KCa channel signal complex. The measurements show that inhibition of TRPC 1 increased EDHF-vasodilation and represents a new strategy for reducing systemic blood pressure. This new approach is accomplished without the involvement of Kir 6. 1 channels...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{data have}} {{identified}} leptin as an afferent signal in a negative-feedback loop regulating {{the mass of}} the adipose tissue. High leptin levels are observed in obese humans and rodents, suggesting that, in some cases, obesity is the result of leptin insensitivity. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the response to peripherally and centrally administered leptin among lean and three obese strains of mice: diet-induced <b>obese</b> AKR/J, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese</b> (NZO), and Ay. Subcutaneous leptin infusion to lean mice resulted in a dose-dependent loss of body weight at physiologic plasma levels. Chronic infusions of leptin intracerebroventricularly (i. c. v.) at doses of 3 ng/hr or greater resulted in complete depletion of visible adipose tissue, which was maintained throughout 30 days of continuous i. c. v. infusion. Direct measurement of energy balance indicated that leptin treatment did not increase total energy expenditure but prevented the decrease that follows reduced food intake. Diet-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> lost weight in response to peripheral leptin but were less sensitive than lean mice. NZO mice were unresponsive to peripheral leptin but were responsive to i. c. v. leptin. Ay mice did not respond to subcutaneous leptin and were 1 / 100 as sensitive to i. c. v. leptin. The decreased response to leptin in diet-induced obese, NZO, and Ay mice suggests that obesity in these strains is the result of leptin resistance. In NZO mice, leptin resistance {{may be the result of}} decreased transport of leptin into the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas in Ay mice, leptin resistance probably results from defects downstream of the leptin receptor in the hypothalamus...|$|R

40|$|Adipocytes release immune {{mediators}} {{that contribute}} to diabetes-associated inflammatory processes. As the stress protein heat shock protein 60 (Hsp 60) induces proinflammatory adipocyte activities, we hypothesized that adipocytes of diabetes-predisposed mice exhibit an increased proinflammatory reactivity to Hsp 60. Preadipocytes and mature adipocytes from nonobese diabetic (NOD), <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>obese</b> (NZO), and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were analyzed for Hsp 60 binding, Hsp 60 -activated signaling pathways, and Hsp 60 -induced release of the chemokine CXCL- 1 (KC), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and macrophage chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1). Hsp 60 showed specific binding to (pre-) adipocytes of NOD, NZO, and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Hsp 60 binding involved conserved binding structure(s) and Hsp 60 epitopes and was strongest to NZO mouse-derived mature adipocytes. Hsp 60 exposure induced KC, IL- 6, and MCP- 1 release from (pre-) adipocytes of all mouse strains with a pronounced increase of IL- 6 release from NZO mouse-derived adipocytes. Compared to NOD and C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse derived cells, Hsp 60 -induced formation of IL- 6, KC, and MCP- 1 from NZO mouse-derived (pre-) adipocytes strongly depended on NFκB-activation. Increased Hsp 60 binding and Hsp 60 -induced IL- 6 release by mature adipocytes of NZO mice suggest that enhanced adipocyte reactivity to the stress signal Hsp 60 contributes to inflammatory processes underlying diabetes associated with obesity and insulin resistance...|$|R

40|$|Obesity, a {{major risk}} factor for type II diabetes, is {{becoming}} more prevalent in Western populations consuming high calorie diets while expending less energy both at the workplace and at home. Most human obesity, and probably most type II diabetes as well, reflects polygenic rather than monogenic inheritance. We have genetically dissected a polygenic mouse model of obesity-driven type II diabetes by outcrossing the <b>obese,</b> diabetes-prone, NZO (<b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Obese)</b> /HlLt strain to the relatively lean NON (Nonobese Nondiabetic) /Lt strain, and then reciprocally backcrossing <b>obese</b> F 1 <b>mice</b> to the lean NON/Lt parental strain. A continuous distribution of body weights was observed in a population of 203 first backcross males. The 22 % of first backcross males developing overt diabetes showed highest peripubertal weight gains and earliest development of hyperinsulinemia. We report a complex diabetes-predisposing (“diabesity”) QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) on chromosome 1 contributing significant main effects to increases in body weight, plasma insulin, and plasma glucose. NZO contributed QTL with significant main effects on adiposity parameters on chromosomes 12 and 5. A NON QTL on chromosome 14 interacted epistatically with the NZO obesity QTL on chromosome 12 to increase adiposity. Although {{the main effect of}} the diabetogenic QTL on chromosome 1 was on rapid growth rather than adiposity, it interacted epistatically with the obesity QTL on chromosome 12 to increase plasma glucose levels. Additional complex epistatic interactions eliciting significant increases in body weight and/or plasma glucose were found between the NZO-contributed QTL on chromosome 1 and other NZO-contributed QTL on chromosomes 15 and 17, as well as with an NON-contributed QTL on chromosome 2. We further show that certain of these intergenic interactions are predicated on, or enhanced by, the maternal postparturitional environment. We show by cross-fostering experiments that the maternal environmental influence in part is {{because of the presence of}} early obesity-inducing factors in the milk of obese F 1 dams.

The present study used a mixed method design to explore the effects of a non-contact boxing-oriented training programme designed in terms of improvements to cardio-metabolic variables. Traditional recruitment strategies (media, referrals) were employed, with limited success leading to 3 adolescent boys (14 - 15 y) participating in the pilot intervention. Exercise sessions included 30 minutes of non-contact boxing training, followed by 30 minutes of progressive resistance training. Participants attended three 1 h training sessions each week, for a total of 12 weeks. Physiological variables included anthropometric indices, visceral fat thickness, central blood pressures, central arterial stiffness (augmentation index: AIx), and carotid arterial stiffness (?). Results revealed that there was no trend for change in body weight (125. 5 ± 12. 1 kg vs. 126. 5 ± 11. 0 kg) or BMI (39. 3 ± 4. 1 kg·m- 2 vs. 39. 0 ± 4. 6 kg·m- 2). However, there was a moderate decrease in visceral fat thickness (4. 34 ± 2. 51 cm vs 3. 65 ± 1. 11 cm, d = 0. 36). There was no change in central pulse pressure (38. 7 ± 7. 3 mmHg vs. 38. 3 ± 5. 0 mmHg), however, there was a small improvement in ? (3. 01 ± 0. 73 vs. 2. 87 ± 0. 84, d = 0. 18). Focus group interview data with participants and their parents were used to explore issues related to motivation to participation. Results revealed participants commented on how the programme has led to new friendships, changes to their physical appearance, and increased physical fitness. Parents commented on increased self-confidence, better performance in school, and a willingness to take part in new activities. In conclusion, it appears participating in the boxing oriented training programme was motivating to participants who engaged and had some physiological benefits in obese adolescent boys of M?ori and Pasifika descent. However, despite these positive attributes, poor recruitment rates suggest that future work should focus on identifying the barriers to engagement...|$|R
