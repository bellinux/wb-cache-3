50|$|Four {{tools are}} {{essential}} {{and several other}} tools are useful {{in the construction of}} wire wrapped jewelry. The basic tools are a flush cutter, round <b>nose</b> <b>pliers,</b> flat <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> and chain nose or bent chain <b>nose</b> <b>pliers.</b> A flush cutter is a special type of cutter that leaves one end of the cut wire flush or flat, while {{the opposite end of the}} cut wire is sharp or pointed. Round <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> are pliers with conical jaws and are used for making loops in wire. Chain nose or bent chain <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> have flat smooth jaws and are used for gripping and holding wire and for bending wire. Flat <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> are just what the name implies…they are flat on both inside surfaces and are used to keep areas flat or to make 90-degree bends in your wire.|$|E
50|$|Round <b>nose</b> <b>pliers,</b> rosary pliers or snub-nose pliers are a {{specialized}} plier characterized by their rounded, tapering jaws and {{most commonly used}} for creating loops in pieces of wire by electricians and jewellers. Some round <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> have insulated handles for safe electrical work, a spring-fitted joint and comfortable grips on the handles.|$|E

30|$|Fishing {{for live}} medium sized Scombrids was {{performed}} during the Australian summer and autumn months, between December and May, when large schools of pelagic fish migrate through the Sunshine Coast region in QLD, Australia. Rod and line fishing was {{the method of}} choice, using artificial lures (mainly metal slugs, 10 – 20  g), that were cast towards the surface of feeding schools. Medium-light spinning rods and reels were used, spooled with a 20  lb Dacron braid line and a 3  m long 25  lb fluorocarbon leader. The lures varied in size (35 – 60  mm) and in colour (reflecting white/blue/silver), to specifically match the baitfish that the fish were feeding upon. Single barbless hooks and long <b>nosed</b> <b>pliers</b> were used to ensure easy and fast release of the fish into the tubes when caught and to minimise handling and potential injury to the fish. Feeding schools were visualized by presence of tern and seagull flocks that were feeding on bait fish schools. Feeding fish were approached carefully {{in order to avoid}} any disturbance to the fish and the bait; specifically, the boat was positioned upwind a feeding school and then the engine was idled, so that the boat would drift quietly towards the feeding fish. Once in casting range (10 – 20  m), lures were cast towards the fish and quickly retrieved. Hooked fish were brought to the surface as soon as possible, landed using a “fish friendly”, knotless rubber net (Environet, Shimano) or a PVC sling lubricated with water based gel, unhooked while maintaining minimal contact with the skin of the fish and placed head first in the tuna tubes.|$|R
50|$|It also {{produces}} cutting pliers, linemen's pliers, long <b>nose</b> <b>pliers,</b> adjustable wrenches, screwdrivers, nutdrivers and special-purpose pliers, {{as well as}} multi-function tools for the fire service and other first responders. According to the company, , all of its pliers were manufactured at one of its two facilities in Meadville, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5000|$|Jack Bracelin's (Fiveacres Lights) {{created some}} of the light shows with {{equipment}} which ranged from 16mm projection of what we would now call 'art house' films (often projected sideways or projected into smoke) or 5 kW 'Pani's' (effects projectors) borrowed from Samuelsons at Pinewood or Elstree film studios (or Strand Electric at Vauxhall) to overhead projectors with transparent trays borrowed from refrigerators and filled with water/indian ink/beer/whatever. A favourite was to use 'Aldis' slide projectors with dual layer 2×2 glass specimen slides with basic designs created with wax crayons (drawn by Lou - the oft naked lady) and then various substances introduced with syringes - indian inks, snot, semen - in fact anything of imiscible viscosities. Bubbles made by injecting air between the glass plates which were then squeezed (by a pair of long <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> - {{in time to the}} music) would send folks even further off their heads! ...|$|E
30|$|Once captured, {{the fish}} must be handled {{as gently as}} possible, {{ensuring}} minimal contact with the skin. Scombrids lack the protection of large scales, and {{have a tendency to}} shed their scales when captured, which makes them more vulnerable to skin infections. When bracing the fish, for example, when heavy fish must be lifted to the boat, or when transferring the fish from the transport tank to the holding tank, it is often necessary to use PVC or vinyl slings covered with water based lubricant, which have shown to be effective and less harmful than nets or bare hands (Takashi 2014). Single barbless hooks are often used to facilitate fast hook removal. Releasing the hook is then performed using long <b>nose</b> <b>pliers,</b> a hook remover, or simply by placing the fish in the transport tank with no tension on the line, so the fish will un-hook itself.|$|E
