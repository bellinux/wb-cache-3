In a previous study, we presented a formulation to calculate <b>net</b> <b>configurations.</b> In this method, fishing nets were modeled as a group of lumped mass points interconnected with springs that have no mass. To verify the validity of calculation results using a computational model, we performed the flume tank experiments with a rectangular net and compared results with those of the numerical simulation of experiments. Using our method, numerical calculations for a rectangular net in a steady flow can provide accurate results. The calculated load and tension force distribution of the flat net were generally in accordance with the results of the flume tank experiments. This study shows that our method is valid for the simulation of fishing nets; furthermore, we have resolved earlier problems that were associated with this model. 網漁具の水中での形状や運動を推定できる数値シミュレーション手法を開発するために，本報では前報で示された計算用モデルの妥当性を検証する。実験では定常流中に 3 種類の長方形の平面網地を設置し，流速を変化させながら網形状と網糸に作用する荷重を計測した。網地形状の計算結果はどのケースでも実物と非常に良く一致した。平面網地上辺に作用する荷重は計算結果と良い一致を示した。網糸張力の分布状況についても，実験結果と概ね一致した。これらの結果は本計算モデルが網漁具の形状や運動を推定するのに十分有効であることを示す...|$|R

40|$|More than {{a decade}} has passed since {{the passage of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. During that time the U. S. tuna purse seine neet reduced its {{incidental}} porpoise mortality rate more than 10 -fold. This was made possible through the development of gear and techniques aimed at reducing the frequency of many low probability events that contribute to the kill. Porpoise are killed by becoming entangled or entrapped in folds and canopies of the net and suffocating. The configuration of the net, both before and during the backdown release procedure, is a major determinant of the number of porpoise killed. Speedboats can be used to tow on the corkllne to prevent net collapse and also to adjust the <b>net</b> <b>configuration</b> to reduce net canopies prior to backdown. Deepening a net can reduce the probability of porpoise being killed by prebackdown net collapse. The effects of environmental conditions and mechanical failures on <b>net</b> <b>configuration</b> can result in high porpoise mortality unless mitigated by skilled vessel maneuvers or prevented by the timely use of speedboats to adjust the net. The backdown procedure is the only means to effectively release captured porpoise from a purse seine. It is also the time during the set when most of the mortality occurs. The use of small mesh safety panels and aprons in the backdown areas of nets reduces porpoise entanglement, and Increases the probability of an effective release. The tie-down points on the net for preparing the backdown channel must be properly located in order to optimize porpoise release. A formula uses the stretched depth of the net to calculate one of these points, making it a simple matter to locate the other. Understanding the dynamics of the backdown procedure permits a thorough troubleshooting of performance, thus preventing the repetition of poorly executed backdowns and thereby reducing mortality. Porpoise that cannot be released must be rescued by hand. A rescuer in a rigidly inflated raft can rescue porpoise effectively at any time during a net set. Hand rescue can make the difference between above average kill and zero kill sets. In all circumstances, the skill and motivation of the captain and his crew are the final determinants in the prevention of incidental porpoise mortality in tuna seining.

Size selectivity quantifies a given trawl’s ability to catch different sizes of a harvested entity, and this information is crucial for the management of a sustainable fishery. We established a morphological description of krill and used it in a mathematical model (FISHSELECT) to predict the selective potential of diamond meshes measuring 5 – 40 mm with mesh opening angles (oa) ranging from 10 to 90 u. We expected the majority of krill to encounter the trawl netting in random orientations due to high towing speeds and the assumed swimming capabilities of krill.

A lot of investigations in this area have been made but problem of corresponding points in considerable occlusions hadn’t solved yet. As a rule we meet essential occlusions in a city area photos, where usual correlation methods are inapplicable. This work introduces new approach to stereo matching problem solution that autonomously constructs the net of corresponding points. The algorithm is based on comparison of intensity profiles extracted from left and right frames. Each profile is presented by pixel sequence along line between two nodes of the net. We construct function which close to zero when profiles are projections of the same line segment from spatial scene. The technique takes account of intensity errors appeared because of perspective photos digitalizing where applying of merely pixel correlation is incorrect. We suggest iterative optimization algorithm which moves nodes of the net. After stabilization of the algorithm every node gives pair of corresponding points. Presence of relationship between nodes gives more useful information in contrast to disjoint spatial points set obtained by ordinary methods. Considerable occlusions appear usually on projections of spatial object edges. That’s why we modify initial <b>net</b> <b>configuration</b> accordingly to detected edges on images before iterative process has started.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a piezoresistive - piezoelectric sensor (or actuator) array is proposed using 'neural' connectivity for signal recognition and possible actuation functions. A closer integration of the sensor and decision functions is {{necessary in order to}} achieve intrinsic identification within the sensor. A neural sensor is the next logical step in development of truly 'intelligent' arrays. This proposal will integrate 1 - 3 polymer piezoresistors and MLC electroceramic devices for applications involving acoustic identification. The 'intelligent' piezoresistor -piezoelectric system incorporates printed resistors, composite resistors, and a feedback for the resetting of resistances. A model of a design is proposed in order to simulate electromechanical resistor interactions. The goal of optimizing a sensor geometry for improving device reliability, training, & signal identification capabilities is the goal of this work. At present, studies predict performance of a 'smart' device with a significant control of 'effective' compliance over a narrow pressure range due to a piezoresistor percolation threshold. An interesting possibility may be to use an array of control elements to shift the threshold function in order to change the level of resistance in a neural sensor array for identification, or, actuation applications. The proposed design employs elements of: (1) conductor loaded polymers for a 'fast' RC time constant response; and (2) multilayer ceramics for actuation or sensing and shifting of resistance in the polymer. Other material possibilities also exist using magnetoresistive layered systems for shifting the resistance. It is proposed to use a neural <b>net</b> <b>configuration</b> to test and to help study the possible changes required in the materials design of these devices. Numerical design models utilize electromechanical elements, in conjunction with structural elements in order to simulate piezoresistively controlled actuators and changes in resistance of sensors.

Detailed geological investigations were carried out to determine the stratigraphic and chronological sequence of the unconsolidated sediments. Using bore hole samples, the areal boundaries and thicknesses of each formation were established.

Evidence is presented for Quaternary history along {{the east coast of}} Australia. Satisfactory correlation with global climatic and geological events have been achieved {{for the first time in}} Australia. Close correlation exists between the oxygen isotope classification of the Pleistocene Period and events recorded in the unconsolidated sediments. Polycyclic deposits older than 135, 000 years have been chronologically recognised and their mode of formation postulated. This model fully documents the last major interglacial facies deposits; establishes sea level heights and the duration for the period (134, 000 to 118, 000 years B. P.) in Australia. The last glacial and Holocene transgression are also established by radiocarbon dating. The physical three dimensional framework has been established. The aquifer parameters were determined with transmissivity values ranging from 0. 0001 to ll 66 m 2;day and storage co-efficient of 4. 5 x l 0 - 6 to 0. 37. Mainly numerical methods of solution were employed.

Experimental results show that among the three proposed deep neural nets and a baseline model, the recurrent neural network based system has the best average chord quality accuracy that significantly outperforms the other considered models. Furthermore, our bias-variance analysis has identified a glass ceiling as a potential hindrance to future improvements of large vocabulary automatic chord estimation systems...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{mechanism for}} hydrolysis with retention of stereochemistry can occur that proceeds through a nucleophilic residue that {{is bound to}} the substrate, rather than being attached to the enzyme. Such mechanisms are common for certain N-acetylhexosaminidases, which have an acetamido group capable of neighboring group participation to form an intermediate oxazoline or oxazolinium ion. Again, the mechanism proceeds in two steps through individual inversions {{to lead to a}} <b>net</b> retention of <b>configuration.</b>|$|R
40|$|Configuration {{structures}} {{provide a}} model of concurrency generalising the families of configurations of event structures. They can be considered logically, as classes of propositional models; then sub-classes can be axiomatised by formulae of simple prescribed forms. Several equivalence relations for event structures are generalised to configuration structures, and also to general Petri <b>nets.</b> Every <b>configuration</b> structure is shown to be ST-bisimulation equivalent to a prime event structure with binary conflict; this fails for the tighter history preserving bisimulation. Finally, Petri nets without self-loops under the collective token interpretation are shown behaviourally equivalent to configuration structures, {{in the sense that}} there are translations in both directions respecting history preserving bisimulation. This fails for nets with self-loops. 1 Introduction The aim {{of this paper is to}} connect several models of concurrency, by providing translations between them and studying whi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Effectiveness of sailkite {{has been}} {{evaluated}} in two trawl designs, namely, a 25 m high opening trawl and a 32 m large mesh demersal trawl, rigged with sailkite through full scale comparative field trials. A 25 m high opening trawl showed {{significant increase in}} total catch by 54. 4 % ribbon fish (Trichiurus spp.) alone by 138. 3 % with a reduction in miscellaneous catch, comprising mostly small sciaenids and juvenile fish, by 13. 2 % while 32 m large mesh demersal trawl showed an improvement in total catch by 9 %, ribbon fish by 17. 2 % and miscellaneous catch by 7. 7 %. The difference in fishing performance between the two gear arrangements {{has been attributed to}} changed <b>net</b> mouth <b>configuration</b> because of higher head line lift and also the possible herding effect on the fish in the vicinity of trawl mouth, due to addition of sailkite...|$|R
25|$|The {{vertical}} {{opening of a}} trawl net is created using flotation on the upper edge ("floatline") and weight on the lower edge ("footrope") of the <b>net</b> mouth. The <b>configuration</b> of the footrope varies based on the expected bottom shape. The more uneven the bottom, the more robust the footrope configuration must be to prevent net damage. This is used to catch shrimp, shellfish, cod, scallops and many others. Trawls are funnel-shaped nets that have a closed-off tail where the fish are collected and is open on the top end as the mouth.|$|R
40|$|Scale model {{studies of}} the Shuttle Orbiter {{arrestment}} system were conducted to determine the proper <b>net</b> arrestment system <b>configuration</b> to bring the Orbiter to a safe stop {{in the event of}} a runway overshoot. Areas of interest include the effect of various net geometries on net engagement of the nose gear and main gear; and whether or not the top bundle contacts the crew cabin window. The model tests indicated that the net arrestment system was properly designed to bring the Orbiter to a safe stop with minimal amount of damage. The test procedures and data are presented...|$|R
