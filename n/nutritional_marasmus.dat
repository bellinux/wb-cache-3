Although many different synergistic factors may influ-ence its occurrence and manifestations, the basic problem appears to be dietary-ingestion of insufficient protein of good quality to meet requirements of growth, resistance and repair, and a low or disproportionately high intake of calories from carbohydrate 12 For many years research efforts have focused primarily on the most serious forms of protein-calorie malnutrition, particularly kwashiorkor and <b>nutritional</b> <b>marasmus.</b> Representing one end of the clinical spectrum, these advanced major syndromes with their high mortality rates have overshadowed interest in the mild forms which, by comparison, are so incon-spicuous and ill-defined that they are easily overlooked and frequently ignored. Dietary lack of protein, however, is a far greater prob-lem than prevalence figures for the full-blown syndromes suggest. Even a slight deficiency of protein intake during the first three years o life when growth demands are high may lead to precarious nutritional imbalance, and i...|$|E

At its one end there is kwashiorkor {{and on the other}} is <b>nutritional</b> <b>marasmus,</b> all the developing countries are at great risk of developing PEM among children. The main objective of study was to assess the nutritional status of primary school children. It was achieved by well designed questionnaire using anthropometric, dietary patterns and clinical signs of children belonging from different socio-economic statuses. Total 46 urban school age children less than 12 years were selected through simple random sampling technique. It was found that young children (both boys and girls) were suffering from PEM were under weight than that of their normal requirement. They use to belong to big family size as indicating unavailability of food or imbalanced nutrition because they hardly take milk or milk products; eat meat, vegetable, fat or cereal group food daily. Only a few children took iron/vitamin syrups. This was expressed in their anthropometric measurements. Most of the children usually lacked apathy impression of skin, turned their hair colour brown, white or grayish, dry and thin. They largely had: enlarged thyroid glands, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly pot belly. They usually had ailments during last six months. They use to face diarrhea, fever diseases and malaria. They mainly use to suffer from phagophagia. Therefore it is suggested that raising the awareness of policy makers on the current magnitude of child malnutrition, country wide and in special subgroups, at city level, enhancing food security by improving storage and distribution systems. Nutrition education should be enhanced thus enabling the individual to distinguish the balanced diet from a deficient one...|$|E

40|$|RESULTS FROM FEASIBILITY STUDY ON THE SEVERE MALNOURISHED CASES AS AN INDICATOR OF OUTBREAK OF FOOD SHORTAGES IN THE COMMUNITY. Background: Outbreak of marasmus, kwashiorkor, and Marasmic-kwashiorkor on {{children}} underfive {{years old in}} Indonesia have been reported on the late of 1998. Those cases assumed as the impact of economic crises {{since the middle of}} 1997 's. It was stated by the Ministry of Health {{that if there is a}} malnourish child found in one area, the people on the surrounded have been suffer from a lack of food. Objective: The Feasiblity study on cases of marasmus and/or kwashiorkor as an indcator of outbreak of a lack of food consumption in the area surrounding was carried out in the District of Bandung, Cirebon, Karawang, and Cianjur, West Java, 1999. Method: 66 villages were chosen purposively based on a present of marasmus and/or kwashiorkor in that areas according to the result of sweeping to the all areas and month-weighing program (Mei-June 1999). There were 81 children identified suffer from Marasmus/Kwashiorkor/Marasmic-Kwashiorkor. Of the 81 cases in 66 villages confirmed were found 56 marasmus, 4 kwashiorkor, 9 marasmic-kwashiorkor, 12 severe degree of malnutrition, and 4 children was passed out without clinical symptom/signs. The main data collected were M, K, and MK, nutritional status data in Posyandu, and social economic status of the Â household sample of the poor surrounding the cases, and food consumption of the household samples. Results: The results were 16 villages (30, 7 %) as the malnourished villages, although no consumption pattern changes. Marasmus, Kwashiorkor, or Marasmic-Kwashiorkor no longer used as an indicator of a lack of food consumption in the areas. These because (a) Marasmus and kwashiorkor already happened long-time before the outbreak cases reported, (b) Some of marasmic or kwashiorkor children not belong to the poor community. 72, 5 % cases were belong to the children below two years old, and the largest belongs to children below 18 months old.
