40|$|Background: Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytology is {{the method}} of choice to exclude malignancy in thyroid nodules. A major limitation of thyroid FNA is the relatively high rate (13 - 17 %) of non-diagnostic samples. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the diagnostic yield of a <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> compared to the conventional FNA. Methods: We retrospectively analysed thyroid nodule cytology of all patients that underwent thyroid nodule fine <b>needle</b> or <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> aspiration between July 2007 and July 2012 in a single academic medical centre. Cytology results were categorized according to the Bethesda classification system. Results: In total, 644 punctures of thyroid nodules from 459 patients were available for analysis. The <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> was used 531 times, and the conventional fine needle 113 times. The percentage of non-diagnostic cytology was significantly lower in the <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> samples than in the fine needle samples (3 % vs 17 %, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: This study shows a significantly better diagnostic performance of the <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> compared to the conventional fine needle in cytology of thyroid nodule...|$|R

40|$|Manipulating small {{objects such}} as <b>needles,</b> <b>screws</b> or plates inside the human body during {{minimally}} invasive surgery can {{be very difficult for}} less experienced surgeons, due to the loss of 3 D depth perception. This paper presents an approach for tracking a suturing needle using a standard endoscope. The resulting pose information of the needle is then used to generate artificial 3 D cues on the 2 D screen to optimally support surgeons during tissue suturing. Additionally, if an external tracking device is provided to report the endoscope’s position, the suturing needle can be tracked in a hybrid fashion with sub-millimeter accuracy. Finally, a visual navigation aid can be incorporated, if a 3 D surface is intraoperatively reconstructed from video or registered from preoperative imaging...|$|R

40|$|Manipulating small {{objects such}} as <b>needles,</b> <b>screws</b> or plates inside the human body during {{minimally}} invasive surgery can {{be very difficult for}} less experienced surgeons due to the loss of 3 D depth perception. Classical navigation techniques are often incapable of providing support in such situations, as the augmentation of the scene with the necessary artificial markers [...] if possible at all [...] is usually cumbersome and leads to increased invasiveness. We present an approach relying solely on a standard endoscope as a tracking device for determining the pose of such objects, using the example of a suturing needle. The resulting pose information is then used to generate artificial 3 D cues on the 2 D screen to provide optimal support for surgeons during tissue suturing. In addition, if an external tracking device is provided to report the endoscope's position, the suturing needle can be directly tracked in the world coordinate system. Furthermore, a visual navigation aid can be incorporated if a 3 D surface is intraoperatively reconstructed from the endoscopic video stream or registered from preoperative imaging...|$|R
2500|$|Vacutainer needle are double ended, {{with one}} side being {{encased in a}} thin rubber coating for safety. When the <b>needle</b> is <b>screwed</b> into the {{translucent}} plastic needle holder, the rubber needle is inside the holder, and the exposed needle will be inserted into the vein. When a Vacutainer tube is inserted into the holder, its rubber cap is punctured by the inner needle and the vacuum in the tube pulls blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. The amount of air evacuated from the tube predetermines how much blood will fill the tube before blood stops flowing.|$|R

30|$|The cell of {{ultrasonic}} interferometer {{was filled}} fully with the solution, and the needle of the ammeter was adjusted {{in the range}} of 20 to 60 with the help of “Adj” knob. It was warmed for 10  min so that the range should remain steady. Micrometer reading was noted. The screw was moved anticlockwise to get the maximum deflection of <b>needle.</b> Movement of <b>screw</b> was continued to get five deflections. After returning back the needle to its original position, micrometer screw reading was noted. The difference between these two readings gave the distance traveled by the screw for getting five maxima. From this, the distance required through which a micrometer screw should move for one maxima was calculated just by dividing it by 5 and multiplying by 2. The same procedure was repeated many times.|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjective In {{this work}} we set {{to develop and}} to {{validate}} a new in vivo frameless orthotopic Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) model based in the implantation of a guide-screw system. Methods It consisted of a guide-screw also called bolt, a Hamilton syringe with a 26 -gauge needle and an insulin-like 15 -gauge <b>needle.</b> The guide <b>screw</b> is 2. 6 mm in length and harbors a 0. 5 mm central hole which accepts the needle of the Hamilton syringe avoiding a theoretical displacement during insertion. The guide-screw is fixed on the mouse skull according to the coordinates: 1 mm right to and 0. 8 mm posterior to lambda. To reach the pons the Hamilton syringe is adjusted to a 6. 5 mm depth using a cuff {{that serves as a}} stopper. This system allows delivering not only cells but also any kind of intratumoral chemotherapy, antibodies or gene/viral therapies. Results The guide-screw was successfully implanted in 10 immunodeficient mice and the animals were inoculated with DIPG human cell lines during the same anesthetic period. All the mice developed severe neurologic symptoms and had a median overall survival of 95 days ranging the time of death from 81 to 116 days. Histopathological analysis confirmed tumor into the pons in all animals confirming the validity of this model...|$|R
40|$|Shotcrete or sprayed {{concrete}} {{is a special}} concrete designed for spraying onto a surface, as a construction material. With shotcrete application as a ground support system ever-present in both mining and tunnelling sectors, a major requirement of drive progression is to determine when {{it is safe to}} re-enter beneath freshly {{sprayed concrete}}. Accurately determining this time is of paramount importance. Generally, this re-entry time is based on measuring the developing strength of shotcrete until an adequate strength value is reached. The issue with current practice {{is that there is no}} widely accepted or generally preferred method that accurately assesses the shotcrete lining&# 039;s true early-age strength. However, there are a number of strength tests that are commercially available and used in the industry, these include the soil penetrometer, <b>needle</b> penetrometer, bolt <b>screws,</b> beam end testers and drilled core samples. This paper researches into these testing methods and their characteristics in order to determine their accuracy, testing ranges and suitability for in situ use in the tunnelling and mining industry. The paper then looks into what advancements or developments in testing technology would be of benefit to the underground industries. The investigation ultimately reveals that current methods all have substantial shortcomings. Based on these findings, recommendations are proposed for the applicable use of the current testing methods and recommendations for future improvements...|$|R

40|$|Fractures of distal humerus on humen {{skeleton}} {{are rare}} and intraarticular fractions of distal part of humerus occur even less frequently, they comprise about 3 % of fractures of humerus. However, these fractures {{can result in}} a functional deficiency of elbow joint and permanent disability. The main goal if our work was to present one of the surgical treatment options of this kind of fracture with minimal amount of fixation material. Treatment result were evaluated by Broberg-Morrey score system. Pilot study consisted of eight patient with comminuted type IV fracture of distal humerus during 2004 - 2005 time period. Comminuted fracture was fixed with minimal amount of material: a Kirchner <b>needle</b> and a <b>screw.</b> Patient treatment progress was evaluated initially and followed up after four, nine and twenty four months by B-M score after removal of cast and bone fixing material. The results of the B-M score after four months were: excellent in 0 patient, good in 2 patients, fair in 4 patients and poor in 2 patients. After physical therapy and follow up check- {{up at the end of}} nine months the result were: excellent in 3 patients, good in 3 patients, fair in 2 patients and no patients had shown poor result. This B-M score result was identical after 24 months follow up with minor deviations in range of motions of elbow, which did not influence the final result of B-M score...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background CT-guided fine needle bioptic {{procedures}} (CTFNP) are characterised by low invasiveness, precise sample collection, a high {{diagnostic efficiency}} and support a rapid diagnostic process. A {{number of different}} fine needles and bioptic procedures are mainly used for tumour diagnostics today. The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterise the most important technical issues of fine needle bioptic procedures. In addition, we directly compared the diagnostic outcome and reliability of the most commonly used Rotex <b>Screw</b> <b>Needle</b> – (RSN) and Yale Needle – (YN) bioptic procedure. Methods In an experimental part of the study, using pig spleen, we measured the maximum number of sampled cells using different needles and aspiration volumes. For the clinical questions we analysed all consecutive 340 patients in which CTFNP were performed between 1 / 97 – 12 / 05 in the hospital Grosshansdorf. We evaluated the number of adverse events based on all clinical available information and compared the cytological findings with the respective final diagnosis (confirmed: clinically n = 192, histologically n = 148). Results Using the YN with at least some negative pressure we found a proportional increase of cell and tissue recovery with increasing number of needle movements. A sensitivity of 78 % and a specificity 98 % indicate a high diagnostic outcome of CTFNP. We found no statistical significant difference in terms of sensitivity (80 vs. 68 %) as well as complication rates (5. 9 vs. 4. 4 %) between RSN or YN. Conclusion As fine needle basically works like a cutting instrument, it is possible to raise the cell/tissue recovery. Keeping this in mind we found a high diagnostic outcome of CTFNP, which was largely independent of needle type and bioptic technique, and comparable with other conventional bioptic procedures. </p...|$|R
