Sera from horses hyperimmunized against M. nigrocinctus venom contain antibodies which inhibit the binding of M. n. nigrocinctus alpha-neurotoxins to AchR and reverse the binding of toxins already complexed with the receptor. This result supports the importance of using antivenom therapeutically in M. n. nigrocinctus envenomations even after the onset of neurological symptoms.

The investigations resulted in complete characterization of several components like phospholipase A 2, a Kunitz type trypsin inhibitor, a Kunitz type chymotrypsin inhibitor-like peptide, several isoforms of miscellaneous neurotoxins, and a cytotoxin-like basic protein Brief summary of the components characterization is given below: (1) Phospholipase A 2 Phospholipase A 2 was purified by a combination of reverse phase HPLC and ion exchange HPLC. The complete primary structure of phospholipase A 2 determined by sequencing the intact protein and its Lys-specific protease digested peptides showed 119 positions in the protein and several involve charged residues. However, the <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>naja</b> subform has no unique residue at the differing positions, thus the functional properties of <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>naja</b> phospholipase A 2 remains unaltered, is clearly related with other subspecies (<b>II)</b> Trypsin inhibitor <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>naja</b> venom trypsin inhibitor bystep of reverse phase HPLC.

The primary structure was established by peptide analyses of the 14 C-carboxymethylated inhibitor. The 57 residue polypeptide chain belongs to the familyof Kunitz type inhibitors and exhibit significant residue identity with corresponding peptides from other resources. Functionally, a basic residue at position P 3 (in the region of main contact with trypsin) conrrelates with strong inhibition (III) Chymotrypsin Kunitz inhibitor-type peptide The chymotrypsin Kuntiz inhibitor type of polypeptide was isolated from the venom of <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>naja</b> by reverse phase HPLC followed by cat-ion exchange FPLC. It wasd present in a considerably lower amount than that of the corresponding trypsin inhibitor.

The main contact site with the protease (P 1) has a phe residue, showing the specificity of the inhibitor of residues considered functionally important in Kunitz-type inhibitor, Gly- 36 is repiaced by Ser in a segment of weak contact with the protease (IV) Cytotoxin-like Basic Peptide cytotoxin-like basic peptide was isolated by a single step of reverse phase HPLC from the venom of <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>naja.</b> The primary structure was determined and consist of 62 amino acid residue in a single polypeptide chain.

Studies of the action of venom and venom constituents on Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of honeybee venom (Apis mellifera), three snake venoms (<b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> sputatrix, Vipera russellii and Crotalus adamanteus) and the polypeptide melittin (a component of honeybee venom) was investigated against the gram-negative organism Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined and action against proliferating and non-proliferating cells was in the order: Apis mellifera venom > melittin > <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> sputatrix > Vipera russellii venom > Crotalus adamanteus venom. Cell lysis was determined by absorbancy changes and {{was caused by the}} more active venoms (Apis mellifera and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> sputatrix) and melittin. Alteration of the permeability of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli cells harvested in mid-log phase was followed principally by measuring β-galactosidase release from cells. Venom activity decreased in the same order as MIC above. Phospholipases A₂ from Apis mellifera and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> sputatrix venoms, melittin and polymixin B (polypeptide antibiotic) increased β-galactosidase release. No synergism between the phospholipases A₂ and melittin was seen under the conditions employed. Separation of Apis mellifera and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> sputatrix venoms was carried out by gel filtration and electrophoresis.

The conformation-sensitive protein infrared bands in the amide I region were analyzed using deconvolution and band-fitting procedures. The spectra of the three cardiotoxins in aqueous buffer are very similar; they indicate a high content of both antiparallel beta-sheet structure and unordered conformation. Moreover, component bands characteristic of turns can also be identified. The binding of cardiotoxins to bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidyl-glycerol results in an increased content of a beta-structure {{at the expense of}} the nonordered conformation.

In addition, venom-induced proteolysis, fibrinogenolysis, DNase activity were also neutralized by the ERE, which contained carbohydrates, glycolides, resins and tannins. Oral administration of ERE at doses levels 100, 200 and 400 Â mg/kg effectively inhibited <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> venom-induced lethality in mice.

Phospholipase A 2 from <b>Naja</b> <b>naja,</b> <b>Naja</b> mocambique mocambique, Apis mellifera venoms and the basic component of Crotalus durissus terrificus venom all induced dose-dependent rat paw oedema whereas those from Crotalus adamanteus venom and bovine pancreas were ineffective.

On the other hand, heparin (50 U/paw) had no effect on the paw oedema induced by PLA 2 from <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> and Apis mellifera venoms but significantly inhibited the <b>Naja</b> mocambique mocambique venom PLA 2 -induced oedema.

Our results suggest that despite the great homology between the various types of sPLA 2 they interact with crotapotin on cell surfaces in different ways leading to either inhibition or potentiation of the paw oedema by a mechanism unrelated to their enzymatic activities.

Here we present the results of our proteomic research on two medically important snakes of Pakistan: Bungarus sindanus and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja.</b> Indian Polyvalent Antivenom (Bharat Serums and Vaccines Ltd), which is currently marketed for use in Pakistan, was completely ineffective against either Pakistani species. In addition to the expected pre- and post-synaptic neurotoxic activity, the venom of the Pakistan population of N. <b>naja</b> was shown to be quite divergent from other populations of this species in being potently myotoxic. These results highlight the importance of studying divergent species and isolated populations, where the same data not only elucidates clinical problems in need of immediate attention, but also uncovers sources for novel toxins with potentially useful activities. Biological significance: Pakistan Bungarus sindanus and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> venoms are differentially complex. <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> is potently myotoxic. Neither venom is neutralized by Indian antivenom. These results have direct implications for the treatment of envenomed patients in Pakistan. The unusually myotoxic effects of <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> demonstrates the value of studying remote populations for biodiscovery...|$|R

Lesser fauna include mugger crocodile, Indian python, <b>Naja</b> <b>naja,</b> Ptyas mucosa, Bengal monitor, Indian Star tortoise and Indian peafowl.|$|R
40|$|A PLA(2) -inhibitor {{has been}} {{purified}} from Indian cobra (<b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>naja)</b> venom by {{the combination of}} ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The inhibitor, NN-I- 3 was a peptide with mol. wt 6500 and has a fluorescence emission maxima cn 340 nm. NN-I- 3 specifically inhibited the enzyme activity of the three acidic PLA? from the same venom. The inhibition of NN-I- 2 d-PLA(2) and NN-I- 2 e-PLA(2) by NN-I- 3 was of mixed type and NN-I- 2 c-PLA(2) was of uncompetitive type, Neither the inhibitor nor the individual mixtures of acidic PLA(2) with the inhibitor (1 : 1 w/w or 1 : 2 mol:mol) were lethal to mice when injected intraperitoneally in doses up to 10 mgkg(-l) body weight.

40|$|Indian cobra venom {{contains}} many phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) toxins. In {{the present study}} two toxic PLA 2 s have been purified from the Indian cobra (<b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>naja)</b> venom by column chromatography. The NN-XIa-and NN-XIb-PLA 2 s have mol. wts between 10, 700 and 15, 000. The NN-XIa-PLA 2 induces myotoxic effects, oedema and neurotoxicity in mice and has an i. p. LD 50 of 8. 5 mg/kg body weight. The NN-XIa-PLA 2 is also cytotoxic to Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. The other PLA 2, NN-XIb, in contrast has an i. p. LD, of 0. 22 mg/kg body weight, and it induces acute neurotoxicity. The NN-XIb-PLA 2 is devoid of the other biological activities which are exhibited by NN-XIa-PLA 2...|$|R
