5000|$|The {{most serious}} breach {{occurred}} with Hubbard's wife Sara, the Foundation's librarian and formerly his personal auditor and research subject. According to Barbara Klowdan, his public relations assistant, both had had affairs—Sara with Miles Hollister, a Dianetics instructor in Los Angeles, and Hubbard with Klowdan herself. Sara was {{suspended from the}} Foundation's {{board of directors and}} her official post. She filed divorce papers in March 1951, and her claims of [...] "systematic torture" [...] allegedly suffered at Hubbard's hands attracted widespread media attention. A few weeks later, Hubbard told the FBI that Sara had tried to kill him: [...] "I was knocked out, had a <b>needle</b> <b>thrust</b> into my heart to give it a jet of air to produce [...] "coronary thrombosis" [...] and was given an electric shock with a 110 volt current." [...] Hubbard later characterized the suit as [...] "a gal I wasn't even married to was suing me for divorce." ...|$|E

30|$|In the {{real-world}} practice, additional procedures, like DPC insertion, could be harmful in critically ill {{patients who are}} vulnerable to bleeding or who had received anticoagulation therapy while on ECMO. Therefore, finding a method to insert the DPC that avoids bleeding complications caused by multiple <b>needle</b> <b>thrusts</b> would {{make it possible to}} avoid fatal complications in the lower limb. In the present study, DPCs were preferentially inserted in all VA-ECMO patients unless limited by technical considerations, typically an inability to cannulate the SFA, and no procedural-related limb complication occurred in patients treated with fluoroscopy-guided DPC insertion. Our findings suggest that simultaneous DPC insertion at the time of primary ECMO cannulation should be considered to prevent limb ischemia, and image-guided insertion methods, such as fluoroscopy, are more effective and safe.|$|R
5000|$|The Plant Camp is {{significant}} for {{its potential to}} contain additional archaeological artefacts associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, particularly equipment associated with Wills' decision to [...] "plant" [...] or bury his astronomical equipment and Burke's order to leave behind everything except food and whatever they could carry on their backs. The Plant Camp has been identified through the presence of archaeological artefacts and two blazed trees situated along an unnamed ephemeral creek line on Durrie Station. Artefacts located to date include percussion caps, nipples, buckles, canvas/leather sewing kit <b>needles,</b> <b>thrust</b> block and duck bill leather sewing pliers {{a number of the}} brass fittings, including a clasp, escutcheon, latch and hinge all suggestive of a possible instrument case. These artefacts date to the same period (s-1860s) as the Burke and Wills expedition and are consistent with items listed in the detailed [...] "List of Stores III" [...] of goods officially supplied to the expedition.|$|R

In the paper, the theoretical analysis on relation between torque and load is done, special wearing test instrument is developed and wearing test of <b>thrust</b> <b>needle</b> bear is conducted. Based on the results of the test, mathematical model of relation between the losing amount of pre-tightening torque and the pre-tightening torque is built, based on which use of the bear in engineering will be more reasonable, and their pre-tightening torque will be given more accurately...|$|R

40|$|Steerable needles {{are widely}} used in {{minimally}} invasive surgery. To perform medical tasks well in the deep of a human body, it is required that a needle is easier and more accurate to be controlled and steered. In this paper, the thrusting performances of a one-direction bendable needle are investigated in detail. Such a needle consists of a bevel-tip head, several articulations, and several sections. Articulations are designed that they can only be bent in the direction that is opposite to the bevel-tip, and they are more flexible than {{the other parts of}} the needle. The maximum bending angles of articulations are fixed. By changing the lengths of head and sections, and the maximum bending angles of articulations, the possible <b>needle</b> <b>thrusting</b> routes are analyzed. Also, the thrusting forces and moments are calculated based on the structure of the needle. The study results demonstrate that it is easier and more accurate to control and steer a one-direction bendable compared with previous needles. The developments of articulated needle provide the opportunities to design different articulated needle to suit different clinical cases. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

That is, until several fighters get the drop on Chow who ends up dead. Meng blames himself and retires from crime fighting to become a pathetic drunk, drowning in shame. He finds work at a brothel for a time, until a patron's abuse {{of one of the}} girls causes him to interfere despite his refusal to fight. After being wounded, he stumbles to the doorstep of a martial arts school run by Magistrate Chen (Chui Chung Hei). Hoping to stay away from conflict, Meng finds work there, but trouble finds him anyway. A white-haired master named Chung Tung (Chang Yi) tries to bribe Chen into letting opium smugglers into the city. Chen refuses and has acupuncture <b>needles</b> <b>thrust</b> into him that will kill him unless removed by Chung Tung who hopes to control the magistrate. Pushed to the limit, Meng finally comes {{up with a plan to}} help beat Chung Tung and save Chen. Sadly, Chen believes his son and daughter are giving into Chung Tung and he removes the needles himself. With nothing holding them back, Meng and Chen's offspring leap into action to take out this pack of drug pushers.|$|R

5000|$|In his autobiography, {{published}} in 1904, polymath Herbert Spencer eloquently describes his own near re-invention of Nicholson's cyclograph {{while working as}} a civil engineer for the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. [...] During the latter part of 1839 the preparations of plans for crossings and sidings at various stations was put into my hands. A device for saving trouble was one of the consequences. Curves of very large radius had to be drawn; and, finding a beam-compassof adequate length difficult to manage, I bethought me of an instrumental application of the geometrical truth that angles in the same segment of a circle are equal to one another. An obvious implication is that if an angle be made rigid, and its arms be obliged to move through the two points terminating the segment, the apex of the angle must describe a circle. In pursuance of this idea I had made an instrument hinged like a foot-rule, but capable of having its hinge screwed tight in any position, and carrying a pen or pencil. Two <b>needles</b> <b>thrust</b> into the paper at the desired points, being pressed against by the arms of the instrument, as it was moved from side to side, its pen or pencil described the arc of a circle. When about to publish a description of this appliance, I discovered that it had been already devised, and was known as Nicholson’s Cyclograph. Herbert Spencer ...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{conjugation}} is a promiscuous DNA transport mechanism. Conjugative plasmids transfer themselves between most bacteria, thus {{being one}} of the main causal agents of the spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, DNA can be transferred conjugatively into eukaryotic host cells. In this review, we aim to address several basic questions regarding the DNA transfer mechanism. Conjugation can be visualized as a DNA rolling-circle replication (RCR) system linked to a type IV secretion system (T 4 SS), the latter being macromolecular transporters widely involved in pathogenic mechanisms. The scheme 'replication + secretion' suggests how the mechanism would work on the DNA substrate and at the bacterial membrane. But, how do these two parts come into contact? Furthermore, how is the DNA transported? T 4 SS are known to be involved in protein secretion in different organisms, but DNA is a very different macromolecule. The so-called coupling proteins could be the answer to both questions by performing a dual role in conjugation: coupling the two main components of the machinery (RCR and T 4 SS) and actively mediating DNA transport. We postulate that the T 4 SS is responsible for transport of the pilot protein (the relaxase) to the recipient. The DNA that is covalently linked to it is initially transported in a passive manner, trailing on the relaxase. We speculate that the pilus appendage could work as a <b>needle,</b> <b>thrusting</b> the substrate proteins to cross one or several membrane barriers into the recipient cytoplasm. This {{is the first step in}} conjugation. The second step is the active pumping of the DNA to the recipient, using the already available T 4 SS transport conduit. It is proposed that this second step is catalysed by the coupling proteins. Our 'shoot and pump' model solves the protein-DNA transport paradox of T 4 SS.

40|$|Immunohistochemical {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out on {{the properties of the}} cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) in focal hepatic injuries. A liquid nitrogen-cooled syringe <b>needle</b> was <b>thrust</b> into the rat liver. Necrotic areas became permeated with plasma within 24 -hour period. Areas became strongly positive for fibronectin and were infiltrated with inflammatory cells positive for lysozyme. By the third day, Ito cells were proliferated in the peripheral portions of the damaged areas. These Ito cells showed enhanced immunostaining for desmin and actin but were negative for lysozyme. Interstitial fibers which were immunochemically positive for Types I and IV collagens, laminin, and fibronectin, began to increase from Day 3. They appeared {{on the rim of the}} hepatocytes adjacent to the damaged areas and extended into the injured regions with the Ito cells. An increase in basal laminas associated with capillaries and bile ducts also increased with a 1 -day delay. The damaged areas were replaced by granulation tissue by Day 5. A rapid diminution then occurred in the granulation tissue, and normal hepatic tissue was restored in 7 - 10 days. These observations demonstrate that ECM changed in a sequential manner and then finally disappeared from the damaged site within 10 days. Although various cells, including parenchymal cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and cholangiolar cells contributed to the healing of the damaged area, Ito cells, which exhibit unique phenotypic changes, presumably had a major role in the process...|$|R

40|$|A {{needle roller}} bearing is a bearing which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings are used to reduce friction of any rotating surface. Needle bearings have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by <b>thrust</b> <b>needles.</b> Complement bearings have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. The bearings have the largest number of rolling elements and also have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for compact designs. Needle roller bearings have relatively small diameter cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger than their diameter. As compared to other types of rolling bearings, {{needle roller bearing}}s possess a small cross-sectional height and significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their volume. Also, because the inertial force acting on them is limited, needle bearings are an ideal choice for applications with oscillating motion. These bearings also work well in compact and lightweight machine designs and they serve as a ready replacement for sliding bearings. Needle bearings features are great rigidity, smaller cross-section, higher loadcarrying capacity, and has lower inertia forces that facilitate to size and weight reductions in machinery. Needle bearings are designed to stand in oscillation, performwell under any conditions, and interchange with the sliding of bearings...|$|R
40|$|When {{we began}} our {{investigations}} of psittacosis, the only animals known to be susceptible to the experimental disease were parrots, certain small birds closely related to parrots, and mice. Consequently it seemed desirable to ascertain whether other small laboratory animals are suitable for experiments with the disease. For this work, rabbits and guinea pigs were chosen. Results of the studies in which these animals were used and concerning which preliminary notes (1, 2) have already appeared are here set forth in detail. Methods and Materials Virus. [...] Virus from two sources was used; one strain came from an emulsion of the liver and spleen of Parrot N infected with virus originally obtained from a parrot with the natural disease, the other strain {{was derived from the}} liver and spleen of Parrot Wenz (WC) infected with material from a patient who had died of psittacosis. For more detailed information concerning these viruses, one may consult the first paper of this series. Inoculations.
