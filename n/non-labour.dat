40|$|In myometrial strips from near-term <b>non-labouring</b> human uterus, {{addition}} of oxytocin (OT) evoked dose-dependent (10 [*]–[*] 3000 [*]nM) phasic contractions that were antagonized by atosiban (1 [*]μM) and relaxed by {{addition of}} the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso L-cysteine (Cys-NO). In near-term labouring myometrium, however, addition of OT was ineffective at raising additional tone. In both labouring and <b>non-labouring</b> tissue, Cys-NO mediated relaxation of spontaneous or OT-induced contractions (IC 50 = 1 [*]μM) was unaffected by prior {{addition of the}} guanylyl cyclase (GC) inhibitors ODQ (1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3,-α]quinoxalin- 1 -one; 1 [*]μM), or methylene blue (MB; 10 [*]μM). Elevation of intracellular cyclic GMP accompanying 30 [*]μM Cys-NO addition in <b>non-labouring</b> tissue (7. 5 fold) or in labouring tissues (2. 5 fold) was completely blocked in tissues that had been pre-treated with ODQ or MB.

Addition of the NO-donor S-nitroso N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) produced a dose-dependent relaxation of pregnant myometrium while 3 -morpholinosyndonimine (SIN- 1) did not. The failure of SIN- 1 to relax OT-induced contractions was not due to a failure of the donor to stimulate myometrial GC. We demonstrate that despite the ability of NO to stimulate myometrial GC in pregnant uterine muscle, relaxations are independent of cyclic GMP action. Effects of K+-channel inhibitors suggests that NO-induced relaxation in human uterine smooth muscle may be subserved by direct or indirect activation of one or more calcium-activated K+-channels...|$|R

For global gene expression analysis, 17 human oligo-arrays were used, represent-ing 24 650 genes each. An empirical Bayes analysis was applied in order to find differentially expressed genes. About 8000 genes that were represented on the arrays met our quality criteria. Ninety two genes were down-regulated and 94 genes were up-regulated in labouring placentas compared to <b>non-labouring</b> placentas.

40|$|An {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms that initiate normal human labour at term seriously hampers the development of effective ways to predict, prevent and treat disorders such as preterm labour. Appropriate analysis of large microarray experiments that compare gene expression in <b>non-labouring</b> and labouring gestational tissues is necessary to help bridge these gaps in our knowledge. In this work, gene expression in 48 (22 labouring, 26 <b>non-labouring)</b> lower-segment myometrial samples collected at Caesarean section were analysed using Illumina HT- 12 v 4. 0 BeadChips. Normalised data were compared between labouring and <b>non-labouring</b> groups using traditional statistical methods and a novel network graph approach. We sought technical validation with quantitative real-time PCR, and biological replication through inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis with published microarray data. We have extended the list of genes suggested {{to be associated with}} labour: Compared to <b>non-labouring</b> samples, labouring samples showed apparent higher expression at 960 probes (949 genes) and apparent lower expression at 801 probes (789 genes) (absolute fold change ≥ 1. 2, rank product percentage of false positive value (RP-PFP) < 0. 05). Although half {{of the women in the}} labouring group had received pharmaceutical treatment to induce or augment labour, sensitivity analysis suggested that this did not confound our results. In agreement with previous studies, functional analysis suggested that labour was characterised by an increase in the expression of inflammatory genes and network analysis suggested a strong neutrophil signature. Our analysis also suggested that labour is characterised by a decrease in the expression of muscle-specific processes, which has not been explicitly discussed previously. We validated these findings through the first formal meta-analysis of raw data from previous experiments and we hypothesise that this represents a change in the composition of myometrial tissue at labour. Further work will be necessary to reveal whether these results are solely due to leukocyte infiltration into the myometrium as a mechanism initiating labour, or in addition whether they also represent gene changes in the myocytes themselves.

40|$|Background: Preterm labour {{is linked}} to higher {{mortality}} and morbidity rates. It has many possible causes; however the vast majority are idiopathic. Current pharmacological interventions are ineffective in reducing preterm birth rates and the associated mortality and morbidity. In order to progress, research into the biological and molecular processes occurring in pregnancy and labour has been highlighted. Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TGII) inhibition inhibits contractions, leading onto questions about this multifunction protein’s role in pregnancy and labour Aims: 1. 	To determine TGII protein expression in human myometrium during non-pregnancy, pregnancy and labour. 2. 	To determine α-actin and α-tubulin expression in human myometrium during non-pregnancy, pregnancy and labour. 3. 	To determine the sub-cellular localisation of TGII, α-actin and α-tubulin in cells derived from pregnant <b>non-labouring</b> myometrium. 4. 	To determine whether TGII co-localises with either α-actin or α-tubulin in cells derived from pregnant <b>non-labouring</b> myometrium. Participants: tissue samples of smooth muscle myometrium were collected from women undergoing elective/emergency caesarean sections or hysterectomies. The three groups were non-pregnant, term-not-in-labour and term-in-labour. Design: Western blotting and related methodologies were carried out to determine TGII, α-actin and α-tubulin levels across the three sample groups. Immunocytocehmistry and related methodologies were carried out to determine the sub-cellular locations of TGII, α-actin and α-tubulin and whether TGII co-localised with either of the cytoskeletal proteins. Results: Significance was found in TGII levels between non-pregnant and term-not-in-labour (p≤ 0. 05) and term-in-labour (p≤ 0. 01). No {{significant difference was found}} in cytoskeletal protein levels. TGII subcellular location in pregnant <b>non-labouring</b> cells was cytoplasmic, indicating TGase activity not GTPase activitiy. No significant co-localisation was found between TGII and either α-actin and α-tubulin. Conclusion: Pregnancy has an impact on the expression of TGII. TGII role in regulating contractility is not through the result of co-localisation with α-actin and α-tubulin. Its mechanism in inhibiting contractions remains unclear...|$|R

40|$|An initial {{group of}} term (36 - 41 6 / 7 weeks), preterm (less than 36 weeks), and post-term (42 or more weeks) placentae were {{collected}} from women at delivery to determine the placental levels of important steroids and steroidogenic enzymes involved in the oestrogen synthesis pathway {{as a function of}} gestational age. A second group of placentae were obtained from women delivering at term before and after the onset of labour. Placentae were evaluated individually for cytosolic steroid hormone levels and microsomal steroidogenic enzyme activities. Oestradiol (E 2), oestrone (E 1), progesterone (P), and delta- 4 -androstenedione (A) were measured by radioimmunoassay in placental cytosols. Aromatase (AR), sulphatase (S), and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3 beta HSD) activities were assayed in placental microsomes. Cytosolic concentrations of E 1, E 2, P, and A did not differ with respect to gestational age. Correspondingly, the microsomal enzyme activities of 3 beta HSD, S, and AR did not vary as a function of gestational age. However, when patients at term who were in labour prior to delivery were compared to those who were not, the placental cytosolic level of E 1 was found to be threefold higher in the <b>non-labouring</b> group (4572 versus 1427 pg/mg cytosolic protein, P 3 ̆c 0. 025). Additionally, microsomal aromatase activity was also significantly higher in the <b>non-labouring</b> patients (46 versus 19 pM/min/mg protein, P 3 ̆c 0. 025), while the E 2 to P ratio in the labouring patients was twice that of the <b>non-labouring</b> group, a difference which was significant at the P 3 ̆c 0. 025 level (Wilcoxon rank sum test). These data suggest that at term, prior to labour, the placental production of E 1 by AR is high, and that AR activity and E 1 levels fall significantly after the onset of labour. Also, the placental cytosolic concentration of the more active oestrogen, E 2, demonstrates stable to rising levels with a significant increase in E 2 /P after the onset of labour. We theorize that in the term pregnancy prior to labour, E 1 may represent a large but relatively inactive intracellular oestrogen pool which is maintained by high AR activity, and may function to protect the pregnant local uterine environment from the more oxytocic effects of E 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ghrelin is a 28 -amino acid octanolyated peptide, {{synthesised}} {{primarily in}} the stomach. It stimulates growth hormone release, food intake and exhibits many other diverse effects. Our group have previously determined that ghrelin inhibited human contractility in vitro. The {{aim of this study}} therefore, was to investigate the expression of ghrelin, its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 (GHS-R 1), ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) which catalyses ghrelin octanoylation, prohormone convertase 1 / 3 (PC 1 / 3) responsible for pro-ghrelin processing, in human myometrium, during pregnancy prior to labour, during labour and in the non-pregnant state. Modulation of ghrelin and ghrelin receptor expression in cultured myometrial cells was also investigated. Methods mRNA and protein were isolated from human myometrium and the myometrial smooth muscle cell line hTERT-HM; and real-time fluorescence RT-PCR, western blotting and fluorescence microscopy performed. The effects of &# 946;-Estradiol and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hTERT-HM gene expression were evaluated by western blotting. Results We have reported {{for the first time the}} expression and processing of ghrelin, GHS-R 1, GOAT and PC 1 / 3 expression in human myometrium, and also the down-regulation of ghrelin mRNA and protein expression during labour. Furthermore, GHS-R 1 protein expression significantly decreased at labour. Myometrial GOAT expression significantly increased during term <b>non-labouring</b> pregnancy in comparison to both non-pregnant and labouring myometrium. Mature PC 1 / 3 protein expression was significantly decreased at term pregnancy and labour in comparison to non-pregnant myometrium. Ghrelin, GHS-R 1, GOAT and PC 1 / 3 mRNA and protein expression was also detected in the hTERT-HM cells. Ghrelin protein expression decreased upon LPS treatment in these cells while &# 946;-Estradiol treatment increased GHS-R 1 expression. Conclusions Ghrelin processing occurred in the human myometrium at term pregnancy and in the non-pregnant state. GOAT expression which increased during term <b>non-labouring</b> pregnancy demonstrating a similar expression pattern to prepro-ghrelin and GHS-R 1, decreased at labour, signifying possible myometrial ghrelin acylation. Moreover, the presence of PC 1 / 3 may contribute to pro-ghrelin processing.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO), {{synthesised}} enzymatically by {{nitric oxide}} synthases (NOS) from the amino acid L-arginine, {{is an important}} mediator of various physiological and pathophysiological processes in several organ systems. As a free radical gas with an unpaired electron, NO is extremely labile and it quickly reacts with its target proteins. The half-life of NO {{is only a few}} seconds during in vivo conditions. Thus, direct measurement of NO synthesis and its localisation in tissue have proved difficult. Therefore, indirect methods to identify and to localise NO production are usually employed. In this thesis, tissue samples from the human reproductive tract were obtained during operations due to legal sterilisation, benign gynaecological diseases, first trimester abortion, Caesarean section or directly after spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. The presence of an endogenous NO system within the Fallopian tube of cycling women {{as well as in the}} uterine body and cervix of pregnant women, was assessed by means of NADPH diaphorase staining, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Further, to study effects of NO, tissue strips were mounted vertically in organ baths and substances known to regulate NO synthesis as well as NO donors were administered. NADPH diaphorase staining, a traditional but non-specific histochemical marker for NOS, indicated positive staining for NOS in all tissues examined. Two isoforms of NOS, endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) were localised in the Fallopian tube and the uterine cervix at term. The expression of these two isoenzymes in the Fallopian tube of fertile women as well as in the uterine body and the cervix of term pregnant women was confirmed by immunoblotting. There was no difference in intensity of NADPH diaphorase staining or in NOS expression between samples from term pregnant <b>non-labouring</b> and labouring women. Contractility experiments further strengthened the notion of an endogenous NO system in the tissues examined. Addition of an NO donor resulted in concentration- dependent inhibition of contractile activity, thereby further indicating a physiological role of endogenously produced NO. Nitric oxide donors caused an effective inhibition of contractile activity in myometrial strips from both labouring and <b>non-labouring</b> women. Uterine cervical tissue specimens of first trimester as well as third trimester pregnant women were clearly responsive to NO in vitro. In the latter specimens, not only a dose-dependent inhibition of frequency and amplitude of contractions, but also a decrease in basal tone were registered. The present demonstration of a functional NO system within the female reproductive tract may have clinical implications...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{data have}} {{provided}} molecular evidence of {{high levels of}} endoplasmic reticulum stress in <b>non-laboured</b> placentas from cases of early-onset pre-eclampsia. Endoplasmic reticulum stress is intricately linked to oxidative stress, and the two often share the same aetiology. In the case of pre-eclampsia {{this is likely to}} be placental malperfusion, secondary to deficient conversion of the spiral arteries. Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates a number of signalling pathways aimed at restoring homeostasis, but if these attempts fail then the apoptotic machinery may be activated. The potential consequences for placental development and function are numerous and diverse. Inhibition of protein synthesis results in lower levels of many kinases, growth factors and regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle control, and experiments in vitro reveal that endoplasmic reticulum stress slows cell proliferation. Chronic, low levels of stress during the second and third trimesters may therefore result in a growth restricted phenotype. Higher levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress lead to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, a feature of pre-eclampsia that may contribute to maternal endothelial cell activation. These findings emphasise the complexity of cellular responses to stress, and the need to approach these in a holistic fashion when considering therapeutic interventions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Over half of twin pregnancies in US and UK deliver prematurely but {{the reasons}} for this are unclear. The {{contractility}} of myometrium from twin pregnancies has not been directly investigated. The objective of this research was to determine if there are differences in the contractile activity and response to oxytocin, between myometrium from singleton and twin pregnancies, across a range of gestational ages. Furthermore, we wished to determine if contractile activity correlates with increasing level of stretch, using neonatal birth weights as a marker of uterine stretch. Methods: This was an in vitro, laboratory based study of myometrial contractility in women pregnant with one or two babies, using biopsies obtained from <b>non-labouring</b> women undergoing Caesarean section. Spontaneous, oxytocin-stimulated and depolarization induced contractile activity was compared. Results: Direct measurements of myometrial contractility under controlled conditions show that the frequency of contractions and responses to oxytocin are significantly increased in twins compared to singletons. The duration of contraction however was significantly reduced. We find that contractile activity correlates with increasing levels of stretch, using neonatal birth weights as a surrogate for uterine stretch, with response to oxytocin being significantly positively correlated with birth weight. Conclusions: We have found significant differences in contractile properties between myometrium from singleton and twi...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of opioid receptors in mammalian myometrial tissue is now widely accepted. Previously enkephalin degrading enzymes {{have been shown}} to be elevated in pregnant rat uterus and a met-enkephalin analogue has been shown to alter spontaneous contractility of rat myometrium. Here we have undertaken studies to determine the effects of met-enkephalin on in vitro human myometrial contractility and investigate the expression of opioid receptors in pregnant myometrium. Myometrial biopsies were taken from women undergoing elective caesarean delivery at term. Organ bath experiments were used to investigate the effect of the met-enkephalin analogue [d-Ala 2, d-met 5] enkephalin (DAMEA) on spontaneous contractility. A confocal immunofluorescent technique and real time PCR were used to determine the expression of protein and mRNA, respectively for two opioid receptor subtypes, mu and delta. DAMEA had a concentration dependent inhibitory effect on contractile activity (1 × 10 − 7 M– 1 × 10 − 4 M; 54 % reduction in contractile activity, P< 0. 001 at 1 × 10 − 4 M concentration). Mu and delta opioid receptor protein sub-types and their respective mRNA were identified in all tissues sampled. This is the first report of opioid receptor expression and of an opioid mediated uterorelaxant action in term human <b>non-labouring</b> myometrium in vitr...|$|R
40|$|The {{contractile}} {{state of}} the human myometrium is controlled by extracellular signals that promote relaxation or contraction. Many of these signals function through G proteincoupled receptors at the cell surface, stimulating heterotrimeric G proteins and leading {{to changes in the}} activity of effector proteins responsible for bringing about the response. G proteins can interact with multiple receptors and many different effectors and are key players in the response. Regulators of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins are GTPase activating proteins for heterotrimeric G proteins and help terminate the signal. Little is known about the function of RGS proteins in human myometrium and we have therefore analysed transcript levels for RGS proteins at various stages of pregnancy (non-pregnant, preterm, term <b>non-labouring,</b> term labouring). RGS 2 and RGS 5 were the most abundantly expressed isolates in each of the patient groups. The levels of RGS 4 and RGS 16 (and to a lesser extent RGS 2 and RGS 14) increased in term labouring samples relative to the other groups. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation in myometrial cells revealed that both RGS 2 and RGS 5 interact directly with the cytoplasmic tail of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting they might help regulate signalling through this receptor.
