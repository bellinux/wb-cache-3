The second general {{division}} of names is into concrete and abstract. <b>A</b> concrete <b>name</b> is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> {{which stands for}} a thing; <b>an</b> abstract <b>name</b> is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> which stands for an attribute of a thing. Thus John, the sea, this table, are names of things. White, also, is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> of <b>a</b> thing, or rather of things. Whiteness, again, is the <b>name</b> of <b>a</b> quality or attribute of those things.

Old is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> of things: old age is <b>a</b> <b>name</b> {{of one of their}} attributes.|$|R
