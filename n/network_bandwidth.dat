25|$|It was {{important}} for warez group members to regulate who had access to these compromised FTP servers, to keep the <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth</b> usage low. A site that suddenly became very popular would be noticed by the real owners of the equipment, as their business systems became slow or low on disk space; investigation of system usage would then inevitably result in discovery and removal of the warez, and tightening of the site security.|$|E

25|$|Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a {{component}} of Microsoft Windows 2000 and later iterations of the operating systems, which facilitates asynchronous, prioritized, and throttled transfer of files between machines using idle <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> It is most commonly used by recent versions of Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Windows Server Update Services, and System Center Configuration Manager to deliver software updates to clients, Microsoft's anti-virus scanner Microsoft Security Essentials (a later version of Windows Defender) to fetch signature updates, and is also used by Microsoft's instant messaging products to transfer files. BITS is exposed through the Component Object Model (COM).|$|E
25|$|Each {{news server}} {{generally}} allocates {{a certain amount}} of storage space for post content in each newsgroup. When this storage has been filled, each time a new post arrives, old posts are deleted {{to make room for the}} new content. If the <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth</b> available to a server is high but the storage allocation is small, it is possible for a huge flood of incoming content to overflow the allocation and push out everything that was in the group before it. If the flood is large enough, the beginning of the flood will begin to be deleted even before the last part of the flood has been posted.|$|E
25|$|Like all thin clients, {{when using}} X across a <b>network,</b> <b>bandwidth</b> {{limitations}} can impede {{the use of}} bitmap-intensive applications that require rapidly updating large portions of the screen with low latency, such as 3D animation or photo editing. Even a relatively small uncompressed 640x480x24bit 30fps video stream can easily outstrip the bandwidth of a 100Mbit/s network for a single client. In contrast, modern versions of X generally have extensions such as MESA allowing local display of a local program's graphics to be optimized to bypass the network model and directly control the video card, for use of full-screen video, rendered 3D applications, and other such applications.|$|E
40|$|Many {{scientific}} applications need {{to stage}} {{large volumes of}} files from one set of machines to another set of machines in a wide-area network. Efficient execution of such data transfers needs {{to take into account}} the heterogeneous nature of the environment and dynamic availability of shared resources. This paper proposes an algorithm that dynamically schedules a batch of data transfer requests with the goal of minimizing the overall transfer time. The proposed algorithm performs simultaneous transfer of chunks of files from multiple file replicas, if the replicas exist. Adaptive replica selection is employed to transfer different chunks of the same file by taking dynamically changing <b>network</b> <b>bandwidths</b> into account. We utilize GridFTP as the underlying mechanism for data transfers. The algorithm makes use of information from past GridFTP transfers to estimate <b>network</b> <b>bandwidths</b> and resource availability. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated on a wide-area testbed. ...|$|R
25|$|A {{smurf attack}} relies on misconfigured network devices that allow packets {{to be sent}} to all {{computer}} hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network, rather than a specific machine. The attacker will send large numbers of IP packets with the source address faked to appear to be the address of the victim.

30|$|In [23], {{the authors}} propose a {{vertical}} handover algorithm between LTE and WLAN consisting of three steps. The first step aims {{to initiate the}} handover based on RSS (received signal strength). In the second step, a fuzzy logic system compares four parameters provided by the two <b>networks</b> (<b>bandwidth,</b> SNR, battery life, and network load) to decide which network provides the best connectivity. In the third step, a seamless vertical handover is executed.|$|R
25|$|BITS {{provides}} API {{access to}} control jobs. A job can be programmatically started, stopped, paused, resumed, and queried for status. Before starting a job, a priority {{has to be}} set for it to specify when the job is processed relative to other jobs in the transfer queue. By default, all jobs are of Normal priority. Jobs can optionally be set to High, Low, or Foreground priority. Background transfers are optimized by BITS, which increases and decreases (or throttles) the rate of transfer based {{on the amount of}} idle <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth</b> that is available. If a network application begins to consume more bandwidth, BITS decreases its transfer rate to preserve the user's interactive experience, except for Foreground priority downloads.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{requires}} sufficient servers and bandwidth, and {{a dedicated}} support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to lag and frustration for the players, and can severely damage {{the reputation of}} a game, especially at launch. Care {{must also be taken}} to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers. Peer-to-peer MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> CPU-hungry rendering engines, unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security (opening fertile new grounds for cheating) can make them a difficult proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers. Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.|$|E

Although quite a few research progresses {{have been made in the}} wired <b>networks,</b> the <b>bandwidth</b> measurement in the wireless mesh networks is yet to be explored. In the latter domain, we need to face totally new challenges including cross-traffic interference and multihop effect.

40|$|Multimedia {{streaming}} applications consume {{significant amounts}} of server and network resources due to the high bandwidth requirements and long duration of audio and video clips. For popular videos, periodic broadcast techniques [1 - 4] exploit the client's buffer space and <b>network</b> reception <b>bandwidth</b> capabilities to reduce server and <b>network</b> transmission <b>bandwidth</b> requirements to serve a new client, while guaranteeing that the playback startup latency does not exceed a prescribed threshold. In this paper, we systematically study the fundamental tradeoffs among the server and <b>network</b> transmission <b>bandwidths,</b> client buffer, client reception bandwidth, and the playback startup delay for periodic broadcast. We adopt a fine-grained fluid transmission model and consider a class of frame-based periodic transmission schemes which assign a fixed transmission bandwidth to each frame in the video, and continuously transmit each frame according to this rate.

For illustration, one network video conference example was utilized to show the method in solving bandwidth allocation unfairness problem. The experimental results show <b>network</b> <b>bandwidths</b> are fairly allocated, packet loss ratio and latency is obvious improvement.

2500|$|Windows Server 2012's {{implementation}} of Hyper-V (Version 3.0) introduced many new features to increase VM mobility, including {{the ability to}} execute simultaneous live migrations (Windows Server 2008 R2 only supported live migrating a single VM at a time, significantly increasing {{the time required to}} carry administrative tasks, such as draining a node for scheduled maintenance). The only real limiting factor here is hardware and <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth</b> available. Windows Server 2012 also supports a new [...] "shared nothing live migration" [...] option, where no traditional shared storage is required in order to complete a migration. Also referred to as “Live System Migration”, a shared nothing live migration will move a running VM and its storage from one Hyper-V host to another without any perceived downtime. Live Migration between different host OS versions is not possible, although this is soon to be addressed in Windows Server 2012 R2.|$|E
2500|$|On average, Communications service {{providers}} utilize {{an average of}} just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity. Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers [...] with innovative services.|$|E
2500|$|First {{discovered}} in 2009, the HTTP POST attack sends a complete, legitimate HTTP POST header, {{which includes a}} 'Content-Length' field to specify {{the size of the}} message body to follow. However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the 'Content-Length' field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections, until all resources for incoming connections on the server (the victim) are used up, hence making any further (including legitimate) connections impossible until all data has been sent. It is notable that unlike many other (D)DoS attacks, which try to subdue the server by overloading its network or CPU, a HTTP POST attack targets the logical resources of the victim, which means the victim would still have enough <b>network</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and processing power to operate. Further combined with the fact that Apache will, by default, accept requests up to 2GB in size, this attack can be particularly powerful. HTTP POST attacks are difficult to differentiate from legitimate connections, and are therefore able to bypass some protection systems. OWASP, an open source web application security project, has released a [...] to test the security of servers against this type of attacks.|$|E
