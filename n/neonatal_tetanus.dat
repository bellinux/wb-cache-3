25|$|The World Health Organization {{certifies}} {{countries as}} having eliminated maternal or <b>neonatal</b> <b>tetanus.</b> Certification requires {{at least two}} years of rates of less than 1 case per 1000 live births.

25|$|The {{incubation}} period of tetanus may {{be up to}} several months, but is usually about ten days.

Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister 'discovered' antiseptics in 1865 in light of the work of Louis Pasteur.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines on {{prenatal}} {{care in the}} United States state that, if an urgent need for tetanus protection occurs during pregnancy, Td vaccine should be administered. If no urgent need arises and the woman has previously received tetanus vaccine, Td vaccination should be delayed until the postpartum period. All postpartum women who have not received Td or Tdap vaccine {{in the last two}} years are recommended to receive Tdap prior to discharge after delivery. It is recommended for pregnant women who have never received tetanus vaccine (i.e., have never received DTP, DTaP or DT as child or Td or TT as adult) to receive a series of three Td vaccinations starting during pregnancy to ensure protection against maternal and <b>neonatal</b> <b>tetanus.</b> In such cases, administration of Tdap is recommended after 20 weeks' gestation, and in earlier pregnancy a single dose of Tdap can be substituted for one dose of Td, and then the series completed with Td.|$|E

In 2010, 91 children died before their fifth birthday for every 1000 live births, down from 163 under five deaths for every 1000 live births in 1990. Prevalence of some diseases is declining, including the elimination of maternal and <b>neonatal</b> <b>tetanus</b> and a sharp reduction in malaria morbidity, mortality rate, and specific lethality.

40|$|In recent years, tetanus and measles are {{estimated}} to {{account for more than}} 2. 5 million childhood deaths annually; measles alone may account for more than 2 million such deaths. The author reviews empirical evidence on the most effective and feasible strategies for measles and tetanus vaccination programs. He found that tetanus and measles immunization programs could significantly reduce deaths among children up to the age of 4 in many developing countries. Vaccinations had a pronounced effect in reducing childhood deaths from measles - with benefits sustained over time, and with the greatest benefits accruing to the most disadvantaged children. He found little support for the existence of a replacement mortality effect. Studies on maternal immunization against tetanus showed a great {{reduction in the number of}} neonatal deaths, but considerable uncertainty about the number of doses needed and how long the immunity lasted. Recent evidence suggests that giving the mother two doses of tetanus toxoid may confer significant levels of protection against <b>neonatal</b> death from <b>tetanus</b> for 15 years or more.

40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> and {{maternal}} <b>tetanus</b> infections remain an important {{cause of death}} in many countries. Few studies have reported tetanus toxoid antibody levels of adolescent girls. As part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization most girls receive up to 3 injections in early childhood, and many subsequently do not receive booster vaccinations until pregnant. We determined (by ELISA) tetanus antibody seropositivity in adolescent girls from Malawi (in 1996), Nigeria (in 1993) and Pakistan (in 1996), and response to tetanus vaccination in adolescent girls from Pakistan. Geometric mean titres (GMT, IU/mL) were 0. 94 in 117 Malawian, 0. 32 in 154 Nigerian and 1. 08 in 162 Pakistani girls. In Nigeria, 54. 7 % of adolescents were seronegative, of whom 26. 8 % had a history of unsafe abortion. In Malawi and Pakistan all girls were seropositive and in Pakistan, following a booster vaccination, titres increased 3 -fold, with a lower response in older girls. The results indicated that adequate childhood immunization is likely to provide protective levels through adolescence. Booster vaccination in late childhood/early adolescence should protect the majority of women throughout their reproductive lives. This practice would reduce the risks of girls exposed to infection through unsafe abortions, and may be the best option for countries seeking to improve their vaccination schedule, especially where tetanus vaccine coverage in pregnant women is unacceptably lo...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Population-based {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} in selected clusters of Pakistan's least developed provinces, Balochistan and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), to assess levels and causes of neonatal and postneonatal mortality. METHODS: Interviews {{were conducted in}} a total of 54 834 households: Balochistan, 20 486; NWFP, 26 175; and FATA, 8173. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires after obtaining verbal informed consent from the respondents. Verbal autopsy interviews were conducted for infant deaths reported for the previous year. FINDINGS: The infant mortality rate based on combined data from the different sites was 99. 7 per 1000 live births (range 129. 0 - 70. 1). The contribution of neonatal deaths to all infant deaths was much higher for NWFP (67. 2 %), where the overall rate was lowest, than for Balochistan (50. 8 %) and FATA (56. 8 %). Around 70 % of all neonatal deaths occurred in the early neonatal period. The three main clinical causes of infant deaths were diarrhoea syndrome (21. 6 %), tetanus (11. 7 %) and acute respiratory infections (11. 6 %). In the <b>neonatal</b> period, however, <b>tetanus</b> (18. 3 %), small size for gestational age or low birth weight (15. 3 %), and birth injury (12. 0 %) accounted for nearly half (45. 6 %) of all deaths, while the contributions of diarrhoea syndrome (5. 1 %) and acute respiratory infections (6. 0 %) were less significant (11. 1 %). Tetanus was the cause of death for 21. 7 % and 17. 1 % of all infant deaths in FATA and NWFP respectively.
