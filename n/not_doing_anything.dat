5|$|Following the Super Viernes on August 13, 2010, {{where he}} {{attacked}} La Máscara, Volador Jr. began being booked as rudo, although the on again, off again feud with Místico {{was put to}} the side in favor of Volador Jr. against La Sombra. The feud between the two led both wrestlers to be booked in the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show, a 14-man steel cage Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match. Volador Jr. was the 10th man to leave the steel cage, keeping his mask safe. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Olímpico to unmask him. On September 17, Volador Jr. {{picked up one of}} the biggest wins in his CMLL career, defeating Místico in the finals of a tournament to win the Copa Bicentenario. On October 5, 2010, Volador Jr. lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to La Máscara, ending his reign at 236 days. After losing the title, Volador Jr. spent several months <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> significant in CMLL until he took over the Los Invasores stable in July 2011, when its leader Héctor Garza turned tecnico. On September 18, Volador Jr. unsuccessfully challenged former partner La Sombra for the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship, in a match that received rave reviews. Two days later, Volador Jr. led Olímpico and Psicosis II of Los Invasores to the Mexican National Trios Championship, when they defeated the trio of Ángel de Oro, Diamante and Rush. Volador Jr. continued his successful run on September 23 by defeating eleven other men in a torneo cibernetico to advance to the finals of the 2011 Leyenda de Plata. On October 7, Volador Jr. defeated Jushin Thunder Liger to win the tournament. Los Invasores lost the Mexican National Trios Championship to Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. on December 16, 2011. On February 14, 2012, Volador Jr. defeated La Máscara to win the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship for the first time. On March 30, Volador Jr. lost the title to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) representative Prince Devitt.|$|E

Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer.

In all actuality, Perry is a skilled fighter {{who is able to}} perform several implausible judo fighting moves and escapes. He has access to several different types of technology and inventions provided to him by The O.W.C.A., including a hover craft dubbed the [...] "Platypusmobile," [...] a jet ski, and a whistle set that allows him to summon different types of animals.

500|$|In {{the eleven}} years {{up to and}} {{including}} Traviata, Verdi had written sixteen operas. Over the next eighteen years (up to Aida), he wrote only six new works for the stage. [...] Verdi was happy to return to Sant'Agata and, in February 1856, was reporting a [...] "total abandonment of music; a little reading; some light occupation with agriculture and horses; that's all". A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything.</b> I don't read. I don't write. I walk in the fields from morning to evening, trying to recover, so far without success, from the stomach trouble caused me by I vespri siciliani. Cursed operas!" [...] An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: [...] "His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury—anything you like that is exaggerated. [...] He gets up almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc....Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed." ...|$|E

[...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts.

500|$|David's mother Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) {{is shocked}} to learn the {{identity}} of his mystery fiancée, and disapproves of Kylie. The pair repeatedly clash in scenes that serve as comic relief. Gail dislikes Kylie because she [...] "knows her type", {{and the fact that}} she is related to Becky does not bode well. Lane said that Gail's reaction was understandable because Kylie is not the epitome of [...] "the perfect daughter-in-law." [...] She added that because Gail is so possessive of David, [...] "it doesn't bode well for the future." [...] Shepherd added that they are [...] "the match made in hell" [...] and revealed that David lets her do as she pleases because he is in love with her. He later said that David appeared obsessed and shared the similar dynamic he had with previous girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). He concluded: [...] "I think he's keener on her than she is on him." [...] David fools Kylie into believing he owns a salon.

500|$|For {{the first}} of the {{afternoon}} concert's two sets, the band performed the compositions [...] "Tatu", [...] "Agharta Prelude", and [...] "Maiysha" [...] (from Get Up with It), making up Aghartas first disc of music. The second-set performances of [...] "Right Off" [...] (from Davis' 1971 Jack Johnson album), [...] "Ife" [...] (from Big Fun), and [...] "Wili (= For Dave)" [...] spanned the second disc; between the [...] "Right Off" [...] and [...] "Ife" [...] segments, the band improvised a passage based on [...] "So What" [...] (from the 1959 album Kind of Blue) for 41 seconds after Henderson started to play its ostinato. The pieces were performed in medleys, which were given generic track titles on Agharta, such as [...] "Prelude" [...] and [...] "Interlude". As with his other live releases in the 1970s, Davis refused to have individual compositions specified in the track listing because he felt critics and other listeners often overlooked the music's intrinsic meaning by indulging in abstract musical analysis. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything,</b> it doesn't need an explanation", he later told Leonard Feather. Music scholars were able to identify the pieces through an examination of what Davis researcher Enrico Merlin called [...] "coded phrases", which Davis played on trumpet or organ to signify the end of one segment and direct the band toward the next section. He first used such cues and modulations when recording [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] in 1959, Merlin said.|$|E
500|$|German public {{discourse}} does not regard Scientology as a religion, but generally characterizes it as a Sekte (cult or sect), {{or as an}} exploitative profit-making venture preying on vulnerable minds. Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults {{date back to the}} early 1970s, when widespread debate took place about [...] "youth religions" [...] such as the Unification Church, ISKCON, Children of God, and the Divine Light Mission. The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the [...] "sect commissioners" [...] (Sektenbeauftragte) of Germany's Protestant Churches, who also actively promoted the establishment of private [...] "initiatives of parents and concerned persons". Aktion Bildungsinformation ("Educational Information Campaign") became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology; taking an activist stance, it warned people not to get involved with Scientology, filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its proselytizing in public places, and published an influential book, The Sect of Scientology and its Front Organizations. In 1981, the organization's founder, Ingo Heinemann, became the director of Aktion für geistige und psychische Freiheit ("Campaign for Intellectual and Psychic Freedom"), Germany's most prominent anti-cult organization. Warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation; as the movements were <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> illegal, the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects, the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979.|$|E
