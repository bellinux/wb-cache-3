50|$|The {{operating}} principle of a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>generator</b> utilizing the adsorption technology {{is based upon}} the dependence of the adsorption rates featured by various gas mixture components upon pressure and temperature factors.

50|$|With {{respect to}} the {{simplicity}} of the system, a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>generator</b> can be split into modules. This is in direct contrast to classical systems where the equipment is designed for a certain stage of the separation process. Using a modular system, the generation facility may be built from a selection of preexisting equipment and where necessary, the output capacity of a plant may be increased at the minimum cost. This option appears all the more useful where a project envisages a subsequent increase in enterprise capacity, or where demand may simply require on site production of nitrogen by employing equipment that is already present.|$|E

5000|$|PSA <b>nitrogen</b> <b>generator</b> plants allow {{production}} of high-purity nitrogen from air, which membrane systems {{are unable to}} provide - up to 99.9995% nitrogen [...]But in most cases they do not produce more than 98.8% nitrogen with the remainder being argon that is not separated from the nitrogen by the usual PSA process. The argon is not normally a problem. As argon is more inert than nitrogen. This nitrogen purity may also be ensured by cryogenic systems, but they are considerably more complex and justified only by large consumption volumes. The nitrogen generators use CMS (carbon molecular sieve) technology to produce a continuous supply of ultra high purity nitrogen and are available with internal compressors or without.|$|E

5000|$|Increased {{corrosion}} potential - Following operation or testing, dry-pipe sprinkler system piping is drained, but residual water collects in piping low spots, and moisture is also {{retained in the}} atmosphere within the piping. This moisture, coupled with the oxygen available in the compressed air in the piping, increases internal pipe corrosion, eventually leading to pin-hole leaks or other piping failures. The internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems (in which the piping is constantly full of water) is much lower, {{as the amount of}} oxygen available for the corrosion process is lower. Corrosion can be combated by using copper or stainless steel pipe which is less susceptible to corrosion, or by using dry nitrogen gas to pressurize the system, rather than air. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>generators</b> {{can be used as a}} permanent source of nitrogen gas, which is beneficial because dry pipe sprinkler systems require an uninterrupted supply of supervisory gas.
