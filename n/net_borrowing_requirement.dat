Both adjustments are important, even when looking at year-to-year changes in the structural deficit. When the stance of fiscal policy is measured by the structural deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, four years stand out as years of major changes. In each of the years 1973 - 74, 1979 - 80 and 1987 - 88 the stance of fiscal policy was substantially tightened with the abrupt tightening in 1979 - 80 being the largest change, though not much larger than that in 1973 - 74. By far the biggest change relaxing the stance of fiscal policy was in 1983 - 84, and the change in this year was the biggest of any change in either direction in the period.

Household and business <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> shares and thereby those sectors' contributions to effective demand are procyclical. Household borrowing over the cycle is led by residential investment. Consumption varies countercyclically, but it is offset by rising taxes as opposed to saving, suggesting that "consumption smoothing" by households as featured in much macro theory is not empirically important. Procyclicality of private <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> is countered by a countercyclical government deficit along traditional lines. In terms of trends, "twin" fiscal and foreign deficits appear infrequently, with the household and external deficits being much more closely related. The former is linked to a strong upward trend in health-care spending as a share of disposable income, with a corresponding downward trend in saving after the early 1980 s. consumption smoothing, <b>net</b> <b>borrowing,</b> twin deficits,...|$|R

This paper examines the sources of discrepancies between <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> and accumulation of net liabilities for the U. S. economy over the past 25 years. In particular, it highlights and quantifies the role played by net capital gains on the U. S. external portfolio and ‘residual adjustments’ in explaining this discrepancy. It discusses whether these ‘residual adjustments’ are likely to be originating from measurement errors in external assets and liabilities, financial flows, or capital gains, and explores the implications of these conjectures for the U.

Further investigation, in the form of econometric analysis of panel data, also points to this outcome.

40|$|According to {{the fiscal}} {{federalism}} literature sub-central budget constraints become softer when {{local governments are}} more dependent on revenues over which they have no discretion. As a consequence of higher "transfer dependency", sub-central governments can expect to be bailed out by the central government and therefore tend to accumulate higher levels of debt. We test this conjecture with data from Austrian municipalities. Austria is a fiscally highly centralised federation in which tax autonomy at the sub-central level is almost absent. Our identification strategy {{is based on a}} discontinuity caused by a special regulation on population weights in the tax sharing agreement between central government and the municipalities. We analyse the discontinuity in the conditional expectation of borrowing given population size to unveil an average causal effect of the treatment. Our results indicate that in line with theoretical expectations municipalities with higher revenue dependency observe higher <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> per capita.

40|$|This {{study is}} about the growth and {{development}} performance of non-industrialized regions {{in the latter part}} of the 20 th century. We find that sustained per capita GDP growth was accompanied by structural change in terms of output and labor share shifts as well as productivity growth with (in some cases) strong reallocation effects due to movements of labor from low to high productivity sectors. Regions that did not enjoy per capita growth showed little structural evolution apart from a rising employment/population ratio in service sectors. On the demand side, we examine shifts in <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> by the private sector, government, and rest of the world. Mutually offsetting co-movements of government and foreign <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> occurred sporadically at most. In other words, the widely accepted “twin deficits” view of macro adjustment does not seem to apply. Macroeconomic flexibility, on the other hand, may be very important. The policy background for these findings is sketched out along with a critique of justifications provided by the World Bank. Proposals are advanced for policy changes. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper investigates {{net lending}} and <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> flows of the {{institutional}} sectors in Europe since {{the introduction of the}} Euro in 1999. Applying a simple statistical apparatus, this paper is novel in describing the sectoral behavior leading up to and during the crisis. We find that (1) many countries of the Northern group were characterized by low public deficits or even budget surpluses, current account surpluses and a private sector in a net lending position. In countries of the Southern periphery, in the Anglo-Saxon countries as well as in many Eastern European Economies private sector <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> coincided with a budget deficit and substantial current account deficits. (2) With the onset of the crisis private net lending soared in all countries while all governments incurred deficits, consistent with the notion of a balance sheet recession. (3) Private net lending is pro-cyclical, reinforcing the economic downturn, while public net lending is countercyclical in all countries. (4) Household net lending tends to lead the business cycle, while corporate net lending tends to lag it especially in the Northern group. (5) Prominent concepts asserting causal relationships in sectoral net lending, such as Ricardian equivalence and the twin deficit hypothesis are not supported by the data.
