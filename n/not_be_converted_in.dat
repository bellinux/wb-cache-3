40|$|The Datacon {{system is}} a serial coaxial {{transformer}} isolated communication field bus system used to control and monitor accelerator remote devices. The Datacon field bus has been a BNL accelerator standard since its initial use in 1965. A single Datacon field bus supports up to 256 devices on a multidrop RG 62 A/U coaxial cable with up to 33 devices or 2, 000 feet between repeaters or buffered branches. The forcing factor to renovate was the inability to repair the aging PDP- 8 E and PDP 10 computers. The maintenance on this aging system was costly and {{the large number of}} accelerator devices dependent on the Datacon system could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> a reasonable period of time to a new modern field bus. A commercial VMEbus host CPU mated with a custom designed VMEbus SBC event driven serial communications engine featuring a superscaler RISC 32 -bit Intel i 960 CPU met the design challenge. The commercial VMEbus host runs the VxWorks real-time operating system and connects to UNIX workstations over a Ethernet LAN.

40|$|The {{manganese}} {{superoxide dismutase}} from lyposarcoma (LSA-MnSOD) is a tumor protein isolated and sequenced, {{for the first}} time, in human lyposarcoma cells (LSA) in the Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Cancer Institute of Naples, G. Pascale, by Dr. Aldo Mancini. This protein showed a rapid and effective anti-cancer activity consisting of a selective cytotoxicity on certain human breast cancer cells (MCF- 7), and no cytotoxic effect on normal cells, such as normal human mammary epithelium (MCF- 10) and fibroblasts (MRC- 5). This protein was sequenced and produced as recombinant form (rMnSOD). The rMnSOD demonstrated the ability to enter both normal and cancer cells and to perform antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals, turning them into hydrogen peroxide that only normal cells are able to transform into molecular oxygen and water, due to their normal levels of catalase. In cancer cells – by their well known catalase underproduction, up to 10 - 100 times, as compared to normal cells – the peroxide can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> oxygen, so that only cancer cells will reach the threshold of toxicity that will cause apoptotic death. The surprising effect of this molecule is, however, due to its ability, following injection in vivo, to penetrate all cells giving off its antioxidant potential, through its enzymatic activity. Both LSA-MnSOD and the rMnSOD were sequenced and compared to the common mitochondrial form. The difference lies {{in the presence of}} a leader peptide detected only in LSA–MnSOD, thus explaining the unusual characteristic of the protein of entering cells, while the native protein remains confined to the mitochondrial compartment. So the leader peptide has been synthesized (rMnSOD-LP) and injected in vitro and in vivo, thus demonstrating its ability to enter cells. These experiments highlighted its role as a molecular carrier. Further studies about its carrier function were performed by conjugation of this peptide to radioactive 68 Ga and its subsequent injection into animals affected by mammary tumors. PET analysis, performed two hours after injection in animals (dogs and cats), demonstrated internalization of the synthetic construct in the tumor and in its metastasis, thus allowing a more accurate identification in the body. Experiments in progress are demonstrating the ability of the leader peptide to deliver a conjugated cysplatin directly inside the tumor cells (as quantitatively demonstrated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) and delivering cisplatin toxic load. This internalization rapidly leads to cell death in vitro and in vivo. As a further demonstration of the ability of rMnSOD to repair the damage caused by radical excess, its topical formulation has been used to treat animals affected by extended necrotic lesions, which quickly returned to the structural and functional integrity of all tissues affected by necrosis. More recently, a significant reduction of tissue injury from X ray damage was demonstrated by using MnSOD-plasmid/liposome treatments in the protection of murine lung. The latter studies demonstrated that rMnSOD not only exerts radioprotective effect on normal cells, but it is also radiosensitizing for tumor cell...|$|E

40|$|Action {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} from slips of the cervical vagi in anaesthetized cats. Single functional units with atrial patterns of discharge (type A, B and Intermediate) were first obtained and then {{attempts were made}} to alter (i. e. convert) their patterns of discharge. Finally the points of origin of their action potentials were located. The investigations were done in five stages. 2. In the first series, thirty unselected units were investigated in thirty cats. Twenty-five of these were located in the endocardium of vein-atrial system and consisted of two type A, fifteen type B and eight Intermediate type units. The remaining five units were located elsewhere in the chest Conversion of the pattern of discharge was achieved in sixteen of the twenty-five atrial units. Both atrial type A units <b>were</b> <b>converted.</b> 3. <b>In</b> the second series, eight type A units were selectively studied in twelve cats. Five were located in the atrial endocardium and all <b>were</b> <b>converted.</b> Of the other three units which were located at other sites in the chest, one could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted.</b> 4. <b>In</b> the third series, four type A units which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>were</b> selectively studied <b>in</b> twenty cats.

The present study has shown that atrial receptors with a type A pattern of discharge are relatively rare in the cat and that conversion of the patterns of discharge is a common phenomenon.

40|$|The {{substrate}} {{requirements for}} angiotensin I-converting enzyme were studied in vivo {{in the dog}} lung and in vitro in plasma, using angiotensin I (AI), 5 -D-Ile-AI, 7 -D-Pro-AI, and 8 -r>Phe-AI which had been synthesized by the solid-phase technique. All peptides were inactive in the rabbit aortic strip preparation. None of the D-amino acid—substituted peptides gave a pressor response in the anesthetized dog; none showed significant immunologic cross-reactivity with anti-AI serum or antiangiotensin II serum. Each peptide was labeled with 125 I, and the monoiodinated species was isolated. The iodinated peptides were incubated with diluted dog plasma or injected into the right ventricle of intact anesthetized dogs. In vitro, 125 I-AI, 125 I- 5 -D-Ile-AI, and 125 I- 7 -D-Pro-AI <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> to angiotensin II (All). 8 -D-Phe-AI <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>converted.</b> <b>In</b> vivo, 15 seconds after injecting 125 I-AI, 125 I- 5 -D-IIe-AI, or 125 I- 7 -r>Pro-AI into the right ventricle, 125 I-AII accounted for 70, 60, and 45 %, respectively, of the radioactive material in aortic blood.

40|$|Abstract — The {{energy storage}} in an SMES {{is in the}} state of {{magnetic}} field within a superconductor coil. The magnetic field is formed by flowing DC current in the SMES. To ensure proper operation the temperature of SMES should be maintained below critical temperature. At this temperature the resistance of the coil is zero and hence there is no loss in stored energy. The ability of SMES to store energy is influenced by the current density. The energy is fed back to the grid by conversion of magnetic field into electrical energy. An SMES system has a superconductor, refrigerant, power conditioning unit and control unit. The storage of energy is achieved by continuous circulation of current inside the coil. Since the energy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> any form other than electrical there are lesser losses in SMES configuration than any other storage mechanism. Thus the efficiency is very high. It inhibits very low cycling time and the number of charge discharge cycles is very high. The major drawbacks of this technology being very high initial cost as well as losses associated with auxiliaries. This paper covers various aspects of SMES configuration and its connection i...|$|R

40|$|Salvarsan in capsule and in {{solution}} in doses varying from 0. 1 to 0. 6 of a gram was administered by mouth to seven patients suffering from syphilis. Five patients were given full doses of 0. 6 of a gram. One patient (case 3) {{received in the}} aggregate within four weeks 2. 4 grams without loss of weight or any disturbing effects. An ulcerating gumma of the knee was practically healed {{after a period of}} five weeks. This was the only patient of the seven, however, in whom notable improvement in the cutaneous manifestations followed the administration of the drug. This ulceration would probably have healed as soon, or possibly sooner, under the influence of mercury and the iodids. From the above observations, it would appear that salvarsan administered by mouth up to the full dose of 0. 6 of a gram, has a perceptible though feeble therapeutic effect on cutaneous syphilitic manifestations. We should naturally expect the influence of any drug to be more evident {{in the case of a}} gumma, in which spirochætes are only sparsely present, than in the secondary syphilides in which the spirochætes are present in enormous numbers. Cutaneous gummata are readily healed at times by very small doses of mercury or iodids. It is interesting to note that the administration of the full dose of the drug by mouth does not appear to give rise to symptoms of systemic arsenical poisoning, unless the vomiting and diarrhea be regarded as such. After some of the full dose administrations, there was neither vomiting nor diarrhea. As salvarsan contains 34 per cent. of arsenic, these patients received the equivalent of five grains of arsenic. In case 3, in the course of four weeks the patient took by mouth the equivalent of over twelve grains of arsenic, without vomiting or having diarrhea, and with no loss of weight or disturbance of health. The urine of this patient was entirely normal. It would seem, therefore, that salvarsan <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> the gastro-intestinal tract into an organotropic arsenical compound, and it is possible that it may remain practically unchanged...|$|R
