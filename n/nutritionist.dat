40|$|Background: As health professionals, <b>nutritionists</b> are {{supposed}} to have good body image, although <b>nutritionists</b> may be overweight or obese. Body image of <b>nutritionists</b> will determine the quality of nutrition service particularly in giving evidence and assurance to the clients. As nutritionist-to-be, nutrition students are expected to have good knowledge and appearance because these will reflect quality of <b>nutritionists</b> in the future. Objective: To identify perception of students of health nutrition study program of the Faculty of Medicine about body image of <b>nutritionists.</b> Method: The study used qualitative descriptive method and case study design. It was carried out in Yogyakarta from October to December 2008. Subject of the study were 23 undergraduate students of Health Nutrition Study Program of Gadjah Mada University of both class A and B. Data were obtained through focus group discussion and in-depth interview. Data validity and reliability used source and method triangulation to 7 lectures of health nutrition Gadjah Mada University. Results: Body image was someone’s physical appearance as viewed by one or others and the effect of mass media in the assessment of body image was relatively significant. Body image of <b>nutritionists</b> was important because it would affect trust of the clients and success in counseling. <b>Nutritionists</b> had responsibility in giving an exemplary healthy life to the community either in physical image or appearance so that <b>nutritionists</b> were supposed to have ideal body posture and good body performance. Conclusion: Good body image for <b>nutritionists</b> would determine quality of counseling and trust of the clients. <b>Nutritionists</b> had responsibility to give an exemplary healthy life to the community. Therefore it was necessary to do monitoring and socialization from the academics as well as related institutions such as association of <b>nutritionists</b> about body image of <b>nutritionists</b> and nutrition students from now on and in the future...|$|R

After parting ways with American sprinter Tim Montgomery, Conte looked to Chambers to fill the athlete's berth. In the run up to the year's major events, Chambers was in fine form and recorded a 200m personal best of 20.27s in Athens on 10 June 2002.

5|$|Cotto {{returned}} to action on February 21, 2009, in a card {{held at the}} Madison Square Garden, sporting {{the first of his}} trademark tattoos which he has expanded on ever since. This time competing against Michael Jennings for the vacant WBO welterweight title. After both pugilists used the first round to study their opponent's style, the tempo accelerated during the second. In the third, Cotto pursued the offensive more fluidly, connecting with jabs and hooks. One round later, Cotto scored two knockdowns on Jennings, who was able to continue until the recess. In the fifth, Jennings was trapped against the ropes, which Cotto utilized to connect a right hook to score a third knockdown. Jennings incorporated, but the referee decided to stop the fight. With this action, Cotto was awarded a technical knockout victory, in the process winning his second championship in the welterweight division. On April 8, 2009, Cotto fired his uncle from the team's staff, following a violent discussion where his property was damaged. However, neither side expressed interest in pursuing any sort of legal action. Consequently, Cotto named Joe Santiago, who had served as the team's <b>nutritionist</b> as his new trainer.|$|E

40|$|Objectives - To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of a motivational interviewing (MI) training programme on trainee <b>nutritionists.</b> Methods - A repeated measures design was applied to assess clinician behaviours in a ‘helping’ conversation. Participants were 32 nutrition students, assessed at baseline and one-month follow-up. Results - The training significantly reduced the use of closed questions and MI non-adherent behaviours (MINA) (P for both = < 0. 001). Trainees significantly increased reflections, affirmations, summaries (P for all = < 0. 001) {{and the use of}} open questions (P = < 0. 013) which are all key indicators of MI beginner-competence. The talk-time ratio of the <b>nutritionists</b> also changed significantly, in favour of the client which serves as an indication of MI being used effectively. There were also significant increases in ‘global' scores for empathy, direction, autonomy/support, collaboration and evocation. Conclusions - Newly trained <b>nutritionists</b> 1 month post-training have a consultation style which suggested positive outcomes for clients. The trainees' scores at the one month post-training assessment were verifiable as ‘beginning proficiency'. Practice implications - Behaviour change counselling skills for <b>nutritionists</b> were enhanced, at one month post-training.

Conclusions: Modifications in structure, training and support of the public health nutrition workforce, facilitation of professional and cultural partnerships, outcome evaluation and localisation and evaluation of health messages may promote more meaningful nutrition communication in remote communities.
