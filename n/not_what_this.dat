5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was <b>not.</b> <b>What</b> <b>this</b> image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} 8 on 10, Alex Needham from NME criticized the compilation's lack of new tracks, and said [...] "while far from immaculate, {{this is still}} quite a collection". About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less {{than the sum of its}} parts, even if this is a good way to get all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't seem to do justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E

"Mr. Platt {{has worked}} out an idea so {{striking}} for its attractiveness and utility that, perceiving it, we at once go to work wondering that somebody else had not executed it before him. He has gone over the vast and superb areas of John Ruskin's Writings, and cutting out one block here and another there, as it has suited his purpose, has put all these parts together again into a literary mosaic, constituting a clear and harmonious system of art principles, wherein Ruskin all the while is the teacher.

Haste out, however, is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> Lord Loudon or his rival can make.

6000|$|What! {{shall not}} the {{worthiness}} of the Son of God {{be sufficient to}} save from the sin of man? or shall the sin of the world be of that weight to destroy, that it shall put Christ Jesus to the uttermost of the worth of his person and merit to save therefrom? I believe it is blasphemy to think so. We can easily imagine that he can save all the world--that is, that he is of ability to do it; but we cannot imagine {{that he can do}} no more than we can think he can. But our imagination and thoughts set no bound to his ability. 'He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.' But what that is, I say, no man can think, no man can imagine. So, then, Jesus Christ can do more than ever any man thought he could do as to saving; he can do we know <b>not</b> <b>what.</b> <b>This,</b> therefore, should encourage comers to come to him; and them that come, to hope. This, I say, should encourage them to let out, to lengthen, and heighten their thoughts by the word, to the uttermost, seeing he can 'save to the uttermost them that come to God by him.'6 ...|$|E
