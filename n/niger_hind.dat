This calls for cooperation and collaboration between various sea-users and researchers to ensure continuous monitoring of coastal biodiversity. Methods Research methods involving local fishermen cooperation in monitoring efforts to identify and track populations of alien species in the Central Mediterranean has led to new records for the genus Cephalopholis (Perciformes: Serranidae) in Malta. Morphological characteristics, meristic counts and mitochondrial DNA sequences from specimens of both species sampled from Maltese waters were analysed to confirm their species identify accurately, essential for tracking their respective population expansions in the Mediterranean. Results and conclusion Results from this study have led to confirmation of the first record of the <b>Niger</b> <b>Hind,</b> Cephalopholis nigri (GÃ¼nther, 1859), in the Mediterranean Sea and of {{the establishment of the}} African Hind, Cephalopholis taeniops (Valenciennes, 1828) in Maltese waters...|$|E
