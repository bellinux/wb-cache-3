5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E

25|$|Louis XIV had {{considered}} William's invasion as {{a declaration of}} war between France and the Dutch Republic (officially declared on 26 November); but he did little to stop the invasion – his main concern was the Rhineland. Moreover, French diplomats had calculated that William's action would plunge England into a protracted civil war that would either absorb Dutch resources or draw England closer to France. However, after landing his forces unhindered at Torbay on 5 November (O.S) 1688, many welcomed William with open arms, and the subsequent Glorious Revolution brought a rapid end to James II's reign. On 13 February 1689 (O.S.) William of Orange became King William III of England – reigning jointly with his wife Mary – and bound together the fortunes of England and the Dutch Republic. Yet few people in England suspected that William had sought the crown for himself or that his aim was to bring England into the war against France on the Dutch side. The Convention Parliament did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the offer of joint monarchy carried with it the corollary of {{a declaration of war}}, but the subsequent actions of the deposed king finally swung Parliament behind William's war policy.|$|E
25|$|Due to poor {{visibility}} {{in the heavy}} rain, the flight crew did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> construction equipment, including two excavators, two vibrating rollers, one small bulldozer, and one air compressor, had been parked on runway 05R. In addition, the runway contained concrete Jersey barriers and pits. About 41 seconds later, the aircraft collided with the machinery and broke into 3 major pieces. The fuselage was torn in two, and the engines and landing gear separated. A crane tore the left wing from the aircraft, forcing the jet back onto the ground. The nose struck a scoop loader. A large fire followed, destroying the forward section of the fuselage and the wings. 79 of 159 passengers and 4 of 20 crew members died in the accident. Many of the dead were seated in the middle section of the aircraft; the fuel stored in the wings exploded and sent balls of flame through that section. At 23:17:36, the emergency bell sounded and 41 fire fighting vehicles, 58 ambulances, 9 lighting units, and 436 personnel were dispatched to assist survivors and extinguish the fire. Chemical extinguishing agents rained on the aircraft at about three minutes after the impact. At 23:35, roughly 10 minutes after the impact, the fire was brought under control. At 23:40, non-airport ambulances and emergency vehicles from other agencies congregated at the north gate. At 00:00 Taipei time on 1 November, the fire was mostly extinguished and the front part of the aircraft was destroyed. Authorities established a temporary command centre.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Noether was invited {{to return to the}} University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the {{philosophical}} faculty: women, they insisted, should not become privatdozent. One faculty member protested: [...] "What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?" [...] Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent.

500|$|As {{with another}} Prabhupada-inspired track {{that he wrote}} during this period, [...] "Living in the Material World", Harrison expresses his belief that the pursuit of fame and riches – {{particularly}} {{in the music industry}} – is meaningless. In the second verse of [...] "The Lord Loves the One", he sings: [...] "We all fool around, with objectives in mind / To become rich or famous, with our reputations signed..." [...] While author Joshua Greene compares Harrison's songs from this period to Vedic sutras, Allison specifies this verse-two message to a passage from the Katha Upanishad, which reads: [...] "Intoxicated, deluded by the glamour of riches, the childish do <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they must pass away.

500|$|The castle had acquitted itself well in {{the eyes}} of {{contemporary}} observers, despite its inability to prevent the raid, and the dedication of its garrison was praised. The pro-government London Gazette reported that [...] "they were so warmly entertained by Major Scot, who commanded there , {{and on the other side}} by Sir Edward Spragg, from the Battery at the Shoare, that after very much Dammage received by them in the shattering of their ships, in sinking severall of their Long Boats manned out by them, in the great number of their Men kill'd, and some Prisoners taken, they were at the last forced to retire." [...] Military historian Norman Longmate observes tartly, [...] "in presenting damning facts in the most favourable light Charles [...] ministers were unsurpassed." [...] Samuel Pepys, secretary of the Navy Board, got closer to the truth when he noted in his diary that the castle's garrison were poorly provisioned: [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Upnor Castle hath received any hurt by them though they played long against it; and they themselves shot till they had hardly a gun left upon the carriages, so badly provided they were." ...|$|E
500|$|Marge is {{generally}} a stereotypical sitcom mother, {{and she also}} plays the [...] "long-suffering wife" [...] who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in [...] "Homer Alone" [...] (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at [...] "Rancho Relaxo", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she [...] "put {{up with a lot}} in [...] marriage," [...] and has left Homer or thrown {{him out of the house}} on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an adult education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is [...] "complete and utter dependence." [...] At first, Marge does <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> as a benefit, but eventually admits that he [...] "really [...] make a gal feel needed." [...] Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.|$|E
