40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{organisational}} barriers faced by professionals working with child sexual abuse (CSA) cases in Malaysia. This study was conducted from a diverse sample of 18 social workers, medical social workers, counsellors and police officers who worked in CSA cases. These participants came from different organisations namely the royal police of Malaysia, the welfare department, hospitals and <b>non-government</b> <b>agency.</b> A qualitative approach was used for collecting and analysing data; and semi structured interview was used to guide the interview. Two main factors had been identified as barriers in working with CSA cases, namely within and between organisations. In terms of within organisations, participants identified factors such as inadequate support, excessive workload, safety issue and lack of resources as the major barriers. As for between organisations, factors such as conflict of power and disorganised system were mentioned as factors preventing capabilities of professionals in giving help. This paper provides an in depth analysis of major barriers facing by professionals working with CSA in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Background:  The Australian {{policy on}} {{homelessness}} identifies participation in structured activities {{as the first}} step towards social inclusion and increasing the likelihood of permanently leaving a homeless lifestyle. Art interventions increase interpersonal function and social participation and provide a means of expression and transformation with people who are homeless. Aim:  This study explores the value of an art programme provided by a <b>non-government</b> <b>agency</b> for homeless adults. Method:  Qualitative methods including participant observation and purposive interviews were analysed inductively and thematically to gain an understanding of the participants’ experience of art and its value. Interviews with stakeholders provided additional information and triangulation of the data. Results:  The study demonstrates that art occupations provide a starting point for participation in community and a positive experience that encourages the construction of new identities, routines and roles. Furthermore, art provides an alternative from the problems associated with homelessness, mental health and substance abuse and allows for public recognition and social inclusion. Conclusions:  Health professionals should work towards the social inclusion of homeless people through providing occupational opportunities for participation in safe settings as a first step to community engagement...|$|E

40|$|Australian rural {{communities}} are experiencing {{some of the}} worst climactic and economic conditions in decades. Unfortunately, the multiple government and <b>non-government</b> <b>agency</b> responses have reportedly been uncoordinated, sometimes losing sight of their consumers. This article describes a program designed to strengthen and empower resilience in small {{rural communities}} and summarises the outcomes, including needs and action planning undertaken. The 97 participants were from eight outer regional or remote towns and communities in the northern Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. As groups representing their communities, they attended meetings and responded to a series of questions regarding issues arising from the drought, community needs, and actions their community could take to address these issues and needs. The study findings highlight the stress and strain of the climatic conditions and the insecurity of rural incomes, as well as problems with the high cost of transport. The communities recognised a degree of social disintegration but also expressed considerable hope that, by working together and better utilising social agencies, they could develop a social connectedness that would make their communities more resilient. Approaches that empower and facilitate community resilience are suggested as an effective model that governments and non-government agencies can use to encourage social groups that are struggling to build resilience...|$|E

40|$|Protecting {{human health}} in today's global food market is an {{important}} challenge and one which must be addressed through internationally recognized food safety systems. The overall responsibility for food safety is shared by all segments of the food system, including the various industry sectors, government regulatory agencies and consumers in general. Any threat to the food supply, whether by intentional or unintentional contamination could result in danger to health, considerable cost to food chain suppliers and could also affect trade. This paper will highlight some food safety management initiatives of three countries [...] Trinidad and Tobago; the Philippines, and Bangladesh in protecting the food supply from hazards. The initiatives of some non-governmental organizations in Trinidad and Tobago are presented. In the Philippines {{both the public and}} private sector are active in encouraging strict adherence to the food legislations. A <b>non-government</b> <b>agency</b> has successfully used inventions and innovative training kits under the “ 4 -in- 1 Food Safety Training system: 5 S, GAP (Good Agricultural Practice), GMP (Good Management Practices) and HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) in the last decade to help the food industries meet the safety and quality requirements of national and international trade.

40|$|Background - Road traffic {{crashes and}} their {{outcomes}} are substantial global public health issues {{and public health}} initiatives are increasingly involving relevant community members {{in order to create}} sustainable change. This paper describes an applied research project utilizing participatory methods to establish a road trauma support service in Western Australia and reflects on the extent of participation in the community-based research partnership. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) provided the basis for the research project conducted in partnership with 34 government and <b>non-government</b> <b>agency</b> representatives and people affected personally by road trauma and which resulted in 22 recommendations for establishing the service. Findings - Attempts to position the group as co-researchers highlighted the dynamic interplay of factors that hinder and enable participation in participatory research. Barriers to participation within the research process included the limited time and funds, reluctance to share authorship, and a lack of clarity regarding roles and processes. Factors that enabled participation were the recognition of each member’s expertise, providing different forms and methods of communication, and the reimbursement of costs according to role. Discussion - In May 2012, the Government of Western Australia announced it would fund the recommendations and Road Trauma Support Western Australia was launched in November 2013. Notwithstanding this successful outcome, there were varied experiences of participation in the research process, and this was despite the use of a research methodology that is by definition participatory, with explicit and embedded participatory structures and processes. The research project shows that elements of CBPR can be incorporated into public health research, even in projects with externally-imposed time and budget constraints...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} one of a pair {{examining}} implementation in two states of programs that provide housing and support to people discharged from psychiatric hospitals. The first paper describes the implementation in Victoria of a program established in 1995 by a <b>non-government</b> <b>agency</b> called Neami. This second paper takes the Neami Community Housing Program as a point of reference against which to examine the implementation since 2005 in South Australia of a program called Returning Home. The paper begins by outlining some of the debates that have informed the delivery of mental health services in Australia, and considers ways in which mental health reform objectives articulate with changes in public and private provision of housing. It describes some of the programs developed in Australia to provide housing and support to people with psychiatric disabilities, and identifies similarities and differences in the models adopted in different states. After introducing the current study, the paper outlines findings in relation to two programs implemented in Victoria and South Australia. It concludes with a discussion of critical differences in context, program design and approach to implementation that influence the capacity of these programs to meet their objectives. Compared with the situation in Victoria a decade previously, planning for redevelopment of mental health services in South Australia has been advanced in an environment that is suspicious of deinstitutionalisation and in which public discussion of mental health policy has been politically sensitive in the extreme. In addition, attempts to find housing for people with high and complex needs were hampered by problems with supply of housing that had not existed when the National Mental Health Strategy was established...|$|E
