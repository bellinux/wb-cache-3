After the establishment of tougher <b>noise</b> <b>standards</b> in the ICAO regulations in 2002, the Tu-134 was banned from most western European airports for its high noise levels. In early 2006, 245 Tu-134s were still in operation, 162 of which were in Russia. After a fatal accident in March 2007, and at the instigation of Russian Minister of Transportation Igor Levitin, Aeroflot {{announced that it would}} be retiring its fleet, and the last Tu-134 was removed from service on 1 January 2008. Some are still in operations with Aeroflot subsidiaries on local routes within Russia. The Tu-134 also found a new life as a business jet with many having an expensive business interior installed. High fuel and maintenance costs are increasingly limiting the number used today.|$|E

30|$|For the 3 × magnification, all {{the best}} PSNR values are {{obtained}} when the dictionary size is 512. Most of the best SSIM values are also obtained when the dictionary size is 512. Therefore, we choose 512 as the dictionary size for the 3 × magnification. When the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation is 5, the best patch size is 3. When the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation is 10 and 20, the best patch size is 5. When the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation is 15, the best patch size is 7. Therefore, there are no best patch size which is suitable for every <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation. But the worst values appear when the patch size is 7. Furthermore, larger patch size will result in larger time complexity. Therefore, we choose 5 in our experiments since it is suitable for two standard deviation values.|$|R
2500|$|The Harbour Commission {{appealed to}} City Council to allow jets and a fixed link {{suggesting}} that passenger levels would {{increase from the}} current 150,000 to over 1.2 million by 2002, turning the airport into a [...] "money maker", while Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall requested that former mayor David Crombie report on ways to save the airport without harming the waterfront. The City Council's economic development committed began holding public hearings on the airport, hearing over 60 speakers. Backers of the expansion advocated it on economic reasons, {{and the idea that}} expansion was necessary to keep the airport open now that subsidies had ceased. Waterfront residents such as those living in the Harbourfront district and on the island, opposed the increases in noise and pollution an expansion would entail. The Harbourfront district residents suggested that the 1983 agreement should be upheld as they had bought residences in the area, based on that expectation. After 10 1/2 hours of speeches and debate, the committee voted 11–4 in favour of building a bridge to the airport paid for by the private sector and to adopt new <b>noise</b> <b>standards</b> that would allow new jets at the airport. A bridge would still require an environmental assessment. The full Toronto City Council voted against allowing jets, and voted against starting an environmental assessment for a bridge, and put off the island airport for further study.|$|E

The estimator derived from these theoretical results {{can be applied to}} different signal processing applications where estimation of the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation is crucial.

40|$|Abstract — Consider {{observations}} where random {{signals are}} randomly present or absent in independent and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). By using a recently estab-lished limit theorem, we {{introduce a new}} estimator for the estimation of the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation when the signals are less present than absent and have unknown probability distributions. The bias, the consistency and the minimum attainable {{mean square estimation error}} of the estimator we propose are still unknown. However, the experimental results that are presented are very promising. First, when the Minimum-Probability-of-Error decision scheme for the non-coherent detection of modulated sinusoidal carriers in independent AWGN is tuned with the outcome of our estimator instead of the true value of the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation, the Binary Error Rate tends to the optimal error probability when the number of observations is large enough. Second, given some speech signal corrupted by independent AWGN, our estimator can be used to estimate the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation so as to adjust the standard Wiener filtering of the noisy speech. The objective performance measurements obtained by so proceeding are very close to those achieved when the Wiener filtering is tuned with the true value of the <b>noise</b> <b>standard</b> deviation.
