40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the business {{challenges faced by}} journalists and traditional <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations {{in light of the}} increasing presence and rising popularity of multiple, personal and ‘amateur’ digital news channels. Our discussion focuses on the differences in value creation that are found in the contrasting ‘traditional’, ‘digital’ and self-organising models of <b>news</b> <b>reporting.</b> The aim of this discussion is to identify the ways in which <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations have previously and can continue to create value in light of the challenges brought by social media technologies. We argue that it is the popularising of digital channels including the increasing realisation and legitimation of crowdsourcing, co-creation and user generated content that directly threatens the traditional practices of <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations, and therefore the business models of these organisations. The threats posed by digital media technologies to traditional <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> is further reinforced by popular acceptance of specific social media actions including ‘tagging’, ‘re-posting’ and ‘liking’. In light of these activities we consider the shifting role that audience-contributed and non-traditional content - what we describe as ‘non-news’ and ‘anti-news’ - plays in relation to <b>news</b> <b>reporting.</b> We argue that two pivotal aspects of value creation for <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations has been, and continues to be, their ability to efficiently synthesise diverse sources of complex information and their ability to construct legitimacy and authority around the brand of the <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisation itself...|$|R

40|$|IT {{project failure}} is an {{enduring}} problem which {{has often been}} associated with bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> and escalation of commitment. The literature in bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> has focused on identifying factors (e. g., organizational climate of silence) that could influence one’s reporting decision. Similarly, the de-escalation literature has primarily investigated conditions or activities (e. g., changes in top management) which promote de-escalation. Nonetheless, what is missing in our understanding is how affect can influence bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> and de-escalation decisions within IT projects. This represents a significant gap in bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> and de-escalation research, as affect (i. e., mood and emotions) is recognized as a fundamental aspect of human life which strongly influences individual perceptions, judgment, and decision making. The aim of this dissertation to provide new insights regarding how affect can influence bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> decisions and de-escalation of commitment {{within the context of}} troubled IT projects...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with comparisons {{of the language of}} hard <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> across languages and cultures. Within English-language journalism, authorial ‘‘neutrality’’ and use of the ‘‘inverted pyramid’’ structure are frequently seen to be distinctive features of the modern hard <b>news</b> <b>report</b> and one of the grounds by which journalists assert the ‘‘objectivity’’ of their writing. This paper proposes a framework for investigating these notions linguistically and crosslinguistically, i. e. by reference to systematically observable features of the language and the text organisational structures used in the hard <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> of different journalistic traditions. The paper reports that what might be termed authorial ‘‘neutrality’’ can be found operating in the hard <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> of a range of different languages, but only when ‘‘neutrality’’ is understood to be a strategic constraining of a certain subset of attitudinal language. The paper reports that the ‘‘inverted pyramid’’ structure is also found cross-linguistically but further research is required to determine whether it is as dominant in the hard <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> of other cultures as it appears to be in English-language journalism...|$|R
