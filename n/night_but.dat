He convinced them to return to their barracks. By 08:00, the rebellion was entirely dismantled, having succeeded in holding the palace grounds for much of the <b>night</b> <b>but</b> failing to find the recordings.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, {{they faced}} Atlético Madrid, and drew 1–1 on the <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> lost 1–2 on {{aggregate}} after losing 1–0 {{in the first}} leg.

Despite the loss, Leicester remained unbeaten at home in the 2016–17 Champions League campaign.|$|E
5|$|Pest species adapt {{readily to}} a variety of environments, but prefer warm {{conditions}} found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light. An exception to this is the Asian cockroach, which flies mostly at <b>night</b> <b>but</b> is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces and pale colors.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{game was}} prototyped {{in a single}} <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> the team spent over half a year iterating through {{variations}} on the idea with visual themes such as sushi and chess. By {{the end of the}} game's 14-month development, the team returned to the game's simple principles and numbers theme.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{consumed}} up to 1000cords {{of firewood}} every {{year during the}} 180-day navigation period, a quantity so great that it led to deforestation {{of most of the}} Kõpu peninsula. A team of six was on guard every <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> storms extinguished the fire often. A rule passed in 1652 decreed that the fire must be strong and a fathom (~) high.|$|E

5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> the creative team felt they could use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives.|$|E
5|$|Fiver's visions {{have promised}} them {{a safe place}} in which to settle, and the group {{eventually}} finds Watership Down, which matches Fiver's description of the perfect home exactly. There they are soon reunited with Holly and Bluebell, who were with Bigwig in the Owsla. The two are nursing severe injuries which, they reveal, were inflicted as they escaped the violent human destruction of Sandleford and then later at Cowslip's warren. Holly also confesses that it was he who had tried to stop them leaving that first <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> Fiver's vision coming true has left him a changed rabbit and he is there to join them in whatever way they will have him.|$|E

5|$|In the semi-finals, Barcelona's opponents were Bayern Munich, {{winners of}} the 2013–14 Bundesliga. They hosted the first leg on 6 May, {{breaking}} the deadlock with two late goals from Messi in a three-minute spell, and an added-time addition by Neymar. Six days later at the Allianz Arena, Bayern took the lead through Medhi Benatia, and Neymar put Barcelona into the lead by half time. Second-half goals by Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller gave Bayern a 3–2 win on the <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> Barcelona advanced 5–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton once more {{finished}} fastest, {{but this time}} it was Sebastian Vettel in second, 0.264s behind Hamilton's time of 1m24.544s. The session started on a slightly wet track caused by rain over the <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> it soon dried up. Ricciardo's session was marred by another technical problem, this time an engine failure to his newly equipped power unit. His teammate Daniil Kvyat did not have a productive session either as he spent most of the time in the garage, setting only seventeenth best time.|$|E
5|$|Kingsbury's {{actions were}} {{a turning point}} in the battle. The Japanese had begun to gather {{momentum}} in their attack, and were threatening to overrun the 2/14th's headquarters. His attack inflicted damage to the Japanese force, temporarily halting their advance. This allowed the Australian troops to stabilise their positions, eventually regaining control and defending the battalion's headquarters. His act of bravery served as an inspiration to the troops. However, the battle ended in defeat for the Australians, with elements of the 2/14th breaking during the afternoon of 29 August. The remainder of the battalion managed to withdraw during the <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> suffered heavy casualties and another defeat during fighting the next day at positions around the Isurava Guest House.|$|E

Sri tells him that she will ask her sister and has Mahmud hide in a wardrobe. After she leaves the room, Supono and Aminah enter from other doors. Supono, unknown to him, is in a similar situation to Mahmud, and Aminah convinces him to hide beneath a table as she asks Sri.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived {{very early}} in the morning of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> were told they could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E

5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the <b>night</b> <b>but</b> repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{advanced}} {{north and}} west from Kladanj towards a cordon established by ten Croatian Home Guard battalions supported by their own artillery. The Germans believed they had thoroughly sealed off the area, and checked the Croatian cordon every <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> the majority of Partisans were able to evade the cordon and escape by breaking up into small groups and infiltrating through the cordon through seemingly impassable terrain. The Germans also believed that some Partisans merely withdrew into the mountains, concealing their numbers by walking in each other's snowprints, in order {{to return to the}} valleys when the Axis forces left. The operation concluded on 4 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Weapons Platoon, after {{becoming}} {{separated from the}} rest of the company, encountered North Koreans on the trail it was following three times in the <b>night,</b> <b>but</b> in each instance neither side fired, each going on its way.

From the body of a North Korean officer the men took a briefcase containing important documents and maps. These showed that Hill 464 was an assembly point for part of the NK 3rd Division in its advance from Hill 518 toward Taegu.|$|E
