50|$|<b>Norgesterone</b> (INN), {{also known}} as norvinodrel, vinylestrenolone, or vinylnoretynodrel, as well as 17α-vinylestr-5(10)-en-17β-ol-3-one and 17α-vinyl-δ5(10)-19-nortestosterone, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-nortestosterone group that was first described in 1965. Combined with ethinylestradiol as Vestalin, it is (or has been) used as a hormonal contraceptive. <b>Norgesterone</b> is virtually devoid of androgenic activity in animal assays.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, <b>norgesterone,</b> allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Vinyltestosterone, or 17α-vinyltestosterone, {{also known}} as 17α-vinylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, as well as 17α-hydroxypregna-4,20-dien-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that was never marketed. It is a relatively weak AAS. In one study, vinyltestosterone showed approximately one-third and one-fifth of the respective androgenic and anabolic activity of other AAS such as nandrolone, methyltestosterone, and ethyltestosterone in castrated male rats, whereas ethisterone showed almost no androgenic and anabolic activity (only 1/20th the anabolic potency of vinyltestosterone). Additionally, in women with metastatic breast cancer, vinyltestosterone {{was found to be}} ineffective in treating the disease (unlike other AAS such as testosterone propionate or fluoxymesterone) and produced little or no virilization in the women at a dosage of 100 mg intramuscularly three times per week. Aside from vinyltestosterone itself, two 19-nortestosterone derivatives of vinyltestosterone, norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-nortestosterone) and <b>norgesterone</b> (17α-vinyl-δ5(10)-19-nortestosterone), have, in contrast, been marketed. They are used as progestins for female hormonal contraception, rather than as AAS.|$|E
