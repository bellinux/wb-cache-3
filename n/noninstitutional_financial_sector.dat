30|$|Development of the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> affects {{remittances}} in two key ways. First, banks may act as intermediaries in {{the transmission}} of remittances. Thus, development of the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> should increase competition and drive down {{the cost of this}} service. A larger <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> also provides more access points from which households can retrieve remitted funds, which would potentially lower transaction costs associated with accessing remittance income. When this happens, remittances become a cheaper source of financing for investment and the purchase of household assets. Therefore, it is expected that the use of remittances for these purposes will increase as the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> develops. Second, <b>financial</b> services such as small business loans, home mortgages, or consumer lines of credit act as a substitute for many of the roles filled by remittances. As the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> develops and households begin to utilize the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> for their investing needs, it is expected {{that there will be a}} decrease in the use of remittances for these purposes.|$|R

40|$|The {{employment}} of financial development indicators without due consideration to country/regional specific financial development realities remains {{an issue of}} substantial policy relevance. Financial depth in the perspective of money supply is not equal to liquid liabilities in every development context. This paper introduces complementary indicators to the existing Financial Development and Structure Database (FDSD). Dynamic panel system GMM estimations are applied. Different specifications, non-overlapping intervals and control variables are used to check the consistency of estimated coefficients. Our results suggest that from an absolute standpoint (GDP base measures), all <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> are pro-poor. However, three interesting findings are drawn from measures of sector importance. (1) The expansion of the formal <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> {{to the detriment of}} other <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> has a disequalizing income effect. (2) Growth of informal and semi-formal <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> {{at the expense of the}} formal <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> has an income equalizing effect. (3) The positive income redistributive effect of semi-formal finance in <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> competition is higher than the corresponding impact of informal finance. It unites two streams of research by contributing at the same time to the macroeconomic literature on measuring financial development and responding to the growing field of economic development by means of informal <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> promotion and microfinance.
