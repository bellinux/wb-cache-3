25|$|In the {{enormous}} contribution to {{language and culture}} of the kingdom, two ecclesiastics stand out, Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro and Martín Sarmiento. Montenegro was the first to denounce the misery of the Galician peasants, proposing changes in the administration of the kingdom. Sarmiento, with extensive knowledge of botany and <b>natural</b> <b>medicines,</b> devoted himself to philology; he wrote the Catalogue of voices and phrases of the Galician language (1745–1755), and was a great defender of the Galician language, defending it against those who tried discredit it. Economic themes were also highlighted by other Galician aristocrats, such as Joseph Cornide Saavedra, Pedro Antonio Sánchez, and Lucas Labrada, as well as ecclesiastics like Francisco de Castro, and merchants like Antonio Raimundo Ibáñez. They were all authors of many works of vital importance in economic development, such Report on sardine fishing off the coast of Galicia (1774), and the Economic description of the Kingdom of Galicia (1804).|$|E

2500|$|Tropical rainforests exhibit {{high levels}} of biodiversity. Around 40% to 75% of all biotic species are {{indigenous}} to the rainforests.

2500|$|In the United States, kudzu {{has been}} used as {{livestock}} feed, in fertilizer, [...] and in erosion control, and the vines have been used for folk art. In Korea, kudzu root is harvested for its starch, which is used in various foods including naengmyon, as well as a health food and herbal medicine. In China, kudzu root is used in herbal remedies, teas, and the treatment of alcohol-related problems. The efficacy of the treatment of alcohol-related problems is currently under question, but experiments show promising results. In Japan, the kudzu root starch (or kuzu root starch) extracted from kudzu roots is used in cooking and <b>natural</b> <b>medicines,</b> and it is used to make hay that sick animals will eat. The starch is used in Japanese cuisine, and is widely consumed as such in that country. Kudzu is also used as a food crop in Java, Sumatra, and Malaya, and can be found in Puerto Rico and South America.|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether the}} <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> and {{biomedicine}} professions could cooperate {{for the benefit}} of patients within an integrated medical model. The investigation contains a substantive narrative and historical overview of the evolution of medicine. This provides a background to the investigation and an explanation of how the different medical paradigms evolved. As the <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> industries in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom evolved through private sector activity, they have only relatively recently attracted the interest of academia. For this reason the number of completed <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> doctoral theses is not considerable, and none appear to have been in the area of this thesis. Further, although there are numerous texts relating to the history of medicine, none adequately detail the evolution of the history and philosophy of <b>natural</b> <b>medicine.</b> Therefore, in order to comprehend the history and philosophy of biomedicine and <b>natural</b> <b>medicine,</b> and other related topics, the thesis critically evaluates a diverse range of secondary source material using philosophical-historiographical inquiry. Analysis of the research literature clarifies — particularly from the perspective of <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> — the evolution of medicine from prehistory to the Middle Ages when <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> practice was separated from Church and State approved medieval physick. Also, as medieval physick evolved into biomedicine, it further separated from <b>natural</b> <b>medicine.</b> It developed new paradigms, identified and treated new diseases, and made significant gains in clinical science, surgery, technology, drugs and other products. However, its safety and efficacy is coming under increasing academic scrutiny. Research also shows how <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> usage increased in the 20 th century, particularly from the 1960 s, and is currently used by 80 per cent of the world population. For the <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> paradigm to be as equally regarded as the biomedicine paradigm in a new integrated medical model, it needs to retain, amongst other things, its differences — particularly the <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> concepts of holism, vitalism, the mind-body connection, spirit, detoxification, digestion and immunity — which are clarified in the thesis. The thesis also investigates various models of integrated medicine and determines that the Australian Voluntary Integrated Model allows biomedicine and <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> practitioners and their clients to cooperate within a model underpinned by mutual recognition and respect. The strengths and limitations of this thesis arise from its originality. Because it traverses new academic territory it will be a useful base for future research. Also, the sections relating to the evolution of the history and philosophy of <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> are immediately available for use in <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> and other educational programmes. The thesis concludes by discussing future research opportunities, which appear to be open to several academic disciplines...|$|R

Traditional medicine refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled with an understanding of the language and culture of local villages. Modern medicine refers to the use of drugs that are regulated and produced to a high standard.
