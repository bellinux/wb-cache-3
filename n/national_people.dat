500|$|Information on {{the dead}} can be found mainly in the {{administrative}} and military archives of West and East Germany. However, the records of Stasi, which were administered by the Stasi federal commissioner, are not completely accessible. Some parts, especially from the later years, were destroyed when the ministry was disbanded, some are not yet sifted. Additionally, due to the Stasi records law, many records can only be looked at {{in the form of}} anonymized excerpts. An amendment from 2007 allows direct access to research projects, provided certain conditions are met. The East German Border Troop records are kept at the Bundeswehr archive, as the border troops were part of the East German <b>National</b> <b>People</b> Army. According to Hertle, when border troop, Stasi and the records from Western authorities are evaluated, one has {{to take into account the}} [...] "values, interests and constraints of the record-keeping authorities and, by extension, of the respective power relations." [...] The families of the victims can be another source, but were often fed with false information and therefore can only seldom answer questions regarding the events themselves.|$|E
