5|$|The {{idea for}} Noodles & Company was {{conceived}} by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian <b>Noodle</b> Shop in Greenwich Village, New York. He felt {{there were not}} enough restaurants that served <b>noodle</b> dishes, which are a staple for many international foods. Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.|$|E

50|$|Shahe fen <b>noodles</b> {{are very}} similar to Vietnamese bánh phở <b>noodles,</b> which are likely derived from their Chinese counterpart. Although the phở <b>noodles</b> used in soups may vary in width, wide phở <b>noodles</b> are also common in stir fried dishes. The popular Thai dishes phat si-io and drunken <b>noodles</b> are also made with similar <b>noodles.</b>|$|R
25|$|Japanese <b>noodles</b> often {{substitute}} for a rice-based meal. Soba (thin, grayish-brown <b>noodles</b> containing buckwheat flour) and udon (thick wheat <b>noodles)</b> are the main traditional <b>noodles,</b> while ramen is a modern import and now very popular. There are also other, less common <b>noodles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hiyamugi are {{wheat flour}} <b>noodles</b> similar to sōmen and udon <b>noodles</b> and {{somewhere in between}} the two in size. These <b>noodles</b> are often served {{in the same manner}} as sōmen and udon <b>noodles.</b> While they are mostly white, there are bundles mixed with <b>noodles</b> of pinkish or brown hues.|$|R

50|$|The {{recipe for}} hot dry <b>noodles</b> is {{different}} from cold <b>noodles</b> and <b>noodles</b> in soup. Firstly mix the cooked <b>noodles</b> with oil and dry them. When {{they are about to}} be eaten, scald the prepared <b>noodles</b> in boiled water, mix them with condiments, and the <b>noodles</b> will be ready to eat. The finished hot dry <b>noodles</b> are firm and chewy, golden and oily, savory and fresh. It is made of <b>noodles</b> called jianmian (碱面) with a mixture of sauces and dried vegetables. Many stalls that make reganmian will have their own variations in seasoning, creating signature tastes for individual stands or localities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} of both chilled and frozen <b>noodles</b> starts with boiled <b>noodles</b> cooked to an optimum state of doneness, generally considered {{as having a}} moisture gradient at {{the surface of the}} <b>noodles</b> of 80% moisture absorption, and {{at the core of the}} <b>noodles</b> of 50% moisture absorption. After boiling, chilled <b>noodles</b> are placed into packaging followed by refrigeration at between 4 - 10 C. Frozen <b>noodles,</b> by contrast, are flash frozen using either air blast technology, a contact freezer or a combination of both, usually at [...] for 30 minutes. Both processes induce a swelling of the starch that reduces deterioration and thus extends the noodles' shelf-life. In production, the boiling time for frozen <b>noodles</b> can be determined from a calculation that subtracts the cooking time of frozen boiled <b>noodles</b> from the total boiling time of fresh <b>noodles.</b> Mass-produced frozen <b>noodles</b> are sometimes packaged first, and then flash frozen. Flash freezing <b>noodles</b> can retain their quality of freshness for up to one year when kept properly frozen.|$|R
50|$|Frozen <b>noodles</b> and chilled <b>noodles</b> are {{types of}} {{instantly}} prepared Asian (or European) <b>noodles</b> that are sold frozen or chilled. These products differ from prepackaged dehydrated <b>noodles</b> {{in a number}} of ways: in flavor, in texture, and in that they normally come packaged with ingredients besides the <b>noodles,</b> such as vegetables, meat, and soup stock.|$|R

At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis. By connecting the incidents to evidence recovered {{with the help of}} Detective Ema Skye, Apollo discredits the case against Wocky by proving that his fiancée, Alita Tiala, {{was the only one who}} could have committed the crime.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a handful}} of Chinese {{settlers}} had arrived in Madagascar {{towards the end of}} the reign of Queen Ranavalona III, the first major influx of Chinese migrants followed an announcement by General Joseph Gallieni, first governor general of the colony of Madagascar, requesting 3,000Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and Toamasina. Chinese migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities, including riz cantonais (Chinese fried rice), soupe chinoise (Chinese-style <b>noodle</b> soup), misao (fried noodles), pao (hum bao) and nems (fried egg rolls).|$|E
5000|$|Sōmen (...) {{are very}} thin white Japanese <b>noodles</b> made of wheat flour, less than 1.3 mm in {{diameter}}. The <b>noodles</b> are usually served cold. The noodles' diameter {{is the chief}} distinction between sōmen and the thicker wheat <b>noodles</b> hiyamugi and Japanese wheat <b>noodles</b> udon. Sōmen <b>noodles</b> are stretched when made, as are some types of udon <b>noodles.</b> The dough is stretched {{with the help of}} vegetable oil to make very thin strips and then air dried.|$|R
40|$|Colour of <b>noodles</b> is {{definitely}} {{a key element of}} a consumer's buying decisions. It can be influenced by many factors. Conditions, under which is winter wheat grown, can be considered as one of these factors. The aim of this work was to evaluate colour of <b>noodles</b> that were prepared from winter wheat grown in ecological and integrated arable farming systems, after different forecrops with two levels of fertilization (fertilized and unfertilized) during the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Winter wheat <b>noodles</b> were prepared from white flour and wholegrain flour and its colour was evaluated using the spectro-colorimeter. Colour was measured by three coordinates: lightness L*, red/ green value a* and yellow/ blue value b*. Wholegrain <b>noodles</b> had lower L* value, so they were darker than white flour <b>noodles,</b> with higher redness and higher yellowness. Colour of white flour <b>noodles</b> and wholegrain <b>noodles</b> was significantly influenced by crop nutrition (fertilized and unfertilized variants), farming system and meteorological conditions during experimental years. Wholegrain <b>noodles</b> from ecological system were darker, with lower lightness and higher redness compared to <b>noodles</b> from integrated system. White flour <b>noodles</b> from ecological system were also darker compared to <b>noodles</b> from integrated system. Fertilization decreased lightness of white flour <b>noodles,</b> on the contrary, fertilization increased the lightness and decreased the redness of wholegrain <b>noodles.</b> In non-fertilized treatment, ecological wheat <b>noodles</b> were darker, with higher redness and yellowness than <b>noodles</b> prepared from winter wheat grown in integrated arable farming system. </p...|$|R
50|$|According to The Financial Times, Ando's {{invention}} of Cup <b>Noodles</b> in 1971, {{at the age}} of 61, helped spark the popularity of instant <b>noodles</b> overseas. He had observed that Americans ate <b>noodles</b> by breaking the <b>noodles</b> in half, putting them into a cup, and pouring hot water over the <b>noodles.</b> They also ate them with a fork instead of chopsticks. Ando was inspired, and felt that a Styrofoam cup—with a narrower bottom than the top—would be the ideal vessel for holding <b>noodles</b> and keeping them warm. Eating the <b>noodles</b> would then be as easy as opening the lid, adding hot water and waiting. This simplicity, efficiency and low price of Cup <b>Noodles</b> went on to transform Nissin's fortunes.|$|R
5|$|Sungei Road (Chinese: 双溪路; {{literally}} River Road) is a road in Singapore situated between Serangoon Road and Jalan Besar {{and runs}} along the Rochor Canal. The area around Sungei Road was formerly the homes of affluent Europeans and Asians, where many ornately designed buildings were built in its place. From the 1930s to the present, the road has been synonymous with the Thieves' Market, the largest and oldest flea market in Singapore, where the locals can hunt for old bric-a-brac or second-hand goods, as a cheap replacement for one's faulty or lost item.

5|$|As {{late as the}} mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was {{strictly}} off-limits to outsiders. Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with its narrow winding streets lined with inns, <b>noodle</b> shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri {{has become one of}} Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today. The former soldiers had settled down, some of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local Thais. The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains Yunnanese. Among their local-born descendants, some have adopted a Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry.

5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while <b>noodle</b> shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
