This new safety criterion is the maximum dose (maximum number of ions stopped in the Spiral 1 Target). To control this, an AQ system has been put in operation and more specifically a new device has been set up in order to measure the ion beam intensity and to calculate the number of particules per second. This value can then be integrated over time. This device mainly consists of two redundant instrumentations, which are acquired via a real time industrial controller. The accuracy of measurement is estimated taking into account the variation of beam, of the environment and of the installation.

The reduction of occurrence and significance of events in NPPs and their safe operation is its ultimate goal.

Starting from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, we (1) trace the expansion of citizen science in the nuclear field to other countries and contexts; (2) ask how citizen-science concepts, methods, and toolsets challenge institutional approaches to preparedness and response to nuclear incidents/accidents and post-disaster situations; and how <b>nuclear</b> <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> respond to such challenges; (3) probe the possibilities of incorporating citizen-science concepts and practices into Belgian and European approaches to nuclear emergency response, preparedness, and recovery. Our research draws on qualitative methods in Interpretive Policy Analysis and Science and Technology Studies to highlight the contentious politics that characterize interactions between citizen scientists and nuclear authorities in Japan and other countries. It anticipates the emergence of hybrid citizen-science forms, comprising material artifacts (e. g. new radioactivity measurement devices) and discourses (e. g. {{on the role of}} science in society), which simultaneously challenge and accommodate institutional approaches to nuclear emergency preparedness and response.

This paper summarizes the major findings obtained in the activity. The state of knowledge on hydrogen generation, distribution, combustion and mitigation is presented. The corresponding computer codes that are used by the member countries for hydrogen safety analysis are discussed, including code capabilities and validation status assessed against the hydrogen behavior associated with generation, distribution, combustion and mitigation. The hydrogen management strategies are presented based on the literature findings. The status of hydrogen management systems implemented by the member countries are discussed, including national requirements, mitigation measures and their implementation status, and considerations on the interaction of engineering safety systems with hydrogen behavior during severe accidents.
