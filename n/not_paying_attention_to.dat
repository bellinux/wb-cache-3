5|$|Producers in the Indies {{would often}} handle {{multiple}} roles, such as director and cinematographer. When these positions were filled separately, the producer retained creative control. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that works produced {{during this time}} were emphatically commercial, <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> nationalistic or aesthetic values. However, the film scholars Thomas Barker and Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn suggest that the Chinese-produced films from the Indies offered {{the possibility of a}} heterogeneous national identity.|$|E

5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E

The C experienced several head-on wrecks due to this. One in 1932 near Hamilton, and another in 1934 near Springfield, Ohio. There were fatalities.

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 10 February 1964, the two ships were {{performing}} manoeuvres off Jervis Bay. Melbournes aircraft were performing flying exercises, and Voyager was tasked as plane guard, positioned behind and to port (left) of the carrier in order to rescue the crew of any ditching or crashing aircraft. After a series of turns effected to reverse the courses of the two ships, Voyager ended up ahead and to starboard (right) of the carrier. The destroyer was ordered to resume plane guard position, which would involve turning to starboard, away from the carrier, then looping around behind. Instead, Voyager began a starboard turn, but then came around to port. The bridge crew on Melbourne assumed that Voyager was zig-zagging to let the carrier overtake her, and would then assume her correct position. Senior personnel on Voyager were <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the manoeuvre. At 20:55, officers on both ships began desperate avoiding manoeuvres, but by then a collision was inevitable.|$|E

Revealing herself as the killer, Mrs. Voorhees turns violent and rushes toward Alice with a bowie knife. A chase ensues, in which Mrs. Voorhees attempts to kill Alice.

Just as she begins to relax, Mrs. Voorhees finds her and attempts to kill her again. During the final struggle, Alice decapitates her with a machete. Afterward, a traumatized Alice boards and falls asleep inside a canoe, which floats out on Crystal Lake.|$|E
25|$|Ma Zhou {{was born}} in 601, {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wen in the Sui dynasty. He {{appeared}} to have been born from a relatively poor household in Qinghe Commandery (清河, roughly modern Xingtai, Hebei) and lost his father early in life. He was studious, particularly concentrating on the Shi Jing and the Spring and Autumn Annals, but was also carefree, <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> details, and because of this, the people of his home region did not view him highly. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu in the Tang dynasty, he served as a teacher in Bo Prefecture (博州, i.e., Qinghe), but was said to spend his days drinking, not concentrating on teaching the students, and was often rebuked by the prefect Daxi Shu (達奚恕). He thus resigned and went to travel in Cao Prefecture (曹州, roughly modern Heze, Shandong) and Bian Prefecture (汴州, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). While there, however, on one occasion he was insulted by Cui Xian (崔賢), the county magistrate for Junyi County (浚儀, in modern Kaifeng), and in anger, he travelled to the capital Chang'an. Once there, he became a guest of the general Chang He.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} home game at Soldier Field, the Bears emerged victorious {{defeating}} the Pittsburgh Steelers (17–15). The victory was short-lived as the Bears finished 6–8 {{leading to the}} termination of head coach Jim Dooley. New Coach Abe Gibron did not start his tenure any better with the Bears. The team was last place in the NFC Central division {{with a record of}} 4–9–1. The era under Gibron took a deeper dive during the 1973 season as the team finished in last place again with a record of 3–11 as the Bears were limited to just 195 total points during the entire season. Dick Butkus, who had terrorized enemy offensive players for the last eight years, retired early in the season after being hobbled by knee injuries. The 1974 season proved to be Gibron's final one with the Bears as the team finished yet again in last place, this time with a record of 4–10. The Gibron era was marked with a combined record of 11–30–1 and with the only memory was not a play or moment, but Gibron's appearance in an NFL Films production where he was taped singing Joy to the World <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the game in front of him.|$|E

25|$|The end of 1912 saw {{the end of}} a year of {{political}} struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer trying to convince the King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the Royal Assent on it, something that horrified Law's constitutional law adviser A.V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable– they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write a memo to Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule be put to the electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.|$|E

500|$|In July 1957, Monk {{began to}} perform at the venue for six months with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time Monk's {{employment}} there ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left {{in pursuit of a}} solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. After returning to New York City's club scene with a new quartet, Monk received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the Five Spot Café beginning on June 12, 1958. He played most nights during the weekend to capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer Roy Haynes, and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's comping during their first few weeks: [...] "Any deviation, one note off, and you sound like you're playing another tune, and you're <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what's going on. And it's so evident ... there's no space." [...] During their performances, Monk often left the stage for a drink at the bar or danced around, which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.|$|E
