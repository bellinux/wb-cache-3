40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{historic}} town of Abano Terme located 10 kilometres south-west of Padua {{at the foot of}} the Euganean Hills. Once a small rural hamlet of poor houses arranged around the church, Abano Terme has grown significantly since World War 2 because of the <b>natural</b> thermal <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> that flow from springs and has become the first place in Italy for thermal tourism. The historic parts of Abano then begun to decline while many high-rise hotels have been built near the thermal spring generating a new spa town for tourists. This article reports the teaching experience on the Architectural and Urban Composition 2 course at the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering at the University of Padua. The theme of the spatial aspects of public spaces in neglected historic Abano was specifically investigated by students looking to redesign the lost unity of the early settlement by progressing from a study of how Abano has evolved through time. The method adopted to enhance the historic town is based on research of the local physical specificity while always retaining the urban morphology in memory of the community and in its image. Awareness of the spatial structure that linked the church, the town hall, and a few other old buildings together, derived from the study of the history of the place, facilitates the coherent design of new public spaces and new building types. Planning new buildings starts from understanding the urban environment, that is, its overall physical structure, and this is especially so in the historic city centre...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of different skin conditions with <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> {{is a long}} tradition dating back to at least late Hellenism. Interestingly, independent scientific examinations studying the effect of <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> are scarce. Objective: In the present in vitro study, we compared the effect of culture media supplemented with (a) thermal <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> (La Roche-Posay, Avène) and (b) two natural mineral drinking waters (Heppinger, Adelholzener) on physiological parameters in HaCaT keratinocytes. Methods: The different medium preparations were investigated with regard to cell proliferation and cell damage. Moreover, the impact on inflammation parameters with and without ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation was examined. Results: Two popular thermal spring waters were found to suppress cell proliferation and cell damage. Moreover, these waters reversed the induction of interleukin- 6, as measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and promoter transactivation, {{and the formation of}} reactive oxygen species after UVB stimulation. Of note, the two natural mineral waters, which are distributed as drinking waters, had some effect on the above-mentioned parameters but to a lesser extent. Conclusion: In summary, our results show that <b>spa</b> <b>waters,</b> and particularly those derived from thermal springs, reduce parameters associated with inflammation. It seems likely that trace elements such as selenium and zinc are critical for the observed effects...|$|R
