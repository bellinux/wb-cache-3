Mitchell had to collect them. [...] Britain had declared the Bay of Biscay to be an “exclusion zone”; their objective was to prevent supplies from reaching Germany, in particular Japanese exports. [...] However Britain needed foreign currency, which she could obtain by exporting coal to Portugal. [...] ‘Navicerts’ were introduced. [...] Ships with a <b>navicert</b> were permitted safe passage through allied lines. [...] They were to follow the line of longitude at 12° west. [...] Allied convoys to Gibraltar were at least 20° west [...] to avoid the range of German bombers. [...] However, {{it was difficult for}} sailing ships to adhere to this straight line, particularly in the stormy conditions, common in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Navicert</b> {{system was}} greatly extended, {{introducing}} compulsory Navicerts and ships' warrants {{in an attempt}} to prevent contraband being loaded in the first place. Any consignment going to or from ports without a certificate of non-enemy origin and any ship without a ships <b>Navicert</b> became liable to seizure ...|$|E
50|$|Cartaz (plural cartazes, in Portuguese) was a naval trade license or pass {{issued by}} the Portuguese in the Indian ocean during the sixteenth century (circa 1502-1750), {{under the rule of}} the Portuguese empire. It shared {{similarities}} with the British <b>navicert</b> system of 1939-45. Its name derives from the portugueses cartas mesinha letter.|$|E
50|$|In {{preparation}} for D-day, Britain withdrew <b>navicerts</b> in April 1944. At {{this time there}} was a severe shortage of fuel in Ireland. Gas rationing was introduced and there was severe curtailment of rail services. The Minister for Supplies instructed the Arklow schooners to cease other imports and only to import coal. The schooners averted a possible great hardship that winter. By the autumn they had imported 40,000 tons of coal, while bringing food supplies to Britain.|$|R

5000|$|From {{the start}} there was close {{co-operation}} between the parallel American and British agencies, over economic warfare measures, intelligence gathering and the later Safehaven Program. The American Embassy in London acted {{as the base}} for the American BEW activities in Europe and was organized in March 1942, [...] "to establish a more intimate liaison between the manifold economic warfare activities centered in the Ministry of Economic Warfare and comparable activities in the United States Government." [...] BEW personnel sat on the Blockade Committee on equal terms with their British counterparts, undertaking the routine work of handling <b>Navicerts,</b> ships permits and defining contraband. The embassy division worked with MEW {{in the development of}} new war trade agreements and the re- negotiation of existing overseas purchase - supply contracts. Together they attempted to persuade the remaining neutrals - Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Switzerland (and Argentina) - that by supplying Germany with the materials it needed they were prolonging the war, and over time a number of measures were tried to pressure these countries into reducing or ending trade with the Axis, with varying degrees of success: ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{months into}} the war, the Ministry reintroduced the 'Navicert' (Navigational Certificate), first used to great effect during World War I. This system was in essence a {{commercial}} passport applied to goods before they were shipped, and was used on a wide scale. Possession of a <b>Navicert</b> proved that a consignment had already been passed as non-contraband by His Majesty's Ambassador {{in the country of}} origin and allowed the captain to pass Contraband Control patrols and ports without being stopped, sparing the navy and the Ministry the trouble of tracking the shipment. Violators, however, could expect harsh treatment. They could be threatened with Bunker Control measures, refused further certification or have their cargo or their vessel impounded. Conversely, neutrals who {{went out of their way}} to co-operate with the measures could expect 'favoured nation' status, and have their ships given priority for approval. Italy, though an ally of Hitler, had not yet joined the war, and its captains enjoyed much faster turnarounds by following the <b>Navicert</b> system than the Americans, who largely refused to accept its legitimacy.|$|E
50|$|Because of her {{geographic}} position and trade with Germany, Switzerland {{was subject to}} Allied blockade measures throughout, although she remained able to move imports and other exports such as sugar and benzene overland, mainly to Germany and {{other countries in the}} neutral zone. In December 1941 an attempt by the Swiss military to purchase American machine-gun cameras was blocked by Britain's refusal to grant a <b>Navicert,</b> and in April 1942 the US Board of Economic Warfare considered quotas for Swiss imports from overseas sources, identifying Swiss commodities which might be bargained for. Firms such as the Fischer Steel and Iron Works at Schaffhausen were added to the blacklists because of their exports, causing them to eventually curtail supply and remodel their plant.|$|E
50|$|Clipped {{forms are}} also used in compounds. One part of the {{original}} compound most often remains intact. Examples are: cablegram (cable telegram), op art (optical art), org-man (organization man), linocut (linoleum cut). Sometimes both halves of a compound are clipped as in <b>navicert</b> (navigation certificate). In these cases {{it is difficult to know}} whether the resultant formation should be treated as a clipping or as a blend, for the border between the two types is not always clear. According to Bauer (1983), the easiest way to draw the distinction is to say that those forms which retain compound stress are clipped compounds, whereas those that take simple word stress are not. By this criterion bodbiz, Chicom, Comsymp, Intelsat, midcult, pro-am, photo op, sci-fi, and sitcom are all compounds made of clippings.|$|E
