500|$|Cruise's {{representative}} {{responded to}} the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise's involvement were [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "he never said that". According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that [...] "Tom {{had nothing to do}} with this matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'" [...] A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue, specifically responding to allegations of Cruise's reputed corporate power play.|$|E
500|$|Mark Ruffalo {{began his}} role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said {{he chose not to}} bring back Norton. In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> to attempt that until Avengers 2. So there's a lot of time to think about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} 2011 about the {{argument}} that the fight for same-sex marriage is the modern-day equivalent of the civil rights struggle, Barron answered, [...] "I don't consider it the civil-rights issue of our time. Comparing it to our struggle when we were stolen from Africa, enslaved, murdered, raped, hung, lynched. I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> to give it the same breath as our movement in this country." ...|$|E

Before the election, most people (including many New Zealand First voters) had expected Peters {{to enter into}} coalition with Labour.

2500|$|The [...] "joke" [...] {{was evidently}} {{already in the}} {{mainstream}} by the very early 1970s; in the October 1972 edition of MAD magazine (issue no. 154), an article entitled [...] "When Watching Television, You Can be Sure of Seeing...", gossip columnist 'Rona Boring' states: [...] "And there isn't a grain of truth to the vicious rumor that movie and TV star Rock Heman and singer Jim Nelly were secretly married! Rock and Jim are just good buddies! I repeat, they are not married! They are <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> steady!" [...] Those who failed to get the joke spread the rumor and as a result, Hudson and Nabors never spoke to each other again. Three years later, Nabors would begin a long-term (and, until 2013, secret) relationship with Stan Cadwallader, a retired firefighter from Honolulu and the man he would eventually marry once same-sex marriage was legalized.|$|E

60|$|The {{three weeks}} that {{followed}} were awful. Dick never came near Owlwood. Jill and I fought every day, we were so cross and disappointed. Nothing had come out right, and Jill blamed it all on me. She said I must have made it too strong. There was no fun in anything, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> in <b>going</b> to church. Dick hardly thumped the pulpit at all {{and when he did}} it was only a measly little thump. But Aunt Tommy didn't seem to worry any. She sang and laughed and joked from morning to night.|$|R
60|$|He laughs {{a fierce}} laugh as he recalls his adventures {{since he has}} been in Europe. Money, friends, pleasure, all have passed away, and he feels the past like a dream.

60|$|When Mrs. Cliff had {{declared}} to Mr. Williams that that horse would never suit her, {{that she would}} not be willing to drive it, and would <b>not</b> <b>even</b> think of <b>going</b> into a house and leaving Willy Croup to hold him, he was very much surprised, and said that he had not a gentler horse in his stable, and he did not believe there was one in the town.|$|R
60|$|He replied not yet awhile, as he {{must make}} plans, {{and that in}} the {{meantime}} I must walk upon the shore so that my legs might grow strong again. So there every day I walked in the cool of the morning and in the <b>evening,</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{out of sight of the}} wreck. I went armed and carrying my big bow, but saw no one, since the natives had been warned that I should walk and must not be looked upon while I did so. Therefore, even when I passed through one of their villages of huts built of mud and thatched with leaves, it seemed to be deserted.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, Sir Ethelred,” {{said the}} Assistant Commissioner, {{pressing}} deferentially the extended hand. “A genuine {{wife and a}} genuinely, respectably, marital relation. He told me that after his interview at the Embassy he would have thrown everything up, {{would have tried to}} sell his shop, and leave the country, only he felt certain that his wife would <b>not</b> <b>even</b> hear of <b>going</b> abroad. Nothing could be more characteristic of the respectable bond than that,” went on, with a touch of grimness, the Assistant Commissioner, whose own wife too had refused to hear of going abroad. “Yes, a genuine wife. And the victim was a genuine brother-in-law. From a certain point of view we are here {{in the presence of a}} domestic drama.” ...|$|R

All my old chums are gone, or hopelessly married and changed, and the young set who have come up know not Joseph, and make me feel uncomfortably middle-aged. It's far worse to feel middle-aged than old, you know. Away there in the woods I feel as eternally young as Nature herself. And oh, it's so nice not having to fuss with thermometers and temperatures and other people's whims. Let me indulge my own whims, Louisa dear, and punish me with a cold bite when I come in late for meals. I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> to church again. It was horrible there yesterday. The church is so offensively spick-and-span brand new and modern." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening," [...] said he {{when the}} three {{appeared}} under escort. [...] "I want your undivided attention for a few minutes. You've known me for five years, and I've known you for--twenty-five. I think we understand one another perfectly. I am now going to pay you a tremendous compliment (the brown one, please, Sergeant. Thanks. You needn't wait). I'm going to execute you without rhyme, Beetle, or reason. I know you went to Colonel Dabney's covers because you were invited. I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> to send the Sergeant with a note to ask if your statement is true; because I am convinced that on this occasion you have adhered strictly to the truth. I know, too, {{that you were not}} drinking. (You can take off that virtuous expression, McTurk, or I shall begin to fear you don't understand me.) There is not a flaw in any of your characters. And that is why I am going to perpetrate a howling injustice. Your reputations have been injured, haven't they? You have been disgraced before the house, haven't you? You have a peculiarly keen regard for the honor of your house, haven't you? Well, now I am going to lick you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nutty,' she said, 'I've {{struggled}} for years against {{the conviction that}} you were a perfect idiot. I've forced myself, against my better judgement, to try to look on you as sane, but now I give in. I can't believe you are responsible for your actions. Don't imagine that I am going to heap you with reproaches because you sneaked off to New York. I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> to tell you what I thought of you for not sending me a telegram, letting me know where you were. I can understand all that. You were disappointed because Uncle Ira had not left you his money, and I suppose that was your way of working it off. If you had just run away and come back again with a headache, I'd have treated you like the Prodigal Son. But there are some things which are too much, and bringing a perfect stranger back with you for an indefinite period is one of them. I'm not saying anything against Mr Chalmers personally. I haven't had time to find out much about him, except that he's an Englishman; but he looks respectable. Which, as he's a friend of yours, is more or less of a miracle.' ...|$|E

40|$|Adolf Hoffmeister is animportant {{figure of}} Czech {{literature}} and {{art of the}} 20 th century. He was an organizer of cultural life, ambassador, member of numerous organisations. He devoted his entire life to travel ling - even after the World War II, which was made possible only {{because he was a}} privileged member of government. In this period he became known as an author of books of travel about exotic count ries, to which a regular Czechoslovak citizen could <b>not</b> <b>even</b> dream of <b>going</b> because of several border restrictions. This paper deals in detail with and compares two books depicting his travels to the Far East : Post cards from China and Made in Japan. The content is two fold: on the one hand, it depicts parts which have strong communist ideological background and depicts the way how they work, {{but on the other hand}} it also brings attention to different parts which spring from Hoffmeister's broad interest in art and literature and thus became more accept able for a contemporary reader...|$|R

I just feel tired of everything sensible and I'm going to let my imagination run riot for the summer. Oh, you needn't be alarmed, Marilla. I'll only let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it's the last summer I'll be a little girl. Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I've done this I'll have to put on longer skirts. She says I'm all running to legs and eyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified. It won't even do to believe in fairies then, I'm afraid; so I'm going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer. I think we're {{going to have a very}} gay vacation. Ruby Gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and there's the Sunday school picnic and the missionary concert next month. And Mr. Barry says that some evening he'll take Diana and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have dinner there. They have dinner there in the evening, you know. Jane Andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses. Jane says it was her first glimpse into high life and she'll never forget it to her dying day." ...|$|E

But it was very charming to linger in the civilization of that hotel; to wander through its garden paths in the afternoon after a forenoon's writing and inhale the keen aromatic odors of the eucalyptus, and when the day waned to have tea at an iron table on the seaward terrace. Or if we went to Gibraltar, {{it was interesting to}} wonder why we had gone, and to be so glad of getting back, and after dinner joining a pleasant international group in the long reading-room with the hearth-fires at either end which, if you got near them, were so comforting against the evening chill. Sometimes the pleasure of the time was heightened by the rain pattering on the glass roof of the patio, where in the afternoon a bulky Spanish mother sat mute beside her basket of laces which you could buy if you would, but need not if you would rather not; in either case she smiled placidly.|$|R
