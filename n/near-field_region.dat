40|$|Abrupt, high-magnitude sea-level changes pose a major {{challenge}} to society and have, in the past, been significant drivers of coastal change. Traditionally, sea-level reconstructions from <b>near-field</b> <b>regions</b> - those close to or strongly influenced by current or former ice masses - depict long-term, millennial-scale sea-level changes associated with low-amplitude ice-sheet histories. Types of abrupt sea-level change, including meltwater pulses, tsunamis and storms, are not well studied in <b>near-field</b> <b>regions,</b> but such areas have potential to provide a suitable context for recording and identifying evidence of abrupt sea-level change. For example, unusually high sedimentation rates due {{to the presence of}} glaciers might promote the development of high-resolution records, while a dominant glacio-isostatic adjustment signal might facilitate improved registration and identification of globally significant episodes of abrupt sea-level rise. This thesis explores the efficacy of <b>near-field</b> <b>regions</b> in reconstructing abrupt sea-level change by using a combination of stratigraphic and dating methods at field sites in Scotland and Greenland. From southwest Scotland, a sub-centennially resolved, diatom-based sea-level reconstruction for the early Holocene constrains the timing and magnitude of three meltwater-induced sea-level accelerations in the c. 500 yrs prior to the 8. 2 kyr BP event. Despite an inability of the 14 C dating technique to confirm synchroneity of events, the three sea-level jumps overlap in age with other examples of abrupt change recorded in North Atlantic non-coastal and coastal archives, lending support to a three-event model of meltwater release from the Laurentide Ice Sheet as the driving mechanism responsible for the 8. 2 kyr BP event. In Greenland, nearshore and freshwater stratigraphic records contain evidence of landslide- and iceberg-induced tsunami events in the mid and late Holocene. Field sites in Vaigat (Disko Bugt, West Greenland) preserve evidence of five tsunami events in the past 1500 - 2000 years, which is comparable to tsunami recurrence intervals described from sites on large subduction zone margins. A coastal lake at Innaarsuit also provides the first reported sedimentary evidence of an iceberg-generated tsunami in the mid Holocene. The thesis concludes by reflecting on the opportunities and challenges in reconstructing abrupt sea-level change from near-field settings...|$|R

A semi-empirical theory shows the discharge stability is only {{dependent on the}} dynamic interaction of three <b>near-field</b> <b>regions</b> - the buoyant jet region, surface impingement region, and radial internal hydraulic jump region. A coupling of the solutions of the three regions yields a prediction of the near-field stability {{as well as the}} bulk mixing characteristics of the buoyant discharge.

5000|$|For example, metal {{objects such}} as steel beams can act as antennas by inductively {{receiving}} and then [...] "re-radiating" [...] some of the energy in the radiative near field, forming a new radiating surface to consider.

In this paper, a new efficient method based on a support vector regression is proposed for the detection of arriving electromagnetic waves scattered by objects located both in the far-field and <b>near-field</b> <b>regions</b> of the smart antenna.

A two-stream mixing layer with a velocity ratio of 0. 6 was generated with the initial boundary layers laminar and nominally two-dimensional. The initial conditions were changed slightly by interchanging the high- and low-speed sides of the wind tunnel, while maintaining the same velocity ratio. The results indicate that, even with this minor change in initial conditions, the <b>near-field</b> <b>regions</b> of the two cases differ significantly, with the peak Reynolds stress levels varying by up to 100 percent. In addition, {{the distribution of the}} individual streamwise vortical structures differs in intensity and position for the two cases, although the overall qualitative description is comparable...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "near field" [...] is {{a region}} {{in which there}} are strong {{inductive}} and capacitive effects from the currents and charges in the antenna that cause electromagnetic components that do not behave like far-field radiation.

Non-propagating (or evanescent) fields extinguish very rapidly with distance, which makes their effects almost exclusively felt in the <b>near-field</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

Also, we discuss the degenerate case in which only one rational dark or antidark soliton survives. Moreover, we reveal that the second-order rational solution displays the interactions between two solitons with combined-peak-valley structures in the <b>near-field</b> <b>regions,</b> but each interacting soliton vanishes or evolves into a rational dark or antidark soliton as |z|∞.

40|$|A {{restriction}} {{in using}} electromagnetic ray tracing for field prediction {{is given by}} the far-field condition: the results are only valid in the far-field region of the radiator. In this paper, it will be shown how ray tracing for accurate field computation can also be applied in the <b>near-field</b> <b>regions</b> of transmitters. The reduction of required large distances between transmitter and receiver is achieved by subdividing the transmitter in smaller subtransmitters. Even for complex transmitters, e. g. antennas with objects in close proximity such as metallic carrier platforms, subtransmitter models can be very efficiently generated by using the Multilevel Fast Multipole Method (MLFMM). This well-known integral equation solving technique makes very large problems in computational electromagnetics manageable. The subtransmitters can be directly generated based on this algorithm. A simulation example will show the improved modeling accuracy and options for simplification and refinement will also be discussed...|$|R
50|$|FRET is {{analogous}} to near-field communication, in that the radius of interaction is {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of light emitted. In the <b>near-field</b> <b>region,</b> the excited chromophore emits a virtual photon that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a radiationless mechanism. Quantum electrodynamical calculations have been used to determine that radiationless (FRET) and radiative energy transfer are the short- and long-range asymptotes of a single unified mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The {{interaction}} with the medium (e.g. body capacitance) can cause energy to deflect back to the source, as occurs in the reactive near field.

Another intermediate region, called the transition zone, is defined on a somewhat different basis, namely antenna geometry and excitation wavelength.|$|E

The field expressions presented in this paper reduces to the known far-field expressions of the loop antenna over ground plane when large argument approximations for SBFs are applied. Moreover, approximate expressions in the <b>near-fields</b> <b>region</b> are derived from the exact fields. Fields of the uniform CLA over ground plane and that on the axis of the loop are obtained as special cases.

40|$|Solutions for the {{impulsive}} wave fields {{generated by}} a horizontal electric dipole situated above an imperfectly conducting surface are derived. The space-time expressions for the reflected wave fields {{open the door to}} analysis of their properties in the far-, intermediate-, and <b>near-field</b> <b>regions,</b> and can serve as benchmark for numerical methods employed to wave simulation with applications in antenna design and radio communication. The EM properties of the conductive material are represented by a surface impedance and translated to the wave motion via employing the local plane wave relation as the boundary condition. At the core of tackling the impedance boundary value problem is the derivation of three space-time reflected-wave Green's functions. In contrast to the vertical electric dipole problem, a coupling term is present in the transform-domain wave solutions, and hinders direct application of the extended Cagniard-De Hoop method. A partial-fraction decomposition of this coupling term is the key to furnishing the transformation back to the time domain.

50|$|First {{scanners}} {{were built}} in the 1950s to map probe signal variations in front of microwave antennas. Determination of a far-field radiation pattern constitutes the primary application of antenna near-field scanners. This novel technique offered an attractive alternative to conventional open area test sites for measurements of high gain, electrically large antennas or antenna arrays (gain > 20 dBi, diameter > 5λ) in an indoor, controlled and all-weather capability environment. Among well recognized and analyzed errors of the near-field measurements, multiple reflections between an antenna under test (AUT) and an electromagnetically non-transparent field detection system (scatterer) belong to the most contributing errors when the AUT has a high gain. Therefore, the scanning surface is recommended to be located outside the reactive <b>near-field</b> <b>region</b> of the AUT.|$|E

This principle underpins powerful multi-dimensional optical and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and related techniques, including Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields used in atomic clocks. Previously established for atomic, molecular and quantum dot systems, recent developments in the optical quantum state preparation of free electron beams suggest a transfer of such concepts {{to the realm of}} ultrafast electron imaging and spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate the sequential coherent interaction of free electron states with two spatially separated, phase-controlled optical near-fields. Ultrashort electron pulses are acted upon in a tailored nanostructure featuring two <b>near-field</b> <b>regions</b> with anisotropic polarization response. The amplitude and relative phase of these two near-fields are independently controlled by the incident polarization state, allowing for constructive and destructive quantum interference of the subsequent interactions.

This solution is applicable to elastic and viscoelastic plates, in the far-field {{as well as in}} the <b>near-field</b> <b>regions,</b> under the assumption of transverse isotropic materials. The theoretical developments are conducted based on a semi-analytical finite element formulation. This formulation yields a one-dimensional modal problem, fast from a computational point of view, and allows to readily handle heterogeneous materials having depth-varying properties (multilayered, piecewise or continuously varying, functionally graded). The modal solution is shown to be expressed in terms of Hankel functions of multiple order thanks to a proper application of inverse transforms and Cauchy residue calculus. The link between the proposed formulation and a fully analytical approach is discussed. The solution of this paper is then successfully compared to literature results and degenerates to the point source case. Formula are presented to calculate point source excitabilities from lines sources. These formula remain valid for non-propagating modes, viscoelastic materials and account for the near-field contribution. Finally, the example of a viscoelastic bilayer waveguide excited by a rectangular source is considered in order to check the theoretical results...|$|R
