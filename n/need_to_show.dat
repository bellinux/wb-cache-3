5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs.

Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was inspired}} by Madonna's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that {{it was about the}} singer's personal views on life and spirituality. Like Truth or Dare, the performance scenes were shot in color, {{while the rest of the}} film was in black-and-white. Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, Åkerlund also shot her family, her working process and her day-to-day life. Madonna and her then-husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London was used for some sequences. The film features appearances from Madonna's father, stepmother and filmmaker Michael Moore.|$|E

5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom.

An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E

25|$|The Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference hired Garrison as its attorney, and {{he quickly}} filed suit in a federal court of appeals to stop the project. The court of appeals blocked the project on December 29, 1965, but the energy company appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, {{allowing}} the injunction against the power plant to stand. The decision in Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, 354 F.2d 608 (1965), cert. den'd., 384 US 941 (1966), is a landmark case in American environmental law, because it established {{for the first time}} that citizens do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> economic harm from a project but have standing to sue merely if the project creates environmental and aesthetic harms.|$|E
25|$|A good map has to {{compromise}} between portraying the items of interest (or themes) {{in the right}} place on the map, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. A good example from the late 1980s was the Ordnance Survey's first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from ground truth, when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.|$|E

Estimates of attendance at the rallies vary; according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, James Edwards attracted about 200 white counter-demonstrators to the Confederate Park vigil, while Sharpton's protest at Forrest Park attracted a few dozen black demonstrators, whom Edwards referred to as [...] "rabble". The Memphis Flyer estimated that Sharpton attracted about 250supporters.

500|$|On November 25, 1525, Charles {{issued an}} edict {{ordering}} the expulsion or conversion of remaining Muslims in the Crown of Aragon. Similar {{to the case}} in Castile, even though the option of exile was available on paper, in practice it was almost impossible. In order to leave the realm, a Muslim {{would have had to}} obtain documentation from Siete Aguas on Aragon's western border, then travel inland across the entire breadth of Castile to embark by sea from A Coruña in the northwest coast. The edict set a deadline of December 31 in the Kingdom of Valencia, and January 26, 1526 in Aragon and Catalonia. Those who failed to arrive on time would be subject to enslavement. A subsequent edict said that those who did not leave by December 8 would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> proof of baptism. Muslims were also ordered to [...] "listen without replying" [...] to Christian teachings.|$|E
500|$|The typical {{case will}} be of a non-fatal offence against the person that causes death. There must be a {{criminal}} act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe. Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions [...] {{where there is no}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> intent [...] would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, can be dealt with by gross negligence manslaughter. Judges have often failed to identify a single unlawful act on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (mens rea) for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This mens rea might be very low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an unlawful act also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime.|$|E
500|$|On August 23, 2010, U.S. District Judge Irma E.

Makaeff appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel ruled unanimously on April 17, 2013, that Trump University is a [...] "limited-purpose public figure" [...] and that Trump University must demonstrate malice on Makaeff's part to establish defamation; it returned {{the case to the}} district court to consider the defamation claim against that standard. After additional briefing, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel ruled in Makaeff's favor on June 16, 2014, and dismissed the defamation claim. Makaeff then, at the court's invitation, presented evidence of her legal costs and fees in connection with the defamation litigation. She asked for $1.3 million, and on April 20, 2015 Curiel ordered Trump University to reimburse Makaeff $798,000 in legal fees and costs.|$|E
