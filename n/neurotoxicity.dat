5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic <b>neurotoxicity,</b> or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic <b>neurotoxicity</b> as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of <b>neurotoxicity</b> from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced <b>neurotoxicity</b> in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs {{at the onset of}} alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. <b>Neurotoxicity</b> can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in <b>neurotoxicity,</b> such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{suggest that}} {{imbalance}} of brain metal homeostasis {{may be a}} cause of PrPSc-associated <b>neurotoxicity,</b> though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form {{as the cause of}} brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E
5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in <b>neurotoxicity,</b> through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe <b>neurotoxicity</b> have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs have}} been found that lessen the risk of <b>neurotoxicity</b> from NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists. Centrally acting alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are thought to most directly target the etiology of NMDA <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Other drugs acting on various neurotransmitter systems known to inhibit NMDA antagonist <b>neurotoxicity</b> include: anticholinergics, diazepam, barbiturates, ethanol, 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonists, and muscimol.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} {{serotonin}} releasing agents, αMT's analogue αET {{has been shown}} to produce long-lasting serotonergic <b>neurotoxicity</b> at very high doses. It is possible that αMT could cause the same <b>neurotoxicity.</b>|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric/neurological: mood swings, irritability, aggression, violent behavior, impulsivity/recklessness, hypomania/mania, euphoria, depression, anxiety, dysphoria, suicidality, delusions, psychosis, withdrawal, dependence, <b>neurotoxicity,</b> {{cognitive}} impairment.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{research}} suggests that acute exposure to alcohol is not neurotoxic in adults and actually prevents NMDA antagonist-induced <b>neurotoxicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{nitrous oxide}} depletes vitamin B levels. This can cause serious <b>neurotoxicity</b> with even acute use, if the user has preexisting vitamin B deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Studies in rats showed {{decreased}} weight, and gastric, intestinal, and renal function changes, while repetitive doses lead to <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Reproductive toxicity {{in males}} were also reported. A NOAEL in rodents {{was observed at}} 43μg/kg bw.|$|E
25|$|Zidovudine: Although {{administered}} {{often with}} aciclovir in HIV patients, <b>neurotoxicity</b> {{has been reported}} in at least one patient who presented with extreme drowsiness and lethargy 30–60 days after receiving IV aciclovir; symptoms resolved when aciclovir was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Pretreatment with NCS-382, a GHB {{receptor}} antagonist, prevents both learning/memory {{deficits and}} neuronal loss in GHB-treated animals, suggesting that GHB's neurotoxic actions are mediated via {{activation of the}} GHB receptor. In addition, the <b>neurotoxicity</b> appears {{to be caused by}} oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|In {{the brain}} (type II and III), glucosylceramidase accumulates {{due to the}} {{turnover}} of complex lipids during brain development {{and the formation of}} the myelin sheath of nerves. The exact mechanism of <b>neurotoxicity</b> is not understood, but it is thought to involve a reaction to glucosylsphingosine.|$|E
25|$|Although NMDA antagonists {{were once}} thought to {{reliably}} cause <b>neurotoxicity</b> in humans {{in the form of}} Olney's lesions, recent research suggests otherwise. Olney's lesions involve mass vacuolization of neurons observed in rodents. However, many suggest {{that this is not a}} valid model of human use, and studies conducted on primates have shown that use must be heavy and chronic to cause <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Indeed, a 2009 review found no evidence of ketamine-induced neuron death in humans. However, temporary and permanent cognitive impairments have been shown to occur in long-term or heavy human users of the NMDA antagonists PCP and ketamine. A large-scale, longitudinal study found that current frequent ketamine users have modest cognitive deficits, while infrequent or former heavy users do not.|$|E
25|$|Recently, a novel {{terminology}} (Psychoproteomics) {{has been}} coined by the University of Florida researchers from Dr. Mark S Gold Lab. Kobeissy et al. defined Psychoproteomics as integral proteomics approach dedicated to studying proteomic {{changes in the}} field of psychiatric disorders, particularly substance-and drug-abuse <b>neurotoxicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{account of}} these interactions, caution should be used when {{combining}} iprindole with other drugs. As an example, when administered with amphetamine or methamphetamine, iprindole increases their brain concentrations and prolongs their terminal half-lives by 2- to 3-fold, strongly augmenting both their physiological effects and <b>neurotoxicity</b> in the process.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{regimes are}} associated with causing an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory amino acids and changes in monoamines release in the central nervous system, which increases <b>neurotoxicity</b> and may result in cognitive impairments, psychological problems and in long-term heavy binge drinkers may cause irreversible brain damage in both adolescents and adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{black box}} warning {{emphasizes}} that lindane {{should not be}} used on premature infants and individuals with known uncontrolled seizure disorders, and should be used with caution in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions (e.g., dermatitis, psoriasis) and people who weigh less than 110lbs (50kg), as they may be at risk of serious <b>neurotoxicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patulin is toxic {{primarily}} through affinity to sulfhydryl groups (SH), {{which results in}} inhibition of enzymes. Oral LD50 in rodent models have ranged between 20 and 100mg/kg. In poultry, the oral LD50 range was reported between 50–170mg/kg. Other routes of exposure are more toxic, yet less likely to occur. Major acute toxicity findings include gastrointestinal problems, <b>neurotoxicity</b> (i.e., convulsions), pulmonary congestion, and edema.|$|E
25|$|Some PCBs share a {{structural}} similarity and toxic {{mode of action}} with dioxin. Other toxic effects such as endocrine disruption (notably blocking of thyroid system functioning) and <b>neurotoxicity</b> are known. The maximum allowable contaminant level in drinking water in the United States is set at zero, {{but because of the}} limitations of water treatment technologies, a level of 0.5 parts per billion is the de facto level.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid {{can also}} exert <b>neurotoxicity</b> through lipid peroxidation, {{as a result}} of its pro-oxidant properties. Quinolinic acid can {{interact}} with Fe(II) to form a complex that induces a reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), notably the hydroxyl radical •OH. This free radical causes oxidative stress by further increasing glutamate release and inhibiting its reuptake, and results in the breakdown of DNA in addition to lipid peroxidation.|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{approved}} {{the use of}} paraquat in 2004 but Sweden, supported by Denmark, Austria, and Finland, appealed this decision. In 2007, the court annulled the directive authorizing paraquat as an active plant protection substance stating that the 2004 decision was wrong in finding {{that there were no}} indications of <b>neurotoxicity</b> associated with paraquat and that the studies about the link between paraquat and Parkinson's disease should have been considered.|$|E
25|$|Blackouts, {{a form of}} amnesia {{that occurs}} in binge {{drinkers}} {{may be due to}} suppressed hippocampus function with rebound NMDA (glutamate) activity combined with excessive glucocorticoid release induced by the stress of repeated intoxication followed by acute withdrawal/abstinence is the proposed mechanism of neural kindling leading to <b>neurotoxicity</b> of structures involved in learning and memory within the brain of binge drinkers. Frontal lobe processing may become impaired as a result of binge drinking with resultant neurocognitive deficits and impaired working memory.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{withdrawal}} syndrome {{is a set}} of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in alcohol use after a period of excessive use. Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, seeing or hearing things that others do not, and delirium tremens (DTs). receptors. The mechanism behind kindling is sensitization of some neuronal systems and desensitization of other neuronal systems which leads to increasingly gross neurochemical imbalances. This in turn leads to more profound withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, convulsions and <b>neurotoxicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|One study {{concluded}} that epidemiological evidence is consistent with {{an increased risk of}} birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to DU. Environmental groups and others have expressed concern about the health effects of depleted uranium, and there is some debate over the matter. Some people have raised concerns about the use of this material, particularly in munitions, because of its mutagenicity, teratogenicity in mice, and <b>neurotoxicity,</b> and its suspected carcinogenic potential. Additional concerns address unexploded DU munitions leeching into groundwater over time.|$|E
25|$|Pedraza et al. (2009) {{found that}} {{repeated}} administration of GHB to rats for 15 days drastically {{reduced the number}} of neurons and non-neuronal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex. With doses of 10mg/kg of GHB, they were decreased by 61% in the CA1 region and 32% in the prefrontal cortex, and with 100mg/kg, they were decreased by 38% and 9%, respectively. It {{is interesting to note that}} GHB has biphasic effects on neuronal loss, with lower doses (10mg/kg) producing the most <b>neurotoxicity,</b> and higher doses (100mg/kg) producing less.|$|E
25|$|Many {{solvents}} {{can lead}} to a sudden loss of consciousness if inhaled in large amounts. Solvents like diethyl ether and chloroform have been used in medicine as anesthetics, sedatives, and hypnotics for a long time. Ethanol (grain alcohol) is a widely used and abused psychoactive drug. Diethyl ether, chloroform, and many other solvents (e.g. from gasoline or glues) are used recreationally in glue sniffing, often with harmful long term health effects like <b>neurotoxicity</b> or cancer. Fraudulent substitution of 1,5-pentanediol for the psychoactive 1,4-butanediol by a subcontractor caused the Bindeez product recall.|$|E
25|$|A high {{concentration}} of Ca2+ induces excitotoxicity which {{is believed to be}} the main mechanism behind movement disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's disease, and convulsive disorders like epilepsy. Honokiol disrupts the interfaces post synaptic density protein (PSD95) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). PSD95 and nNOS coupling to the NMDA receptor causes a conformational change responsible for the intracellular influx of Ca2+ which could in turn be a pathway for <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Calcium overloading can also cause damage by over-activation of calcium-stimulated enzymes. Honokiol can reduce calcium influx through inhibition of the fMLP, AlF4−, and thapsigargin G-protein pathways.|$|E
25|$|Local {{anesthetic}} toxicity {{is indicated}} by numbness and tingling around the mouth, metallic taste, or ringing in the ears. Additionally, this may lead to seizures, arrhythmias, and may progress to cardiac arrest. This reaction may stem from an allergy, excessive dose, or intravascular injection. Other complications include nerve injury which has an extremely low rate of 0.029-0.2%. Some research even suggests that ultrasound lowers the risk to 0.0037%. The use of ultrasound and nerve stimulation has greatly improved practitioners’ ability to safely administer nerve blocks. Nerve injury most often occurs from ischaemia, compression, direct <b>neurotoxicity,</b> or needle laceration, and inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid may {{contribute}} to the causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Researchers have found elevated levels of quinolinic acid in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), motor cortex, and spinal cord in ALS patients. These increased concentrations of quinolinic acid could lead to <b>neurotoxicity.</b> In addition, quinolinic acid is associated with overstimulating NMDA receptors on motor neurons. Studies have demonstrated that quinolinic acid leads to depolarization of spinal motor neurons by interacting with the NMDA receptors on those cells in rats. Also, quinolinic acid plays a role in mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons. All of these effects could contribute to ALS symptoms.|$|E
