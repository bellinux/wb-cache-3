40|$|AbstractIsomerization process {{became one}} of the best {{gasoline}} production sources, as it gives a high octane product while saving environment from pollution impacts. This paper presents a practical study that aims to improve the gasoline quality and economic income of an existing light <b>naphtha</b> <b>isomerization</b> unit used for octane improvement. The study included selecting the optimum combination of isomerization unit equipment that gives better product specifications for a specified feed. Eight scenarios were studied and simulated to predict the product specs. The original studied unit is MIDOR light <b>naphtha</b> <b>isomerization</b> unit at Alexandria-Egypt that recycles the unconverted hexane (C 6). The other studied scenarios were adding fractionators for separating feed iso-pentanes, and recycling unconverted pentanes, hexanes and/or combinations of these fractionators. The results show a change in octane number of gasoline product for a specific feed. Once through process with no extra fractionators has lower octane number of 81 while that with de-iso-pentanizer–de-pentanizer and de-hexanizer produces gasoline with 92. 3 octane number. Detailed economic study was done to calculate the return on investment “ROI” for each process option based on equipment, utilities, feed and product prices. Once through simple isomerization unit had the lowest ROI of 14. 3 % per year while the combination of De-iso-pentanizer with the De-hexanizer had the best ROI of 26. 6 % per year...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} deals with {{environmental}} issues in refineries and petrochemical processes. More precisely gaseous, liquid and solid effluents from processes are analysed qualitativelyand quantitatively when possible. Techniques to treat these effluents are reviewed or proposedwhen lacking and methods to {{do not produce}} these effluents are envisaged. In the part A of the report general effluents that are released from all types of processes arestudied. These effluents include fugitive emissions, flue gases from process heaters,blowdown systems emissions and wastewaters. Fugitive emissions, one of the greatestsources of VOCs can be qualified and quantified by the average emission factor approach andreduced thanks {{to the implementation of}} an LDAR program. Flue gases from process heaters,which are a major source of NOx, SOx and particulate matters can be characterized withemission factors and several techniques exist to treat or prevent these emissions. Concerningblowdown systems emissions, which are difficult to quantify, methods to minimize theseemissions are given. Finally, wastewaters treatment in petroleum industry is shortly describedbefore best management practices and pollution prevention methods are enounced. In the part B of the report four families of processes are studied: <b>naphtha</b> hydrotreatment,naphtha <b>isomerization,</b> catalytic reforming and hydrogenation in olefin plants. Each of theseprocesses is firstly described, the process flow diagram is explained and continuous andintermittent effluents are characterized. In addition to general effluents dealt with in part A, ithas been found that processes can produce other effluents such as dioxins in isomerization orcatalytic reforming units or green oils during catalyst regeneration operations.

30|$|The {{process of}} light <b>naphtha</b> <b>isomerization</b> mainly bases on the {{chlorinated}} platinum promoted alumina catalysts [3]. These active catalysts function {{even at a}} low temperature, which is a favorable condition for the process of isomerization. In earlier times, aluminum chloride {{was used as a}} catalyst in isomerization to produce iso-butane [4]. Afterward, many other catalysts have been developed but operated at a high temperature with reduced conversion of naphtha due to their lower activity. Therefore, highly active dual function catalysts are developed in recent years that can be operated at a lower temperature with high conversion of naphtha [6]. The types of catalysts used for the isomerization process of light naphtha are mixed metal oxide- and zeolite-based catalysts [2].|$|E
40|$|Abstract−The {{isomerization}} {{process is}} a substantial technology to produce clean fuel from linear paraffinic species existing in light naphtha. We investigated the influence of hydrocracking reactions besides the other reactions on the research octane number (RON) of the isomerization product. A reaction network and a kinetic model including fif-teen lumps and sixteen reactions were developed. Several experiments were carried out in a pilot plant to estimate kinetic parameters. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing the model prediction with the experimen-tal results. The maximum RON and process yield were strongly dependent on the temperature, hydrogen to hydrocar-bon molar ratio (H 2 /Oil) and {{liquid hourly space velocity}} (LHSV). Also, increasing the reaction temperature com-pensated for the negative effects of raising the LHSV and H 2 /Oil in RON maximization. Moreover, we concluded that the hydro cracking reactions were very effective on RON, such that they can dominate the role of the other reactions. By sensitivity analysis in this research, a rule was obtained to declare the effect of operating condition on maximization of RON and the method of revamping of <b>naphtha</b> <b>isomerization</b> reactor...|$|E
40|$|Transition metal {{catalysts}} are ubiquitous {{for industrial}} chemical reactions such as water-gas shift (WGS), CO oxidation, <b>naphtha</b> <b>isomerization,</b> and alkane dehydrogenation. However, a primary obstacle in optimizing these heterogeneous systems {{is that the}} dominant reaction pathways, identities of the active sites, and roles of the metal and support phases are often not well understood. Many of the challenges associated with the design and operation of catalysts to achieve enhanced turnover frequencies (TOF) and product selectivities can only be addressed at the molecular level. Thus, the primary objective {{of this research is}} to obtain a fundamental understanding of the surface chemistries that occur on supported metals, such as Pt, Zn, and Ga, by examining specific catalytic phenomena under reaction conditions. ^ Because of its relative simplicity, the WGS reaction is an ideal system for studying catalytic chemistry on supported noble metal surfaces. Experimental evidence indicates that WGS catalysts which exhibit the highest turnover frequencies operate in a bi-functional manner with contributions from both the dispersed metal as well as the support in activating CO and H 2 O, respectively. The WGS TOF per exposed surface metal atom on supported Pt catalysts can vary by a factor of 100 depending upon the metal oxide support. In this work, operando infrared spectroscopy (IR) and transient kinetics with CO/ 13 CO and H 2 O/D 2 O isotope switches are used to examine the carbon and hydrogen reactive pools on Pt/Al 2 O 3, Pt/ZrO 2, Pt/CeO 2, and Na-Pt/Al 2 O 3 while correlating catalyst performance with surface features related to CO and H 2 O activation. The presence of a hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) kinetic isotope effect (KIE) along with time-resolved IR spectra of transient surface species, reveals that O-H bond breaking is involved in the rate-determining step on alkali-free Pt catalysts. The addition of Na to these Pt-containing materials leads to the formation of new H 2 O activation sites that modify the rate-determining O-H dissociation step such that nearly all of the CO adsorbed on the Pt surface is able to participate in the reaction. When normalized by the true number of catalytic sites rather than simply by the exposed metal surface, the WGS TOFs are comparable for Na-free Pt and Na-doped Pt samples. ^ Supported metal catalysts are also vital in a number of hydrocarbon processes. Recent surges in natural gas production from gas-containing shale formations throughout the United States have spurred interest in catalytic solutions to convert these lower alkanes directly into value-added chemicals and fuels. Previous alkane dehydrogenation technologies based on PtSn/Al 2 O 3 and CrOx/Al 2 O 3 catalysts offer improvements over thermal cracking for the production light alkenes, but issues regarding product selectivity and catalyst stability limit their widespread application. Isolated metal centers, which are known to catalyze structure-insensitive reactions such as dehydrogenation, were examined for ethane (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Ga 3 + single-sites on SiO 2 demonstrated over 95 % C 3 H 6 selectivity for 12 h during PDH at 550 °C, but suffered from low TOF. SiO 2 -supported Pt, which exhibits a strong affinity to paraffinic C-H bonds, was shown to become nearly 100 % selective to C 2 H 4 during EDH at 600 °C upon incorporation of Zn to form a Pt 1 Zn 1 intermetallic alloy. An integrated approach using density functional theory (DFT) methods, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopy, revealed that the role of Zn is two-fold: (i) to isolate Pt surface sites and suppress C-C bond cleavage, and (ii) to modify the Pt surface electronic structure and promote the EDH TOF per exposed surface Pt by a factor of ten for PtZn/SiO 2 compared to Pt/SiO 2. The experimental validation of DFT predictions suggests that the measurement of energy transfer between the unoccupied and occupied Pt valence d-shells, rather than the d-band center alone, may provide insight toward predicting the reactivity of metals and, ultimately, toward guiding catalyst design. ...|$|E
