5000|$|The GM {{standard}} eliminates {{variation in}} note mapping. Some manufacturers had disagreed over what <b>note</b> <b>number</b> should represent middle C, but GM specifies that <b>note</b> <b>number</b> 69 plays A440, {{which in turn}} fixes middle C as <b>note</b> <b>number</b> 60. GM-compatible devices are required to respond to velocity, aftertouch, and pitch bend, to be set to specified default values at startup, and to support certain controller numbers such as for sustain pedal, and Registered Parameter Numbers. A simplified version of GM, called [...] "GM Lite", is used in mobile phones and other devices with limited processing power.|$|E

50|$|For {{notes in}} an A440 equal temperament, this formula {{delivers}} the standard MIDI <b>note</b> <b>number</b> (p). Any other frequencies fill {{the space between}} the whole numbers evenly. This lets MIDI instruments be tuned accurately in any microtuning scale, including non-western traditional tunings.|$|E
50|$|Another system {{known as}} {{scientific}} pitch assigns a frequency of 256 Hz but, while numerically convenient, {{this is not}} used by orchestras. Other note-octave systems, including those used by some makers of digital music keyboards, may refer to Middle C differently. In MIDI, Middle C is <b>note</b> <b>number</b> 60.|$|E
50|$|Since 440 Hz is {{a widely}} used {{standard}} concert A (e.g. USA, UK), and since that is represented in MIDI terms by the integer 69 (nine semitones above middle C, which is 60), this gives a real number which expresses pitch {{in a manner consistent}} with MIDI and integer notation, known as the midi <b>note</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This term, however, is {{not limited}} to simple counting. Other sequences, such as the decimal numbers of the {{mathematical}} constants [...] (3/14/1592), [...] (2/7/1828), and the square root of two (1/4/1421) are also <b>noted.</b> <b>Number</b> sequences such as the Fibonacci sequence (1/1/2358) can also be found in time stamps.|$|R

50|$|In GM {{standard}} MIDI files, channel 10 {{is reserved}} for percussion instruments only.
