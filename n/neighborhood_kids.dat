500|$|The utter {{disrepair}} in {{the park}} prompted some informal rules at the park's golf courses. For instance, the Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "a player was allowed to drop his ball a club length away if it rolled up against an abandoned auto, or, in one case, a boat. To thwart robbers, besieged golfers quit playing in traditional foursomes and instead ventured forth in football-team-sized units. Some players added an extra club—a night stick—or tucked tear gas spray into their golf bags." [...] Years later, one writer recalled that dozens of the course's trees died, and [...] "flagsticks were reduced to broken bamboo poles stuck into the ground." [...] Weeds overgrew the course, and golfers would wear long-sleeved shirts to ward off against the city's insufficient mosquito repellents. Homeless squatters moved into the park, while courses fell into disrepair, replaced by dirt tracks and [...] "huts and forts" [...] built by <b>neighborhood</b> <b>kids.</b> In 1985, the city licensed control of the courses to Los Angeles-based American Golf Corporation for 60 years, leading to their restoration.

[...] “Donald and Lydia” was originally called “Natural” about two young lovers failing to connect with anybody but themselves and got the characters’ names from a book to help expectant parents name their baby. Prine biographer Eddie Huffman notes, “On the surface the song may have been about masturbation, but on another level Prine aimed at a deeper truth about loneliness and isolation.
