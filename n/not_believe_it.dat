5|$|Laurens Hammond died in 1973, and {{the company}} {{struggled}} to survive, proposing an acquiring of Roland in 1972, which was turned down. Roland's Ikutaro Kakehashi did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was practical at that point to move the entire manufacturing operation from Chicago to Japan, and also viewed Hammond's declining sales figures as a problem.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} {{the feasibility of}} building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as they did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.|$|E
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E

5|$|Since Archie Comics {{partnered with}} Marvel Comics for the 1994 {{one-shot}} comic Archie Meets the Punisher, the Archie characters {{have had a}} tradition of team-ups with characters from other fictional universes. Following the success of Archie meets KISS in 2012 and Archie meets Glee in 2013, the Archie Creative Summit held in March 2014 included a brainstorming session for new crossovers. Godzilla and Friday the 13th were considered, but the Predator received the most support. Artist Fernando Ruiz was at the summit and liked the premise, but did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> would actually be made, or {{that he would be}} involved if it was.|$|E
5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician {{and chairman of}} the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in around 125 prints in the overseas markets, grossing a total of $8.9 million {{at the end of}} its theatrical run. It performed very well in the United Kingdom, with a gross of $689,000 in its opening weekend. It thus debuted at the third position at the British box-office. The total earnings of the film reached over $3.2 million in the UK. The film also had the biggest opening ever for a Bollywood film in North America, with a gross of $1.1 million in 73 screens. However, according to a report by Rediff, the numbers were so high that the official reporting agency did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> and asked for evidence that could not be furnished until after the reporting deadline had passed. If reported on time, the film would have opened at the number 10 spot in the North American box-office. However, according to figures from Box Office Mojo, the film debuted at the 32nd place at the American box office during the week of 4 January 2002. It eventually gathered a total of $2.9 million there. Additionally, in 2003, the film became the first from India to be given a theatrical release in Germany.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Chet Simmons, {{president}} of the year-old ESPN, asked Pete Rozelle if the fledgling network could broadcast coverage of the draft live on ESPN. Although Rozelle did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> would be entertaining television, he agreed.|$|E

25|$|Both Plato and Aristotle {{argue against}} some of Protagoras's claims {{regarding}} relativity; however, {{they argue that the}} concept provides Protagoras with too convenient an exemption from his own theory and that relativism is true for him yet false for those who do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> They claim that by asserting that truth is relative, Protagoras then could say that whatever further theory he proposed must be true.|$|E
25|$|SMK gained {{its modern}} French art {{collection}} in 1928 {{when it was}} donated by the late collector Johannes Rump. This collection features some of the museum’s most famous pieces from artists such as Matisse, Picasso, Derain and Braque. The collection was first offered to the SMK by Rump in 1923, but {{was rejected by the}} director Karl Madsen, as he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be of a high enough quality.|$|E
25|$|In Memphis, Unionists {{held two}} torchlight processions to honor their cause. The secessionists replied {{with their own}} demonstrations and a celebratory ball. That week, on February 9, the state of Tennessee was to vote {{on whether or not}} to send delegates to a State Convention that would decide on secession. The General Assembly convened by Governor Isham Harris did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> had the {{authority}} to call a State Convention without a vote of the people.|$|E

25|$|The dig in {{question}} was led by David Ussishkin of the University of Tel Aviv, who responded to Abu El Haj's characterization in an open letter published on the internet in December 2006. While confirming that the earlier strata was the main interest of the dig, Ussishkin denied that any damage was done to other strata, which he insisted were properly excavated. Ussishkin defended {{the use of the}} bulldozer at the site as being necessary to properly excavate the site, and said he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> had caused any damage.|$|E
25|$|A {{public inquiry}} into the tolls was held in March 2009 by {{independent}} inspector Neil Taylor. In July 2009, the Department for Transport announced that it {{had decided not to}} allow the proposed increase. Transport Minister Sadiq Khan said he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was right for the tolls to be raised in the current economic climate. In October 2009, the government approved a £6million grant for maintenance costs, which meant {{that there would be no}} toll increase before 2011 at the earliest, by which time tolls would have been frozen for five years.|$|E
25|$|Olivia Colman was {{the first}} cast member to learn the killer's identity—having been {{informed}} during her first meeting with the producers. Colman told Radio Times that she asked who the killer was, and was told. An hour later, she {{was told that the}} killer's identity would remain a secret and that she should not tell anyone. Somehow, David Tennant's agent learned that Colman knew the murderer's identity, and told David Tennant midway through the production that Colman knew. Tennant did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> Colman later said that Tennant was angry at learning the truth.|$|E

50|$|It is said by some {{scholars}} {{that the letter}} was sent to Kunal; <b>not</b> <b>believing</b> <b>it,</b> Kunal went to his father.

It is uncertain whether this is true.|$|R
25|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{proposal}} was to extend the line into the Taupo industrial area. The line would extend from the proposed log-processing yard around the southern flank of Mount Tauhara and head north towards Broadlands Road before completing a horseshoe like curve south into the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report said the line {{would be used for}} transporting sawn timber from the processing yard to the mill on Centennial Drive. Forest industry people did not express an interest in this option, as they did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> would bring any new opportunities to them.|$|E
25|$|I also do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} {{appropriate}} for me to offer opinions, as your letter suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of senior White House officials for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the sufficiency of the remedial measures that White House officials took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, Parker {{had begun}} {{attending}} {{meetings of the}} group later known as the Transcendental Club. Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Divinity School Address that year had been deeply arresting to him, and he welcomed the opportunity to associate with Emerson, Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, and several others. Transcendentalists such as Henry David Thoreau and Parker wrote {{of the world as}} divine, and of themselves as part of this divinity. Unlike Emerson and other Transcendentalists, however, Parker believed the movement was rooted in deeply religious ideas and did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> should retreat from religion. All shared a conviction that slavery should be abolished and social reforms should take root.|$|E
