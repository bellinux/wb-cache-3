500|$|Secondly, {{there is}} a {{difference}} between the kinds of tribunals the decisions of which are being considered for judicial review. The source of this reasoning is the dissenting judgment of Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane in Pearlman v. Keepers and Governors of Harrow School (1978). Lord Browne-Wilkinson noted that this dissenting judgment was approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. <b>Non-Metallic</b> <b>Mineral</b> Products Manufacturing Employees Union (1980), and also by a majority in Re Racal Communications Ltd. (1980). In the latter case, Lord Diplock highlighted that the decision in Anisminic only applies to administrative bodies or tribunals as {{there is a}} presumption that Parliament does not intend such bodies to be the final arbiters of questions of law. This can be contrasted with courts of law in respect of which such a presumption is not present. Instead, the presumption is that [...] "where Parliament had provided that the decision of an inferior court was final and conclusive the High Court should not be astute to find that the inferior court's decision on a question of law had not been made final and conclusive, thereby excluding the jurisdiction to review it." ...|$|E
