50|$|A large {{traditional}} hand bookbinding studio or workshop may {{be divided}} into areas for different tasks such as sewing, rounding and backing the spine, attaching the boards to the book and covering the book with cloth or leather. These processes are collectively called forwarding and would be {{carried out in the}} forwarding department. This area of the bindery would typically have equipment such as sewing frames, guillotines, board choppers for cutting boards used as covers, laying presses for holding books when being worked on and <b>nipping</b> <b>presses</b> for flattening paper, board, etc. Recently, some compact material have been developed, allowing the processing of almost all the operations.|$|R
50|$|Extended <b>Nip</b> <b>Presses</b> (or ENP) are a {{relatively}} modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll {{is usually a}} standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved {{to the shape of}} the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higherâ€”delivering significant steam savings or speed increases. ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.|$|R
40|$|Dewatering of pulp in a {{paper machine}} is a well {{established}} process. Nevertheless, {{it is far from}} being fully understood. One of the major steps in this process is the mechanical dewatering within the press section. It is achieved by applying large mechanical loads on the wet paper web {{while at the same time}} providing an escape route for the excess water. The quality of this process is influenced by many parameters. Besides the <b>press</b> <b>nip</b> parameters like pressure, roll diameters and press type (roll or shoe press), also other factors contribute to the mechanical dewatering performance. Among these factors the press felts, that transport the paper web through the <b>press</b> <b>nip,</b> are a major influence. Besides dewatering pulp, press felts govern also the papers smoothness and printability...|$|R

60|$|It was now midnight, {{and the men}} {{on board}} both vessels {{required}} rest. A watch was set in each, {{and most of the}} people were permitted to turn in. Of course, proper look-outs were had, but the light of the moon was not sufficiently distinct to render it safe to make any final efforts under its favour. No great alarm was felt, there being nothing unusual in a vessel's being embayed in the ice; and so long as she was not <b>nipped</b> or <b>pressed</b> upon by actual contact the position was thought safe rather than the reverse. It was desirable, moreover, for the schooners to communicate with each other; for some advantage might be known to one of the masters that was concealed by distance from his companion. Without concert, therefore, Roswell and Daggett came to the same general conclusions, and waited patiently.|$|R
40|$|The problem {{presented}} {{concerned the}} dynamics of a roll <b>press</b> <b>nip,</b> a crucial component in a paper-making machine. Modern commercial paper-making machines are huge items of equipment. They may be {{as long as a}} football field and cost many millions of dollars each. Integrity of the process is extremely important; the paper in such a machine travels so fast (up to 20 km/sec) that a break is viewed as a major calamity and may take many man-hours and dollars to recover from. The size and speed of the machines means that {{it is not easy to}} make measurements as the paper passes through. The hostility of the environment therefore dictates that a thorough theoretical understanding of the important parts of the process is crucial if the processes involved are to be optimized. In this study we do not seek to answer anyone specific question, but rather wish to propose a general framework for modeling the flow and deformation under a roll <b>press</b> <b>nip.</b> Because of the difficulty of making measurements in the nip region and the need to closely control the process, the distributions of pressure, velocity and felt porosity within the nip have traditionally been subjects of great debate. Previous treatments have included lubrication theory models and "Bernoulli" based models. Although some progress may be made using thin layer theory, we shall show the required modeling does not take the form of standard lubrication theory. As far as models based on Bernoulli's equation are concerned, we simply note that the discussion below shows that the drag force exerted by the felt on the liquid is a key physical component of the flow process. Clearly, a full three-phase flow treatment is required. In this study we will thus address the following questions: (i) Is it possible to propose a general theoretical treatment of the roll <b>press</b> <b>nip?</b> (ii) What determines the physics of the water movement within the paper and felt in the roll <b>press</b> <b>nip</b> and how is this connected to the details of the air movement and the deformation of the felt? (iii) When a general model has been proposed, is it possible exploit the geometry within the nip to generate some simple exact solutions? (iv) What are the key non-dimensional parameters in the problem and how large are they likely to be for realistic paper-making machines? A further matter of interest concerns the influence that the size, shape and separation of the rollers have on the whole process. We approach the modeling from a rather general point of view, beginning by including all effects that might be important and then making clearly defined assumptions to simplify the equations. In this way it is possible to make changes to the model if circumstances change...|$|R
40|$|When {{the paper}} web and press felt enter a <b>nip</b> in the <b>press</b> {{section of a}} paper machine, both the paper web and felt are compressed. Water is forced from the paper sheet into the press felt due to a {{hydrodynamic}} pressure gradient between the sheet and felt. Water not only flows through the felt in the transversal z-direction, but also flows through the felt in the machine and cross-machine directions. On the exit side of the nip, the pressure imposed on the sheet-felt system by the rolls begins to decrease. Both the paper web and press felt begin to expand, and a vacuum is created in the web and felt. The vacuum in the web is stronger than that in the felt, and thus water and air tend to flow from the felt back into the sheet, causing rewet. Three mechanisms that contribute to rewet have been proposed: 1) film splitting between the paper web and press felt, 2) capillary forces in the web drawing water from the felt into the web, and 3) the pressure differential between the web and felt during expansion. The objective of this project was to design and test under flow conditions {{similar to those in}} a <b>press</b> <b>nip</b> a smart water receiver {{to be used in the}} press section of a paper machine. In this manner, the feasibility of such a water receiver was to be determined. The purpose of this water receiver is to accept water that is pressed from the paper web in a nip and prevent the return of this water to the paper web upon exit from the nip. Thus, the smart water receiver allows flow through the felt in the positive z-direction of the felt (away from the paper web) and not in the negative z-direction (towards the paper web). The smart water receiver concept utilizes a layer of micro-check valves incorporated into the press felt to perform in the desired manner. A mathematical model and lab-scale prototype were created in order to predict the behavior of such a design in the <b>press</b> <b>nip.</b> M. S.

50|$|Conventional roll presses are {{configured}} {{with one}} of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. The felts run through the <b>nips</b> of the <b>press</b> rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the press felt. When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.|$|R

40|$|As of April 1998, {{the project}} was behind on schedule. This was {{as a result of}} the need for {{additional}} process development work. Work has focused on evaluating nip decompression and post-nip depressurization techniques as used on the Beloit X 2 pilot paper machine. The authors have also concentrated on implementing impulse drying technology on Beloit`s No. 4 and No. 2 pilot paper machines. Experiments on Beloit`s X 4 pilot paper machine demonstrated that roll coating durability problems have been solved. They also showed that further development work on sheet picking, implementation of delamination suppression techniques and CD temperature control are necessary in order to ensure success on the X 4 machine. Experiments on the Beloit`s X 2 pilot paper machine were carried out to resolve issues identified on the X 4 machine. Two methods of implementing <b>press</b> <b>nip</b> decompression were investigated. The results confirmed that the technology can be used to increase impulse drying operating temperatures.

40|$|Abstract: This paper focuses {{upon the}} press {{section of a}} paper machine and {{describes}} a neural network vibration-based condition monitoring system for providing advance warning of faults in the felts. These are extremely important components of the paper machine as {{they are responsible for}} guiding the paper through the <b>press</b> <b>nips.</b> Any deterioration in the felts may result in paper breakage and machine shut-downs with a resulting fall in productivity. The need for tighter control of the manufacturing process is thus the main motivation for this work. The system developed makes use of spectral analysis of the raw vibration signals. This involves the technique of acceleration enveloping for isolating the spectral components that reflect the process defects. Since visual examination of the spectra for detecting subtle changes in the early stages is both difficult and impractical, a peak detection algorithm has been designed. Its purpose is to extract the relevant features from each spectrum. These are then fed into a neural network classifier for discriminating between the fault and the no-fault conditions. The system is demonstrated to be successful for detecting felt deterioration in its early stages when assessed on industrial data. Other benefits include the ease of on-line implementation and its possible extension {{to a wide range of}} mechanical and rotating equipment...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{reserves}} {{of fuel and}} energy resources saving {{in the production of}} oil extraction is the improvement of equipment energy-intensive modes, and forepress in particular. Therefore the authors used an efficient energy saving method, based on the optimi-zation of the oilseeds pressing in the forepress on technical and economic indicator. Specific heat and energy losses were used as the optimi-zation criterion. We propose an automatic optimization of the two-stage pressing, including the measuring of oil content in the seeds of the original material and expeller oilcake, initial product temperature, flow rate of the initial product and oil output in the first stage pressing in forepress and the second stage extracting in the spin expeller. Additionally, the steam is fed in the tank roaster, mean-integral product temperature in the roaster and after it is measured, steam flow rate and power consumption of regulated forepress drive is determined. From the measured oil content values of the starting material and expeller oilseed cake the current value of their ratio is determined. Depending on it the frequency of screw rotation is set in forepress by influencing the power of forepress regulated drive with the correction of ratio of oil content on the current pressure in the <b>press</b> <b>nip.</b> According to the temperature of the initial product the steam flow with the correction by value of mean-integral temperature in the tank roaster is determined. When the pressure reaches its maximum value the speed of the fore-press screw is reduced, and the heating temperature of the product in the area of tank roaster is stabilized by changing the steam flow in it with the correction of the current value of the temperature of the starting material...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the Walker and Fetsko ink {{transfer}} equation {{was used as}} an analytic tool to determine how the physical properties of the transfer surface change from printing on unprinted paper to overprinting on another wet ink film. The equation has three parameters, b, k, and f, which indicate {{what is happening in the}} <b>nip</b> of the <b>press</b> during the moment of impression. Parameter b represents the maximum absorptive capacity of the paper, parameter k is highly reflective of printing smoothness, and parameter f represents the fraction of free ink film which splits to the paper surface. The I. G. T. Printability Tester was used to simulate the wet-on-wet trapping which occurs on a lithographic press. Heatset inks and uncoated paper were used to conduct the testing. Application of the equation to the experimental data showed that the surface in wet-on-wet trapping is less absorbent, smoother, and increases the fraction of free ink film which splits to the paper in comparison to the surface of the unprinted paper. The first two observations are explained simply by considering that in wet-on-wet trapping the paper porosity and the low spots on the paper surface are filled by the first-down ink film. The third observation regarding parameter f is explained by considering a model in which the ink film cavities expand and the ink film ruptures more readily in areas of high vehicle concentration and low viscosity. In printing to the unprinted paper the vehicle drains more quickly into the paper than the pigment particles due to its lower viscosity and lower molecular weight. Thus there is a higher concentration of vehicle nearer the paper surface, causing the split to occur here. On the other hand, the surface in wet-on-wet trapping at the moment the second ink film is transferred is not very absorbent. Therefore, the vehicle does not drain that quickly into the surface, causing the viscosity of the ink film to be the same throughout, which tends to create a fifty percent split...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{claims a}} {{relationship}} between the film splitting sound emission from the printing <b>press</b> <b>nip</b> and the dynamic interaction occurring there between ink, fountain solution and substrate in offset lithography. The film splitting sound derives from the cavitation formed by the pressure drop {{in the second half of}} the print nip flow passage. As the ink film is strained, the cavities expand and eventually implode into breaking filaments at the nip exit, while emitting a partly audible, broadband, high frequency, noisy sound. A free-field microphone, A/D-converter and laptop computer were used to record pressure signals in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 50 kHz emitted by a variety of printing instruments and presses for a range of offset ink and paper types. After signal acquisition and filtering two signal averages of power and frequency were estimated. This average power increased with increasing loads of sheet-fed offset ink on an ink distributor, in accordance with a mass-conservation model developed. The behaviour of average frequency and power over different ink load ranges indicated transitions between different flow regimes. A glossy fine-coated paper gave higher average power than a corresponding matte paper during printing with such inks on a laboratory device, possibly due to an air sealing effect. The sound from tack measurements with the Deltack instrument during setting of heat-set offset inks printed on MWC papers showed a relation between the measured tack rise and average power, reflecting changes in splitting mechanism during the course of setting. With the Hydroscope instrument the interaction between these heat-set inks and fountain solution was studied, with the measured tack and sound emission displaying a clear, but non-linear, correlation. A heat-set offset pilot trial showed that the acoustic response from the printing nip sensitively and systematically detected changes in (LWC) paper type, optical density, ink-fount balance, and press stability. Pilot trials of cold-set offset inks on newsprint by sheet-fed presses indicated a strong correlation between evolution in average power, optical density and fountain solution consumption during the first thousand sheets normally needed for stabilisation. Acoustic measurements of ink film splitting have, aside from the laboratory studies performed by one Japanese group, previously received little attention, with the current study showing that a great deal of information useful to the printer can be accessed from this sound emission. Although the detailed mechanisms for ink film splitting have to be further studied and supported by mathematical simulation, the sensitivity of the acoustic method recommends its implementation for monitoring and control of offset printing.
