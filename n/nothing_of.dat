The Air Force knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> Operation Market Time and did not routinely communicate with Naval Forces, Vietnam. To avoid a repetition of the incident, aircraft patrolling near the DMZ were instructed not to attack vessels without first contacting CSC Da Nang for clearance.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw. He was also very lucky on many occasions.

He abandoned all the rules.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{residents}} of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to restore Old Pine Church: the church's original windows were repaired and the unpainted weatherboards painted; a new roof was installed and the original wood floor replaced. The boarding room addition was probably removed (<b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> it now remains) and the pressed metal ceiling may have been added.|$|E

5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> them survives, their design {{has had to}} be reconstructed from historical records.

5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E

5|$|Wehha was a pagan {{king of the}} East Angles who, if he {{actually}} existed, ruled the kingdom of East Anglia during the 6th century, {{at the time the}} kingdom was being established by migrants from what is now Frisia and the southern Jutland peninsula.

5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the Prince and had never heard of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

5|$|European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century, boosted by Champollion's translation of hieroglyphs. Early in the century, the area was visited by Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located and <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E

5|$|In September 1915, {{after the}} Italian {{declaration}} of war on the Central Powers, {{the transfer of the}} B-class boats to the Adriatic was suggested by the Admiralty. Originally they were to be based at Brindisi, but this was changed to Venice as there were already 14 British and French submarines based at Brindisi. B4, B7, and B9 were the first to arrive, but B4 collided en route with the Italian tug escorting them and required immediate docking upon her arrival. B9 made the first patrol on 18 October and a total of 81 patrols were made by the B-class submarines before they ceased in October 1916. <b>Nothing</b> <b>of</b> note was directly accomplished by the submarines, but they fulfilled the ultimate goal of keeping the Austro-Hungarians from attacking the Italian coast.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul is {{primarily}} {{known for its}} Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. <b>Nothing</b> <b>of</b> {{the architecture of the}} classical Greek period has survived, but Roman architecture has proved to be more durable. The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, and a section of the Valens Aqueduct, constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at {{the western edge of the}} Fatih district. The Column of Constantine, erected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital, stands not far from the Hippodrome.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, 1980, IAF guided {{missiles}} destroyed two armored cars carrying SA-9 batteries, {{manned by}} Libyan troops, near Sidon. The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> the kind.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At {{the same time that the}} British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E

His wife and daughter know <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> what has befallen him and struggle to live in the city. The daughter gets a position in a sweatshop, and her eyesight deteriorates until she is unable to work anymore. Now blind, she resorts to playing the violin for money while her mother becomes a beggar.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies.
