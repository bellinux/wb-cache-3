5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash.

5|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design studies {{were carried out}} and some scale models were made. This was partly due to the changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E

The first estimates of the damage inflicted on the building and its contents ranged between 2 and 3million US dollars. Apart from the Banski dvori, other buildings in the area sustained damage. Those included the Croatian Parliament building, the Old City Hall, St. Mark's Church, the Museum of History, the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments as well as residences and offices in the vicinity, including the residence of Swiss consul Werner Mauner.|$|E

5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, 2000. It was an above average {{season in which}} 19tropical cyclones formed. Fifteen depressions attained tropical storm status, and eight of these attained hurricane status. Three hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most likely because of an ongoing La Niña in the Pacific Ocean. Three hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 77deaths and $1.2billion in damage (2000USD). Hurricane Florence and Isaac and Tropical Storm Leslie also caused damage and fatalities, though <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> made landfall. The last storm of the season, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on October 29, over {{a month before the}} official end of {{hurricane season}} on November30.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible for assessing the conservation status of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat {{if it has a}} small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% in ten years or three generations). <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> Delichon species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; {{all of them are}} broken on the right side, and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.|$|E

5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E
5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E
