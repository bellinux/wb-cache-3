5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
25|$|The next Annual Report had {{virtually}} <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{about how and}} why the Irish banking system collapsed. Although there were four Central Bank directors {{on the board of the}} Financial Regulator, the Central Bank maintained it had no powers to intervene in the market. Yet, the Central Bank had the power to issue directives to the Financial Regulator if it thought it was conducting its business in a way that was contrary to overall Central Bank policy aims. None were issued.|$|E

25|$|Wilson and Robertson had a {{very brief}} {{handover}} meeting at the War Office, at which Robertson (by Wilson’s account) was “grumpy and ungracious & said he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> – and indeed said nothing”. Wilson later recalled (in his last letter as CIGS, to Rawlinson (13 Feb 1922)) that he “walked out without handing me over anything in particular; there was indeed a box of matches in the top right-hand drawer and some feathers for pipe-cleaning, or the remains {{of some of the}} Staff”.|$|E

25|$|The moral {{influence}} view can {{be combined}} {{with some of the}} other views of atonement. Indeed, Methodist theologian Vincent Taylor, while regarding the moral influence theory of atonement as inadequate by itself, described the moral influence theory as the 'truth' that is the 'presupposition of any worthy doctrine of the Atonement'. In the early centuries of the church, the moral influence view focused around the issue of how people can pass God's final judgment (namely through positive moral change). Some other atonement views, such as ransom from Satan, have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about final judgment and deal with other concerns. Such views can therefore be easily held in combination with the moral influence view.|$|E

25|$|LQG {{differs from}} string theory {{in that it}} is {{formulated}} in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, while the latter requires both to be true. There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory's predictions of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions. In a 2003 paper A dialog on quantum gravity, Carlo Rovelli regards the fact LQG is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation, consistent with current experimental results, over its rival string/M-theory. Proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which Loop Quantum Gravity has struggled to do. In that sense string theory's connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative, at the mathematical level. Loop Quantum Gravity has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the matter(fermions) in the universe.|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the reviews}} were not entirely positive. Rolling Stone {{originally}} gave the album {{three out of}} five stars. Reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, [...] "If Nirvana isn't onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit {{to be much more}} than a reformulation of college radio's high-octane hits." [...] The Boston Globe was less enthusiastic about the album; reviewer Steve Morse wrote, [...] "Most of Nevermind is packed with generic punk-pop that had been done by countless acts from Iggy Pop to the Red Hot Chili Peppers," [...] and added [...] "the band has little or <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> settling for moronic ramblings by singer-lyricist Cobain." ...|$|E

[...] The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger: That means you are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: [...] "Things are not that simple, Rebbe.

By {{the end of the}} day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was [...] "dreadfully upset at first", and the Field family was [...] "insulted and angry". [...] Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, [...] "I have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will {{be in a position to}} marry I cannot imagine.

500|$|In May 1878, Bond {{made her}} first {{appearance}} on the dramatic stage {{at the age of}} 25, creating the role of Cousin Hebe in W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore. [...] The role had been written for a veteran performer, Mrs Howard Paul. But Gilbert and Sullivan were unhappy with Mrs. Paul's vocal abilities, which were deteriorating. [...] Finally, with only about a week to go before opening night, Carte hired Bond to play Cousin Hebe. At this stage of her career, Bond was not comfortable with spoken dialogue, and so her character was written out, or given <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in several scenes. After opening night, however, a portion of the recitative was converted to spoken dialogue, and Bond would have dialogue in all of the remaining roles that she created. [...] She quickly grew to enjoy character acting.|$|E

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of}} his death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she {{realized}} it when {{she arrived at the}} Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He shrugged and replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to one another.|$|E
500|$|The film {{attracted}} 236,189 viewers at the French box office. Time Out gave a favourable review, {{calling the}} film a [...] "welcome {{addition to the}} post-holocaust barbarism [...] boom." [...] Steve Macfarlane from Not Coming to a Theater Near You gave a moderately positive review, stating [...] "While the film’s heart is syrupy-sentimental (who’s shocked?), its surfaces are clean, incremental, reverently silent—appropriate, given that ... humankind has lost its ability to speak." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it [...] "a bravura first film, using the simplest means, yet managing to incorporate humor, pathos, suspense and even a well-articulated definition of basic human needs." [...] Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review, stating: [...] "The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt, {{but it is also}} an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who really has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Another John Carpenter is born, which {{is by no means a}} bad thing." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with his hands together and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] The only thing he thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.|$|E
500|$|In early 1942, {{the company}} that Doc Goddard worked for {{required}} him to relocate to West Virginia. California laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced the possibility of having {{to return to the}} orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old factory worker James [...] "Jim" [...] Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently {{dropped out of high school}} and became a housewife; she later stated that the [...] "marriage didn't make me sad, but it didn't make me happy, either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I was dying of boredom." [...] In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine. He was initially stationed on Catalina Island, where she lived with him until he was shipped out to the Pacific in April 1944; he would remain there for most of the next two years. After Dougherty's deployment, Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the Radioplane Munitions Factory in Van Nuys, both as part of the war effort and to earn her own income.|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then {{they need to go}} out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E
