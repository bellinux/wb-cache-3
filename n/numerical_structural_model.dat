40|$|The {{second half}} of the 20 th century was {{affected}} by the introduction of electronic data processing. The numerical methods appeared to be capable of solving every engineering problem. However, dealing with real problems, an appropriate numerical discretization of built structures is in many cases a difficult task, since fundamental input data concerning the actual properties of the structure, material and the mechanical boundary condition couldnâ€™t always be met. Typical difficulties are an incomplete documentation, unknown effects of structural faults and uncertain material properties. In this paper our experience in experimental assessment of structures is described and the outcome of experimental versus numerical results is compared in several examples. This paper summarizes finally both prospects and limitations of numerical simulations of built structures and shall show that the identified load bearing capacity is strongly bound {{to the quality of the}} <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{accuracy}} of the structural design of flexible pavements based on mechanistic approaches {{is directly related to}} the appropriateness of the structural response algorithm and the material resilient modulus models selected. Mechanistic response algorithms can be based on layered theory or finite element algorithms. The geomaterials can be modeled as linear or nonlinear. To evaluate the appropriateness of the numerical models and the available resilient modulus models for estimating the response of pavements, several small-scale pavements were constructed and tested under different loads, loading areas and moisture conditions. A nonlinear <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> was then utilized with different resilient modulus models to match the experimental responses. With some modifications, a three-parameter nonlinear model provided the same patterns as the experimentally measured values as long as the weight of the material was considered. In all cases, a transfer function was necessary to accommodate the differences in stiffness properties due to the differences between the field and the laboratory compaction methods...|$|E

A dedicated suspension system has been designed and realized in order to achieve the test article free free boundary conditions. The Ground Vibration test has been carried out in order to characterize the experimental dynamic model of the vehicle by using both the Phase Resonance (Normal Mode) and the Phase Separation techniques. A correlation analysis between the experimental modal data and the numerical results has been performed.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of masonry heritage {{buildings in}} Malta subjected to seismic {{action is a}} major risk in conserving such buildings. This is because Malta lies on a seismic zone which was subjected to high intensity earthquakes in the past (Galea, 2007). Many of the existing masonry heritage buildings were subjected to major earthquakes of 1693, 1743 and 1856, with repairs ranging from minor repairs to partial rebuilding (Abela, 1969; Galea, 2007).

40|$|This paper draws {{together}} some important lessons from a compartment fire test conducted by BRE in the full-scale eight storey steel building at Cardington. The experiment is briefly described, {{and the main}} structural observations are highlighted. A <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> of the fire compartment, using the nonlinear analysis program ADAPTIC, is then discussed. The numerical analysis employs a grillage to model the composite floor slab, and uses a one-dimensional element to model the supporting steel beams and columns. Detailed consideration of the numerical model illustrates the importance of accounting for thermal expansion effects, and leads to the identification of a load carrying mechanism at full temperature in which both the floor slab and the composite beam play an important role. A sensitivity study is then carried out in which characteristic sizes of various components and strengths of the different steel and concrete materials are varied, {{and the influence of}} such variations on the floor system response is investigated. This not only highlights the relative importance of various components in resisting the floor loading, but also sheds considerable light on the extent of plasticity developed within the various materials over the structure. Finally, several implications of the present experimental and numerical findings towards an improved design procedure, which accounts for the interaction between the floor slab and the composite beam at elevated temperature, are discussed...|$|E

This study initially attempts to quantify the forces acting on an existing WPU due to a tsunami bore impact. Surge and bore heights of 2 m, 5 m and 10 m are used to compute the forces using the commercially available full 3 D Navier Stokes equation solver FLOW 3 D. The applicability of FLOW 3 D to solve these types of problems is examined by comparing results obtained from the numerical simulations to those determined by small scale laboratory experiments. The simulated tsunami forces on the WPU are input into a simplified <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> of the WPU to determine its dynamic response. The tsunami force is also used to obtain base excitation which when applied on the WPU would be equivalent dynamically to the tsunami forces acting on it. This base excitation is useful to obtain the response of the WPU experimentally, the setup for which is available at University of California, San Diego's (UCSD) Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table (LHPOST). The facility allows full scale experimental setup capable of subjecting a 65 kW Nordtank wind turbine to random base excitations. A stress analysis of turbine tower cross section is performed in order to assess the structural integrity of the WPU. It has been determined that the WPU is unsafe for bore/surge heights above 5 m. It has also been postulated that the structural responses could be considerable in case of the taller multi megawatt wind power units of present day...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the soil restraint on pipelines due to relative pipe/soil movements is important to assess the pipeline's strain response during large ground displacements. The interaction between soil and pipeline can affect serviceability and integrity of pipelines. [...] Current engineering practice for pipe/soil interaction {{is based on an}} idealized pipeline and soil <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> that evaluates a pipelines mechanical response using beam elements and soil behavior using discrete spring system. The load-displacement relationships are provided in the state of practice for principal directions (i. e. longitudinal, lateral horizontal, vertical upward and vertical downward). [...] Recent studies have indicated that in complex pipe/soil relative movements (e. g. axial-lateral or lateral-vertical directions) assuming no interaction among the loads applied to the pipe at different directions is not valid. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} more advanced numerical tools and engineering guidelines to assess the pipeline's response in complex loading conditions and reduce technical uncertainty. [...] This thesis has investigated the complex soil failure processes and load transfer mechanisms during nonlinear, oblique pipeline/soil interaction events associated with large permanent ground deformations. The oblique loading events considered include combined axial-lateral and axial-vertical (upward) relative pipeline/soil displacements in frictional soils, and lateral-vertical pipeline/soil interactions in both frictional and cohesive soils. [...] A series of centrifuge tests of pipelines displaced in a horizontal plane through sand have been conducted for different relative angles between the pipe longitudinal axis and the transverse lateral loading direction. A three-dimensional continuum finite element model was developed using ABAQUS/Standard (Hibbitt et al. 2005) software. The numerical model is validated against experimental results and is used to extend the physical investigation results through parametric studies. [...] Interaction diagrams that characterize the coupled soil load-displacement mechanisms were developed and compared with other yield surfaces in the public domain literature. Alternative soil-spring formulations that account for coupled soil deformation mechanisms during oblique pipeline/soil interaction events have been proposed based on interaction diagrams. The effects of this alternative soil-spring formulation on pipelines responses via structural finite element models are shown and discussed in Appendix B of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in performing modal analysis is the identification of different modes occurring at close natural frequencies. In this paper it is proposed to face such problem by an original application of the Modal Assurance Criterion, that is typically used to verify the reliability of <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> by evaluating the correspondence between numerical and experimental mode shapes. To properly apply the Modal Assurance Criterion, experimental mode shapes must be retrieved acquiring data at {{a high number of}} experimental points suitably distributed {{on the surface of the}} structure.

To overcome such difficulties Speckle Interferometry techniques can be used.

40|$|Real-time hybrid {{simulation}} (RTHS) {{has become}} a recognized methodology for isolating and evaluating performance of critical structural components under potentially catastrophic events such as earthquakes. Although RTHS is efficient in its utilization of equipment and space compared to traditional testing methods such as shake table testing, laboratory resources {{may not always be}} available in one location to conduct appropriate large-scale experiments. Consequently, distributed systems, capable of connecting multiple RTHS setups located at numerous geographically distributed facilities through information exchange, become essential. This dissertation focuses on the development, evaluation and validation of a new distributed RTHS (dRTHS) platform enabling integration of physical and numerical components of RTHS in geographically distributed locations over the Internet. ^ One significant challenge for conducting successful dRTHS over the Internet is sustaining real-time communication between test sites. The network is not consistent and variations in the Quality of Service (QoS) are expected. Since dRTHS is delay-sensitive by nature, a fixed transmission rate with minimum jitter and latency in the network traffic should be maintained during an experiment. A Smith predictor can compensate network delays, but requires use of a known dead time for optimal operation. The platform proposed herein is developed to mitigate the aforementioned challenge. An easily programmable environment is provided based on MATLAB/xPC. In this method, (i) a buffer is added to the simulation loop to minimize network jitter and stabilize the transmission rate, and (ii) a routine is implemented to estimate the network time delay on-the-fly for the optimal operation of the Smith predictor. ^ The performance of the proposed platform is investigated through a series of numerical and experimental studies. An illustrative demonstration is conducted using a three story structure equipped with an MR damper. The structure is tested on the shake table and its global responses are compared to RTHS and dRTHS configurations where the physical MR damper and <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> are tested in local and geographically distributed laboratories. ^ The main contributions of this research are twofold: (1) dRTHS is validated as a feasible testing methodology, alternative to traditional and modern testing techniques such as shake table testing and RTHS, and (ii) the proposed platform serves as a viable environment for researchers to develop, evaluate and validate their own tools, investigate new methods to conduct dRTHS and advance the research in this area to the limits. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{excavation}} for the 53 -story {{reinforced concrete}} One Museum Park West building (OMPW) in Chicago was constructed using combined support systems. The building {{was supported by}} caissons and a perimeter wall formed by secant piles which transitioned to tangent piles below {{the bottom of the}} cut. After installing the perimeter wall and deep foundations for the building, the excavation for the reinforced concrete central core was supported by a circular cofferdam made of sheet piles and steel ring beams. This excavation was made using conventional bottom-up excavation techniques. Â The excavation {{for the rest of the}} building was made using a top-down method and was laterally braced with reinforced concrete floor slabs structurally connected to the secant pile walls and the reinforced concrete core. Field performance data during construction of the OMPW basements were collected with settlement points, inclinometers and strain gages installed in the concrete basement slabs. Significant settlements were observed adjacent to the excavation during wall and deep foundation installation, central core construction and top-down excavation. The influence of concrete material time-dependence of the floor slabs on the performance during top-down excavation is evaluated and a method for the separation of temperature-related strains from the excavation-induced strains in the concrete is described. Â The construction of the basements is simulated with a 3 D <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> to study the influence of the concrete material time-dependence of the floor slabs in the excavation-induced movements resulting from top-down construction. Computed strains in the floor slabs are compared with the observed performance data collected from the strain gages. For use in numerical simulation of the entire excavation process, hypoplasticity constitutive parameters for clays (HC model) at the element test level were calibrated with tests conducted on high quality block samples obtained from the excavation of Block 37 project in Chicago. They included oedometer tests, bender element measurements, and triaxial tests following different stress probes, and were further refined with seismic cone penetration results. Â The entire OMPW excavation is simulated with the calibrated parameters with a fully coupled-flow deformation, three-dimensional finite element model. Influence of the construction of secant pile walls, concrete material time-dependence, and nonlinear concrete behavior of the perimeter pile walls on the performance of the OMPW excavation is determined. Conclusions about top-down construction are drawn in light of the measured and simulated performance of the OMPW excavation.

40|$|The {{development}} of new aircraft requires {{the evaluation of the}} aeroelastic stability to avoid the phenomenon of flutter, a self-excited oscillation of the airframe. Since the rational analysis of the flutter stability comprises coupled simulations using <b>numerical</b> <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> and unsteady aerodynamic loads, the accomplishment is complex and the implementations must be checked for their validity by comparison of analytical and experimental results. In the so-called Ground Vibration Test (GVT) the natural modes, eigenfrequencies and damping ratios of the prototype aircraft are identified using classical Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) methods. Depending on the complexity of the new design, conducting such a test requires a time slot of several days shortly before the first flight. Consequently, there is an ongoing need to reduce the testing time to improve the availability of the aircraft prototype. This paper addresses the application of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) methods during the GVT of an aircraft, which might cut down the efforts in time and labour. An automatically running fast implementation of the Stochastic Subspace Identification method (SSI) is introduced, which analyses the output acceleration response of the airframe randomly excited by modal shakers. The identification process is specified in detail for a glider aircraft, where acceleration time series must be evaluated to generate the stabilization diagram. To isolate the physical mode shapes from the mathematical poles, a pole-weighted Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) is evaluated for several model orders to clean the stabilization diagram. Since the process needs no further operator interaction, it is suitable for monitoring airframe vibrations of the aircraft in flight, provided that the changes in flight conditions are significantly slower than the duration of the vibration periods considered. For the sucess of the methods, the OMA requirements should be fulfilled, i. e. the excitation of aircraft should be non-deterministic with broad-band spectra. Such conditions are provided by atmospheric turbulence excitation and/or pilot control inputs. The presented autonomous process is applied to a simulated Flight Vibration Test (FVT) of an research aircraft with real-time modal identification where changes of eigenfrequencies and damping ratios are tracked with changes in flight conditions...|$|R

40|$|Despite a {{large volume}} of literature, there has been {{relatively}} little <b>numerical</b> use of <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> when trying to decompose observed wage changes resulting from joint trade and technology shocks into portions attributable to each source. This paper highlights a series of difficulties with the numerical performance of widely used theoretical structures for decomposition experiments, which raise questions as to their suitability for this purpose. For small open economies, the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin-type model implemented with convenient functional forms (Cobb-Douglas, CES) reveals problems of specialisation unless the price changes accompanying trade shocks are small. As a result, this model is typically unable to accommodate large international price changes in performing decompositions. The model can also yield wide ranges for decomposition from alternative parameterisations consistent with the same wage change. In addition, as Leamer (1994) has argued, the structure can only meaningfully accommodate sector-biased rather than factor-biased technical change in the small open economy case. A differentiated goods model which generalises Heckscher-Ohlin removes problems of specialisation {{and is able to}} accommodate large price and wage changes, bu...|$|R

The large proportion of NH 3 in the ice mass inhibits the formation of the dense crystalline phase II of H 2 O ice at the satellite's centre. This may explain the absence of compressional features on the surface. The favoured model of Rhea has a chemically uniform interior and is very cold. The satellite is nearly isodense and the predicted value of the axial moment-of-inertia factor is C/MR^ 2 = 0. 399 +/- 0. 004.

40|$|Abstract: I {{report a}} model for the {{formation}} of Saturnâ€™s family of mid-sized icy moons to coincide with the first flypast of Rhea by the Cassini spacecraft on 2005 November 26. It is proposed that the moons had condensed from a concentric family of orbiting gas rings that were shed some 4. 66109 yr ago by the proto-Saturnian (hereafter p-Sat) cloud. The p-Sat cloud is made up of gas and residual grains of the gas ring that was shed by the proto-Solar cloud (hereafter PSC) at Saturnâ€™s orbit. The bulk of the condensate within this proto-Solar ring accumulates to form Saturnâ€™s central core of mass ~ 10 â€“ 20 M (M = Earth mass). The process of formation of Saturnâ€™s solid core thus provides an opportunity for the p-Sat cloud to become depleted in rock and water ice relative to the usual solar abundances of these materials. Nitrogen, which exists as uncondensing N 2 in the PSC and as NH 3 in the p-Sat cloud, retains its solar abundance relative to H 2. If the depletion factor of solids relative to gas is zdep = 0. 25, as suggested by the low mass of Rhea relative to solar abundance expectations, the mass-percent ratio of NH 3 to H 2 O in the dense p-Sat cloud is 36 : 64. <b>Numerical</b> and <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> for Rhea are constructed {{on the basis of a}} â€˜cosmogonicâ€™ bulk chemical composition of hydrated rock (mass fraction 0. 385), H 2 O ice (0. 395), and NH 3 ice (0. 220).

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to conduct the {{structural}} analysis and construct the static <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> of the electricity market system. Since the components responsible {{for the construction of}} the electricity market system are the technological and commercial subsystems, their <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> are presented in the form of directed graphs according to the stages of reforming the electricity sector and imposed models of the commodity electricity market. The <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> of the technological subsystem is built on technical and industrial languages in the form of planar graphs of objective and subjective <b>structural</b> <b>models.</b> The <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> of the commercial subsystem is built on trade and finance languages in the form of planar graphs for non-competitive models and non-planar graphs for competitive models of the commodity electricity market. It is shown that the built <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> of the technological and commercial subsystems can be combined, thereby creating multigraphs of the <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> of the electricity market system. ????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ??????????????. ????????? ?????????????, ?????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??????????????, ????????? ??????????????? ? ???????????? ??????????, ?? ??????????? ?????? ???????????? ? ???? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ????? ??????????????. ??????????? ?????? ??????????????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ? ???????????????? ????? ? ???? ??????? ?????? ????????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ???????. ??????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ???????? ? ?????????? ????? ? ???? ??????? ?????? ??? ?????????????? ??????? ? ????????? ?????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ????? ??????????????. ????????, ??? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????????????? ? ???????????? ????????? ????? ??????????, ???????? ??? ????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ??????????????...|$|R

The key issue is to provide conditions which support the interpretation of the sensitivity of investment to liquidity variables such as cash flow as a measure of financial constraints. The <b>structural</b> <b>modelling</b> of investment facing financial constraints is also limited by the <b>structural</b> <b>modelling</b> of the forces driving investment dynamics such as adjustment costs, which has not been so successful empirically.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} posed a serious {{challenge}} {{to the ability of}} <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> to explain changes in corporate credit spreads: <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> variables explain {{only a small portion of}} credit spread variation and the unexplained portion has one dominant latent factor related to supply/demand shocks. Studying 2, 375 corporate bonds over 1990 through 2003, we provide new evidence supporting the use of <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> in corporate bond pricing. We show that the poor performance of <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> variables occurs in high-grade bonds. For this segment, the explanatory power of <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> variables is 35 %, firm-level variables play no role, and a single latent factor dominates the unexplained variation. For low-grade bonds, however, the explanatory power rises to 67 %, firm-level fundamentals are important, and no latent factor is apparent. We also suggest a more comprehensive set of <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> variables that build on recent innovations in asset pricing. Our suggested set captures most of the variation in credit spread changes and subsumes the explanatory power of th...|$|R
50|$|<b>Structural</b> {{equation}} <b>modeling</b> (SEM) {{includes a}} diverse set of mathematical models, computer algorithms, and statistical methods that fit networks of constructs to data. SEM includes confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, partial least squares path modeling, and latent growth modeling. The concept {{should not be}} confused with the related concept of <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> in econometrics, nor with <b>structural</b> <b>models</b> in economics. <b>Structural</b> equation <b>models</b> are often used to assess unobservable 'latent' constructs. They often invoke a measurement model that defines latent variables using one or more observed variables, and a <b>structural</b> <b>model</b> that imputes relationships between latent variables. The links between constructs of a <b>structural</b> equation <b>model</b> may be estimated with independent regression equations or through more involved approaches such as those employed in LISREL.|$|R
