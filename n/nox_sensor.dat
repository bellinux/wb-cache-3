50|$|A {{nitrogen}} oxide sensor or <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> is typically a high-temperature device built to detect {{nitrogen oxide}}s in combustion environments {{such as an}} automobile or truck tailpipe or a smokestack.|$|E
50|$|The main {{problems}} that have limited {{the development of a}} successful <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> (which are typical of many sensors) are selectivity, sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, response time, limit of detection, and cost. In addition due to the harsh environment of combustion the high gas flow rate can cool the sensor which alters the signal or it can delaminate the electrodes over time and soot particles can degrade the materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{drive to}} develop a <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> comes from {{environmental}} factors. NOx gases can cause various problems such as smog and acid rain. Many governments {{around the world have}} passed laws to limit their emissions (along with other combustion gases such as SOx (oxides of sulfur), CO (carbon monoxide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) and hydrocarbons). Companies have realized that one way of minimizing NOx emissions is to first detect them and then employ some sort of feedback loop in the combustion process, minimizing NOx production by, for example, combustion optimization or regeneration of NOx traps.|$|E
5000|$|Continental Automotive Systems/NGK produce <b>NOx</b> <b>sensors</b> for {{automotive}} {{and truck}} applications. Several automobile and related {{companies such as}} Delphi, Ford, Chrysler, and Toyota have also put extensive research into development of <b>NOx</b> <b>sensors.</b> Many academic and government labs are pushing to develop the sensors as well. The term NOx represents several forms of nitrogen oxides such as NO (nitric oxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and N2O (nitrous oxide aka laughing gas). In a gasoline engine NO {{is the most common}} form of NOx being around 93% while NO2 is around 5% and the rest is N2O. There are other forms of NOx such as N2O4 (the dimer of NO2), which only exists at lower temperatures, and N2O5, for example. However, owing to much higher combustion temperatures due to high cylinder compression and turbo or supercharging, diesel engines produce much higher engine-out NOx emissions than spark-ignition gasoline engines do. The recent availability of Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) allows the properly equipped diesel engine to emit similar values of NOx at the tailpipe compared to a typical gasoline engine with a 3-way catalyst. In addition, the diesel oxidation catalyst significantly increases the fraction of NO2 in [...] "NOx" [...] by oxidizing over 50% of NO using the excess oxygen in the diesel exhaust gases.|$|R
50|$|<b>NOx</b> <b>sensors</b> are {{extremely}} expensive {{and are in}} general used only when a compression-ignition engine is fitted with a selective catalytic-reduction (SCR) converter, or a NOx absorber catalyst in a feedback system. When fitted to an SCR system, there may be one or two sensors. When one sensor is fitted it will be pre-catalyst; when two are fitted, the second one will be post-catalyst. They are used {{for the same reasons}} and {{in the same manner as}} an oxygen sensor; the only difference is the substance being monitored.|$|R

To overcome this inconvenient, a high-sensitive sensor based on selective electrochemical reduction of NO 2 is proposed. An electrochemical cell consisting of three metallic electrodes on solid-state electrolyte (YSZ) operating under electric polarization between a gold working electrode and a platinum counter electrode allows selective NO 2 detection at 400 - 550 °C with high sensitivity, {{and without any}} significant interferences to other gases like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and also ammonia and nitrogen monoxide.

40|$|To meet future {{emission}} targets, {{it becomes}} increasingly important {{to optimize the}} synergy between engine and aftertreatment system. By using an integrated control approach minimal fluid (fuel and DEF) consumption is targeted within the constraints of emission legislation during real-world operation. In such concept, the on-line availability of engine-out NOx emission is crucial. Here, {{the use of a}} Virtual <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> can be of great added-value. Virtual sensing enables more direct and robust emission control allowing, for example, engine-out NOx determination during conditions in which the hardware sensor is not available, such as cold start conditions. Furthermore, with use of the virtual sensor, the engine control strategy can be directly based on NOx emission data, resulting in reduced response time and improved transient emission control. This paper presents the development and on-line implementation of a Virtual <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor,</b> using in-cylinder pressure as main input. The development steps from off-line modelling, calibration and validation towards real-time on-line implementation and validation will be presented in great detail.

50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperature}} of the combustion environment, only certain types of material can operate in situ.

An experimental SCR test apparatus installed on a slipstream of a Coo-per-Bessemer GMV- 4, 2 -stroke cycle {{natural gas engine}} is utilized. Ammonia (NH 3 ) feed rate control algo-rithm development is carried out. Two control algorithms are evaluated: a feed forward control algorithm, using a pre ammonia injection ceramic <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> and a feed forward plus feedback control algorithm, us-ing a pre ammonia injection ceramic <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> and post catalyst ceramic <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> to generate feedback signals.

40|$|This article {{describes}} a <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> based urea dosing control strategy for heavy-duty diesel aftertreatment systems using Selective Catalytic Reduction. The dosing control strategy comprises of a fast-response, model-based ammonia storage control system {{in combination with}} a long-timescale tailpipe-feedback module that adjusts the dosing quantity according to current aftertreatment conditions. This results in a control system that is robust to system disturbances such as biased NOx sensors and variations in AdBlue concentrations. The cross-sensitivity of the tailpipe <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> to ammonia is handled by a novel, smart signal filter that can reliably identify the contributions of NOx and NH 3 in the tailpipe sensor signal, without requiring an artificial perturbation of the dosing signal. The tailpipe feedback module compares the signal from the cross-sensitive tailpipe <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> to the modeled tailpipe sensor signal to estimate the measured and modeled NOx conversion and NH 3 slip, {{without the need for}} an NH 3 sensor. The difference between these measured and modeled quantities is used to adjust the dosing quantity to the aftertreatment system, thereby maintaining nominal performance of the aftertreatment system in the presence of disturbances. Simulation results are presented of the urea dosing control system covering a wide range of disturbances, demonstrating the robustness properties of the controlled system. The robust urea dosing control strategy was implemented on a rapid prototyping platform and tested on a state-of-the-art Euro VI engine and aftertreatment systems, confirming the expected performance and robustness properties...|$|E

40|$|The on–board {{quantification}} of {{exhaust emission}} from the internal combustion engines is of global concern {{in order to}} monitor and control release of toxic gaseous pollutants such as the oxides of nitrogen (NOx). This scenario calls for highly performing, cost–effective and long lasting gas sensors. In this regard, semiconducting metal oxides present the foremost choice of active materials for real–time detection of exhaust gases due to their low cost, good electrical properties, high sensitivity and stability at temperatures as high as > 500 °C [1]. In this work, {{we report on the}} synthesis, analytical characterization, and surface modification of metal oxide nanoparticles (ZnO–, ZrOx, InOx- NPs) for their potential application as semiconductor gas sensors. ZnO is a promising material and one of the earliest oxides studied for gas adsorption [2]. However, owing to its high working temperature and limited selectivity, ZnO did not achieve commercial success. ZrOx and InOx nanomaterials are well known active components of <b>NOx</b> <b>sensors,</b> which have shown some performance limitations –either in selectivity or in response intensity and kinetics-. To overcome these limitations, in recent years semiconductor metal oxides (MO) are being frequently modified by selected inclusions of transition metal nanoparticles, bringing their own surface reactivity characteristics to the hybrid catalyst-MO system [3]. In the present study, MO–NPs are prepared via simple and economical sol–gel methods. The surface of MO–NPs is subsequently modified by electro–chemical decoration of nanoscale gold (nano–Au), performed under surfactant stabilization conditions. Since Au nanoparticles exhibit pronounced selectivity toward NOx gases [4], the nano–Au/MO–NPs hybrids are believed to enhance the sensing properties of MO–NPs such as the selectivity and long–term stability of the nanomaterial. Both the pristine MO–NPs and the composite nano–Au/MO–NPs are calcined at temperatures > 500 °C to induce stability at the usual operating temperature of gas-sensing experiments and the effect of calcination on nanostructure and morphology is systematically studied. The as–prepared and the calcined nanomaterials are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X–ray diffraction techniques. The results demonstrate that these nanomaterials are highly stable and even ultrafine gold nanophases retain their morphology and surface chemical speciation upon annealing. The experimental evidences support further application of these composite nano–Au/MO–NPs as active elements in semiconductor <b>NOx</b> gas <b>sensors...</b>|$|R
