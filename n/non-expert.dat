25|$|On high-traction {{surfaces}} such as bitumen, or concrete, many (though not all) ABS-equipped {{cars are}} able to attain braking distances better (i.e. shorter) than those that would be possible {{without the benefit of}} ABS. In real world conditions, even an alert and experienced driver without ABS would find it difficult to match or improve on the performance of a typical driver with a modern Anti-lock Braking System-equipped vehicle. ABS reduces chances of crashing, and/or the severity of impact. The recommended technique for <b>non-expert</b> drivers in an ABS-equipped car, in a typical full-braking emergency, is to press the brake pedal as firmly as possible and, where appropriate, to steer around obstructions. In such situations, ABS will significantly reduce the chances of a skid and subsequent loss of control.|$|E
25|$|Several {{large-scale}} benchmarking {{efforts have}} been made to assess the relative quality of various current homology modeling methods. CASP is a community-wide prediction experiment that runs every two years during the summer months and challenges prediction teams to submit structural models for a number of sequences whose structures have recently been solved experimentally but have not yet been published. Its partner CAFASP has run in parallel with CASP but evaluates only models produced via fully automated servers. Continuously running experiments that do not have prediction 'seasons' focus mainly on benchmarking publicly available webservers. LiveBench and EVA run continuously to assess participating servers' performance in prediction of imminently released structures from the PDB. CASP and CAFASP serve mainly as evaluations {{of the state of the}} art in modeling, while the continuous assessments seek to evaluate the model quality that would be obtained by a <b>non-expert</b> user employing publicly available tools.|$|E
40|$|Basic perceptual {{quality of}} coded audio {{material}} is commonly evaluated using ITU-R BS- 1534 MUSHRA (Multi Stimulus with Hidden Reference and Anchors) listening tests. MUSHRA guidelines call for experienced listeners. However, {{the majority of}} consumers using the final product are no expert-listeners. Also the degree of expertise in a listening test may vary amongst listeners in the same laboratory. It {{would be useful to}} know how the audio quality evaluation differs between trained and untrained listeners and how training and actual tests should be designed in order to be as reliable as possible. To investigate the rating differences between experts and <b>non-experts,</b> we performed MUSHRA listening tests with 13 experienced and 11 inexperienced listeners using 5 speech and audio codecs delivering a wide range of basic audio quality. Except for the hidden reference, absolute ratings of <b>non-experts</b> were consistently higher than those of experts. However, rank order only rarely changed between experts and <b>non-experts.</b> For lower quality values, confidence intervals were significantly larger for <b>non-experts</b> than for experts.

2500|$|There {{are other}} species of the genus Loxosceles native to the southwestern part of the United States, {{including}} California, that may resemble the brown recluse, but these species have never been documented as medically significant.

6000|$|All {{thanks for}} your so vivid news of the {{overflow}} of Henley's gall. Ça ne pouvait manquer--ça devait venir. I have sent for the article and will write you when I've read it. I gather from you that it's really rather a striking and lurid--and so far interesting case--of long discomfortable jealousy and ranklement turned at last to posthumous (as it were!) malignity, and making the man do, coram publico, his ugly act, risking the dishonour for the assuagement. That is, {{on the part of}} a favourite of the press etc., a remarkable [...] "psychologic" [...] incident--or perhaps I'm talking in the air, from not having read the thing. I dare say, moreover, at all events, that H. did very seriously--I mean sincerely--deplore all the graces that had crept into Louis's writing--all the more that they had helped it so to be loved: he honestly thinks that L. should have written like--well, like who but Henley's self? But the whole business illustrates how life takes upon itself to give us more true and consistent examples of human unpleasantness than expectation could suggest--makes a given man, I mean, live up to his ugliness. This one's whole attitude in respect to these recent amiable commemorations of Louis--the having (I, [...] "self-conscious and alone") nothing to do with them, contained singularly the promise of some positive aggression. I have, however, this a.m., a letter from Graham Balfour (in answer to one I had written him on reading his book,) in which, speaking of Henley's paper, he says it's less bad than he expected. He apparently feared more. It's since you were here, by the way, that I've read his record, in which, as to its second volume, I found a good deal of fresh interest and charm. It seems to me, the whole thing, very neatly and tactfully done for an amateur, a <b>non-expert.</b> But, I see now that a really curious thing has happened, a [...] "case" [...] occurred much more interesting than the cas Henley. Insistent publicity, so to speak, has done its work (I only knew it was doing it, but G. B.'s book's a settler,) and Louis, qua artist, is now, definitely, the victim thereof. That is, he has superseded, personally, his books, and this last re-placement of himself so en scène (so largely by his own aid, too) has killed the literary baggage. Out of no mystery now do they issue, the creations in question--and they couldn't afford to lose it. Louis himself never understood that; he too publicly caressed and accounted for them--but I needn't insist on what I mean. As I see it, at all events, it's a strange little evolution and all taking place here, quite compactly, under one's nose.|$|E
