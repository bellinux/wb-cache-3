40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{national}} model for assessment in aged care – Commonwealth Aged Care Assessment. It builds on three background papers that {{set out a}} framework, examined overlaps at the proposed three levels of assessment and proposed useful triggers and prompts to assist information flow and referral across programs and to build a continuous record. The model has been modified with feedback from the Department of Health and Ageing and its Expert Clinical Reference Group for this project. It outlines the components of a recommended <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>system</b> needs to include components to ensure that assessment information contributes substantially {{to the development of}} the sector over time including a proposed data sharing model, a data repository, linkages to local systems and assessment role delineation (with associated training materials linked to assessor competencies). Assessor competencies and credentialing will be important components of a <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>system</b> as these enable service providers to trust the quality of the assessments that they receive. The initial contact is the start of an assessment system that captures the person’s needs and goals of care and other important characteristics over the full period that they require services. Needs assessment in aged care should be considered as a continuous or multi-tiered and multi-staged process, beginning with an initial assessment when a client requests an aged care service. It assists the referral of people to appropriate services and other levels of assessment. The information gathered by service providers and assessors from people should build on the initial collection of information and form an important source of data...|$|E

In this paper I reflect {{on the impact of}} a government-funded programme in Scotland, Assessment is for Learning (AifL), and attempts that were made to move it from a small-scale pilot into all Scottish schools. In particular, I analyse approaches to changing professional thinking and consider the importance of the wider educational context on development activity.

40|$|International audienceLakes in Europe {{are subject}} to {{multiple}} anthropogenic pressures, such as eutrophication, habitat degradation and alien species which are frequently inter-related. Therefore, effective assessment methods addressing multiple pressures are needed. In addition, these systems have to be harmonised (i. e. intercalibrated) to achieve common management objectives across Europe. Assessments of fish communities inform environmental policies on ecological conditions integrating the impacts of multiple pressures. However, {{the challenge is to}} ensure consistency in ecological assessments through time, across ecosystem types and across jurisdictional boundaries. To overcome the serious comparability issues between <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe, a total anthropogenic pressure intensity (TAPI) index was developed as a weighed combination of most common pressures in European lakes that is validated against 10 national fish based water quality <b>assessment</b> <b>systems</b> using data from 556 lakes. Multi-pressure indices showed significantly higher correlations with fish indices than single-pressure indices. The best-performing index combines eutrophication, hydromorphological alterations and human use intensity of lakes. For specific lake types also biological pressures may constitute an important additional pressure. The best-performing index showed a strong correlation with eight fish-based <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>systems.</b> The developed best performing index can be used in lake management for assessing total anthropogenic pressure on lake ecosystems and creates a benchmark for comparison of fish assessments independent of fish community composition, size structure and fishing-gear. We argue that fish-based multiple-pressure assessment tools should be seen as complementary to single-pressure tools offering the major advantage of integrating direct and indirect effects of multiple pressures over large scales of space and time...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the implications for}} New Zealand secondary drama educators of {{the introduction of the}} National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) assessment in drama. Traditionally a ―fringe‖ subject with little academic credibility, drama has moved to the mainstream of secondary education with the introduction of NCEA assessment. This has carried with it improvements in terms of the recognition of drama as a secondary subject; however, it has also required a re-evaluation of pedagogical priorities for drama practitioners. The data which formed the basis of this research were collected through interviews with drama educators throughout New Zealand. A hermeneutic approach was employed in the analysis of data {{in order to understand the}} extent to which the teachers‘ priorities for teaching and learning were challenged by NCEA. With no pre-existing models of national assessment in drama on which to scaffold the transition to NCEA, the introduction of NCEA assessment has necessitated the formulation of an entirely new system derived from a wide range of existing practices and approaches. In this study sites of tension were identified in the interface between the historic practices of drama education and the requirements of a <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>system.</b> Drama is an open and creative subject. Assessment systems, on the other hand, are necessarily defined by criteria designed to meet the objectives of national curricula. This thesis explores teachers‘ perceptions of the pedagogical challenges associated with arriving at a synthesis of these competing discourses in drama education. The main findings from this study indicate that the personal ideologies of the interviewees, which had been influenced by the particular nature of the historical development of drama education, had a direct effect on their pedagogical decisions in the classroom. The participants in the study evinced an intrinsic commitment to nurturing student creativity through drama education by utilising a combination of kinaesthetic, interpersonal and linguistic approaches to teaching and learning. Interviewees perceived the existence of sites of tension in the process of assimilating the creative and explorative features of drama education into a prescribed schedule of curriculum and assessment requirements. These included challenges associated with structure and management of the assessment schedule and the workload generated by the implementation of NCEA. The teachers in this study acknowledged that the introduction of NCEA assessment in drama had resulted in a shift from a marginalised position in New Zealand education to one of recognition as a mainstream secondary subject. This change in the status of drama education had generated increased enrolments in the subject; participants in the study, however, discerned a lack of appropriate pre-service teacher education in drama which would ensure its continued success in the future...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} a stand-alone {{description of how}} the national model for assessment in aged care was received when reviewed by the relevant reference groups and when demonstrated to experienced assessors. It covers the preliminary testing {{of a system that}} operates across three levels to guide the people requesting assistance to the set of aged care services that they need. The overall aim of the new assessment system has been to simplify and streamline information so it {{can be used in a}} practical way in the field to plan how best to meet those needs. The purpose of collecting assessment information is to differentiate between people who: -Have no problems and need no services -Have minor problems (i. e., low need), and need some basic services (e. g., meals, home maintenance), but do not need a comprehensive assessment (Basic Services: Level 1 Assessment) -Have mild to moderate problems and require access to more than a couple of basic services and may require services such as personal care (Basic Plus Services: Level 2 Assessment) -Have a moderate to high problems and/ or complex needs and require a comprehensive assessment (Packaged Care - CACP, EACH, Transition Care /Residential Care Services: Level 3 Assessment). The usability testing and ECRG comments highlighted that assessment information can also be used to produce 2 ̆ 7 change scores 2 ̆ 7 at a subsequent point of re-assessment and to allow assessors and service providers to more efficiently 2 ̆ 7 inter-operate 2 ̆ 7 across existing aged care programs and with other assessment systems. A wealth of relevant data is already being collected through Medicare-remunerated GPs 2 ̆ 7 assessments, in hospital and community health systems, in rehabilitation units and in palliative care and in outpatient clinics, that are of direct relevance to the new national aged care assessment system. The overall model and the components of a recommended <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>system</b> have been developed with feedback from the Department of Health and Ageing and its Expert Clinical Reference Group, as well as with feedback from experienced assessors. The initial usability testing of the tool with assessors has resulted in some minor revisions as well as some practical ideas to build into any subsequent stages. The result of this first stage of development is a system that is judged by these initial methods of usability testing to be fit for purpose. The electronic version of the tool that was tested is included in Appendix 1 and the resulting recommended changes are shown in Appendix 2. The next step is expected to be more extensive field testing that should be designed to deal with the wider implementation issues. These are likely to include a proposed data sharing model, a data repository function to enable more extensive empirical testing, examining the linkages to other systems and assessment role delineation (with associated training materials linked to assessor competencies) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{socio-cultural}} {{study investigated}} the assessment of group composing for a secondary school qualification, and the implications such assessment might have for teacher practice. It examines {{the validity of the}} contributions of group-composing students and classroom music teachers to the common purposes of learning, teaching, and assessment. The research was carried out in two cycles of practitioner inquiry where the researcher worked in collaboration with two teachers in their respective secondary schools to teach and assess group composing for New Zealand’s secondary school qualification, the National Certificates of Educational Achievement (NCEA). A wide range of data were gathered during the collaboration, including teacher and student interviews, recorded discussions, classroom materials and assessment documents, resulting in a rich data set. In the classroom, conceptual models of composing and creativity were used to bridge the discourses of formal and informal music learning, with the aim of engaging the students as thoughtful, independent artists, able to communicate their creative intentions clearly to each other, and to their teacher. During data analysis, cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) was used to analyse and interpret the complexities and contradictions associated with group composing and its assessment. A significant finding is that the incorporation of group composing into established senior secondary music programmes required teachers to make changes to their practice. The teachers’ experiences as learners, musicians and teachers, and their perceptions of professional identity, were found to be key factors in {{the extent to which they}} were able to make those changes. If the assessment of group composing was to be valid, then all participants, teachers and group composers alike, needed to engage with each other in the closely interrelated practices of composing, teaching and assessment. Multiple forms of musical authorship, particularly those of rhythm-section or novice players, proved to be problematic for the assessment system. What were regarded as valid contributions by some members of a group-composing ensemble were not necessarily regarded as valid by the teacher. Arriving at a final grade for each group-composing student not only required grading the music but also entailed the evaluation of portfolios of student achievement data, derived from collaborative interactions within the group. The teacher needed to interpret a complex mix of interpersonal, musical and social relationships among students. Therefore, a broad, socio-cultural assessment perspective was required, necessitating holistic, rather than atomised, judgments to be made across the entire compositional process. This thesis offers possible insights into how music teachers might reconcile the validity demands of a <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>system</b> with the considerable challenges posed by the ethical requirement to meet the diverse needs of their students. It adds to on-going debates in the literature about the nature of disciplinary knowledge in music education, what constitutes music curriculum in the 21 st century, and how such curriculum knowledge might be assessed. It also throws new light upon the complexities and challenges of conducting collaborative action research in schools...|$|E

Intermediate response was found for a cyanobacterial bloom intensity index (Cyano), the Ellenberg macrophyte index and a multimetric index for {{benthic invertebrates}} (MMI). The latter also responded to hydromorphological pressure. The metrics provide information on primary and secondary impacts of eutrophication in the pelagic and the littoral zone of lakes. Several of these metrics were used as common metrics in the intercalibration of <b>national</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>systems</b> or have been incorporated directly into the national systems. New biological metrics have been developed to assess hydromorphological pressures, based on aquatic macrophyte responses to water level fluctuations, and on macroinvertebrate responses to morphological modifications of lake shorelines. These metrics thus enable the quantification of biological impacts of hydromorphological pressures in lakes. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Katz was {{appointed}} {{for two years}} to lead IoM’s Committee on Nursing Home Regulation. He facilitated {{a comprehensive review of}} current practice and care guidelines to base the committee’s recommendations on science as far as possible. Katz's committee recommended sweeping changes to the standard of care, audit procedures, and better enforcement of quality assurance practices by both nursing home facilities and oversight organizations. The IoM committee recommendations were incorporated into OBRA-87 legislation, which was signed into law in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. Katz’s recommendations also paved the way towards the 1991 mandate, as part of the Minimum Data Set legislation, that requires nursing homes to complete the <b>national</b> resident <b>assessment</b> <b>system</b> to ensure quality of life for residents.|$|R
40|$|With the {{developing}} awareness {{on the natural}} attributes of rivers and the problems of river ecosystems, the objectives of water environment management should extend from single water quality protection to the overall management of aquatic ecosystems. River health assessment {{can be used as}} a water environment management tool, which is important to sustainable management of watershed and regional ecological protection. However, the river health concept hasn't been introduced into environmental measurement systems, and a set of <b>national</b> river health <b>assessment</b> <b>system</b> is absent in China. As a result, in this paper, the significance of river health to water environmental management is discussed, and the methods and recommendations on building Chinese river health <b>assessment</b> <b>systems</b> are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Academics {{are under}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to demonstrate the}} impact of their research with external actors. Some <b>national</b> research <b>assessment</b> <b>systems</b> have mandated academics to document their impact on non-academic actors, and linked research funding to assessments of these impacts. Although there has been considerable debate around the design of these systems, little is known about how academics perceive the value of impact against more conventional academic outputs, such as publications. Using multisource data, including a large-scale survey of UK business and management academics, this paper explores the individual and institutional factors that explain an individual’s preference for impact versus publication. The results show that academics display a preference for impact over publications, even when that impact is not associated with requirements of the <b>assessment</b> <b>system</b> in terms of rigour of the underpinning research. The preference for impact over publications is heightened by organization tenure, non-academic work experience, intrinsic career motivations and research-intensive contexts, while it is weakened by academic influence, extrinsic career motives and academic rank. We explore the implications of these findings for the design of research <b>assessment</b> <b>systems</b> and academics’ reactions to them...|$|R
50|$|The {{exposure}} of high-profile corruption {{cases in the}} media and the limited political engagement have contributed to poor public perception of political corruption in Portugal. Recurring corruption scandals involving high-level politicians, local administrators and businesses abusing public funds have revealed that safeguards to counter corruption and abuse of power have been relatively inefficient, according to the <b>National</b> Integrity <b>System</b> <b>Assessment</b> 2012 by the Portuguese chapter of Transparency International (TIAC).|$|R
50|$|According to Eurobarometer 2012, {{connections}} between business and politics {{are the most}} cited reason behind corruption and almost one-third of surveyed citizens share this perception. This {{is supported by the}} <b>National</b> Integrity <b>System</b> <b>Assessment</b> 2012, which notes that collusion between businesses and public authorities is especially prevalent in the public procurement sector. This sector is sensitive to irregularities and the report recommends the government to strengthen regulations and supervision of public procurements.|$|R
50|$|Political {{corruption}} is acknowledged {{as a significant}} problem by many observers, but some believe its size has been overstated by international media. According to the <b>National</b> Integrity <b>System</b> <b>Assessment</b> 2012 report by Transparency International-Greece, the problem of corruption in Greece is the confluence of many factors, including weak enforcement of the law, a lack of audits, the absence of codes of conduct, the non-transparency of government activities, an inefficient bureaucracy, government impunity and broad discretionary powers, {{and a lack of}} public awareness.|$|R
40|$|National {{integrity}} systems {{function to}} ensure that power is exercised {{in a manner that}} is true to the values, purposes and duties for which that power is entrusted to, or held by, institutions and individual office-holders. This report by Dr AJ Brown looks at how different elements of <b>National</b> Integrity <b>Systems</b> <b>Assessment</b> (NISA) interact, which combinations of institutions and reforms make for a strong integrity system, and how Australia’s integrity systems should evolve to ensure coherence, not chaos in the way public integrity is maintained...|$|R
