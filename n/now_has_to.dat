5|$|In Mumbai and Goa, Kaira (Alia Bhatt) is a {{promising}} cinematographer {{who wishes to}} direct her own films. Blunt and cynical, she is most comfortable when with her three best friends, Fatima (Ira Dubey), Jackie (Yashaswini Dayama) and Ganju (Gautmik). Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra (Kunal Kapoor), a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord turns {{her out of her}} apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for her shift to Goa, where she <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> grudgingly live with her parents (Aban Deohans and Atul Kale) with whom she has some issues. She ends up spending many sleepless nights in unhappiness and uncertainty.|$|E

Mill anticipates the {{objection}} that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a means to happiness, eventually, it becomes part of someone's happiness and is then desired as an end in itself.|$|E

25|$|Fassbinder scored {{his first}} {{domestic}} commercial success with The Merchant of Four Seasons (Händler der vier Jahreszeiten, 1971). The film portrays {{a married couple}} who are fruit sellers. Hans faces rejection from his family after he violently assaults his wife for not bending to his will. She leaves him, but after he suffers a heart attack they reunite, though he <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> employ other men. His restricted ability to function leads him to ponder his own futility. He literally drinks himself to death.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pump out not only the volume of blood {{that goes into the}} aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.|$|E

50|$|On this basis, Directive 88/295 amended all {{previous}} public supplies directives. Open tendering procedures were now the norm and negotiated procedures were allowed only in exceptional circumstances.

National technical standards <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be mutually recognised, and the exempted sectors were more clearly defined.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{the central}} {{government}} revised the law on the control of infectious diseases in March 2004. The revision provides instructions to tackle infectious-disease outbreaks, improve the reporting of infectious diseases, implement interventions to control the spread of such diseases, provide clinical services, and fund the control of infectious diseases. This law directly benefited tuberculosis control by addressing the under-reporting of tuberculosis by health facilities. Tuberculosis <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be reported to local public-health authorities within 24 hours. Because failure to report is now a crime, hospitals have begun to take the reporting of tuberculosis very seriously.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with him, since he <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{live in poverty}} and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date – it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, they gained one day upon crossing the International Date Line. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake, and Fogg hurries to the Reform Club {{just in time to}} meet his deadline and win the wager. Having already spent the bulk of the £20,000 during the journey, he divides the remaining money between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.|$|E

Let's re-run {{the entire history of}} South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 2011, Super Rugby was a {{round-robin}} competition {{where each}} team played {{with every other}} team once; a team had six or seven home games, and six or seven away games each. The winner received four competition points; if the game was a draw two points were awarded to each team. The Rugby union bonus points system was also used, where any team scoring four or more tries, and/or losing by seven points or less, receives an extra competition point. In 2016, the try bonus changed. A team <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> score three more tries than their opponents. The top four teams {{at the end of}} the round-robin phase then played semi-finals – the first placed team hosting the fourth placed team, and the second placed team hosting the third placed team. The two winners then played the final at the home ground of the top surviving seed. There were 91 regular season games in total. Games were held over 14weekends with each team receiving one bye.|$|E
500|$|In 1992 Megadeth {{released}} Countdown to Extinction, {{which contained}} songs with compact, accessible structures that resulted with strong sales and significant radio airplay. 1994's Youthanasia and 1997's Cryptic Writings followed a similar route, receiving platinum and gold certification respectively, {{with the latter}} spawning three rock-radio hits. Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band's commercial breakthrough, said: [...] "I {{think a lot of}} our success <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the fact that}} we're willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don't get the opportunity to go into the market with educated strategy.

500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E

500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is {{that we live in a}} time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E

To do this the EPA is required to establish new science polices to assess the risks. [...] The FQPA requires the EPA to set tolerances for pesticide uses that fall under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (emergency exemptions).|$|E
2500|$|On February 16, 2012, {{explaining}} {{the rationale behind}} the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman {{said in an interview}} during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the Bhagavad Gita As It Is declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, “it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [...] However, {{the problem is that the}} Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason.” Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, [...] "That is why the prosecutor <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> stand up for his position in the appellate court".|$|E
2500|$|The Legion of Super Heroes {{animated}} series premiered on Kids' WB! (the Saturday Morning kids' {{block on}} The CW network) in September 2006. The show's {{premise is that}} the Legion travels {{back in time to}} recruit Superman in their fight against crime in the 31st century, but they go a little too far back and recruit Superman before he has had a chance to fully develop his powers. Superman, the inspiration for the Legion, <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> learn from them how to be a hero. Season 1 focused on a [...] "core" [...] team consisting of Bouncing Boy, Brainiac 5, Lightning Lad, Phantom Girl, Saturn Girl, Superman, and Timber Wolf, while other Legionnaires such as Cosmic Boy, Colossal Boy, Ferro Lad, Matter-Eater Lad, and Triplicate Girl appeared occasionally. Classic Legion villains such as the Fatal Five, Starfinger, and the Sun-Eater were included, and other Legionnaires, including Blok, Dream Girl, Element Lad, Shrinking Violet, Star Boy, Sun Boy, and Tyroc, made cameo appearances. Season 2 takes place two {{years after the end of}} Season 1. New members, such as Chameleon Boy, have joined the Legion.
