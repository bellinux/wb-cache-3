25|$|Under Principal Railway Architect John Sidney Egan, new station {{designs were}} {{prepared}} for the quadruplication project. An overall concept for the form {{and structure of the}} station buildings was established, but the designs were <b>non-standardised,</b> and took account of platform width, which varied from station to station. Architect Jan Kral was responsible for the Graceville and Chelmer designs and signed-off on the drawings for Sherwood station as Acting Principal Architect. He was born in Poland and studied at Stuttgart University after the war. He came to Australia in 1950 and was employed by the Queensland Railways the following year, initially as a draftsman, becoming a Senior Architect by 1958. While the designs were all somewhat different, they shared a form derived from a long, thin building, rectangular in plan and made with a regular procession of columns, surmounted by a butterfly roof that cantilevered over each platform side to shelter waiting and alighting rail passengers. A number of standardised plans for Railways Department butterfly-roofed awnings were developed and used between 1949 and 1960, many having been designed by Bevis Thelwall. A common palette of materials including reinforced concrete, steel and exposed brickwork was used. The steel work was all prefabricated at the Northgate workshops. Graceville Station was the first of these station fit-outs to be completed within the quadruplication project between Corinda and Roma Street.|$|E

50|$|Very often RA {{is used as}} a {{moderator}} variable to look at differences between studies. Information on allegiance is not typically reported by the term ‘allegiance’ in original reports. Moreover, the definition of allegiance differs from study to study. Even if some authors of meta-analysis are familiar with this factor and are willing to investigate RA effects, they have to rely on <b>non-standardised</b> measuring methods like reprint analysis (i.e., analysis of the publication for the presence of attributes that may hint at allegiance) based on the limited information available in the published articles.|$|E

50|$|The {{topic of}} the {{teaching}} of regional languages in public primary and secondary schools is controversial. Proponents of the measure state {{that it would be}} necessary for the preservation of those languages and to show respect to the local culture. Opponents contend that local languages are often <b>non-standardised</b> (thus making curricula difficult), of dubious practical usefulness (since most are spoken by a small number of people, without any sizable corpus of publications) and that the curriculum and funding of public schools are already too strained. The topic also leads to wider controversial questions of autonomy of the régions. Regarding other languages, English, Spanish, Italian and German are the most commonly studied foreign languages in French schools.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, {{granting}} a 1981 petition from Ford Motor Company, the 44-year-old US headlamp {{regulations were}} amended to allow replaceable-bulb, nonstandard-shape, architectural headlamps with aerodynamic lenses that could {{for the first}} time be plastic. This allowed the first US-market car since 1939 with replaceable bulb headlamps: the 1984 Lincoln Mark VII. These composite headlamps were sometimes referred to as [...] "Euro" [...] headlamps, since aerodynamic headlamps were common in Europe. Though conceptually similar to European headlamps with <b>non-standardised</b> shape and replaceable-bulb construction, these headlamps conform to the SAE headlamp standards of US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, and not the internationalised European safety standards used outside North America. Nevertheless, this change to US regulations largely united headlamp styling within and outside the North American market.|$|E
5000|$|Appropriate color {{conversion}} {{filters are}} used {{to compensate for the}} effects of lighting not balanced for the film stock's rated color temperature (usually 3200 K for professional tungstens and 5500 K for daylight): e.g., the 80A blue filter used with film for daylight use corrects the perceived orange/reddish cast of incandescent photographic photoflood lighting (for which the usual photographic term is [...] "tungsten lighting"), and significantly improves the stronger cast produced by lower-temperature household incandescent lighting, while the 85B will correct the bluish cast of daylight photographs on tungsten film. Color correction filters are identified by <b>non-standardised</b> numbers which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. The need for these filters has been greatly reduced by the widespread adoption of digital photography, since color balance may be corrected with camera settings as the image is captured, or by software manipulation afterwards.|$|E

The quality of outcome data is poor and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in their 2000 report concluded {{that there were no}} simple answers to the question of modern psychosurgery's clinical effectiveness; studies suggested improvements in symptoms following surgery but it was impossible to establish the extent to which other factors contributed to this improvement. Research into the effects of psychosurgery {{has not been able to}} overcome a number of methodological problems, including the problems associated with <b>non-standardised</b> diagnoses and outcome measurements, the small numbers treated at any one centre, and positive publication bias. Controlled studies are very few in number and there have been no placebo-controlled studies. There are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses.|$|E
5000|$|Cats {{that were}} {{imported}} from Siam (today, Thailand) to Western {{countries in the}} 19th and early 20th century were broader in features than the modern Western Siamese. While the Thai, known in Thailand as the [...] (among other, <b>non-standardised</b> spellings, e.g. [...] ), has common ancestry with the Western Siamese, generations of separate breeding {{led to the development}} of two distinct breeds, which began to bifurcate in the 1950s, with more extreme features dominating the cat show circuit, and thus becoming the dominant variety of Siamese in the West. [...] Starting in the 1980s, various breed clubs in both North America and Europe appeared that were dedicated to preserving the type that represents the early 20th-century Siamese, comparable to those still found in Thailand catteries, and which were shown again beginning in 1993 in Europe. The World Cat Federation (WCF) recognised the old-style as separate breed, Thai, with full championship competitive status, in 1990. [...] The rename was not universally accepted; in 2000, the independent Old-Style Siamese Club (OSSC) formed in the UK to preserve and promote the breed as such.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{at least}} the 16th century, {{individual}} Officers of State had separate property, powers and responsibilities granted with their separate offices by Royal Command, and the Crown and the Privy Council constituted the only co-ordinating authorities. In England, phrases such as [...] "cabinet counsel", meaning advice given in private, in a cabinet {{in the sense of}} a small room, to the monarch, occur from the late 16th century, and, given the <b>non-standardised</b> spelling of the day, it is often hard to distinguish whether [...] "council" [...] or [...] "counsel" [...] is meant. The OED credits Francis Bacon in his Essays (1605) with the first use of [...] "Cabinet council", where it is described as a foreign habit, of which he disapproves: [...] "For which inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice of France, in some kings’ times, hath introduced cabinet counsels; a remedy worse than the disease". Charles I began a formal [...] "Cabinet Council" [...] from his accession in 1625, as his Privy Council, or [...] "private council", and the first recorded use of [...] "cabinet" [...] by itself for such a body comes from 1644, and is again hostile and associates the term with dubious foreign practices.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Relative {{survival}} estimates cancer {{survival in}} the absence of other causes of death. Previous work has shown that standard errors of <b>non-standardised</b> relative survival may be substantially overestimated by the conventionally used method. However, evidence was restricted to <b>non-standardised</b> relative survival estimates using Hakulinen’s method. Here, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of standard errors including age-standardised survival and estimation by the Ederer II method. METHODS: Five- and ten-year <b>non-standardised</b> and age-standardised relative survival was estimated for patients diagnosed with 25 common forms of cancer in Finland in 1989 – 1993, using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. Standard errors of mutually comparable <b>non-standardised</b> and age-standardised relative survival were computed by the conventionally used method and compared with bootstrap standard errors. RESULTS: When using Hakulinen’s method, standard errors of <b>non-standardised</b> relative survival were overestimated by up to 28 %. In contrast, standard errors of age-standardised relative survival were accurately estimated. When using the Ederer II method, deviations of the standard errors of <b>non-standardised</b> and age-standardised relative survival were generally small to negligible. CONCLUSION: In most cases, overestimations of standard errors are effectively overcome by age standardisation and by using Ederer II rather than Hakulinen’s method...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates {{whether it}} is viable to {{implement}} <b>non-standardised</b> thematic projection media when dealing with the young adolescent.

40|$|Two, {{three and}} four {{compartment}} (2 C, 3 C and 4 C) models of body composition are popular methods to measure fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) in athletes. However, the impact of food and fluid intake on measurement error has not been established. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate standardised (overnight fasted, rested and hydrated) v. <b>non-standardised</b> (afternoon and non-fasted) presentation on technical and biological error on surface anthropometry (SA), 2 C, 3 C and 4 C models. In thirty-two athletic males, measures of SA, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) and air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD) were taken to establish 2 C, 3 C and 4 C models. Tests were conducted after an overnight fast (duplicate), about 7 h later after ad libitum food and fluid intake, and repeated 24 h later before and after ingestion of a specified meal. Magnitudes of changes in the mean and typical errors of measurement were determined. Mean change scores for <b>non-standardised</b> presentation and post meal tests for FM were substantially large in BIS, SA, 3 C and 4 C models. For FFM, mean change scores for <b>non-standardised</b> conditions produced large changes for BIS, 3 C and 4 C models, small for DXA, trivial for BOD POD and SA. Models that included a total body water (TBW) value from BIS (3 C and 4 C) were more sensitive to TBW changes in <b>non-standardised</b> conditions than 2 C models. Biological error is minimised in all models with standardised presentation but DXA and BOD POD are acceptable if acute food and fluid intake remains below 500 g...|$|E
