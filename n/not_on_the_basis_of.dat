25|$|The Red Gaurs were ex-mercenaries and men {{discharged}} from the military for disciplinary infractions mixed with unemployed vocational school graduates, high-school dropouts, idle street corner boys, and slum toughs. In the early-1970s, potential recruits found themselves in dire economic straits, unable to obtain employment, and thus were easy targets of anti-student and anti-worker propaganda. Their grievances were exploited by the state, notably the king's network, and their anger directed towards student protesters. They were recruited <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> ideological commitment, but rather by promises of high pay, abundant liquor, brothel privileges, and the lure of public notoriety. Unlike the Village Scouts and the Nawaphon, the motivation of the Red Gaurs was more sociological than ideological.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of urban service providers in Morocco: private concessionnaires (38% of urban water customers), municipal utilities (31%), the national public company ONEE (28%), and municipalities providing services directly (3%). De jure, {{according to the}} municipal code of 1976 (Charte Communale), amended in 2002 and 2008, public services such as water supply, sewerage and electricity distribution are the responsibility of municipalities (communes). There are 1,547 municipalities in Morocco, including 249 urban and 1,298 rural municipalities. As mentioned above, some municipalities have delegated service provision to private concessionnaires. In other municipalities the Régies provide these services, often <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> a specific contract. In the smaller municipalities ONEE often provides services, either {{with or without a}} contract (contrat de gestion déléguée) with the municipality. In the case of sewers, many smaller municipalities still provide this service directly, although there is a policy to gradually transfer sewer services to ONEE.|$|E

500|$|The Constitutional {{restraint}} on {{the size}} of rural Parliamentary constituencies was later removed, providing what one commentator called [...] "an indirect buttress" [...] to Malay special rights; as Malays were concentrated in rural areas, this indirectly enhanced Malay political power.

500|$|Compensation demanded {{from the}} {{defeated}} party {{was a common}} feature of peace treaties. The financial burden of the Treaty of Versailles was labelled [...] "reparations", which distinguished them from punitive settlements usually known as indemnities. The reparations were intended for reconstruction and as compensation for families who had been bereaved by the war. Sally Marks wrote that the article [...] "was designed to lay a legal basis for reparations" [...] to be paid. Article 231 [...] "established an unlimited theoretical liability" [...] for which Germany {{would have to pay}} but the following article [...] "in fact narrowed German responsibility to civilian damages". When the final reparation figure was established in 1921, it was based on an Allied assessment of [...] German capacity to pay, <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Allied claims.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky {{struggled}} with sonata form. Its principle of organic growth through {{the interplay of}} musical themes was alien to Russian practice. According to Brown and musicologists Hans Keller and Daniel Zhitomirsky, Tchaikovsky found his solution to large-scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony. He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an [...] "outline," [...] as Zhitomirsky phrases it. Within this outline, the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another, with what Keller calls [...] "new and violent contrasts" [...] between musical themes, keys, and harmonies. This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum and adds intense drama. While the result, Warrack charges, is still [...] "an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them" [...] in the Germanic sense, Brown counters that it took the listener of the period [...] "through a succession of often highly charged sections which added up to a radically new kind of symphonic experience" [...] (italics Brown), one that functioned <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation.|$|E

500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Dele Fadele saw My Bloody Valentine as the [...] "blueprint" [...] for the shoegaze genre, and wrote: [...] "with 'Loveless' you could've {{expected the}} Irish / English partnership {{to succumb to}} self-parody or mimic The Scene That's Delighted To Eat Quiche [...] But no, 'Loveless' fires a silver-coated bullet into the future, daring all-comers to try and recreate its mixture of moods, feelings, emotion, styles and, yes, innovations." [...] While Fadele expressed some disappointment that the group seemed to disassociate themselves from dance music and reggae basslines, he concluded [...] "'Loveless' ups the ante, and, however decadent one might find the idea of elevating other human beings to deities, My Bloody Valentine, failings and all, deserve more than your respect." [...] Melody Maker writer Simon Reynolds praised the album, and wrote that Loveless [...] " [...] how unique, how peerless MBV are." [...] He declared, [...] "Along with Mercury Rev's Yerself is Steam, 'Loveless' is the outermost, innermost, uttermost rock record of 1991." [...] Reynolds noted that his only criticism was that [...] "while My Bloody Valentine have amplified and refined what they already were, they've failed to mutate or leap into any kind of beyond." [...] In a review that also covered Chapterhouse and Creation labelmates Velvet Crush, Rolling Stone reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, [...] "Despite the record's intense ability to disorient—this is real do-not-adjust-your-set stuff—the effect is strangely uplifting. Loveless oozes a sonic balm that first embraces and then softly pulverizes the frantic stress of life." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that the band had [...] "written a new vocabulary for the guitar, and perhaps given it another 10 years of life as rock`s central instrument." [...] Spin gave Loveless a mixed review with writer Jim Greer noting that the album's songs are [...] "standard-ish and dull" [...] and concluded that he felt [...] "The warped music is a cool idea and I recommend the album—but <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the singing or the songs".|$|E

2500|$|Mahoney, in a concurring judgment, adopts the {{reasoning}} of the Trial Judge, {{asserting that the}} definition of [...] "spouse" [...] in the Old Age Security Act does not discriminate against the appellants.

2500|$|His various {{contributions}} were harnessed by Dada's {{international effort}} of self-promotion. In April 1917, he welcomed the Dada affiliation of Switzerland's own Paul Klee, calling Klee's {{contribution to the}} Dada exhibit a [...] "great event". His mask designs were popular beyond Europe, and inspired similar creations by Mexico's Germán Cueto, the [...] "Stridentist" [...] painter-puppeteer. The Dadaist popularization effort received lukewarm responses in Janco's native country, where the traditionalist press expressed alarm at being confronted with Dada precepts. Vinea himself was ambivalent about the activities of his two friends, preserving a link with poetic tradition which made his publication in Tzara's press impossible. In a letter to Janco, Vinea spoke about having personally presented one of Janco's posters to modernist poet and art critic Tudor Arghezi: [...] " [...] said, critically, that you cannot say whether a person is talented or <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> only one drawing.

2500|$|The actual {{amount of}} reparations that Germany {{was obliged to}} pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 million marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in [...] "C bonds" [...] were entirely chimerical—a device to fool the public into {{thinking}} Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion German gold marks, worth about $5 billion US dollars or £1 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods like coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 {{on the basis of}} a German capacity to pay, <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Allied claims. The highly publicized rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US received $100 million.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the Perm Krai ombudswoman Tatyana Margolina {{reported}} that 14 women with disabilities {{were subjected to}} compulsory medical sterilization in the Ozyorskiy psychoneurological nursing home whose director was Grigory Bannikov. The sterilizations were performed <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> a mandatory court decision appropriate for them, but only {{on the basis of}} the application by the guardian Bannikov. On 2 December 2010, the court did not find corpus delicti in the compulsory medical sterilizations performed by his consent. The order by the health minister of the Russian Federation that was issued in 1993 and neatly determined the procedure of forced abortion and sterilization of women with disabilities was repealed by the head of Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation Tatyana Golikova in 2009. Therefore, now women can be subjected to compulsory sterilization without court decision, according to Tatyana Margolina, which may place some types of people within their nation at risk. In Russia, one of the supporters of preventive eugenics is the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko, who justifies forced sterilization of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes, and states that “one needs a more strictly adjusted and open control for the practice of preventive eugenics, which, in itself, is, in its turn, justifiable.” ...|$|E

The next day, Pablo Iglesias revealed that C's had refused Podemos' concessions, being unwilling to accept anything other than [...] "minor changes" [...] to their accord with PSOE, as well as to any kind of Podemos' involvement within the government. Iglesias said that Sánchez had been effectively [...] "kidnapped" [...] by Rivera's party and was unable to negotiate on his own, announcing that Podemos would put the PSOE–C's pact up to its membership vote on 14–16 April, voicing his opposition to it and placing the responsibility for a new election on PSOE.
