40|$|With the {{explosive}} proliferation of mobile devices and services, the user-density of large-scale cellular networks continues to increase, {{which results in}} further escalating traffic-generation. Yet, there is an urging demand for reducing the <b>network’s</b> <b>energy</b> dissipation. Hence we model the energy efficiency of large-scale cellular networks for characterizing its dependence on the base station (BS) density {{as well as for}} quantifying the impact of tele-traffic on the achievable energy efficiency under specific quality of service requirements. This allows us to match the BS deployment to the network’s tele-traffic, whilst conserving precious energy. More specifically, we formulate a practical tele-traffic-aware BS deployment problem for optimizing the <b>network’s</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency whilst satisfying the users’ maximum tolerable outage probability. This is achieved by analyzing the optimal BS-density under specific tele-traffic conditions. Furthermore, we study the energy saving potential of our optimal BS deployment strategy under diverse practical parameters and provide insights into the attainable energy savings in dense random cellular networks. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy of our analysis and verify the impact of the parameters considered on the <b>network’s</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency.

50|$|Reduce {{processing}} {{requirements and}} core <b>network</b> <b>energy</b> consumption - A core optical router in an OBS network may face reduced control plane requirements {{when compared to}} that in an OPS network, as: A core optical router in an OPS network would have to perform processing operations for every arriving packet, wherelse in an OBS network the router performs processing operations for an arriving burst which contains several packets. Therefore, less processing operations per packet are required in an OBS network core optical router compared to an OPS network. Consequently, the energy consumption and potentially the carbon footprint of a core optical router in an OPS network {{is likely to be}} larger than that of an OBS network router for the same amount of data.|$|E
50|$|The {{cost for}} {{deploying}} a wireless network is normally dominated by base station sites (real estate costs, planning, maintenance, distribution <b>network,</b> <b>energy,</b> etc.) and sometimes also by frequency license fees. The objective of radio resource management is therefore typically {{to maximize the}} system spectral efficiency in bit/s/Hz/area unit or Erlang/MHz/site, under some kind of user fairness constraint, for example, that the grade of service should be above a certain level. The latter involves covering a certain area and avoiding outage due to co-channel interference, noise, attenuation caused by path losses, fading caused by shadowing and multipath, Doppler shift {{and other forms of}} distortion. The grade of service is also affected by blocking due to admission control, scheduling starvation or inability to guarantee quality of service that is requested by the users.|$|E
50|$|To reduce {{communication}} costs some algorithms remove {{or reduce}} nodes' redundant sensor information and avoid forwarding data {{that is of}} no use. As nodes can inspect the data they forward, they can measure averages or directionality for example of readings from other nodes. For example, in sensing and monitoring applications, it is generally the case that neighboring sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. Aggregation reduces the amount of network traffic which helps to reduce energy consumption on sensor nodes. Recently, {{it has been found}} that network gateways also {{play an important role in}} improving energy efficiency of sensor nodes by scheduling more resources for the nodes with more critical energy efficiency need and advanced energy efficient scheduling algorithms need to be implemented at network gateways for the improvement of the overall <b>network</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the optimal control of <b>networked</b> <b>energy</b> systems. <b>Networked</b> <b>energy</b> systems {{consist of a}} {{collection}} of energy storage nodes and a network of links and inputs which allow energy to be exchanged, injected, or removed from the nodes. The nodes may exchange energy between each other autonomously or via controlled flows between the nodes. Examples of networked systems include building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and networked battery systems. In the building system example, the nodes of the system are rooms which store thermal energy in the air and other elements which have thermal capacity. The rooms transfer energy autonomously through thermal conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermal energy can be injected into or removed from the rooms via conditioned air or slabs. In the case of a networked battery system, the batteries store electrical energy in their chemical cells. The batteries may be electrically linked so that a controller can move electrical charge from one battery to another. <b>Networked</b> <b>energy</b> systems are typically large-scale (contain many states and inputs), affected by uncertain forecasts and disturbances, and require fast computation on cheap embedded platforms. In this thesis, the optimal control technique we study is model predictive control for <b>networked</b> <b>energy</b> systems. Model predictive or receding horizon control is a time-domain optimization-based control technique which uses predictive models of a system to forecast its behavior and minimize a performance cost subject to system constraints. In this thesis we address two primary issues concerning model predictive control for <b>networked</b> <b>energy</b> systems: robustness to uncertainty in forecasts and reducing the complexity of the large-scale optimization problem for use in embedded platforms. The first half of the thesis deals primarily with the efficient computation of robust controllers for dealing with random and adversarial uncertainties in the forecasts. We show that the exact control policies can be found efficiently for certain types of robust predictive control problems. The second half of the thesis deals with improving computation speed and memory usage through model reduction and exploitation of symmetries in the predictive control problem. We present a model reduction technique tailored for networked systems which preserves sparsity and thus greatly improves computation speed. We also show how to apply symmetry methods for efficient computation of explicit model predictive controllers to systems which are not perfectly symmetric...|$|R

Another type of delay is in terms of the routing delay. Using this metric, the accumulated routing delays from any source sensor node to the BS are measured. Between these pairs of nodes, we also use another metric that counts the number of hops traversed on the path way which actually measures the network's paths lengths.|$|E

The important statistical {{properties of the}} universal (general) cell association functions are first studied and the cell load statistics for power-law cell association functions, which can characterize the accurate void cell probability of a BS in every tier, is also derived. A simple and feasible green channel-aware cell association (GCA) scheme is proposed and the green coverage probability is also proposed for any particular cell association scheme, such as the maximum received power association (MRPA) and nearest base station association (NBA) schemes. Then the link and <b>network</b> <b>energy</b> efficiencies are proposed to characterize the mean spectrum efficiency per unit power consumption for a BS and the mean area spectrum efficiency for a HetNet, respectively.
