The Bill also affects the Hungarian notariat, which proudly looks back to a past of 700 years, and is conferring several new powers on the organisation. In the medieval Hungary the activities requiring public authenticity were performed by two types of institutions, the locus authenticus operated by the Church and the secular civil law notary. The loci authentici were succeeded by the Latin type of notariat in 1875. Following the 1948 Communist takeover, the Latin type of notariat fell victim to {{the transformation of the}} justice system after the Soviet model. It was not until after 1991 that the private type of notariat in harmony with the Hungarian traditions could resume its operation in the end. At present two main groups of cases fall within the competence {{of the civil}} law notaries: conducting certain <b>non-litigious</b> <b>proceedings,</b> and preparing notarial deeds. The new Civil Code would refer several new <b>non-litigious</b> <b>proceedings</b> to the competence of the civil law notaries, for example keeping the register of the matrimonial and conjugal property contracts, conducting divorce upon the agreed request of the parties, as well as the dissolution of common law marriage upon the agreed request of the parties. In conclusion the codification enlarges the sphere of tasks of the notariat in the territory of <b>non-litigious</b> <b>proceedings,</b> thus wishing to strengthen the Hungarian Notariatâ€™s official character...|$|E

We define {{the meaning of the}} term 'a building's appertaining land' and its usage. On the basis of a survey of normative acts from 1958 till today, we also add its synonyms used in the past. We furthermore define the term 'orderliness of a building's appertaining land'. Following the analysis of the data about apartment buildings and their appertaining land that were gathered in public real estate registers, we classify individual cases according to the definition of orderliness of such land, and additionally describe its most frequent forms. However, the aim of the thesis is not only to display the current state, but also to find solutions to the problems appearing in this field. Therefore we present two possibilities to solve them; one is based on agreement and the other on <b>non-litigious</b> <b>proceedings</b> (the ZVEtl Act). The town of Trbovlje was chosen as a test settlement. First, the actual state of buildings' appertaining land is described, and then they are classified according to its orderliness as introduced earlier in the thesis. The conclusion of the thesis explicates why it would be more sensible to use the term 'functional land' instead of 'building's appertaining land' in expert literature...|$|E
