40|$|Introduction Integrated {{management}} systems (IMS) for pigs offer {{the prospects of}} optimising meat production and minimising <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> through closed-loop control of pig growth by nutritional control (Whittemore, et al., 2001). Such an IMS requires a real-time sensor system, a nutritional model which is optimised in response to data collected in by the sensor system, and a control system which uses forward predictions of the model to predict the nutritional regime required to satisfy growth and pollution targets.

40|$|Amphibians {{are declining}} {{worldwide}} and pollutants have been implicated {{as a major}} contributor to these declines. To understand these declines, many studies have assessed the impact of pollutants on amphibian behaviour. However, information regarding their effect on locomotor abilities, as well as the intra-specific variation of the tolerance to pollutants, is extremely rare. Further, the majority of studies examining the impact of pollutants on amphibians have been conducted in simplified laboratory settings. Given the complexity of natural systems, determining whether amphibian responses in laboratory studies can be generalized to more realistic natural scenarios is critical. Towards this goal, this study assessed the impact of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> on survival and fitness-related larval traits (growth, mass and swimming performance) for three populations of the frog Pelophylax perezi, exposed to different degrees of eutrophication in two different and complementary experiments: (1) pond mesocosms, with NH 4 Cl isolated or combined with NaNO 2 and NaNO 3, and (2) field enclosures placed in natural streams differing in their degree of pollution. For both mesocosm and field enclosure experiments, larval mortality was unaffected by <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution.</b> However, in the mesocosm experiment, exposure to nitrogenous compounds reduced final larvae mass and growth. In contrast, in the enclosure experiment, polluted locations facilitated final mass and growth of surviving tadpoles. Population-level variation in the effect of pollution was observed for final larval mass in the mesocosm but not in the field enclosure experiment. In addition, although nitrogenous compounds in both mesocosm and natural conditions had no direct effect on absolute larval swimming performance, they may impact the viability of larvae by affecting the relationships between growth and the swimming abilities. The differential pattern found in the impacts of nitrogenous compounds on larvae of P. perezi when raised in different experimental venues (mesocosms and field conditions) points to the convenience of considering more realistic natural scenarios in assessing the impact of pollutants on amphibians.

Increasingly, the effect of {{corrosion}} on their present and future structural safety is of interest. Field investigations and observations to assess corrosion losses and pitting of the cast iron piers of four different operational railway bridges located in tidal marine exposure conditions are described, noting that direct visual examination usually is rendered difficult by immersion, marine growth and the presence of the graphitised layer. Measured corrosion losses and pit depths showed considerable variability between piers and between bridges.

50|$|This {{omission}} of the aquaculture industry from mandatory reporting is significant for Spencer Gulf, South Australia. In this region, {{southern bluefin tuna}} and yellowtail kingfish sea-cage aquaculture are the two largest industrial contributors of <b>nitrogenous</b> nutrient <b>pollution</b> to the marine environment. The Spencer Gulf is particularly vulnerable to impacts because its water exchange with the ocean is constrained and the waters are naturally very low in nutrients by world standards. The existing marine communities have evolved to these unique circumstances, and are therefore particularly susceptible to changes in their environment. Iconic marine species of the region include the giant Australian cuttlefish and the little penguin, {{both of which are}} in decline.|$|R
40|$|A Hollow-fiber Membrane Biofilm Reactor (MBfR) {{was used}} to nitrify and denitrify {{synthetic}} wastewater to remove nitrogenous pollutants such as ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite. Aerobic and anoxic MBfRs were combined to oxidize and reduce these <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollutions</b> using biofilms as the catalyst for these chemical reactions. The MBfR is capable of converting ammonium (NH 4 +) to nitrogen gas (N 2), {{through a series of}} nitrification and denitrification reactions in a completely mixed environment. For these reactions to occur, oxygen gas must be supplied into the nitrifying reactor (NR) to oxidize the pollutants into nitrate (NO 3 -). Hydrogen gas must be supplied to the denitrifying reactor (DR) to reduce the pollutants into N 2 gas. Hydrogen is an excellent electron donor because it is inexpensive, nontoxic to humans and leaves no residual in the water. Hydrogen gas is normally a substantial safety hazard, but the hollow fiber membrane’s design eliminates the possibility of an explosion and thereby the danger. The aerobic/anoxic MBfR was tested to determine the nitrogen removal at several different O 2 pressures while H 2 pressure was held constant. The reactor was also tested at different H 2 pressures while constant O 2 pressure was maintained. The aerobic/anoxic MBfR was successful for nearly total nitrogen removal (97. 1 %) from the 50 mg NH 4 +-N/l medium, which represents the typical nitrogen content of municipal wastewater. Total nitrogen removal was strongly influenced by the O 2 pressure, in that low O 2 pressure (1. 25 psi) caused poor nitrification and high O 2 pressure (6. 0 psi) caused poor denitrification. Total nitrogen removal was slightly influenced by H 2 pressure, although increasing the H 2 pressures to 5. 0 psi provided better denitrification. The optimal gas pressures for O 2 and H 2 gas were determined to be 2. 1 psi and 2. 0 psi respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|Lichens {{have been}} shown to be useful bioindicators for {{determining}} levels of nitrogen deposition related to air pollution. Preliminary lichen surveys in Forest Park in 2011 and 2012 revealed the presence of lichen species associated with high levels of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution.</b> The summer of 2013, we conducted lichen surveys at 25 permanent research sites that had been set up in Forest Park and the Ancient Forest Preserve in 1993. The majority of the lichens we collected at every site were classified as indicative of worst, poor, or fair air quality, with few lichens found that would indicate good or best air quality. Lobaria is a lichen common in Oregon and is important in the normal nitrogen cycle in forests. However, Lobaria is very sensitive to nitrogenous air pollution and is associated with the best air quality category. We only collected Lobaria at one site in the middle of the park. We found no significant differences in lichens in the different air quality variables in the various sections of the park, indicating that all of Forest Park is subjected to poor air quality...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{stable isotope}} ratios (δ 15 N) in macroalgae {{are often used}} to {{identify}} sources of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> in fluvial and estuarine settings. This approach assumes that the macroalgal δ 15 N {{is representative of the}} sources of the pollution averaged over a timespan in the order of days to weeks, but the preferential uptake of a particular nitrogen compound or potential for fractionation in the water column or during uptake and assimilation by the macroalgae could make this assumption invalid. Laboratory studies were therefore performed to investigate the uptake and assimilation of both nitrate and ammonium at a variety of concentrations using the vegetative (non-fertile) tips of the brown macroalgae, Fucus vesiculosus. Nitrate appeared to fractionate at high concentrations, and was found to be taken up more rapidly than ammonia; within 13 days, the macroalgae tips were in isotopic equilibrium with the nitrate solution at 500 μM. These experiments were complemented by an investigation involving the translocation of macroalgae collected from a site enriched in 15 N relative to natural levels (Staithes, UK), to the River Tees, Middlesbrough (UK), a site depleted in 15 N relative to natural levels. The nitrogen isotope signature shifted 50 % within 7 days, with samples deployed nearer the surface subject to greater change.

It is notably to confirming the purification performances and decontamination of secondary effluent by sand filter drained under an intense wild plant. For this, a basin of 100 m² of infiltration surface equipped with two wells of sampling in the center and in the periphery, has been constructed in irrigated perimeter of Dissa in Gabes (south east of Tunisia).

The sand filter retains the different shapes of the phosphor by adsorption and precipitation in the superficial horizon.

40|$|Studies by Dr. Nancy Broshot in Forest Park, {{an urban}} forest in Portland, Oregon, have shown high tree {{mortality}} and low concomitant recruitment. Lichen surveys conducted in 2013 revealed {{a shift in}} the lichen community to one typified by nitrogen-tolerant and nitrogen-thriving species. To ascertain if <b>nitrogenous</b> air <b>pollution</b> could be a cause of low recruitment, soil samples were collected from 32 previously established study sites in Forest Park and at 3 control sites established in 2014 in the Mount Hood National Forest, a rural forest in the Clackamas River Basin. At each site, the soil O horizon depth was measured, and soil samples were collected from the A horizon, which were subsequently dried and sieved. The resulting soil samples were analyzed at the Central Analytical Laboratory at OSU to determine carbon and nitrogen concentration, as well as carbon to nitrogen ratios. The results of the soil analysis show that soil samples from the control sites had significantly higher concentrations of carbon and a significantly higher carbon to nitrogen ratio than the sites in Forest Park. These findings are quite exciting and suggest a number of possible avenues for further research...|$|R
40|$|In 1993, Dr. Nancy Broshot {{randomly}} located 25 permanent study {{sites in}} Forest Park in Portland, Oregon {{to examine the}} effects of urbanization on forest health. Plant community structure was examined. In 2003, Dr. Broshot reexamined the plant communities at each site and found significantly higher tree mortality and reduced recruitment (young trees) in all areas of the park. Many seedlings that had been present in 1993 were absent in 2003. In 2013, a 20 -year follow up study of the tree community was conducted. Although the rate of tree mortality had dropped, recruitment of seedlings and saplings was still low. A series of lichen studies completed at each site in 2013 indicated high levels of <b>nitrogenous</b> air <b>pollution</b> at all sites in the park. In 2014, three control sites along a gradient of air quality in the Mount Hood National Forest above Estacada, Oregon were added to the study. Plant community variables were measured in the same manner as in Forest Park. We found significantly more live trees, saplings and seedlings at the control sites than at sites in Forest Park. We also found significantly fewer dead trees at control sites. Indeed, we had more seedlings at the three control sites than at all 25 of the Forest Park sites.

Laws.) seedlings along a mature tree vertical canopy gradient {{was conducted in}} the mixed conifer forest of the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California. Concentrations of nitric acid vapor (HNO 3), particulate nitrate (NO 3), and ammonium (NH 4) were measured, as well as dry surface deposition of NO 3 and NH 4. By using this data, along with meteorological information, a series of simple models were developed that predict the vertical gradient of foliage-rinse surface deposition for NO 3, NH 4, and total N. Individual models for NO 3 and NH 4 were calculated by using deposition data, air concentrations {{at the top of}} the canopy, and wind speed. These models explained 80 percent of the variation between deposition values at the lower canopy positions. Examination of model coefficients indicated that the two models were not significantly different, and a single model was developed to estimate total N deposition. This model explained less variation than the individual models (R 2 N = 0. 69) but is a simpler description of the system. All models have two parameters (a 0 and a 1) that are estimated by nonlinear regression. Independent data indicates that the a 1 parameter depends only on the rate of decline in wind speed vertically down the canopy. The a 0 parameter reflects the difference between foliage rinse surface deposition {{at the top of the}} canopy and that at lower canopy positions. It indicates that about 20 percent less dry surface deposition occurs at lower canopy positions than expected from wind speed alone for all nitrogenous compounds, most likely because decreased turbulence within the canopy results in increased quasi-laminar boundary layer resistance at lower canopy positions...|$|R

Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, Nutrition Society Conference on Malnutrition Matters, Harrogate, 2 - 3 November 2010, 69, (4), 613 - 620. IMPF: 03. 92 RONO: 03135 -CGCRuminant {{farming is}} {{an important component of the}} human food chain. Ruminants can use offtake from land unsuitable for cereal crop cultivation via interaction with the diverse microbial population in their rumens. The rumen is a continuous flow fermenter for the digestion of ligno-cellulose, with microbial protein and fermentation end-products incorporated by the animal directly or during post-ruminal digestion. However, ruminal fermentation is inefficient in capturing the nutrient resource presented, resulting in environmental pollution and generation of greenhouse gases. Methane is generated as a consequence of ruminal fermentation and poor retention of ingested forage nitrogen causes <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> of water and land and contributes to the generation of nitrous oxide. One possible cause is the imbalanced provision of dietary substrates to the rumen micro-organisms. Deamination of amino acids by ammonia-producing bacteria liberates ammonia which can be assimilated by the rumen bacteria and used for microbial protein synthesis. However, when carbohydrate is limiting, microbial growth is slow, meaning low demand for ammonia for microbial protein synthesis and excretion of the excess. Protein utilisation can therefore be improved by increasing the availability of readily fermentable sugars in forage or by making protein unavailable for proteolysis through complexing with plant secondary products. Alternatively, realisation that grazing cattle ingest living cells has led to the discovery that plant cells undergo endogenous, stress-mediated protein degradation due to the exposure to rumen conditions. This presents the opportunity to decrease the environmental impact of livestock farming by using decreased proteolysis as a selection tool for the development of improved pasture grass varieties.

40|$|International audience: This paper {{compares the}} removal {{performances}} of two complete {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) for all priority substances listed in the Water Framework Directive and additional compounds of interest including flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides, and personal care products (PCPs) (n[*]=[*] 104). First, primary treatments such as physicochemical lamellar settling (PCLS) and primary settling (PS) are compared. Similarly, biofiltration (BF) and conventional activated sludge (CAS) are then examined. Finally, the removal efficiency per unit of nitrogen removed of both WWTPs for micropollutants is discussed, as <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> treatment results in a special design of processes and operational conditions. For primary treatments, hydrophobic pollutants (log K ow[*]>[*] 4) are well removed (> 70  %) for both systems despite high variations of removal. PCLS allows an obvious gain of about 20  % regarding pollutant removals, {{as a result of}} better suspended solids elimination and possible coagulant impact on soluble compounds. For biological treatments, variations of removal are much weaker, and the majority of pollutants are comparably removed within both systems. Hydrophobic and volatile compounds are well (> 60  %) or very well removed (> 80  %) by sorption and volatilization. Some readily biodegradable molecules are better removed by CAS, indicating a better biodegradation. A better sorption of pollutants on activated sludge could be also expected considering the differences of characteristics between a biofilm and flocs. Finally, comparison of global processes efficiency using removals of micropollutants load normalized to nitrogen shows that PCLS[*]+[*]BF is as efficient as PS[*]+[*]CAS despite a higher compactness and a shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT). Only some groups of pollutants seem better removed by PS[*]+[*]CAS like alkylphenols, flame retardants, or di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), thanks to better biodegradation and sorption resulting from HRT and biomass characteristics. For both processes, and out of the 68 molecules found in raw water, only half of them are still detected in the water discharged, most of the time close to their detection limit. However, some of them are detected at higher concentrations (> 1  μg/L and/or lower than environmental quality standards), which is problematic as they represent a threat for aquatic environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{observatory}} {{of urban}} pollutants {{was created in}} Paris {{for the purpose of}} assessing the dynamics of wastewater and wet weather flow (WW and WWF) pollutant loads within combined sewers. This observatory is composed of six urban catchments, covering land areas ranging in size from 42  ha to 2581  ha. For a wide array of parameters including total suspended solids (TSS), chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD and BOD(5)), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), heavy metals (Cu and Zn) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), this article is intended to evaluate the contributions of wastewater, runoff and in-sewer processes to WWF pollutant loads through the use of an entry-exit mass balance approach. To achieve this objective, a total of 16 rain events were sampled on these sites between May 2003 and February 2006. This study has confirmed that at the considered catchment scale (i. e. from 42  ha to 2581  ha) the production and transfer processes associated with WWF pollutant loads do not vary with basin scale. Entry-exit chemical mass balances over all catchments and for a large number of rain events indicate that wastewater constitutes the main source of organic and <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution,</b> while runoff is the predominant source of Zn. For Cu, PAHs and TSS, the calculation underscores the major role played by in-sewer processes, specifically by sediment erosion, as a source of WWF pollution. A significant loss of dissolved metals was also observed during their transfer within the sewer network, likely {{as a consequence of the}} adsorption of dissolved metals on TSS and/or on sewer deposits. Moreover, the nature of eroded particles was examined and compared to the various sewer deposits. This comparison has highlighted that such particles exhibit similar organic and PAH contents to those measured in the organic layer, thus suggesting that the deposit eroded during a wet weather period is organic and of a nature comparable to the organic layer. Despite the extent of initial field investigations, no organic deposit was observed to be present on sewer lines within the catchments, which implies that this organic deposit is probably present in another form or to be found elsewhere in the main trunks...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the serious}} {{environmental}} problems that the human beings are facing is the <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution.</b> It comes along with the perturbed nitrogen cycle in the nature and is mostly caused by human activities. NH 4 +, NO 2 –-N, and NO 3 [...] N are three major nitrogenous pollutants widely seen in the environment and known by most people. They are also the target compounds this thesis primarily focuses on. ^ Traditional nitrogen removal techniques apply the nitrification process to biodegrade NH 4 +, but accumulate NO 3 [...] N in the treated body. The alternating-aerobic-anoxic process combines both nitrification and denitrification in one system. Therefore, it can not only remove NH 4 + by nitrification but also eliminate NO 3 [...] N by denitrification. NO 2 [...] N exists in the system as an intermediate product of both nitrification and denitrification. The AAA process also shows the capability of removing TOC, which is oxidized under the aerobic condition and consumed by heterotrophs in the anoxic stage. If the organic carbon source is directly obtained from the existing waste stream, costs on adding external carbon will be saved. Successfully applying the biological fluidized bed reactor to the AAA process is proved in this thesis. Its advantages include saving space, eliminating sludge problems, and removing carbon and nitrogen efficiently. ^ Due to the alternating aeration, the aeration/non-aeration ratio {{is one of the}} important factors affecting the performance of the AAA process. For free NH 4 + and easily biodegradable carbon (e. g. glucose), the optimal aeration/non-aeration ratio is within a close range around 1. For a complex aromatic amine (e. g. aniline), due to its low denitrification rate, the non-aeration duration should be correspondingly increased and this makes the aeration/non-aeration ratio less than 1. Accumulation of the organic carbon in the anoxic stage is the distinguished result of a longer non-aeration process when dealing with slowly biodegradable organic compounds. ^ Applying the results of this thesis to the design of the AAA process for the joint aquacultural project between the University of Pennsylvania and the Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey is expected in the near future. The success of the AAA process in removing aniline claims its potential application to removing toxic nitrogen containing organic compounds. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreasing the rumen-stable {{protein content}} of feed {{would lead to}} {{improved}} nitrogen utilisation in cattle, and less nitrogenous waste. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is a high protein ruminant feed containing high polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity. PPO mediated protein-quinone binding {{has been linked to}} protecting plant proteins from proteolysis. To explore the mechanism underlying the effect of PPO on protein protection in fresh forage feeds, proteomic components of feed down-boli produced from wild-type red clover and a low PPO mutant, at point of ingestion and after 4 h in vitro incubation with rumen inoculum were analysed. Significant differences in proteomic profiles between wild-type and mutant red clover were determined after 4 h incubation, with over 50 % less spots in mutant than wild-type proteomes, indicating decreased proteolysis in the latter. Protein identifications revealed preferentially retained proteins localised within the chloroplast, suggesting that PPO mediated protection in the wild-type operates due to the proximity of target proteins to the enzyme and substrates, either diffusing into this compartment from the vacuole or are present in the chloroplast. This increased understanding of protein targets of PPO indicates that wider exploitation of the trait could contribute to increased protein use efficiency in grazing cattle. Biological significanceOne of the main challenges for sustainable livestock farming is improving capture of dietary nitrogen by ruminants. Typically up to 70 % of ingested protein-N is excreted representing a loss of productivity potential and a serious environmental problem in terms of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> of lands and water. Identification of key characteristics of rumen-protected protein will deliver target traits for selection in forage breeding programmes. The chloroplastic enzyme PPO catalyzes the oxidation of phenols to quinones, which react with protein. Little is currently known about the intracellular protein targets of the products of PPO activity or the mechanism underlying protein complexing, including whether there is any specificity to the reaction. Here we have determined significant differences in the proteomes of freshly ingested down boli corresponding to {{the presence or absence of}} active PPO. These results show that in the presence of PPO the forage protein is less amenable to proteolysis and provide the novel information that the protected proteins are putatively chloroplastically located. These data also contribute to a growing evidence base that a chloroplastic PPO substrate exists in red clover in addition to the currently known vacuolar substrates...|$|E

Journal of Agricultural Science, 143 (2 - 3), 117 - 135 White clover (Trifolium repens L.) and {{red clover}} (T. pratense L.) {{are the most}} important legumes of temperate pastures. The former is used largely in systems based around sheep or cattle grazing and is grown together with a companion grass. Breeding aims to optimize the white clover contribution to the sward. This means that yield per se is not the aim but rather {{to take full advantage of}} the benefits of white clover; in particular, nitrogen fixation, high protein content, digestibility, mineral content and high intake. The objective is an agronomically and, as far as possible, nutritionally balanced sward, thus persistence of white clover and yield stability over a number of years are key goals. A considerable focus of germplasm improvement has therefore been overcoming biotic and abiotic stresses to clover performance. The former include not only pests and diseases but also the impact of the ruminant animal and the competitive interaction with the companion grass, while abiotic stress could be loosely defined as ?winter hardiness? and ?summer survival? depending on the site. In recent years the focus of many breeding efforts has shifted to give more consideration to the effects of variation within white clover germplasm on animal performance and the environment. Beneficial effects on productivity have been known for many years, but recent studies of the impact of forage diets on meat and milk quality have opened up new opportunities for improvement. Diffuse pollution of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural sources is high on the environmental protection agenda of many governments. Breeding efforts are now being made to reduce the contribution of clovers to both direct (leaching) and indirect (through animal returns) pollution. In particular, recent insights into mechanisms affecting protein breakdown in the rumen and silo offer new prospects for breeding interventions to reduce environmental impacts. Molecular marker methods are being developed in white clover and the transfer and use of resources and information accumulating in the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus is likely to be a major route by which the power of genomic approaches is translated into forage legume improvement. Hybrids of white clover and related species have been developed to introgress key traits; namely, drought tolerance, grazing tolerance of large leaf types and enhanced seed yield, for which only limited genetic variation is present within the white clover gene pool. Red clover is less persistent than white clover, is typically cut three or more times in a season and is used to make silage for winter feed. Although it is often grown with a companion grass, monocultures are common and yield per se as well as persistency and pest and disease resistance are major breeding aims. Fewer agronomic studies and less germplasm improvement have been carried out in this species and molecular studies are not as well advanced although, as with white clover, future developments are likely to benefit greatly from a close relationship to model legumes. Red clover brings considerable benefits in terms of animal production and meat and milk quality. These aspects, alongside approaches to reduce <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> from the silo, represent considerable opportunities for variety development. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe micropollutants fate in the {{environment}} has become an increasing topic of interest last decades, especially in heavily urbanized area. In addition to priority pollutants (WFD), {{a large number of}} molecules such as pesticides, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, artificial sweeteners, etc. is detected in {{the environment}} and also represents a potential threat for it (Rogers 1996, Jørgensen and Halling-Sørensen 2000, Heberer 2002). Furthermore, the fate of pollutants within the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is today well studied and WWTP effluents are generally considered as an important source of contamination for a long time, {{especially in the case of}} urban areas (Heberer 2002). Tertiary treatments are nowadays developed because some molecules are persistent to primary and biological treatments. Different kinds of technologies already exist and are mainly imported from drinking water industry. Adsorption on activated carbon seems to be one of the most interesting of these processes regarding its simplicity, efficiency and functioning costs. Some recent papers have already shown its efficiency over persistent micropollutants (Margot et al. 2013; Boehler et al. 2012). In this context, the LEESU (Water, Environment and Urban Systems Laboratory), through the framework of the OPUR (Observatory of Urban Pollutants) research programme and in close partnership with the Parisian public company (SIAAP) which manages wastewaters of the 8 million inhabitant conurbation, launched this study on the tertiary treatments. Thus, a full-scale activated carbon adsorption pilot (50 m 3 /h) has been set up at the Seine Centre WWTP (capacity of 250 000 m 3 /day) and is currently studied in order to i) characterize the efficiency of the process for priority and emerging pollutants removal and ii) characterize the sorption mechanism and the different parameters influencing it (organic matter competition, operating parameters, activated carbon structure and properties, etc.). The process consists in a fluidized bed of powdered activated carbon (PAC) reactor. As coagulant and flocculant are added to the system, the bed stays steady and no filtration system is needed to separate water and PAC. In addition, a new type of activated carbon, developed for the process, will also be tested. These micro-grains have an intermediary size (300 - 400 µm) compared to powder (1 mm), what should allow a high efficiency together with a higher ease of operating for the process as no chemicals are needed and solid retention time can be higher. Furthermore, the micro-grain selected for this study is regenerated and can easily be recycled, what is consistent with an environmental application. In fact, a recycling by the supplier system can be implemented, potentially resulting in cost reductions and in avoiding the waste carbon handling issue. Considering this, the selection of the process configuration (PAC or micro-grain) will then be possible depending on each site situation and treatment requirements. The study is organized in 3 phases. The first phase consists in an optimization of the pilot, where different configurations (PAC dose, hydraulic retention time and nature of carbon) are tested, while the second phase will operate at steady state. Finally, the third phase will allow testing the micro-grain configuration. A strategy of intensive (every 2 weeks during 2 years) and large (> 130 molecules) screening campaigns has been built to get a very large database and range of information, by measuring inlet and outlet concentrations of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, priority substances and metals during a total of 30 campaigns. Preliminary results tend to highlight a removal of 15 - 50 % of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and a slight decrease of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> (10 - 30 %) whereas TSS are not eliminated. Regarding micropollutants, only pharmaceuticals results are currently available. A significant removal (40 - 90 %) of these molecules seems possible even for the most hydrophilic (log KOW < 4) ones such as antibiotics and beta-blockers. Moreover, a clear influence of the operating parameters can be highlighted. This is in good accordance with recent and similar works in Switzerland and Germany (Margot et al. 2013; Boehler et al. 2012). In addition, a significant relation between micropollutant, DOC and UV- 254 signal removals seems to exist, and the potential of using measure of UV- 254 as a control tool of the efficiency of the process will be evaluated. This presentation aims at presenting results from the two PAC phases and the first feedbacks from the micro-grain phase. A focus will be done on micropollutants fate, but classical wastewater treatment parameters will also be presented to have a precise and complete overview of the potential impact of the addition of a tertiary treatment to the urban areas WWTPs...|$|E
