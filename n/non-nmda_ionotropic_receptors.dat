40|$|The mode of Na+ {{entry and}} the {{dynamics}} of intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) changes consecutive to {{the application of the}} neurotransmitter glutamate were investigated in mouse cortical astrocytes in primary culture by video fluorescence microscopy. An elevation of [Na+]i was evoked by glutamate, whose amplitude and initial rate were concentration dependent. The glutamate-evoked Na+ increase was primarily due to Na+-glutamate cotransport, as inhibition of <b>non-NMDA</b> <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> by 6 -cyano- 7 -nitroquinoxiline- 2, 3 -dione (CNQX) only weakly diminished the response and D-aspartate, a substrate of the glutamate transporter, produced [Na+]i elevations similar to those evoked by glutamate. Non-NMDA receptor activation could nevertheless be demonstrated by preventing receptor desensitization using cyclothiazide. Thus, in normal conditions non-NMDA receptors do not contribute significantly to the glutamate-evoked Na+ response. The rate of Na+ influx decreased during glutamate application, with kinetics that correlate well with the increase in [Na+]i and which depend on the extracellular concentration of glutamate. A tight coupling between Na+ entry and Na+/K+ ATPase activity was revealed by the massive [Na+]i increase evoked by glutamate when pump activity was inhibited by ouabain. During prolonged glutamate application, [Na+]i remains elevated at a new steady-state where Na+ influx through the transporter matches Na+ extrusion through the Na+/K+ ATPase. A mathematical model of {{the dynamics of}} [Na+]i homeostasis is presented which precisely defines the critical role of Na+ influx kinetics in the establishment of the elevated steady state and its consequences on the cellular bioenergetics. Indeed, extracellular glutamate concentrations of 10 microM already markedly increase the energetic demands of the astrocytes...|$|E

Glutamate, acting on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and <b>non-NMDA</b> <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors,</b> is the major neurotransmitter in this nucleus, and the relative contribution of each receptor to signal transmission is unclear. We have examined NMDA excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDA-EPSCs) in the subpostremal NTS using the whole cell patch clamp technique on a transverse brainstem slice preparation. The NMDA-EPSCs were evoked by stimulation of the solitary tract over a range of membrane potentials. The NMDA-EPSCs, isolated pharmacologically, presented the characteristic outward rectification and were completely blocked by 50 µM DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid. The I-V relationship of the NMDA response shows that current, with a mean (± SEM) amplitude of - 41. 2 ± 5. 5 pA, is present even at a holding potential of - 60 mV, suggesting that the NMDA receptors are weakly blocked by extracellular Mg 2 + at near resting membrane potentials. This weak block can also be inferred from the value of 0. 67 ± 0. 17 for parameter delta obtained from a fit of the Woodhull equation to the I-V relationship. The maximal inward current measured on the I-V relationship was at - 38. 7 ± 4. 2 mV. The decay phase of the NMDA currents was fitted with one exponential function with a decay time constant of 239 ± 51 and 418 ± 80 ms at a holding potential of - 60 and + 50 mV, respectively, which became slower with depolarization (e-fold per 145 mV). The biophysical properties of the NMDA receptors observed in the present study suggest that these receptors in the NTS contain NR 2 C subunits and may contribute to the synaptic signal integration...|$|E
40|$|N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) is an {{excitatory}} {{amino acid}} selectively {{acting on a}} subclass of glutamate receptors (the NMDA ionotropic receptor) which {{has been involved in}} many of the physiological and pathological effects of glutamate in the CNS. The basal ganglia are particularly enriched in NMDA receptors and NMDA receptor activation in the basal ganglia has been involved in the expression of motor behaviour. The aim of my thesis was to investigate the neurochemical effects produced by NMDA receptor stimulation in a specific region of the basal ganglia (i. e. the striatum) in order to shed light on the mechanisms by which NMDA is involved in motor control. The effects of intrastriatal perfusion with NMDA on local DA, GABA and GLU release were first evaluated in the halothane anaesthetized rat by means of microdialysis technique (paper I). In this study both basal and NMDA-stimulated neurotransmitter release was characterized in terms of TTX- and Ca++-sensitivity as well as sensitivity to NMDA antagonists. This paper demonstrated that striatal NMDA receptor activation increases striatal DA, GABA and GLU release via different mechanisms. A follow up study was then undertaken to test the sensitivity of the NMDA effects to D 1 and D 2 dopamine receptor antagonists (paper II). The major finding of this study was that D 1 and D 2 receptor blockade inhibited and potentiated NMDA-evoked GABA release respectively. This finding suggested the possibility of an interaction between DA and NMDA receptors in the modulation of the striatonigral pathways. For this reason, dual probe microdialysis technique was used in the awake freely moving rat to test the effects of intrastriatal NMDA perfusion on nigral GABA and GLU release. In paper III, the TTX- and Ca++-sensitivity of basal DA, GABA and GLU release from the striatum and GABA release from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) was analyzed. In addition, the reciprocal modulation between these two areas was studied. A correlation was made between contralateral rotation induced by intranigral perfusion with TTX and changes in striatal and nigral neurotransmitter release. The effects of intrastriatal perfusion with NMDA on striatal DA, GABA and GLU as well as SNr GABA release were subsequently analyzed (paper IV). This study has led to the important finding that, at variance to that observed in the anaesthetized rat, NMDA receptor activation inhibited striatal DA release, possibly via the activation of the striatonigral-nigrostriatal loop. Striatal NMDA receptor activation was also found to subserve motor activation induced by intranigral TTX. In a follow up study (paper V), it was shown that nigral GLU release was modulated by changes in striatal neurotransmission and, particularly, that striatal NMDA receptor activation resulted in an increased nigral GLU release, consistent with an activation of the indirect striatonigral pathway. In paper VI, the effects of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor activation on ACh release from striatal slices and synaptosomes in vitro were characterized. An important finding of this study was the demonstration of the presence of both NMDA and <b>non-NMDA</b> <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> facilitating ACh release on the presynaptic cholinergic terminals. In paper VII, the response of the cholinergic neurons to NMDA was evaluated in the 6 OH-dopamine model of Parkinson's disease. An enhanced responsitivity of both pre- and postsynaptic NMDA receptors was observed in the DA-depleted striatum, consistent with an altered glutamatergic regulation of cholinergic transmission in course of Parkinson's disease. In summary, our data show that NMDA receptor activation in the striatum regulates intrastriatal transmission via multiple mechanisms and also modulates striatal output via the striatonigral direct and indirect pathways. Striatal NMDA receptors may be involved in the expression of motor behaviour and pharmacological properties of NMDA receptors regulating ACh release appear to be altered in course of Parkinson's disease. These data support the general notion that striatal NMDA receptors represent a target for pharmacological management of motor disorders...|$|E

Remarkably, the application of low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz) for a short duration (3 - 5 min) resulted in the induction of a slow-onset long-term potentiation (LTP) {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stimulated electrode. This phenomenon was observed exclusively in the CA 1 subfield, neither in the CA 3 area nor in the dentate gyrus. The induction of this slow-onset LTP required neither N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) nor <b>non-NMDA</b> <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> activation but was strongly dependent on metabotropic glutamate mGlu(5) receptor stimulation and [Ca(2 +) ]i increase. In addition, this form of synaptic plasticity was associated with an increase in cAMP concentration and required protein kinase A activation. Paired-pulse facilitation ratio and presynaptic fiber volley amplitude were unaffected when this LTP was triggered, suggesting the involvement of postsynaptic modifications. Although mitogen activated protein kinase pathway was stimulated after the application of low frequency, the induction and maintenance of this slow-onset LTP were not dependent on the activation of this intracellular pathway. The direct activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin also induced a synaptic enhancement displaying similar features.

40|$|Summary—Heterologous {{expression}} of {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} (nAChR) RNAs in Xenopus oocytes {{was used to examine}} the structural basis for pharmacological and physiological differences between muscletype and neuronal nAChRs. Neuronal nAChRs have a higher permeability to calcium than muscle-type nAChRs and display inward rectification, while muscle-type nAChRs have a linear current–voltage relation. In addition, neuronal nAChRs are more sensitive to inhibition by a class of compounds known as “ganglionic blockers”. It has been shown previously that neuronal-muscle hybrid receptors show increased sensitivity to the usedependent inhibitor of neuronal nAChRs, BTMPS, based on the presence of a neuronal beta subunit. In this study, we report that omission of gamma subunit RNA has a similar abd effect. receptors exhibit prolonged inhibition by BTMPS, show a significant permeability to divalent ions, display inward rectification and are more sensitive to mecamylamine. However, while pharmacological effects are associated with the presence of an additional delta subunit, the physiological changes described seem {{to be associated with the}} presence or absence of a gamma subunit.

We investigated an interface between the nicotinic cholinergic and glutamatergic systems by measuring nicotinic receptor subunit transcript expression following administration of 6 -cyano- 7 -nitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (CNQX), an antagonist of the AMPA and kainate subtypes of glutamate receptors. Using [35 S] in situ hybridization, we measured expression of Α 2, Α 3, Α 4, Α 5, Α 7, Β 2, Β 3, and Β 4 nicotinic receptor subunit transcripts in the rat forebrain. Following 7 days of treatment with vehicle or CNQX (1 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day), changes in nicotinic receptor subunit transcript expression were restricted to subunits that form heteromeric receptors. We found increased levels of transcripts for Α 2 and Β 2 nicotinic receptor subunits in the hippocampus, decreased Α 4 subunit transcripts in the medial habenula and amygdala, and increased Β 2 subunit transcripts in the septum and piriform cortex. We did not detect changes in expression of transcripts for the Α 7 subunit, which forms homomeric nicotinic receptors.

Employing extracellular field potentials, current source density analysis, and intrasomatic and dendritic recordings, the present studies demonstrated the relative contribution of non-NMDA and NMDA receptors to sensory feedback synapses within a highly stratified in vitro slice preparation of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Results confirmed a significant contribution of both a non-NMDA, and a fast NMDA component to EPSPs evoked by stimulation of the tractus stratum fibrosum (tSF) pathway. A voltage-dependent synaptically-mediated persistent Na+ (slow) component of the tSF-evoked EPSP interacts with both fast NMDA and non-NMDA components, producing highly non-linear "thresholding" behaviour at the tSF synapses within the ventral molecular layer (VML) of the ELL.

In order to discriminate the effects of CBZ on the activation of glutamate receptors from possible effects on Ca 2 + channels, we determined the inhibitory effects of Ca 2 + channel blockers on [Ca 2 +]i changes in the absence or in the presence of CBZ. The presence of 1 [mu]M nitrendipine, 0. 5 [mu]M [omega]-conotoxin GVIA ([omega]-CgTx GVIA), or of both blockers, inhibited the kainate-stimulated increase in [Ca 2 +]i by 51. 6, 32. 9 or 68. 7 %, respectively. In the presence of both 100 [mu]M CBZ and nitrendipine, the inhibition was similar (54. 1 %) to that obtained with nitrendipine alone, but in the presence of both CBZ and [omega]-CgTx GVIA, the inhibition was greater (54 %) than that caused by [omega]-CgTx GVIA alone. However, CBZ did not inhibit the increase in [Na+]i stimulated by the glutamate receptor agonists, but inhibited the increase in [Na+]i due to veratridine.

40|$|Stimulation of {{neuronal}} cells by the excitatory amino acid, glutamate, {{often leads}} to a rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i), which can affect cell survival and differentiation. The early appearance of endogenous glutamate in the embryonic rabbit retina suggests {{that it may be}} involved in intercellular signalling during development. Thus, the effect of glutamate on the [Ca 2 +]iof cells in the fetal and neonatal rabbit retina was examined using Ca 2 + imaging techniques, which enabled the responses of large numbers of morphologically identified classes of cell to be compared directly. Ganglion cells and amacrine cells, the first retinal neurons to differentiate, showed a rise in [Ca 2 +]i in the presence of glutamate from the earliest age studied (embryonic day 20; E 20). These responses were mediated by non-NMDA (non-N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. NMDA stimulated ganglion cells and amacrine cells only several days later, at about E 24. Moreover, whilst most, if not all, putative ganglion cells responded to NMDA, only a subset of putative amacrine cells were sensitive to NMDA throughout development. Photoreceptors, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and Muller cells differentiate later than the ganglion cells and amacrine cells. Between E 20 and birth, cells in the ventricular zone are largely the precursors of these cell types. During this period, 50 - 60 % of ventricular cells responded to glutamate with an increase in [Ca 2 +]i, upon activation of <b>ionotropic</b> <b>non-NMDA</b> <b>receptors.</b> At no age studied were these ventricular cells, or their differentiated counterparts, stimulated by NMDA. After birth, most cells in the inner nuclear layer were sensitive to non-NMDA receptor agonists, but photoreceptors showed no response. Taken together, the results suggests that NMDA and non-NMDA receptors may adopt separate roles during retinal development, and that non-NMDA receptors, rather than NMDA receptors, may be involved in developmental processes in the ventricular zone...|$|R
40|$|Immune cells express plasma {{membrane}} receptors for extracellular nucleotides. Both G protein-linked metabotropic and channel-forming <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> have been described, although no P 2 receptor subtype has been cloned from {{the immune system}} thus far. Metabotropic receptors have been described in human B but not T lymphocytes; {{they have not been}} found in mouse B and T cells. <b>Ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> seem to be ubiquitously expressed in the immune system; however, their functional properties, if not their pharmacology, appear to be different in different immune cells. Human T normal and B leukaemic lymphocytes, human macrophages, mouse B and T lymphocytes, mouse microglial and macrophage cells, and rat mast cells express <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> that recognize ATP 4 - as the preferred ligand, are activated by 3 '-O-(4 -benzoyl) benzoyl ATP and inhibited by oxidized ATP. The pharmacological profile of <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> expressed by different immune cells is similar, but their permeability properties may be different: the pore formed by receptors expressed by macrophages, microglial cells and mast cells is typically permeable to charged molecules of molecular mass up to 900 Da; on the contrary, that expressed by lymphocytes has a molecular cut-off of 200 - 300 Da. The ionotrpic receptor of immune cells is modulated by inflammatory cytokines (e. g. interleukin [IL]- 2 and gamma-interferon) and is also modulated during monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Transient stimulation of the <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> of macrophages and microglial cells elicits IL- 1 beta release. Sustained activation leads to cell death, either by necrosis or apoptosis, depending on the given cell type...|$|R

Throughout life, activity-dependent changes in neuronal connection strength enable {{the brain to}} refine neural circuits and learn based on experience. In line with predictions made by Hebb, synapse strength can be modified depending on the millisecond timing of action potential firing (STDP). The sign of synaptic plasticity depends on the spike order of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. <b>Ionotropic</b> neurotransmitter <b>receptors,</b> such as NMDA receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, are intimately involved in setting the rules for synaptic strengthening and weakening. In addition, timing rules for STDP within synapses are not fixed. They can be altered by activation of <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> located at, or close to, synapses. Here, we will highlight studies that uncovered how network actions control and modulate timing rules for STDP by activating presynaptic <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Furthermore, we will discuss how interaction between different types of <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> may create “timing ” windows during which particular timing rules lead to synaptic changes. 1...|$|R

An increasing number of observations, however, point to a novel mechanism through which neurotransmitters can initiate biochemical signals and modulate neuronal excitability.

40|$|Glutamate is {{the most}} {{abundant}} excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. There are two distinct types of glutamate <b>receptors,</b> <b>ionotropic</b> and metabotropic, present in the mammalian excitatory synapses. My thesis {{is focused on the}} <b>ionotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors,</b> which play critical roles in learning and memory formation. The main subtypes of <b>ionotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors</b> are α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate receptors. All types of the <b>ionotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors,</b> which are assembled as tetramers, contain many glycosylation sites, which can be modified by glycans or monosaccharides. The glycans and monosaccharides attached to the <b>ionotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors</b> have been shown to regulate key processes such as folding of the subunits, transport to the cell surface as well as their functional properties. Recent literature also suggests that many neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia exhibit abnormal glycosylation of <b>ionotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors.</b> Thus, understanding of the molecular mechanisms, which regulate the glycosylation of the <b>ionotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors,</b> may be important for developing new therapies for the patients with altered functioning of the glutamatergic synapses in the [...] ...|$|R

Changes in pre-synaptic activity and in the function of various post-synaptic elements contribute to generate a large variety of synaptic responses. Previous studies have explored postsynaptic factors responsible for regulating synaptic strength variations, but have given far less importance to synaptic geometry, and more specifically to the subcellular distribution of <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors.</b> We analyzed the functional effects resulting from changing the subsynaptic localization of <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> by using a hippocampal synaptic computational framework. The present study was performed using the EONS (Elementary Objects of the Nervous System) synaptic modeling platform, which was specifically developed to explore the roles of subsynaptic elements {{as well as their}} interactions, and that of synaptic geometry. More specifically, we determined the effects of changing the localization of <b>ionotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> relative to the presynaptic glutamate release site, on synaptic efficacy and its variations following single pulse and paired-pulse stimulation protocols. The results indicate that changes in synaptic geometry do have consequences on synaptic efficacy and its dynamics...|$|R
