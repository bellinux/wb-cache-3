50|$|During the Middle Ages, leather craft was developed, as turnshoes and welt {{shoes were}} invented. Refined kinds of leather such as suede and <b>nubuck</b> were also introduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nubuck</b> {{characteristics}} {{are similar to}} aniline leather. It is soft to the touch, scratches easily, and water drops darken it temporarily (it dries to its original color).|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the finish}} desired, the hide may be waxed, rolled, lubricated, {{injected}} with oil, split, shaved and, of course, dyed. Suedes, <b>nubucks,</b> etc. are finished {{by raising the}} nap of the leather by rolling with a rough surface.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Nubuck</b> (pronounced [...] ) is top-grain cattle leather {{that has}} been sanded or buffed on the grain side, or outside, to give a slight nap of short protein fibers, {{producing}} a velvet-like surface. It is resistant to wear, and may be white or coloured.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nubuck</b> {{is similar}} to suede, but is created from the outer side of a hide, giving it more {{strength}} and thickness and a fine grain. It is generally more expensive than suede, and must be coloured or dyed heavily {{to cover up the}} sanding and stamping process.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{extraction}} of Eucalyptus globulus bark and a concentration strategy to obtain a phenolic-rich extract for application in the leather tanning industry. The profiles of total phenolic compounds (TPC) and tannins contents in water and dilute alkali {{as a function of}} extraction temperature and time led to the selection of the best conditions concerning extraction yield and selectivity. The selectivity profile for TPC and tannins was established, and a maximum of 20 g per kg of bark was found, representing 2. 5 g per L of extract produced. On the basis of these results, the conditions selected to produce the extract for the application envisaged in this work were: water, 140 degrees C and 120 min. To increase the extract concentration, recirculation of the extracts over fresh bark (similar to a continuous bark extraction process) was performed and evaluated. The increment in phenolic compounds was about 4, attaining the final concentration of 8. 6 g/L for TPC and 6. 5 g/L for tannins. The final extracts showed leather retanning aptitude equivalent to a commercial extract of chestnut and revealed good performance in the production of leather articles like box-calf and <b>nubuck...</b>|$|E
