40|$|The article {{describes}} an experimental study {{dealing with the}} possibility of <b>nanotextile</b> materials usa­ge for microbiologically contaminated water filtration. The aim of the study is to verify filtration ability of different <b>nanotextile</b> materials and evaluate the possibilities of practical usage. Good detention ability of these materials in the air filtration is the presumption for <b>nanotextile</b> to be used for bacteria filtration from a liquid. High <b>nanotextile</b> porosity with the <b>nanotextile</b> pores dimensions smaller than a bacteria size predicates the possibility of a successful usage of these materials. For the experiment were used materials made from electrospinning nanofibres under the label PA 612, PUR 1, PUR 2 s PUR 3 on the supporting unwoven textiles (viscose and PP). As a model simulation of the microbial contamination, bacteria Escherichia coli was chosen. Contaminated water was filtered during the overpressure activity of 105 Pa on the input side of the filter from the mentioned material. After three-day incubation on the nutrient medium, cultures found in the samples before and after filtration were compared. In the filtrated water, bacteria E. coli were indicated, which did not verify the theoretical presumptions about an absolut bacteria detention. However, used materials caught at least 94 % of bacteria in case of material PUR 1 and up to 99, 996 % in case of material PUR 2. These results predict the possibility of producing effective <b>nanotextile</b> filters for microbiologically contaminated water filtration. Recommendation: For the production of materials with better filtrating qualities, experiments need to be done, enabling better understanding of the bacteria detention mechanisms on the <b>nanotextile</b> material, and parameters of the used materials that influence the filtrating abilities need to be verified...|$|E

50|$|Nano-silver is {{expected}} to have as much as 49.5% of its global production taken by the <b>nanotextiles</b> industry due to its antibacterial properties. It is predicted that 20% of the nano-silver used in the nanofabrics industry will be released into waterways which could cause harm to microorgansims. However, more than 90% of nano-silver is removed during treatment at wastewater facilities, so {{it is likely that the}} environmental impact will be minimal. A study on aluminum oxide nanoparticles showed that inhalation caused inflammation in rat lungs. Aluminum oxide nanoparticles are not used in large quantity, so its health risks are negligible. Other studies conducted for nanoparticles suggest that their environmental impact should be low as the <b>nanotextiles</b> industry continues to grow.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of smart <b>nanotextiles</b> {{has the potential}} to revolutionize the functionality of our clothing and the fabrics in our surroundings. Nanoscale manipulation results in new functionalities for intelligent textiles, including self-cleaning, sensing, actuating, and communicating. This is made possible by such developments as new materials, fibers, and finishings; inherently conducting polymers; carbon nanotubes; and antimicrobial nanocoatings. These additional functionalities have numerous applications, encompassing healthcare, sports, military applications, and fashion. The wearer and the surrounding environment may be monitored in an innocuous manner, giving continuous updates of individual health status or environmental hazards. More generally, smart textiles become a critical part of the emerging area of body sensor networks incorporating sensing, actuation, control, and wireless data transmission.

40|$|Abstract. The unique {{properties}} of <b>nanotextiles</b> based on poly(vinyl-alcohol) (PVA) manufactured using the electrospinning method {{have been known}} and exploited for many years. Recently, the enrichment of nanofiber textiles with nanoparticles, such as ions or nanodiamond particles (NDP), has become a popular way to modify the textile mechanical, chemical and physical {{properties of}} the textile. The aim of our study is to investigate the macromechanical properties of PVA <b>nanotextiles</b> enriched with NDP, silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) ions. Nanofiber textiles of various surface weights were prepared from a 16 % PVA solution, while glyoxal and phosphoric acid were used as cross-linking agents. The copper and silver ions were diluted in an aqueous solution and NDP were dispersed into the fibers by ultrasound homogenization. All {{but one of the}} sets of samples were exposed to a temperature of 140 °C for 10 minutes. The samples without thermal stabilization exhibited significantly lower elastic stiffness and tensile strength. Moreover, the results of tensile testing indicate that the addition of dispersed nanoparticles has a minor effect on the mechanical properties of the textiles and contributes rather to their reinforcement. However, the lack of thermal stabilization results in a poor interconnection of individual nanofiber layers, and the non-stabilized textiles exhibit lower elastic stiffness and reduced tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|Nanoscience and {{nanotechnology}} are {{the study}} and application of extremely small things {{and can be used}} across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering. Nanotechnology overcomes the limitation of applying conventional methods to impart certain properties to textile materials. There is no doubt that {{in the next few years}} nanotechnology will penetrate into every area of the textile industry. <b>Nanotextiles</b> are nanoscale fibrous materials that can be fictionalized with a vast array of novel properties, including antibiotic activity, self-cleaning and the ability to increase reaction rates by providing large surface areas to potential reactants. These materials are used not only as cloth fabric, but as filter materials, wound-healing gauzes and antibacterial food packaging agents in food industry. World demand for nano-materials will rise more than two-and-a-half times to $ 5. 5 billion in 2016 driven by a combination of increased market penetration of existing materials, and ongoing development of new materials and applications. In recent years was demonstrated that nanotechnology can be used to enhance textile attributes, such as fabric softness, durability and breathability, water repellency, fire retardancy, antimicrobial properties in fibers, yarns and fabrics. The development of smart <b>nanotextiles</b> has the potential to revolutionize the production of fibers, fabrics or nonwovens and functionality of our clothing and all types of textile products and applications. Nanotechnology is considered one of the most promising technologies for the 21 st century. Today is said that if the IT is the wave of the present, the nanotechnology is the wave of the present, the nanotechnology is the wave of the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of metal nanoparticle (NP) -coated textiles (<b>nanotextiles)</b> {{is achieved by}} a dipping process in water without toxic chemicals or complicated synthetic procedures. By {{taking advantage of the}} unique nature of tannic acid, metal-phenolic network-coated textiles serve as reducing and stabilizing sites for the generation of metal nanoparticles of controllable size. The textiles can be decorated with various metal nanoparticles, including palladium, silver, or gold, and exhibit properties derived from the presence of the metal nanoparticles, for example, catalytic activity in water (> 96 % over five cycles using palladium nanoparticles) and antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (inhibition of Escherichia coli using silver nanoparticles) that outperforms a commercial bandage. The reported strategy offers opportunities for the development of hybrid nanomaterials that may have application in fields outside of catalysis and antimicrobials, such as sensing and smart clothing. embarg...|$|R
30|$|Vanadium oxides (e.g., V 6 O 13, V 3 O 7, V 2 O 5) are cathode {{materials}} applicable for high-energy {{lithium-ion battery}} (LIB), {{due to their}} low cost, high specific capacities, and the abundance of vanadium element [1 – 6]. Among the oxides, V 6 O 13 has been considered as an excellent candidate of the cathode material [7 – 14]. Its theoretical capacity and energy density can reach 417  mA h g− 1 and 890  Wh kg− 1 when lithiated to the final product, Li 8 V 6 O 13 [2, 8]. However, V 6 O 13 electrodes have suffered short cycle life and low rate capability {{for a long time}} because V 6 O 13 ’s electronic conductivity decreases when lithiated while Li+ diffusion coefficients (10 − 8 to 10 − 9  cm 2  S− 1) are low [7, 9]. Constructing free-standing 3 D nanostructures is an effective method to solve the above problems. 3 D nanostructure can enhance ion/electron transport/diffusion while effectively avoids self-aggregation [15 – 20]. For example, Yu et al. synthesized 3 D V 6 O 13 <b>nanotextiles</b> assembled from interconnected nanogrooves via a facile solution-redox-based self-assembly route with MnO 2 template at room temperature. In a voltage range of 1 – 4  V, V 6 O 13 <b>nanotextiles</b> exhibited reversible capacities of 326 and 134  mA h g− 1 at 20 and 500  mA g− 1, respectively, and a capacity retention of above 80 % after 100  cycles at 500  mA g− 1 [2]. Tong et al. fabricated V 6 O 13 cathode supported by a steel mesh with wrinkles by the similar route. The free-standing electrode with a loading amount of V 6 O 13 up to 2.0  mg cm− 2 was obtained. At a current density of 500  mA g− 1, the V 6 O 13 electrode demonstrated an initial capacity of 225  mA h g− 1 that deteriorated to around 150  mA h g− 1 after 500  cycles [21]. However, above research involved the two-step electrodeposition and removal of MnO 2. Direct growth of mixed-valence vanadium oxide nanostructure with good electrochemical property remains a great challenge [22]. Meanwhile, previous studies have not demonstrated V 6 O 13 -based flexible cathode, which has a potential use in the wearable devices.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} towards {{the design of}} smart <b>nanotextiles</b> with innovative properties is presented. Silica (SiO 2), titania (TiO 2), and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs), were synthesized {{without the use of}} any toxic organic compound and then were used, alone and in combination, to functionalize wool fabrics. Electrostatic forces, influenced by a low pH of the solutions, allowed the interactions between wool fabrics and NPs, enabling a robust functionalization. This was verified by X-ray microfluorescence and visualized by scanning electron microscopy measurements. The antibacterial Ag NPs were embedded in a polymer, alginic acid, to reduce the possible side effect due to their direct contact with the skin. SiO 2 NPs, instead, were used to change the hydrophilicity of wool while the functionalization with TiO 2 NPs was chosen to provide self-cleaning properties. The antibacterial activity of the fabrics was studied against the bacteria Escherichia coli, while the hydrophilicity of wool was studied by contact angle measurements and the self-cleaning properties were tested by estimating the visible discoloring of a dye stain under sunlight irradiation. Interestingly the combination of three different types of NPs provided the best results. SiO 2 and Ag made the wool superhydrophilic providing {{at the same time the}} best antibacterial properties, while fabrics with titania (alone or in combination) were hydrophobic and showed the best self-cleaning properties...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) This exegesis {{and studio}} praxis explores artistic {{responses}} to {{changes taking place}} in science and society due to the nanotech revolution. More specifically, it explores these revolutionary changes artistically and philosophically through the perspective of nanotech/technical textiles. The author’s research asserts that <b>nanotextiles</b> and wearable apparel are intelligent ‘second skins’ that transform our understanding of how smart technologies merge with nature and environment to produce particular affects. The catalyst for this research was an interest in creating speculative material approaches to exploring spaces in-between, across and beyond established art science divides with a view to producing art based upon re-tooling nanotech textiles. To this end, this thesis analyses the role of artists as agents of transformation, sustainability and innovation beyond the utilitarian expectations of design practice. Underpinning this research is the premise that exemplary artistic projects can speculatively reflect upon the world of nanoscience {{in a manner that is}} discursive, collaborative, transdisciplinary, imaginative, and serendipitous. Significantly, this imaginative realm is free from valuation based upon scientific measurement. By extension, this project proposes that artists are meaningfully responding to substantial shifts in perspective availed by invisible structures of materiality at molecular, atomic and subatomic scales. Accordingly, the studio-based component of this thesis reflects both materially and speculatively upon new ‘active’ and highly-functional fibres and textiles manifest in a space in-between, across and beyond art and emerging science and new textile technologies...|$|R
40|$|Textiles are {{ubiquitous}} to us, enveloping {{our skin}} and surroundings. Not {{only do they}} provide a protective shield or act as a comforting cocoon but they also serve esthetic appeal and cultural importance. Recent technologies have allowed the traditional functionality of textiles to be extended. Advances in materials science have added intelligence to textiles and created ‘smart’ clothes. Smart textiles can sense and react to environmental conditions or stimuli, e. g., from mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, or magnetic sources (Lam Po Tang and Stylios 2006). Such textiles find uses in many applications ranging from military and security to personalized healthcare, hygiene, and entertainment. Smart textiles may be termed ‘‘passive’’ or ‘‘active. ’’ A passive smart textile monitors the wearer’s physiology or the environment, e. g., a shirt with in-built thermistors to log body temperature over time. If actuators are integrated, the textile becomes an active, smart textile as it may respond to a particular stimulus, e. g., the temperature-aware shirt may automatically roll up the sleeves when body temperature rises. The fundamental components in any smart textile are sensors and actuators. Interconnections, power supply, {{and a control unit}} are also needed to complete the system. All these components must be integrated into textiles while still retaining the usual tactile, flexible, and comfortable properties that we expect from a textile. Adding new functionalities to textiles while still maintaining {{the look and feel of}} the fabric is where nanotechnology has a huge impact on the textile industry. This article describes current developments in materials for smart <b>nanotextiles</b> and some of the many applications where these innovative textiles are of great benefit...|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, modern {{chemistry}} and engineering churn out {{huge amounts of}} nanoobjects {{in order to improve}} utility properties of matter not only in special applications but increasingly in products of everyday consumption. Nanostructured materials, i.e., nanoparticles [1, 2], nanorods [3], nanotubes [4], nonwoven <b>nanotextiles</b> [5], as they stand or attached to different kinds of supports, significantly increase yields in almost all areas of industrial applications ranging from cosmetics [6] and health care [7], over bioengineering [8, 9], up to energy conversion applications [10], and catalysts [3]. While the inclusion of nanomaterials in these products can enhance their performance, their breakdown {{at the end of their}} useful lifetime provides several key points of entry for synthetic NPs into the environment. Especially engineered NPs, which has been extensively used in catalysts, UV-protective dye stabilizers, antimicrobial agents in textile industry, or health care products and cosmetics (in particular that of high chemical inertness such as Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd) must be given special attention, since they may accumulate in the environment almost unchanged for many years, triggering so far unknown processes upon their plant uptake. Concerning noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs), some pioneering works has been published on the effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on seedlings of thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), indicating that very low concentrations of AgNPs (<[*] 1  ppm) could be toxic to the seedlings [11]. AgNPs of 20 to 80  nm clearly stunted the growth, and their phytotoxicity is concentration and particle size dependent. The root tip (cap and columella) were observed to turn light brown when primary roots were exposed to AgNPs. The brown tip was attributed to the adsorption of AgNPs either itself or in conjunction with cell wall materials or secondary metabolites produced by root tips. However, the exact mechanism has not been elucidated yet.|$|R
