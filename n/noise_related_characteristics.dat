40|$|This basic {{lecture on}} {{propeller}} noise summarizes the fundamental noise generating mechanisms for subsonic tip speed propellers. Based on {{that the effects}} on noise of different geometrical and operational parameters are presented. Realistic propeller installations often cause excessive noise to be generated. This {{may be due to}} oblique or disturbed inflow conditions and non-uniform rotational speed. <b>Related</b> <b>noise</b> <b>characteristics</b> and governing parameters are discussed. Flyover noise measurement and -analysis techniques are described and examples of typical test results are provided...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} experimental {{program was}} conducted to develop a data base for the <b>noise</b> and <b>related</b> flow <b>characteristics</b> of upper surface blown configurations. The effect of various geometric and flow parameters was investigated experimentally. The dominant noise was identified from the measured flow and noise characteristics to be generated downstream of the trailing edge. The possibilities of noise reduction techniques were explored. An upper surface blown (USB) noise prediction program was developed to calculate noise levels at any point and noise contours (footprints). Using this noise prediction program and a cruise performance data base, aircraft design studies were conducted to integrate low noise and good performance characteristics. A theory was developed for the noise from the highly sheared layer of a trailing edge wake. Theoretical results compare favorably with the measured noise of the USB model...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be observed in children, and that these characteristics are associated with increased risk for the development of borderline personality disorder. It is not clear whether borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> in children share etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated the etiology of borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> in a longitudinal cohort study of 1, 116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12 years. Borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> measured at age 12 years were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment through age 10 years predicted borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> at age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness, consistent with diathesis–stress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate that borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> in children share etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive contributions to borderline etiology...|$|R

40|$|Objective To examine ethnic {{disparities in}} {{maternal}} prepregnancy obesity and gestational weight gain, {{and to examine}} to which extent these differences {{can be explained by}} socio-demographic, lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Methods In a multi-ethnic population-based prospective cohort study among 6444 pregnant women in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, maternal anthropometrics were repeatedly measured throughout pregnancy. Ethnicity, socio-demographic, lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> were assessed by physical examinations and questionnaires. Results The prevalence of prepregnancy overweight and obesity was 23. 1 % among Dutch-origin women. Statistically higher prevalences were observed among Dutch Antillean-origin (40. 8 %), Moroccan-origin (49. 9 %), Surinamese-Creole-origin (38. 6 %) and Turkish-origin (41. 1 %) women (all p-values < 0. 05). Only Dutch Antillean-origin, Moroccan-origin, Surinamese-Creole-origin and Turkish-origin women had higher risks of maternal prepregnancy overweight and obesity as compared to Dutch-origin women (p-values < 0. 05). Socio-demographic and lifestyle <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> explained up to 45 % of the ethnic differences in body mass index. Compared to Dutch-origin women, total gestational weight gain was lower in all ethnic minority groups, except for Cape Verdean-origin and Surinamese-Creole-origin women (p-values < 0. 05). Lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> explained up to 33 % and 40 % of these associations, respectively. The largest ethnic differences in gestational weight gain were observed in late pregnancy. Conclusion We observed moderate ethnic differences in maternal prepregnancy overweight, obesity and gestational weight gain. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> partly explained these differences. Whether these differences also lead to ethnic differences in maternal and childhood outcomes should be further studied...|$|R

The primary data from 184 agro-pastoralist households were collected using a structured questionnaire.

The result showed that the probability of household willingness to pay (WTP) was influenced by both animal and household <b>related</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Animal <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> that had a significant influence on the probability of households WTP for NMB’s of cattle included: Animal age (ANAGE), herd size (HERDSIZE) and cattle breeds (INDBRED).
