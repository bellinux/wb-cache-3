40|$|We {{studied the}} {{regional}} genetic diversity and seed exchange dynamics of pearl millet landraces in southwestern Niger. The genetic study {{was based on}} AFLP markers. We found significant genetic differentiation between landraces in different geographical areas of southwestern Niger. However, the degree of differentiation was low insofar as only 1. 9 % of the total molecular diversity was due to regional differentiation, suggesting a relatively high gene flow. Anthropologic studies on farming practices have suggested that seed exchanges between farmers on a large geographical scale probably make a considerable contribution to this result. In order to test this hypothesis, the effects of seed exchange on the genetic diversity of landraces was analyzed on seed samples from two distant villages in contrasting areas of south-western <b>Niger.</b> <b>Seeds</b> imported by farmers into the southern village of Sina Koara {{did not differ significantly}} from locally grown landraces.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the spasmolytic, antidiarrhoeal, antisecretory, bronchodilatory and urinary bladder relaxant properties of Hyoscyamus niger to rationalize {{some of its}} medicinal uses. The crude extract of H. <b>niger</b> <b>seeds</b> (Hn.

Cr inhibited contractions induced by carbachol (1 mu M) and K(+) (80 mM) in a pattern {{similar to that of}} dicyclomine, but different from verapamil and atropine. Hn. Cr shifted the Ca(2 +) concentration-response curves to the right, similar to that caused by verapamil and dicyclomine, suggesting a Ca(2 +) channel-blocking mechanism in addition to an anticholinergic effect. In the guinea-pig ileum, Hn. Cr produced a rightward parallel shift of the acetylcholine curves, followed by a non-parallel shift with suppression of the maximum response at a higher concentration, similar to that caused by dicyclomine, but different from that of verapamil and atropine. Hn. Cr exhibited antidiarrhoeal and antisecretory effects against castor oil-induced diarrhoea and intestinal fluid accumulation in mice. In guinea-pig trachea and rabbit urinary bladder tissues, Hn. Cr caused relaxation of carbachol (1 mu M) and K(+) (80 mM) induced contractions at around 10 and 25 times lower concentrations than in gut, respectively, and shifted carbachol curves to the right. Only the organic fractions of the extract had a Ca(2 +) antagonist effect, whereas both organic and aqueous fractions had anticholinergic effect. A constituent, beta-sitosterol exhibited Ca(2 +) channel-blocking action. These results suggest that the antispasmodic effect of H. niger is mediated through a combination of anticholinergic and Ca(2 +) antagonist mechanisms. The relaxant effects of Hn.

Gibberellic acid (GA 3) and chilling treatment strongly promoted seed germination which {{was accompanied by}} increased α-amylase activity. KNO 3, NaN 3 and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, also promoted germination. During storage, the seeds retained high viability even after a storage of 72 months under ambient conditions.

The sensitivity of the dermatophytic fungi Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes to 405 nm violet-blue light exposure was investigated, and the results compared with those obtained with the saprophytic fungus Aspergillus niger.

Results: A. niger conidia showed greater resistance, and colonial growth developed after light exposure. In liquid suspension tests, 405 nm light dose levels of 360, 720, and 1440 J/cm 2 resulted in complete inactivation of T. rubrum microconidia, whereas A. niger showed greater resistance, and at the highest dose level applied (1440 J/cm 2) although A niger hyphae were completely inactivated, only a 3 -log 10 reduction of a 5 -log 10 conidial suspension was achieved. The study results demonstrate the relatively high sensitivity of Trichophyton microconidia to 405 nm violet-blue light, and this is may be of potential interest regarding the control and treatment of dermatophyte infections...|$|R
