Aims {{of the study were}} to evaluate their utility in discriminating between cardiac and non-cardiac chest pain, and to identify those "chest pain-enzyme negative" patients who are at high risk of developing acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The results obtained showed that WBC (p < 0. 0001) and fibrinogen (p < 0. 0001) significantly discriminated AMI patients. However, only male gender (p < 0. 03), abnormal CK-MB% (p < 0. 0001) and neutrophil counts (p < 0. 0001) were independently related to AMI. The combined determination of neutrophils and CK-MB% increased the sensitivity from 50 % (for CK-MB% alone) to 70 % (p < 0. 05), with a negative predictive value similar to that observed for CK-MB% alone.

However, more recent studies suggest that <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> inhibit the wound repair process. To investigate the role of neutrophils in wounds, mice were neutrophil-depleted by injection with rabbit anti-mouse neutrophil serum. Remarkably, epidermal healing, measured by wound closure, proceeded significantly faster in neutropenic than control mice (77. 7 � 14. 2 % vs. 41. 2 � 0. 9 %, P< 0. 02 at day 2). Dermal healing was not affected by neutrophil depletion, as neither collagen deposition nor wound-breaking strength was significantly different between neutropenic and control mice. As the delayed repair of diabetic individuals exhibits robust inflammation, the effect of neutrophil depletion on diabetic wound healing was investigated. Similar to the observations in wild-type mice, wound closure was accelerated by nearly 50 % in neutropenic, diabetic mice.

The mean values of age, skin reaction to Candida albicans (C. albicans), serum IgE levels, specific IgE antibodies to house dust (HD) and C. albicans, bronchial sensitivity and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) synthesis from peripheral venous blood in patients with DIA were not significantly different from those in patients with non-DIA. In contrast, the frequency of positive skin reaction to HD and histamine release from peripheral basophils by anti-IgE were significantly lower in DIA than in non-DIA. These results agree with the reports that DIA was often observed in non-atopic asthma. But, the mean value of serum IgE was very high in DIA as well as in non-DIA.

The major virulence factors in the development of gastric inflammation are VacA, CagA and HPNAP.

Agents (natural or chemical) inhibiting the HPNAP mediated <b>neutrophil</b> activation <b>might</b> be of great medical importance.

Lymphocyte blastogenesis and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by PHA and Candida antigen in intractable asthmatics was significantly suppressed dose-dependently by OKY- 046.

The rate of neutrophil recruitment into the mammary gland and their bactericidal activity largely affect the severity and outcome of the disease.

The disease is associated with high blood and milk levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), previously shown to negatively affect neutrophil function by unknown mechanisms. We show here that the mammary pathogenic E. coli strain P 4 activates normal bovine neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are highly bactericidal against this organism. Preincubation of these neutrophils with increasing concentrations (0. 1 to 8 mmol/liter) of BHBA caused a fivefold decrease of E. coli P 4 phagocytosis, though intracellular killing was unaffected. Furthermore, BHBA caused a 10 -fold decrease in the NETs formed by E. coli P 4 -activated neutrophils and a similar decrease in NET bactericidal activity against this organism.

30|$|During ARDS, {{lung edema}} and endothelial/epithelial cell damage promote the {{recruitment}} and activation of neutrophils in interstitial and bronchoalveolar spaces. The overwhelming inflammatory response associated with ARDS not only targets the lung but also causes persistent elevation of circulating protease and cytokine levels, and primed or hyperactivated neutrophil numbers, leading to extrapulmonary organ dysfunction [2, 33]. The mechanisms that regulate this acute, severe inflammatory response are poorly understood. <b>Neutrophils</b> themselves <b>might</b> help to dampen this inflammation, by releasing IL- 1 RA or TGF-β, by adopting an immunosuppressive phenotype (CD 16 bright CD 62 -Ldim) or {{by engaging in}} crosstalk with other immune cells [34, 35].

Controversy exists as to whether infants suffer from virus-induced lung pathology or from excessive immune responses. Furthermore, detailed knowledge {{about the development of}} primary T-cell responses to viral infections in infants is lacking. We studied the dynamics of innate neutrophil and adaptive T-cell responses in peripheral blood in relation to theviral load and parameters of disease in infants admitted to the intensive care unit with severe RSV infection. Analysis of primary T-cell responses showed substantial CD 8 (+) T-cell activation, which peaked during convalescence. A strong neutrophil response, characterized by mobilization of bone marrow-derived neutrophil precursors, preceded the peak in T-cell activation. The kinetics of this neutrophil response followed the peak of clinical symptoms and the viral load with a 2 - to 3 -day delay. From the sequence of events, we conclude that CD 8 (+) T-cell responses, initiated during primary RSV infections, are unlikely to contribute to disease when it is most severe.

We hypothesized that the NET formation of <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> be changed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, explaining their higher incidence of coronary artery diseases (CAD). Method. A cross-sectional study was performed in 60 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, 30 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (HV, negative control), and 30 patients with acute infection (positive control). Neutrophil activation and function were measured with reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, degranulation, NET formation, and phenotypical changes. Result. Compared with HV, neutrophils extracted from MHD patients displayed significantly increased levels of basal NET formation, ROS production, and degranulation, suggesting spontaneous activation in uremia. Also, an increase in citrullinated histone H 3 was detected in this group compared to the HV. And neutrophils from HV were normal CD 16 bright/CD 62 Lbright cells; however, neutrophils from MHD were CD 16 bright/CD 62 Ldim, similar to those from patients with acute infections. Interestingly, multivariate analyses identified the prevalent CAD and neutrophil counts as independent determinants of baseline NET formation (β= 0. 323, p= 0. 016 and β= 0. 369, p= 0. 006, resp.).

Immunoelectron microscopy identified these fibrinogen products to be located within electron lucent vesicles, and not {{on the surface of the}} cell, suggesting that they are internalized. Although a specific interaction between fibrinogen and the <b>neutrophil</b> membrane <b>might</b> assist uptake, in the presence of physiological concentrations of fibrinogen, internalization occurred largely via a non-specific pinocytic process. Studies at low temperature revealed that both intact and degraded forms of fibrinogen can associate with neutrophils. The fibrinogen products detected intracellularly in experiments performed at 37 degrees C might represent uptake of degraded as well as intact forms of fibrinogen, the latter being rapidly degraded intracellularly. This route of fibrinogenolysis contributes minimally to the overall extent of the degradation process, the majority occurring extracellularly. Neutrophils thus possess a proteolytic mechanism for preventing accumulation of surface ligand, perhaps allowing them to evade the immunomodulatory effects of such ligands during inflammation...|$|R
