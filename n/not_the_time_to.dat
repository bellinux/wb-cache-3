500|$|As of November 13, 2009, Borris {{maintained}} that Bonds {{was still not}} retired. On December 9, however, Borris told the San Francisco Chronicle that Bonds had played his last major league game. Bonds announced on April 11, 2010, that {{he was proud of}} McGwire for admitting his use of steroids. Bonds said that it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> retire, but he noted that he was not in shape to play immediately if an interested club called him. [...] In May 2015, Bonds filed a grievance against Major League Baseball through the players' union arguing that the league colluded in not signing him after the 2007 season. [...] In August 2015, an arbitrator ruled in favor of MLB and against Bonds in his collusion case.|$|E
500|$|Stewart {{declared}} that his rally {{was intended for}} the majority of Americans, [...] "the 70–80 percenters," [...] who do not hold extreme political views and lack a voice in the media. To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: [...] "Take it down a notch for America." [...] A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as [...] "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." [...] Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own [...] "March to Keep Fear Alive." [...] Noting that this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be reasonable, Colbert declared, [...] "Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom!" ...|$|E

500|$|As the German Emperor, he officially {{received}} Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (his mother-in-law) and King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, {{and attended}} {{the wedding of}} his son Prince Henry to his niece Princess Irene. However, Frederick reigned for only 99days, {{and was unable to}} bring about much lasting change. The majority of the German ruling elite viewed Frederick's reign as merely a brief interim period before the accession of his son Wilhelm to the throne. [...] An edict he penned before he ascended to the throne that would limit the powers of the chancellor and monarch under the constitution was never put into effect, although he did force Robert von Puttkamer to resign as Prussian Minister of the Interior on 8 June, when evidence indicated that Puttkamer had interfered in the Reichstag elections. Dr. Mackenzie wrote that the Emperor had [...] "an almost overwhelming sense of the duties of his position". In a letter to Lord Napier, Empress Victoria wrote [...] "The Emperor is able to attend to his business, and do a great deal, but not being able to speak is, of course, most trying." [...] Frederick had the fervour but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> accomplish his desires, lamenting in May 1888, [...] "I cannot die ... What would happen to Germany?" ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Conkling then {{submitted}} {{a resolution that}} bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who was sitting at the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever." [...] Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation. He scribbled a note to Garfield which read, [...] "New York requests that Ohio's real candidate and dark horse come forward...R.C." ...|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do it.... Give me a few days. Give me {{to the end of the}} week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

40|$|Classical search {{algorithms}} such as A * or IDA * {{are useful}} for computing optimal solutions in a single pass, which can then be executed. But in many domains agents either do <b>not</b> have <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> compute complete plans before acting, or should <b>not</b> spend <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do so, due to the dynamic nature of the environment. Extensions to A * such as LRTA* address this problem by gradually learning an exact heuristic function, but the learning process is quite slow. In this paper we introduce Partial–Refinement A * (PRA*), which can fully interleave planning and acting through path abstraction and refinement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PRA* {{in the domain of}} real–time strategy (RTS) games. In maps taken from popular RTS games, we show that PRA * is not only able to cleanly interleave planning and execution, but i...|$|R
