Different symmetry of dangling unoccupied d-bonds on CoO(0 0 1) and NiO(0 0 1) explains the origin of an order of magnitude difference in the contrast of tunnelling images observed for the two surfaces.

50|$|Butyl {{acrylate}} can {{be produced}} in several reactions. Acetylene, 1-butyl alcohol, carbon <b>monoxide,</b> <b>nickel</b> carbonyl, and hydrochloric acid can react to make butyl acrylate. Another synthesis of butyl acrylate involves the reaction of butanol with methyl acrylate or acrylic acid.|$|R
25|$|For this reason, nickel in any tubing or part {{must not}} come into {{prolonged}} contact with carbon <b>monoxide.</b> <b>Nickel</b> carbonyl decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces, and this method {{is used for the}} industrial purification of nickel in the Mond process.|$|R
50|$|Steps 2 and 3 {{illustrate}} a chemical transport reaction, exploiting the properties that (1) carbon <b>monoxide</b> and <b>nickel</b> readily combine {{to give a}} volatile complex and (2) this complex degrades back to <b>nickel</b> and carbon <b>monoxide</b> at higher temperatures. The decomposition may be engineered to produce powder, but more commonly an existing substrate is coated with nickel. For example, nickel pellets are made by dropping small, hot pellets through the carbonyl gas; this deposits a layer of nickel onto the pellets.|$|R

We show that by taking better account of strong Coulomb correlations between electrons in the 5 f shell of uranium ions in UO 2 and in the 3 d shell of nickel ions in NiO it is possible to arrive at a better description of electron energy loss spectra, cohesive energies and elastic constants of both oxides compared with local spin density functional theory. For NiO we also compare the LSDA + U results and EELS spectra with a self-interaction corrected LSDA calculation. 1...|$|E
40|$|The oxide {{films of}} nickel {{electrode}} formed in 30 wt. % KOH solution under potentiodynamic conditions {{were characterized by}} means of electrochemical, in situ PhotoElectrochemistry Measurement (PEM) and Confocal Microprobe Raman spectroscopic techniques. The results showed that a composite oxide film was produced on nickel electrode, in which aroused cathodic or anodic photocurrent depending upon polarization potentials. The cathodic photocurrent at - 0. 8 V was raised from the amorphous film containing nickel hydroxide and <b>nickel</b> <b>monoxide,</b> and mainly attributed {{to the formation of}} NiO through the separation of the cavity and electron when laser light irradiates nickel electrode. With the potential increasing to more positive values, Ni 3 O 4 and high-valence nickel oxides with the structure of NiO 2 were formed successively. The composite film formed in positive potential aroused anodic photocurrent from 0. 33 V. The anodic photocurrent was attributed the formation of oxygen through the cavity reaction with hydroxyl on solution interface. In addition, it is demonstrated that the reduction resultants of high-valence nickel oxides were amorphous, and the oxide film could not be reduced completely. A stable oxide film could be gradually formed on the surface of nickel electrode with the cycling and aging in 30 wt. % KOH solution. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All tights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Layered Li[Li 0. 2 Mn 0. 56 Ni 0. 16 Co 0. 08]O- 2 cathode {{materials}} were synthesized via a solid-state reaction for Li-ion batteries, in which lithium hydroxide monohydrate, manganese dioxide, <b>nickel</b> <b>monoxide,</b> and cobalt monoxide were employed as metal precursors. To uncover {{the relationship between}} the structure and electrochemical properties of the materials, synthesis conditions such as calcination temperature and time as well as quenching methods were investigated. For the synthesized Li[Li 0. 2 Mn 0. 56 Ni 0. 16 Co 0. 08]O- 2 materials, the metal components were found to be in the form of Mn 4 +, Ni 2 +, and Co 3 +, and their molar ratio was in good agreement with stoichiometric ratio of 0. 56 : 0. 16 : 0. 08. Among them, the one synthesized at 800 degrees C for 12 h and subsequently quenched in air showed the best electrochemical performances, which had an initial discharge specific capacity and coulombic efficiency of 265. 6 mAh/g and 84. 0 %, respectively, and when cycled at 0. 5, 1, and 2 C, the corresponding discharge specific capacities were 237. 3, 212. 6, and 178. 6 mAh/g, respectively. After recovered to 0. 1 C rate, the discharge specific capacity became 259. 5 mAh/g and the capacity loss was only 2. 3 % of the initial value at 0. 1 C. This work suggests that the solid-state synthesis route is easy for preparing high performance Li[Li 0. 2 Mn 0. 56 Ni 0. 16 Co 0. 08]O- 2 cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.

40|$|X-ray {{absorption}} spectroscopy (XAS) {{is a useful}} tool for obtaining structural and chemical information about the active sites of metalloproteins and metalloenzymes. Information may be obtained from both the edge region and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) or post-edge region of the K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum of a metal center in a compound. The edge contains information about the valence electronic structure of the atom that absorbs the:X-raysi It is possible in some systems to infer the redox state of the metal atom in question, as well as the geometry and nature of ligands connected to it, from the features in the edge in a straightforward manner. The EXAFS modulations, being produced by the backscattering of the ejected photoelectron from the atoms surrounding the metal atom, provide, when analyzed, information about the number and type of neighbouring atoms, and the distances at which they occur. In this thesis, analysis of both the edge and EXAFS regions has been used to gain information about the active sites of various metalloproteins.

5000|$|Ludwig Mond, one of {{the founders}} of Imperial Chemical Industries, {{investigated}} in the 1890s with Carl Langer and Friedrich Quincke various processes for the recovery of chlorine which was lost in the Solvay process by nickel metals, oxides and salts. As part of their experiments the group treated <b>nickel</b> with carbon <b>monoxide.</b> They found that the resulting gas colored the gas flame of a burner in a greenish-yellowish color; when heated in a glass tube it formed a nickel mirror. The gas could be condensed to a colorless, water-clear liquid with a boiling point of 43 °C. Thus, Mond and his coworker had discovered the first pure, homoleptic metal carbonyl, nickel tetracarbonyl (Ni(CO)4). The unusual high volatility of the metal compound nickel tetracarbonyl led Kelvin with the statement that Mond had [...] "given wings to the heavy metals".|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the course}} of the {{development}} of new materials for inert anodes in the aluminum electrolysis process, cermets {{have been shown to be}} good candidates due to combined properties of conduction and resistance to corrosion. At temperatures as high as 900 - 1000 °C, these materials must be particularly resistant, not only to the corrosion by the electrolytic bath, but also to the corrosion by the gaseous atmosphere, which contains oxygen and fluorides. This study was devoted to the kinetics of oxidation in air of a cermet composed with nickel ferrite (NixFe 3 -xO 4), nickel oxide (NiyFe 1 -yO) and nickel-copper alloy (CuzNi 1 -z). First, we present thermogravimetric measurements at 960 °C and PO 2 in the range 1 – 200 hPa and SEM observations of the oxidized samples. The influence of oxygen pressure on the rate of oxidation was determined by means of sudden changes in PO 2 in {{the course of}} oxidation experiments. The data indicate that over a partial oxygen pressure of 51 hPa (PCu), the oxygen pressure did not influence the rate of oxidation. The presence of the two copper oxides, CuO and Cu 2 O explains this independence. Thermodynamically, the coexistence of those two oxides determines the partial oxygen pressure under this interface. Below PCu, only Cu 2 O was detected in the outermost layer of the oxidized samples, and the oxidation rate was found to depend on the oxygen pressure. Complementary analysis by EPMA showed the formation of a sub layer containing a monoxide phase (NiCuFe) O, the consumption of the metallic phases initially present in the bulk of the cermet, with nickel oxide localized around the metal phases. In addition to these modifications, it was observed the dissolution of small amounts of copper inside the grains of <b>nickel</b> ferrite and <b>monoxide.</b> These results can be explained on the basis of an oxidation mechanism involving both external oxidation (copper oxides formation) and bulk oxidation (nickel oxide formation and reactions between nickel oxide and nickel ferrite). Diffusion of copper towards the surface and diffusion of oxygen inwards the material must account for the rate of weight gain measured in the isothermal experiments, as well as the influence of oxygen pressure in the rage 1 – 51 hPa...|$|R
