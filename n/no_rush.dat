Artanis is overjoyed to meet this manifestation of his old comrade and is in <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> {{to tell him the}} truth, allowing him to discover it at a pace he is comfortable with, by studying the combat logs. Eventually, upon learning more about Fenix, he decides to have his name changed to 'Talandar'. He becomes the ambassador between the Daelaam and the Purifiers, convincing them to join force. He follows Artanis in battle to reclaim their homeworld.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{entered the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939. At {{the time of}} the {{declaration}} of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E
25|$|To {{compete with}} the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics {{launched}} the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.|$|E

25|$|The American command {{did not see}} {{the need}} for {{long-range}} fighters in 1942, and like Bomber Command in the early war period, believed the bomber would always get through. On that understanding, there was <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> to develop fighter aircraft of this type. The twin-engined mid-range Lockheed P-38 Lightning had been designed as a high-altitude interceptor and was adequate in the escort role. Production had not yet reached the output needed and losses in the Mediterranean had diverted the P-38 strength there. As an interim solution the Americans were given the British Spitfire, but it lacked the range to reach beyond the coastal areas of western Europe.|$|E
500|$|McNamara {{attempted}} to short-circuit deployment in early 1966 {{by stating that}} the only program that had any reasonable cost-effectiveness was the thin defense against the Chinese, and then noted there was <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> to build such a system {{as it would be}} some time before they had an ICBM. Overruling him, Congress provided $167.9 million ($ billion in [...] ) for immediate production of the original Nike-X concept. McNamara and Johnson met on the issue on 3 November 1966, and McNamara once again convinced Johnson that the system could not justify the cost of deployment. McNamara headed off the expected counterattack from Romney by calling a press conference on the topic of Soviet ABMs and stating that the new Minuteman III and Poseidon SLBM would ensure the Soviet system would be overwhelmed.|$|E
500|$|Video game {{developer}} Square Enix {{announced the}} opening of Square Enix Montreal in November 2011, headed by Lee Singleton, a former general manager at Square Enix London Studios.

Its first project was a new Hitman series game for home consoles, to be co-developed with another Square Enix subsidiary, IO Interactive of Denmark, which created the series and was at work on [...] (2012). Square Enix Montreal began with four staff members—Singleton and three developers from IO Interactive—but planned to grow beyond the single Hitman team to have multiple concurrent projects with up to 150 employees. Singleton planned a slow design process, with <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> to production. The studio also received support from the Quebecois government.|$|E

[...] Trained as a lawyer, Horace Judson retired from the active practice of law to continue the family’s stained glass tradition. [...] The studios were described in 1940 as “a medieval guild secluded from a hectic modern world by the vine-covered building.” [...] At the time, Horace Judson told the Highland Park News-Herald: “Here there is <b>no</b> <b>rush.</b> [...] We work slowly and for perfection as they did six centuries ago.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, a Bill {{to extend}} the {{existing}} moratorium against annexations by cities from 2010 to 2020 passed both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, but was vetoed by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. The Virginia Municipal League reported: [...] "The governor {{said that there was}} <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> on this extension, and that the legislature should study the impact of the annexation moratorium on cities. The moratorium applies only to a limited number of cities. Many cities are barred from annexation by either geography or by other laws establishing the ability of counties to obtain complete or partial immunity from annexation." ...|$|E

In subsequent years, the Air Force indicated it would launch a competition for the T-38's replacement. Likely bidders include: A partnership of BAE Systems and Rolls Royce, offering the Hawk trainer, equipped with Rolls' Adour Mk951 engine offering 6,500lb of thrust and FADEC; Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries, offering the T-50; and Raytheon and Alenia Aermacchi offering the T-100, an aircraft whose design originated with the M-346.|$|E
50|$|After {{the opening}} loss, Weis named {{freshman}} Jimmy Clausen the starting quarterback. Clausen {{would become the}} eighth Notre Dame freshman to start at quarterback since 1951 and would be the earliest to start when he faced the 15th ranked Penn State Nittany Lions in Happy Valley.

2500|$|State {{attorneys}} called {{current and}} former police officers and the two lead prosecutors, who testified that the investigation had been careful, and that no witnesses had been coerced or threatened. The lead detective testified that his investigation was [...] "very meticulous and careful… I was in <b>no</b> <b>rush</b> just to pick the first guy we got our hands on. I wanted the right guy." [...] He stated that witnesses gave [...] "strikingly similar descriptions on how the shooter was dressed", mostly describing the shooter as wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, which other witnesses said Davis was wearing that evening. A state attorney asserted that the testimony of at least five prosecution witnesses remained unchallenged, and the evidence of Davis's guilt was overwhelming. In July 2010, Davis's lawyers filed a motion asking Moore to reconsider his decision to exclude testimony from a witness to a confession by Coles, but in August 2010, Moore stood by his initial decision, stating that in not calling Coles, Davis's lawyers were seeking to implicate Coles without desiring his rebuttal.|$|E

For his rookie year in 2010, Spiller produced 283 rushing yards, 157 receiving yards, and 1189 return yards on 56 kickoff and punt return opportunities in 14 games (1 start).|$|R

They did not function as did the bulk of the Canadian fleet: <b>no</b> <b>rushing</b> back and forth across the ocean, cold and damp, chained to 50 degrees North.
