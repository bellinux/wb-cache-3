5|$|Inigo moved ashore on Australia as a weak {{tropical}} cyclone, though several locations reported {{winds of}} <b>near</b> <b>gale</b> force. The storm dropped light to moderate precipitation near where it made landfall which peaked at 226mm (8.90inches), of which 128mm (5.04in) of rain fell in 80minutes.

5|$|Tropical Storm Dean {{originated}} from inside a frontal cloud band, which had moved off the Eastern Coast of the United States on September 22. During {{the next few}} days, the band became stationary from the Bahamas to beyond Bermuda. During this period, a 1035millibar (30.56inHg) high pressure cell had become settled over the northeastern United States. This resulted in a strong pressure gradient and winds <b>near</b> <b>gale</b> force along the eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Gamede {{remained}} a broad system, and by February 24 it produced winds of <b>near</b> <b>gale</b> force up to 670km (415mi) southeast of its center; {{later in the}} day, it passed about 300km (190mi) north of Réunion, its closest point of approach to the island. For over 90hours, the cyclone remained within 400km (250mi) of the island, resulting in torrential rainfall in the island's mountainous region. Radar imagery on the island indicated Gamede maintained an eye diameter of 60–70km (37–43mi). After tracking generally southwestward for several days, a building ridge to its south changed {{the motion of the}} cyclone to the west before it became quasi-stationary. Initially, it was predicted to continue westward and strike Madagascar near Toamasina. The cyclone re-intensified while executing a small loop, and late on February 25 Gamede officially attained peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) about halfway between Réunion island and the coast of Madagascar; at the time, wind gusts in association with the storm reached 230km/h (135mph).|$|E

50|$|July {{continued}} the season's activity, with {{a tropical storm}} forming in the western Caribbean Sea north of Panama on July 4. The 2nd storm of the season intensified to a 95 mph (153 km/h) hurricane before hitting the northeast coast of Honduras. It mainly retained its strength until it hit the northeastern coast of Belize on July 6. Afterwards, it rapidly weakened over the Yucatán Peninsula and dissipated on July 7. The storm sank several ships and reportedly caused a large loss of life. It has been paleotempestologically traced in sediment <b>near</b> <b>Gales</b> Point.|$|R

5|$|While it {{was moving}} little over the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought {{prolonged}} tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to <b>near</b> <b>gale</b> force battered the islands, although peak gusts to 58mph (92km/h) were confined to Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of 4.0 in (102mm) was recorded on Aruba, while 1.7 in (43mm) and 1.5 in (41mm) of rain fell in Curaçao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported {{in some parts of}} Aruba. In the SSS Islands (Saba, St. Eustatius, and Sint Maarten) strong winds from Omar, gusting up to 76mph (122km/h), and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On Sint Maarten, rainfall from the storm totaled to 5.4in (139.4mm). Damage in Sint Maarten was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between a tropical wave and a upper-level low moving southeastward from Texas spawned a broad trough over the central Gulf of Mexico on October24. That day, {{there was a}} marked increase in convection, or thunderstorms. At the same time, the pressure gradient between the trough and a high pressure area over the southeastern United States produced winds of <b>near</b> <b>gale</b> force across the northern Gulf of Mexico. Early on October 26, a tropical depression developed about 380 mi (610 km) south-southwest of New Orleans. Within 12 hours, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Juan, based on satellite imagery and reports from the Hurricane Hunters. Initially, the structure was akin {{to that of a}} subtropical cyclone, with light winds near the center. Juan moved erratically at first, eventually tracking more steadily to the north-northeast on October 27. After turning to the northwest late on October 27, Juan intensified into a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Near</b> <b>gale</b> force {{winds were}} {{experienced}} at Port Hedland {{for a period}} of about 17hours beginning at midnight AWST on 5 March. The peak hourly average wind speed recorded was 72km/h (45mph) and the maximum gust recorded was 104km/h (65mph) (between 8 and 9am AWST 6 March). Winds averaged near 70km/h (43mph) at Karratha in the early evening 6 March and the maximum gust recorded was 98km/h (61mph) at 6pm AWST.|$|E
500|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was first}} observed well {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on August26. The storm moved westward and brought severe weather to Martinique, including hurricane-force winds. Throughout its trek across the Caribbean Sea, the system maintained winds of 80mph (130km/h). Late on August31, the hurricane made landfall in Belize District of Belize. Off the coast, several ships were damaged or sunk. The brig Antonio, the Hannah, and the bark Berkshire were among the ships that capsized. On land, tides up to [...] above normal caused coastal flooding in Belize. This storm has been paleotempestologically traced in sediment <b>near</b> <b>Gales</b> Point.

2500|$|On 21 October 1942 Palatia was sailing off Lindesnes, Norway, {{escorted by}} the {{submarine}} chaser UJ 1704 and a Junkers Ju 88. She {{had originally been}} part of a convoy of three vessels with three submarine chaser escorts from the port of Kristiansand, but the tanker Ostermoor had suffered engine failure and the fellow prisoner ship Ostland (with 1,000 prisoners on board) had run aground. One of the escorts had also suffered engine failure. Palatias renewed departure from Kristiansand only occurred at 09:00. This left her in an exposed position in poor weather when, at 15:05, she was discovered by one of four Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers from No. 489 Squadron RNZAF of the RAF Coastal Command that were patrolling the Norwegian coastline that day. At the time the weather was rainy, with winds from strong breeze to <b>near</b> <b>gale</b> and [...] waves.|$|E

Leah, Anna Maria, and Sally Hollyday Gale donated the Gale family burial plot to the Episcopal Church to erect a chapel. Bishop William Rollinson Whittingham laid the cornerstone on September 3, 1844. Construction was completed in 1845. It was established as a Chapel of Ease for St. Mary Anne's Episcopal Church in North East.|$|R

60|$|There in {{the gloom}} sat the silent, impassive, inscrutable Yaqui. His dark face, his dark eyes were plain {{in the light of}} the stars. Always he was <b>near</b> <b>Gale,</b> unobtrusive, shadowy, but there. Why? Gale {{absolutely}} could not doubt that the Indian had heart as well as mind. Yaqui had from the very first stood between Gale and accident, toil, peril. It was his own choosing. Gale could not change him or thwart him. He understood the Indian's idea of obligation and sacred duty. But there was more, and that baffled Gale. In the night hours, alone on the slope, Gale felt in Yaqui, as he felt the mighty throb of that desert pulse, a something that drew him irresistibly to the Indian. Sometimes he looked around to find the Indian, to dispel these strange, pressing thoughts of unreality, and it was never in vain.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{within a}} persistent, broad trough across the southwestern Caribbean organized into the nineteenth tropical {{depression of the}} season by 06:00UTC on October20 about 195mi (315km) north of Cabo Gracias a Dios.

Upper-level winds slackened over subsequent days, allowing the cyclone to attain hurricane intensity early on October24 and reach peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) by 00:00UTC the next day. Richard moved ashore <b>near</b> <b>Gales</b> Point, Belize, thirty minutes later. The system weakened rapidly once inland, degenerating into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on October26.
