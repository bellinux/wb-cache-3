If the liquid in a wet gel is removed under a supercritical condition, a highly porous and extremely low density material called aerogel is obtained.

In addition, a sol-gel process was developed in the 1950s for the production of radioactive powders of UO2 and ThO2 for nuclear fuels, without generation of large quantities of dust.|$|E

The state has built 120 desalination plants, more than three times as many as any other state, including the largest plant in the United States. Additionally, an electrodialysis reversal plant in Sarasota is the largest of its type in the world, and a <b>nanofiltration</b> plant in Boca Raton is the largest of its type in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Distillation removes all {{minerals}} from water, and {{the membrane}} methods of reverse osmosis and <b>nanofiltration</b> remove most to all minerals. This results in demineralized water {{which is not}} considered ideal drinking water. The World Health Organization has investigated {{the health effects of}} demineralized water since 1980. Experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased blood serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium, and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium, which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants, when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10mg/L with 20–30mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20mg/L minimum and a 40–80mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2 to 4mmol/L. At water hardness above 5mmol/L, higher incidence of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. Additionally, desalination processes can increase the risk of bacterial contamination.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of <b>nanofiltration</b> {{as a method of}} softening water is that during the process of retaining calcium and magnesium ions while passing smaller hydrated monovalent ions, filtration is performed without adding extra sodium ions, as used in ion exchangers. [...] Many separation processes do not operate at room temperature (e.g. distillation), which greatly increases the cost of the process when continuous heating or cooling is applied. Performing gentle molecular separation is linked with <b>nanofiltration</b> that is often not included with other forms of separation processes (centrifugation). These are two {{of the main}} benefits that are associated with <b>nanofiltration.</b> <b>Nanofiltration</b> has a very favorable benefit of being able to process large volumes and continuously produce streams of products. Still, <b>Nanofiltration</b> is the least used method of membrane filtration in industry as the membrane pores sizes are limited to only a few nanometers. Anything smaller, reverse osmosis is used and anything larger is used for ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration can also be used in cases where <b>nanofiltration</b> can be used, due to it being more conventional. A main disadvantage associated with nanotechnology, as with all membrane filter technology, is the cost and maintenance of the membranes used. <b>Nanofiltration</b> membranes are an expensive part of the process. Repairs and replacement of membranes is dependent on total dissolved solids, flow rate and components of the feed. With <b>nanofiltration</b> being used across various industries, only an estimation of replacement frequency can be used. This causes nanofilters to be replaced a short time before or after their prime usage is complete.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} <b>nanofiltration</b> {{has been}} {{extended}} into other industries such as milk and juice production. Research and development in solvent-stable membranes has allowed the application for <b>nanofiltration</b> membranes to extend into new areas such as pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and flavour and fragrance industries. Development in organic solvent <b>nanofiltration</b> technology and commercialization of membranes used has extended possibilities for applications {{in a variety of}} organic solvents ranging from non-polar through polar to polar aprotic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nanofiltration</b> is {{also known}} as “loose” RO and can reject {{particles}} smaller than 0,002 µm. <b>Nanofiltration</b> is used for the removal of selected dissolved constituents from wastewater. NF is primarily developed as a membrane softening process which offers an alternative to chemical softening.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, <b>nanofiltration</b> {{and other}} {{membrane}} technology used for molecular separation was applied entirely on aqueous systems. The original uses for <b>nanofiltration</b> were water treatment {{and in particular}} water softening. Nanofilters can “soften” water by retaining scale-forming, hydrated divalent ions (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+) while passing smaller hydrated monovalent ions [...]|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nanofiltration</b> is a {{relatively}} recent membrane filtration process used most often with low total dissolved solids water such as surface water and fresh groundwater, {{with the purpose of}} softening (polyvalent cation removal) and removal of disinfection by-product precursors such as natural organic matter and synthetic organic matter.

5000|$|Pretreatment is {{important}} {{when working with}} reverse osmosis and <b>nanofiltration</b> membranes {{due to the nature}} of their spiral-wound design. The material is engineered in such a fashion as to allow only one-way flow through the system. As such, the spiral-wound design does not allow for backpulsing with water or air agitation to scour its surface and remove solids. Since accumulated material cannot be removed from the membrane surface systems, they are highly susceptible to fouling (loss of production capacity). Therefore, pretreatment is a necessity for any reverse osmosis or <b>nanofiltration</b> system. Pretreatment in sea water reverse osmosis systems has four major components: ...|$|E
5000|$|Applications include water purification, desalination, maple syrup, power {{generation}} and semiconductor manufacturing. Membranes and <b>nanofiltration</b> elements {{are made in}} different diameters and lengths. [...] "Bigmembranes" [...] are typically 4” or 8” in diameter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nanofiltration</b> {{membranes}} have pores sized from 0.001 µm to 0.01 µm and filters multivalent ions, synthetic dyes, sugars {{and specific}} salts. As the pore size drops from MF to NF, the osmotic pressure requirement increases.|$|E

50|$|Virus removal {{processes}} using <b>nanofiltration</b> techniques remove viruses specifically by size exclusion. This type {{of process}} is typically used for parvoviruses and other viruses containing a protein coat. A typical HIV virion is 180 nm and a typical parvovirus can vary between 15 and 24 nm, {{which is very}} small. One great advantage of filtration, as opposed to methods involving extremes of temperature or acidity, is that filtration will not denature the proteins in the sample. <b>Nanofiltration</b> is also effective for most types of proteins. Since it is not chemically selective, {{no matter what the}} surface chemistry of the viral particle is, viral removal processes using <b>nanofiltration</b> techniques will still be effective. Another great advantage of this technique is its ability to be performed on a lab scale and then effectively scaled up to production standards. It is important to consider, however, the fact that the level of removal of the viruses is dependent {{on the size of the}} pores of the nanofilter. In some cases, very small viruses will not be filtered out. It is also necessary to consider the possible effects of pressure and flow rate variation.|$|E
5000|$|The entropy driven {{nature of}} nanofluidics gives CNT {{membranes}} {{a very low}} energy consumption requirement.

50|$|Cross flow {{membrane}} filtration {{technology has been}} used widely in industry around the globe. Filtration membranes can be polymeric or ceramic, depending upon the application. The principles of cross-flow filtration are used in reverse osmosis, <b>nanofiltration,</b> ultrafiltration and microfiltration. When purifying water, {{it can be very}} cost effective in comparison to the traditional evaporation methods.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the college {{research}} was carried out in the conventional areas of chemical engineering like Absorption, Adsorption, Liquid-liquid extraction, and Fluid Dynamics. Over the period of years the areas of research have moved in line with developments in the chemical process industries. The department focuses on areas like <b>Nanofiltration,</b> Bioengineering and Environmental systems.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of various}} nanomaterials, {{including}} carbon nanotubes and TiO2, shows promise {{for treatment of}} surface water, including for purification, disinfection, and desalination. Target contaminants in surface waters include heavy metals, organic contaminants, and pathogens. In this context, nanoparticles {{may be used as}} sorbents, as reactive agents (photocatalysts or redox agents), or in membranes used for <b>nanofiltration.</b>|$|E
50|$|Likewise, <b>nanofiltration</b> {{can be used}} as a {{pre-treatment}} before directed reverse osmosis. The {{main objectives}} of NF pre-treatment are: (1). minimize particulate and microbial fouling of the RO membranes by removal of turbidity and bacteria, (2) prevent scaling by removal of the hardness ions, (3) lower the operating pressure of the RO process by reducing the feed-water total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration.|$|E
5000|$|In {{tandem with}} {{nano-scale}} particulate, {{studies have demonstrated}} CNTs can cause damage to microbial cell walls and kill bacteria. Single-walled nanotubes tend to exhibit more antimicrobial behavior than multi-walled and double-walled nanotubes and inhibits the formation of biofilms, {{the first stage of}} biological fouling. Therefore, the anti-biofouling surface of CNT membranes may require less maintenance than traditional <b>nanofiltration</b> and reverse osmosis membranes.|$|E
5000|$|Membrane pore sizes {{can vary}} from 0.1 to 5,000 nm (4×10−9 to 2×10−4 in) {{depending}} on filter type. Particle filtration removes particles of 1 µm in or larger. Microfiltration removes particles of 50 nm or larger. Ultrafiltration removes particles of roughly 3 nm or larger. <b>Nanofiltration</b> removes particles of 1 nm or larger. Reverse osmosis is in the final category of membrane filtration, hyperfiltration, and removes particles larger than 0.1 nm.|$|E
50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes have a {{very important}} role in the separation industry. Nevertheless, they were not considered technically important until the mid-1970s. Membrane separation processes differ based on separation mechanisms and size of the separated particles. The widely used membrane processes include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, <b>nanofiltration,</b> reverse osmosis, electrolysis, dialysis, electrodialysis, gas separation, vapor permeation, pervaporation, membrane distillation, and membrane contactors. All processes except for pervaporation involve no phase change. All processes except (electro)dialysis are pressure driven. Microfltration and ultrafiltration is widely used in food and beverage processing (beer microfiltration, apple juice ultrafiltration), biotechnological applications and pharmaceutical industry (antibiotic production, protein purification), water purification and wastewater treatment, the microelectronics industry, and others. <b>Nanofiltration</b> and reverse osmosis membranes are mainly used for water purification purposes. Dense membranes are utilized for gas separations (removal of CO2 from natural gas, separating N2 from air, organic vapor removal from air or a nitrogen stream) and sometimes in membrane distillation. The later process helps in the separation of azeotropic compositions reducing the costs of distillation processes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nanofiltration</b> is a {{membrane}} filtration based method that uses nanometer sized cylindrical through-pores that {{pass through the}} membrane at a 90°. <b>Nanofiltration</b> membranes have pore sizes from 1-10 Angstrom, smaller than that used in microfiltration and ultrafiltration, but just larger than that in reverse osmosis. Membranes used are predominantly created from polymer thin films. Materials that are commonly used include polyethylene terephthalate or metals such as aluminum. [...] Pore dimensions are controlled by pH, temperature and time during development with pore densities ranging from 1 to 106 pores per cm2. Membranes made from polyethylene terephthalate and other similar materials, {{are referred to as}} “track-etch” membranes, named after the way the pores on the membranes are made. “Tracking” involves bombarding the polymer thin film with high energy particles. This results in making tracks that are chemically developed into the membrane, or “etched” into the membrane, which are the pores. Membranes created from metal such as alumina membranes, are made by electrochemically growing a thin layer of aluminum oxide from aluminum metal in an acidic medium.|$|E
50|$|The present {{market of}} nanotech-based {{technologies}} applied in water treatment consists of reverse osmosis, <b>nanofiltration,</b> ultrafiltration membranes. Indeed, among emerging products one can name nanofiber filters, carbon nanotubes and various nanoparticles. Nanotechnology {{is expected to}} deal more efficiently with contaminants which convectional water treatment systems struggle to treat, including bacteria, viruses and heavy metals. This efficiency generally stems from the very high specific surface area of nanomaterials which increases dissolution, reactivity and sorption of contaminants.|$|E
50|$|Reverse Osmosis is {{the finest}} {{separation}} membrane process available, pore sizes range from 0.0001 µm to 0.001 µm. RO {{is able to}} retain mostly all molecules except for water and due {{to the size of}} the pores, the required osmotic pressure is significantly greater than that for MF. Both reverse osmosis and <b>nanofiltration</b> are fundamentally different since the flow goes against the concentration gradient, because those systems use pressure as a means of forcing water to go from low pressure to high pressure.|$|E
50|$|The product {{portfolio}} covers the entire spectrum of water treatment technology. This includes filtration, filter media ion exchange systems for demineralisation, alternative limescale protection, water softening, decarbonisation, disinfection (UV, ozone, chlorine dioxide, etc.), metering technology, membrane technology microfiltration, ultrafiltration and <b>nanofiltration,</b> reverse osmosis), pure steam generators, pure water distillation, UV systems, ozone generators, ion exchange membranes, electrolysis, electrodialysis, electrodeionisation,chlorine dioxide generators and metering pumps. BWT is also {{entering a new}} business sector to develop membranes for fuel cells and batteries.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{selectivity}} of a membrane {{depends on the}} membrane pore size. Depending on the pore size, they can be classified as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), <b>nanofiltration</b> (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Membranes can also be of various thickness, with homogeneous or heterogeneous structure. Membranes can be neutral or charged, and particle transport can be active or passive. The latter can be facilitated by pressure, concentration, chemical or electrical gradients of the membrane process. Membranes can be generally classified into synthetic membranes and biological membranes.|$|E
50|$|Mercury is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most notorious metal pollutants present in food, water, air and soil, but the process of eliminating it is limited. Heavy metals such as mercury are formed on the earth's crust and made into solutions with ground water through certain natural processing and pH changes occurring in the soil. There are traditional methods that are used to extract mercury from the natural water sources and industrial waste water, such as chemical precipitation, amalgamation, reverse osmosis, membrane filtration and photochemical methods. However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and inefficient, hence the need for a <b>nanofiltration</b> technology that overcomes all of these issues. <b>Nanofiltration</b> technology is very efficient in removal of mercury species due to its characteristics of having high surface area-to-volume and the fact that it's easily chemically functionalized. Additionally, Brownian motion of nanomaterials allows them to scan large volume of solvent in short times. There are many copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used as scavengers to eliminate mercury species via redox reactions such as selenium NPs, manganese dioxide nanowhiskers, carbon nanotube−silverNP composites, silver NPs, silver NP-decorated silicaspheres, gold NP-based materials. Among these adsorbents, citrate-capped gold NP-based materials have been used intensively to capture mercury species from nature water.|$|E

50|$|Gypsum also {{precipitates}} onto {{brackish water}} membranes, a {{phenomenon known as}} mineral salt scaling, such as during brackish water desalination of water with high concentrations of calcium and sulfate. Scaling decreases membrane life and productivity. This {{is one of the}} main obstacles in brackish water membrane desalination processes, such as reverse osmosis or <b>nanofiltration.</b> Other forms of scaling, such as calcite scaling, depending on the water source, can also be important considerations in distillation, as well as in heat exchangers, where either the salt solubility or concentration can change rapidly.|$|E
50|$|As enzymes are macromolecules {{and often}} differ greatly {{in size from}} {{reactants}} they can be separated by size exclusion membrane filtration with ultra- or <b>nanofiltration</b> membranes. This is used on industrial scale {{for the production of}} enantiopure amino acids by kinetic racemic resolution of chemically derived racemic amino acids. The most prominent example is the production of L-methionine on a scale of 400t/a. The advantage of this method over other forms of immobilisation of the catalyst is that the enzymes are not altered in activity or selectivity as it remains solubilised.|$|E
