5|$|The spy {{followed}} the court mystic to Mount Tai, where he performed a ritual with his followers, although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>saw</b> any immortals. Luan Da ordered {{his followers to}} stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals, telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants. The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and {{reported that he had}} seen his immortal master and that they were to report back to the emperor. Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu. The emperor, incensed at Luan Da's confidence tricks, decided to play along when the mystic returned to see what lies he would tell.|$|E

500|$|On March 30, Reagan {{delivered}} a luncheon address to AFL–CIO representatives at the Washington Hilton Hotel. The hotel {{was considered the}} safest venue in Washington because of its secure, enclosed passageway called [...] "President's Walk", which was built after the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Reagan entered the building through the passageway around 1:45p.m., waving to a crowd of news media and citizens. The Secret Service had required him to wear a bulletproof vest for some events, but Reagan was not wearing one for the speech, because his only public exposure would be the 30 feet (9 m) between the hotel and his limousine, and the agency did not require vests for its agents that day. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>saw</b> Hinckley behaving in an unusual way; witnesses who reported him as [...] "fidgety" [...] and [...] "agitated" [...] apparently confused Hinckley with another person that the Secret Service had been monitoring.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Graves, who climbed with Mallory, in his {{autobiography}} recounts this story, at the time famous in climbing circles, about an ascent that Mallory made {{as a young man}} in 1908:"My friend George Mallory .... once did an inexplicable climb on Snowdon.

By a rule of the Climbers' Club climbs are never named in honour of their inventors, but only describe natural features. An exception was made here. The climb was recorded as follows: 'Mallory's Pipe, a variation on route 2; see adjoining map. This climb is totally impossible. It has been performed once, in failing light, by Mr G. H. L. Mallory.'".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{readers have}} noticed {{similarities}} between Bruce Marshall's 1943 novel Yellow Tapers for Paris and Irène Némirovsky's Suite française {{which was written}} {{at about the same}} time but not discovered until 1998. There is no suggestion of plagiarism, Némirovsky was dead before Marshall's novel was published and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>saw</b> Némirovsky's work before its 1998 discovery. [...] Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's protagonist is an accountant while Némirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank. [...] Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters. [...] The stories cover the prelude of the Nazi invasion and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different. [...] Marshall's ends before the occupation, while Némirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. [...] "Dolce," [...] the second part of Suite française, is similar to Le Silence de la Mer, a novella by the French author Vercors (pseudonym of Jean Bruller). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. Suite française and Le Silence de la Mer were finished in early 1942.|$|E
2500|$|The {{confidence}} in Augustinussen was strongly expressed {{during his first}} term as mayor, since he also [...] "worked as the municipality's administrator". It was an old practice that the village's pastor would manage the poor relief fund and the municipal treasury, but when Krogh left Nesna in 1841, the formannskap agreed to a different arrangement. Johan Augustinussen was employed as treasurer with responsibilities for the poor relief fund, with a wage of two Spd. per year. He was also responsible for the school treasury in Nesna (but not Dønnes) with a wage of one Spd. per year. This agreement {{was made by the}} formannskap where Augustinussen was himself one of the three members, but according to Jenssen <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>saw</b> [...] "anything suspicious about this". Jenssen further notes that Augustinussen's accounts were always in [...] "exemplary order" [...] in contrast to the accounts of the school treasury in Dønnes, for which he was not responsible. The wage increased over the years, and in 1876 he received 30 Spd. per year for the supervision of the poor relief fund. Augustinussen was the municipal treasurer until he became a pensioner in 1878; when previous mayor Jacob Fredrik Zahl overtook the position. Zahl was succeeded by Ivar Anton Ivarsen Mehus in 1883, who was also a successor of Augustinussen in a different capacity in 1884, when he became Nesna's second parliamentary representative.|$|E
2500|$|When Lucian Truscott's 3rd Division {{was first}} {{selected}} for the operation, he pointed out to Clark that the position was a death trap {{and there would be}} no survivors. Agreeing, Clark canceled the operation, but Prime Minister Churchill revived it. Apparently the two allies had different concepts: the Americans viewed such a landing as another distraction from Cassino, but if they could not break through at Cassino, the men at Anzio would be trapped. Churchill and the British high command envisioned an outflanking movement ending with the capture of Rome. Mediterranean Theatre commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower, leaving to take command of Operation Overlord, left the decision up to Churchill with a warning about German unpredictability. Both sides finally agreed that the troops could not remain at Anzio, but Lucas received somewhat equivocal orders. He was to lead the Fifth Army's U.S. VI Corps in a surprise landing in the Anzio area, and make a rapid advance into the Alban Hills to cut German communications and [...] "threaten the rear of the German XIV Panzer Corps" [...] under General Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin. It was hoped that this threat would draw Germany's forces away from the Cassino area and facilitate an Allied breakthrough there. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>saw</b> the point of taking the Alban Hills, nor was Churchill's idea of a flanking movement expressed.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah recounted a {{story that}} {{demonstrated}} {{the authority of the}} court in [...] — that one must follow the rulings of the court and [...] "not turn [...] [...] [...] to the right hand, nor to the left." [...] After two witnesses testified that they saw the new moon at its proper time (on the thirtieth day of the month shortly before nightfall), Rabban Gamaliel (the president of the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem) accepted their evidence and ruled that a new month had begun. But later at night (after the nightfall with which the thirty-first day of the earlier month would have begun), when the new moon should have been clearly visible, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>saw</b> the new moon. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declared the two witnesses to be false witnesses, comparing their testimony to that of witnesses who testify that a woman bore a child, when on the next day her belly was still swollen. Rabbi Joshua told Rabbi Dosa that he saw the force of his argument. Rabban Gamaliel then ordered Rabbi Joshua to appear before Rabban Gamaliel with his staff and money on the day which according to Rabbi Joshua's reckoning would be Yom Kippur. (According to Rabbi Joshua's reckoning, Yom Kippur would fall a day after the date that it would fall according to Rabban Gamaliel's reckoning. And [...] prohibited carrying a staff and money on Yom Kippur.) Rabbi Akiva then found Rabbi Joshua in great distress (agonizing over whether to obey Rabban Gamaliel's order to do what Rabbi Joshua considered profaning Yom Kippur). Rabbi Akiva told Rabbi Joshua that he could prove that whatever Rabban Gamaliel ordered was valid. Rabbi Akiva cited [...] which says, [...] "These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed seasons," [...] {{which is to say that}} whether they are proclaimed at their proper time or not, God has no appointed seasons other than those that are proclaimed. Rabbi Joshua then went to Rabbi Dosa, who told Rabbi Joshua that if they called into question the decisions of the court of Rabban Gamaliel, then they would have to call into question the decisions of every court since the days of Moses. For [...] says, [...] "Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and 70 of the elders of Israel went up," [...] and [...] does not mention the names of the elders to show that every group of three that has acted as a court over Israel is on a level with the court of Moses (as most of the members of that court also bore names without distinction). Rabbi Joshua then took his staff and his money and went to Rabban Gamaliel on the day that Rabbi Joshua reckoned was Yom Kippur. Rabban Gamaliel rose and kissed Rabbi Joshua on his head and said, [...] "Come in peace, my teacher and my disciple — my teacher in wisdom and my disciple because you have accepted my decision."–25a2.|$|E
