40|$|A partial {{differential}} equation model is developed {{to understand the}} effect that <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> acidosis have {{on the distribution of}} proliferating and quiescent cells and dead cell material (necrotic and apopotic) within a multicellular tumour spheroid.

Analysis of the differences in <b>nutrient</b> consumption <b>and</b> acid production by quiescent and proliferating cells shows low nutrient levels do not necessarily lead to increased acid concentration via anaerobic metabolism. Rather, it is the balance between proliferating and quiescent cells within the tumour which is important; decreased nutrient levels lead to more quiescent cells, which produce less acid than proliferating cells. We examine this effect via a sensitivity analysis which also includes a quantification of the effect that <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> acid concentrations have on the rates of cell quiescence and necrosis...|$|R

We applied factorial warming <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> manipulation to a <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> species poor alpine/arctic heath community for seven years. Vascular plant abundance in control plots increased by 31 %. There were also notable changes in cover in the <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> combined <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> warming treatments, with deciduous and evergreen shrubs declining, grasses overgrowing these plots. Sedge abundance initially increased significantly with <b>nutrient</b> amendment <b>and</b> then declined, going below initial values in the combined <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> warming treatment. <b>Nutrient</b> addition resulted in a change in dominance hierarchy from deciduous shrubs to grasses.

The results give some experimental support that species poor plant communities with low diversity may be more vulnerable to loss of species diversity than communities with higher initial diversity.

5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate <b>nutrients</b> <b>and</b> are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E

Putting greens were constructed and established with Agrostis stolonifera L. in sequential years from 1997 to 2000. Treatments included root zone mixtures of 80 : 20 (v:v) sand and sphagnum peat and 80 : 15 : 5 (v:v:v) sand, sphagnum peat, and soil, and accelerated versus controlled establishment. In the establishment year, the accelerated treatment received 2. 6 -, 3. 0 -, and 2. 6 -fold more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively, than the controlled treatment. Soil samples were taken in Fall 2001, Spring 2004, and Summer 2004 and were analyzed for <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> chemical properties such as pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter (OM), total soluble salts (TSS), <b>and</b> 12 <b>nutrients.</b> The root zone mixture and establishment treatments had minimal effects on most <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> chemical properties with the exception of phosphorus and pH. Cation exchange capacity, OM, TSS, <b>and</b> all <b>nutrients</b> decreased with soil depth, whereas soil pH increased. The putting green age × soil depth interaction was significant for many of the <b>nutrient</b> <b>and</b> chemical properties, but separating soil samples into mat and original root zone instead of predetermined soil sampling depths eliminated most of these interactions.

5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of <b>nutrients</b> <b>and</b> the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding <b>nutrients</b> <b>and</b> molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), <b>nutrients</b> <b>and</b> light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
