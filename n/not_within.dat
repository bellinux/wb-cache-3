5|$|As Mary II and William III & II had {{ascended the}} English and Scottish thrones, Mary of Modena {{ceased to be}} Queen of England on 11 December 1688 OS and of Scotland on 11 May 1689 OS. This was {{concurrent}} with her husband's formal deposition. James II, however, backed by Louis XIV of France, still considered himself king by divine right and maintained it was <b>not</b> <b>within</b> parliament's prerogative to depose a monarch.|$|E
5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were <b>not</b> <b>within</b> the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E

5|$|The city of St. Louis is an {{independent}} city, and is <b>not</b> <b>within</b> the limits of a county. Its residents voted to secede from St. Louis County in 1876.

5|$|The {{construction}} of private {{buildings on the}} boulevards and surrounding areas took place later. The middle class continued to prefer living in new suburbs rather than the cramped {{areas of the city}} center. The high prices of the land (expected to finance part of the construction costs) and the high rents were <b>not</b> <b>within</b> the means of the lower classes. Life in apartments was no longer desirable for residents of Brussels, who preferred to live in single family homes. The buildings constructed by private citizens had difficulty finding buyers.|$|E

Swimmer Ayouba Ali Sihame qualified for the Games via a universality place awarded by FINA for the women's 100 metre freestyle as her best time of one minute and 21.54 seconds was <b>not</b> <b>within</b> the standard entry time. Ahamada was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony and Darouèche held it for the closing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Although NFL rules {{generally}} require {{wide receivers}} to wear jersey {{numbers in the}} 10-19 and 80-89 range, players who later change positions are allowed to keep their previous number, {{as long as it}} is <b>not</b> <b>within</b> the 50-79 range for eligible receiver purposes. Hester was allowed to keep number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two wide receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of LMAs involve the outsourcing of one television station's operations to another, occasionally, a company may operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA {{even if it does}} not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Hornets owner Tom Benson) entered into a shared services agreement with Raycom Media to run the former company's Fox affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, WVUE-DT; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station's ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including Baton Rouge, Jackson, Biloxi, Lake Charles and Shreveport) but <b>not</b> <b>within</b> New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but was not prepared to sell WVUE outright.|$|E

5|$|Ayouba Ali Sihame was the {{youngest}} competitor to be selected by Comoros at the London Games, aged 17. She qualified after receiving a universality place by FINA as her best time of one minute and 21.54 seconds was <b>not</b> <b>within</b> the standard entry time. Sihame was drawn in the first heat of the women's 100 metre freestyle, which was held on 1 August, finishing third (and last) in her heat {{with a time of}} one minute and 14.40 seconds. She finished behind the heat winner Mareme Faye from Senegal (one minute and 6.42 seconds) and second-placed swimmer Shreya Dhital of Nepal (one minute and 10.80 seconds). Sihame finished 48 (and last) of all swimmers who competed, and did not advance to the later stages of the women's 100 metre freestyle.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, <b>not</b> <b>within</b> Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} that had to be used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was <b>not</b> <b>within</b> range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E

5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is <b>not</b> <b>within</b> the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{understood}} that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At {{the beginning of the}} war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, {{on the grounds that it}} was <b>not</b> <b>within</b> their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquois {{signed the}} Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands {{south of the}} Ohio to the British. European {{expansion}} into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were <b>not</b> <b>within</b> hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers {{had to deal with}} harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.|$|E
