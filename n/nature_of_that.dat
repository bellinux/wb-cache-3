5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have noted}} {{considerable}} political {{conflict in the}} burghs between the great merchants and craftsmen throughout the period. Merchants attempted to prevent lower crafts and guilds from infringing on their trade, monopolies and political power. Craftsmen attempted to emphasise their importance and to break into disputed areas of economic activity, setting prices and standards of workmanship. In the fifteenth century a series of statutes cemented the political position of the merchants, with limitations {{on the ability of}} residents to influence the composition of burgh councils and many of the functions of regulation taken on by the bailies. In rural society historians have noted a lack of evidence of widespread unrest of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> evidenced the Jacquerie of 1358 in France and the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in England. This was possibly because in Scotland there was relatively little of the type of change in agriculture, like the enclosure of common land, that could create widespread resentment before the modern era. Instead a major factor was the willingness of tenants to support their betters in any conflict in which they were involved, for which landlords reciprocated with charity and support. Both Highland and border society acquired reputations for lawless activity, particularly the feud. However, more recent interpretations have pointed to the feud as a means of preventing and speedily resolving disputes by forcing arbitration, compensation and resolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital {{costs associated with the}} schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{widespread}} belief, {{there is}} no empirical knowledge concerning extraterrestrial life forms and civilizations. The implications of a detection of extraterrestrial life would vary greatly depending on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> life, its location, and how human society reacts. Because of this lack of certainty, PDPs consider a variety of scenarios and the appropriate reactions. The formulation of a cohesive plan for {{a response to the}} detection of ETI would involve the development of scenario-contingent strategies for managing the discovery and its consequences.|$|E

He or she will host members of the Royal Family, as well as foreign royalty and heads of state, and will represent the Queen and country abroad on state visits to other nations. Before a 2006 reform the Governor-General had to ask the monarch's permission, via the prime minister, before leaving New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|This grape, later {{discovered}} {{in front of}} houses as a decorative vine in the villages of Figers, Mainxe, Saint-Savinien and Tanzac in the Poitou-Charentes was colloquially known as Madeleina or Raisin de La Madeleine due to its propensity to be fully ripe and ready for harvest around the July 22nd feast day of Mary Magdalene. As the connection to Merlot became known, the grape was formally registered under the name Magdeleine Noire des Charentes. Through its relationship with Magdeleine Noire des Charentes Merlot {{is related to the}} Southwest France wine grape Abouriou, though the exact <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> relationship (with Abouriou potentially being either a parent of Magdeleine Noire or an offspring) is not yet known.|$|E
25|$|In 1234 a Bulgarian-aided coup d'état in Serbia toppled Stefan Radoslav, a {{son-in-law}} of Theodore of Epirus, {{and replaced}} {{him with his}} brother Stefan Vladislav I, a son-in-law of Ivan Asen II. This {{has been seen as}} the extension of Bulgarian influence over Serbia, but the extent and <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> relationship remains unclear. The two governments cooperated with each other, but Stefan Vladislav did not long survive his father-in-law's death, being overthrown by his younger brother Stefan Uroš I in 1242. In 1235 uncle of the Serbian king, the Archbishop of Serbia Saint Sava died in Tarnovo, and in 1237 Ivan Asen II allowed his nephew to transfer the prized body back to Serbia.|$|E

Live bands play {{a wide variety of}} music for lindy hoppers, from big band standards and blues to original compositions. There are ongoing debates about the types of music most appropriate for lindy hop and other swing dances, with the discussions focusing on whether the music should be historically accurate (i.e. matching a dance style with the popular music of the day) or include other musical styles and forms.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Mutanchiang (or Mudanjiang) was a {{large-scale}} military engagement fought between {{the forces of}} the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Empire of Japan from August 12 to 16, 1945, as part of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in World War II. Due to the short <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> campaign, {{this was one of the}} only set-piece battles that transpired before its conclusion. During the battle, elements of the Japanese Fifth Army attempted to delay the Soviet Fifth Army and First Red Banner Army long enough to allow the bulk of the Japanese forces to retreat to more defensible positions. Though casualties on both sides were heavy, the Red Army forces were able to break through the hastily organized Japanese defenses and capture the city ten days ahead of schedule. Nevertheless, the Japanese defenders at Mutanchiang achieved their goal of allowing the main forces to escape.|$|E
25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E

25|$|The Doty—Salzar Creek Fault {{does not}} fully fit the {{regional}} pattern of basins and uplifts bounded by faults described above. It does bound {{the north side of}} the Chehalis basin, but the south boundary of the Black Hills Uplift is more properly the southeast striking Scammon Creek Fault that converges with the Doty—Salzar Creek Fault just north of Chehalis. In the acute angle between these is located the minor Lincoln Creek uplift, the Doty Hills, and an impressive chunk of uplifted Crescent basalt (reddish area at west edge of the map). The SE striking Scammon Creek Fault seems to be terminated by the Salzer Creek Fault (the exact relationship is not clear), with the latter continuing east for another seven miles. Yet the former is only the first of at least six more parallel southeast striking faults, which do cross the Salzer Creek Fault. These faults are: the Kopiah Fault (note the curious curve), Newaukum Fault, Coal Creek Fault, and three other unnamed faults. Just past them is the parallel Olympia Structure, which as a geophysical lineament has been traced to a point due east of Chehalis; these would seem to be related somehow, but the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> relationship is not yet known.|$|E
