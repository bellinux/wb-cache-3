Antioxidants may be important in delaying the onset of the complications. The current work reports the effect of an antioxidant rich <b>nutriceutical</b> on serum lipid profile and antioxidant status of alloxan induced diabetic rats. The <b>nutriceutical</b> was prepared from onions, garlic, lemon, palm oil and Cray fish in ratio 6 : 6 : 2 : 1 : 5 respectively. The <b>nutriceutical</b> was administered orally to diabetic rats(wister strains) age ≥ 4 months for three weeks with and without treatment with metformin.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{were only}} few studies {{addressing}} the physicians' training, attitudes, and utilization of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, {{compared to the}} well-documented escalating use of CAM among consumers. Patients who use CAM, however often do not disclose their utilization to their physicians. This study thus surveyed knowledge, attitudes, and practices of complementary and alternative medicine among physicians {{on the island of}} Oahu in Hawaii. The Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA) provided physicians' names and contact information. METHOD: This is a descriptive study with a questionnaire that was mailed to all physicians on the list. A total of 299 physicians responded to this survey. Response rate was 17. 45 %. RESULTS: Physicians reported having moderate acknowledge in acupuncture, massage, prayer/spiritualty chiropractic, hypnosis and meditation. They recognized the value of these treatments and refer their patients to have these treatments. On the other hand, homeopathy naturopathy, electromagnetic therapies, therapeutic/healing touch, and <b>nutriceuticals</b> were consistently rated as having no role in conventional medicine, strongly opposed to in practice, or would not refer patients to. Respondents felt CAM could be most effective for pain, musculoskeletal, psychological conditions and smoking cessation. DISCUSSIONS: Results indicated that the respondents had knowledge about prayer/spirituality, massage, chiropractic, meditation, hypnosis, and acupuncture, and also rated them as playing a role in conventional medicine, and would refer or have referred patients to. When they had little knowledge about naturopathy, electromagnetic therapies, <b>nutriceuticals,</b> and homeopathy, they rated these therapies as having no role in conventional medicine, and were strongly opposed to in practice or would not refer patients to. Respondents reported the least know abut the Aryurveda and Native American medicine. However, there was no significant correlation between negative attitude and practice patterns.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Healthy {{aging and}} {{longevity}} depend on successful and dy-namic interactions among biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Biological aging occurs mainly {{during the period}} of survival beyond the evolutionarily required essential lifespan (ELS). Natural se-lection processes for survival and successful reproduction have selected for a range of genetically determined ELS-assuring maintenance and repair systems (MRSs). The progressive failure of MRSs, and the con-sequent accumulation of molecular heterogeneity and damage, underlie the biological basis of aging, age-related diseases, and eventual death. However, the genetic processes of MRSs operate in a complex hierarchy of factors which range from intracellular molecular factors to physiologi-cal, psychological, environmental, and other stochastic factors, including chance. This view also facilitates setting up a framework for understand-ing, researching, and developing effective and realistic strategies for ag-ing intervention, prevention, and therapies. Manipulating genes and the milieu in which genes and gene products operate opens up novel possi-bilities of aging intervention and prevention. Gene therapy, stem cells, and modulation through functional foods, <b>nutriceuticals,</b> cosmeceuticals and lifestyle alterations, including mild stress-induced hormesis, are ex-amples of such strategies at various levels of development and practice...|$|R

40|$|Application of {{hormesis}} in aging {{research and}} interventions {{is becoming increasingly}} attractive and successful. The {{reason for this is}} the realization that mild stress-induced acti-vation of one or more stress response (SR) pathways, and its consequent stimulation of repair mechanisms, is effective in reducing the age-related accumulation of molecular damage. For example, repeated heat stress-induced synthesis of heat shock proteins has been shown to have a variety of anti-aging effects on growth and other cellular and bio-chemical characteristics of normal human skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells undergoing aging in vitro. Therefore, searching for potential hormetins – conditions and compounds eliciting SR-mediated hormesis – is drawing attention of not only the researchers but also the industry involved in developing healthcare products, including <b>nutriceuticals,</b> functional foods and cosmeceuticals.

Camomile and alfalfa inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation by 84 and 65 %, respectively, but nettle could not inhibit collagen-induced aggregation.

In addition, long-term research is required to evaluate and develop advanced, possibly more expensive, countermeasures, in the eventuality {{that they may be}} required.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} indicates that nutritional supplements can improve cognition; however, which supplements are effective remains controversial. In this review article, we focus on dietary supplementation suggested for predementia syndromes and Alzheimers disease (AD), with particular emphasis on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Very recent findings confirmed that SAM can exert a direct effect on glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. AD is accompanied by reduced GST activity, diminished SAM, and increased S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the downstream metabolic product resulting from SAM-mediated transmethylation reactions, when deprived of folate. Therefore, these findings underscored the critical role of SAM in maintenance of neuronal health, suggesting a possible role of SAM as a neuroprotective dietary supplement for AD patients. In fact, very recent studies on early-stage AD patients and moderate- to late-stage AD patients were conducted with a <b>nutriceutical</b> supplementation that included SAM, with promising results. Given recent findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in which n- 3 PUFA supplementation was effective only in very mild AD subgroups or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we suggest future intervention trials using measures of dietary supplementation (dietary n- 3 PUFA and SAM plus B vitamin supplementation) to determine if such supplements will reduce the risk for cognitive decline in very mild AD and MCI. Therefore, key supplements are not necessarily working in isolation and the most profound impact, or in some cases the only impact, is noted very early in the course of AD, suggesting that <b>nutriceutical</b> supplements may bolster pharmacological approaches well past the window where supplements can work on their own. Recommendations regarding future research on the effects of SAM or n- 3 PUFA supplementation on predementia syndromes and very mild AD include properly designed RCTs that are sufficiently powered and with an adequate length (e. g., 3 – 5 years of follow-up) ...|$|E

These include amino acids such as creatine, L-carnitine, and L-arginine, as well as vitamins and cofactors such as &alpha;-tocopherol and coenzyme Q. Like these other molecules. D-ribose is a naturally occurring compound. It is the sugar moiety of ATP and has also received interest as a metabolic supplement for the heart. The general hypothesis is that under certain pathologic cardiac conditions, nucleotides (particularly ATP, ADP, and AMP) are degraded and lost from the heart. The heart’s ability to resynthesize ATP is then limited by the supply of D-ribose. which is a necessary component of the adenine nucleotide structure. In support of this hypothesis, recent reports have used D-ribose to increase tolerance to myocardial ischemia.

Accordingly, finfish nutritionists are being challenged to formulate feeds that not only meet the nutritional requirements of livestock but also minimize production costs, limit environmental impacts, and enhance product quality. These challenges not only add considerable complexity to finfish nutrition but also afford opportunities to avoid some of the mistakes made by other industries in the past. From a review of the current status of finfish nutrition with respect to major nutrient classes, we comment on future opportunities and promising avenues of research. Alternative protein sources, specifically those derived from marine bycatch, plants, and microbes, are discussed, as well as methods to facilitate their implementation in finfish feeds.

Aim To examine whether the partially hydrolysed and dried product of pacific whiting fish influenced the small intestinal damaging side effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin. Methods Eight human volunteers completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol of clinically relevant dose of indomethacin (50 mg t. d. s. p. o. for 5 days) with 7 days of fish hydrolysate or placebo starting 2 days prior to indomethacin. Changes in gut permeability were assessed using 5 h urinary lactulose:rhamnose (L/R) ratios. Results Fish hydrolysate given alone did not affect permeability. In the main study (n = 8), baseline values were similar for both arms (0. 28 +/- 0. 05 and 0. 35 +/- 0. 07). Administration of indomethacin (+placebo) caused a fivefold rise in L/R ratios (increasing to 1. 54 +/- 0. 35), whereas L/R ratios in the same subjects ingesting indomethacin + fish hydrolysate was only 0. 59 +/- 0. 14 (P < 0. 01 vs. indomethacin alone). Dyspeptic symptoms occurred in four of eight subjects taking indomethacin alone, but zero of eight when hydrolysate was co-administered.
