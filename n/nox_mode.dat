40|$|Selective and {{sensitive}} detection of trace amounts of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is demonstrated. The screening system {{is based on}} a sampling/concentrator front end and electrochemical potentiometric gas sensor as the detector. A single sensor is operated in the dominant hydrocarbon (HC) and nitrogen oxides (<b>NOx)</b> <b>mode</b> by varying the sensor operating condition. The potentiometric sensor with integrated heaters was used to capture the signature of PETN. Quantitative measurements based on hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide sensor responses indicated that the detector sensitivity scaled proportionally with the mass of the explosives (10 [*]μg down to 200 [*]ng). The ratio of the HC integrated peak area to the NOx integrated peak area is identified as an indicator of selectivity. The HC/NOx ratio is unique for PETN and has a range from 1. 7 to 2. 7. This detection technique has the potential to become an orthogonal technique to the existing explosive screening technologies for reducing the number of false positives/false negatives in a cost-effective manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} plasma biotechology studies the {{applications of the}} plasma phase of matter to biological systems. "Ambient-condition" plasmas created at or near room temperature and atmospheric pressure are especially promising for biomedical applications because of their convenience, safety to patients, and compatibility with existing medical technology. Plasmas can be created from many different gases; plasma made from air contains a number of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, or RONS, involved in various biological processes, including immune activity, signaling, and gene expression. Therefore, ambient-condition air plasma {{is of particular interest}} for biological applications. 	To understand and predict the effects of treating biological systems with ambient-air plasma, it is necessary to characterize and measure the chemical species that these plasmas produce. Understanding both gaseous chemistry and the chemistry in plasma-treated aqueous solution is important because many biological systems exist in aqueous media. Existing literature about ambient-air plasma hypothesizes the critical role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; a major aim of this dissertation is to better quantify RONS by produced ambient-air plasma and understand how RONS chemistry changes in response to different plasma processing conditions. Measurements imply that both gaseous and aqueous chemistry are highly sensitive to operating conditions. In particular, chemical species in air treated by plasma exist in either a low-power ozone-dominated mode or a high-power nitrogen oxide-dominated mode, with an unstable transition region at intermediate discharge power and treatment time. Ozone (O 3) and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO 2, or NOx) are mutually exclusive in this system and that the transition region corresponds to the transition from ozone- to nitrogen oxides-mode. Aqueous chemistry agrees well with to air plasma chemistry, and a similar transition in liquid-phase composition from ozone mode to nitrogen oxides mode occurs as the discharge power increases. 	One prominent example of plasma biotechnology is the use of plasma-derived reactive species as a novel disinfectant. Ambient-air plasma is an attractive means of disinfection because it is non-thermal, expends a small amount of power, and requires only air and electricity to operate. Both solid surfaces and liquid volumes can be effectively and efficiently decontaminated by the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that plasma generates. Dry surfaces are decontaminated most effectively by the plasma operating in <b>NOx</b> <b>mode</b> and less effectively in ozone mode, with the weakest antibacterial effects in the transition region, and neutral reactive species are more influential in surface disinfection than charged particles. Aqueous bacterial inactivation correlates well with ozone concentration, suggesting that ozone is the dominant species for bacterial inactivation under the condition of a low-power discharge. Alternatively, air plasma operating in the higher-power, nitrogen oxides-rich mode can create a persistently antibacterial solution. Finally, when near-UV (UVA) treatment follows plasma treatment of bacterial suspension, the antimicrobial effect exceeds the effect predicted from the two treatments alone, and addition of nitrite to aqueous solution, followed by photolysis of nitrite by UVA photons, is hypothesized as the primary mechanism of synergy. 	The results presented in this dissertation underscore the dynamic nature of air plasma chemistry and the importance of careful chemical characterization of plasma devices intended for biological applications. The complexity of atmospheric pressure plasma devices, and their sensitivity to subtle differences in design and operation, can lead to different results with different mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Increasing the {{performance}} of an internal combustion engine requires the transformation of total fuel energy to useful energy at the highest as possible. Increase of inner cylinder heat plays {{important role in the}} increase of engine performance and decrease of exhaust emissions. It is understood that coating combustion chamber elements with thermal barriers contributes a lot to the increase of inner cylinder heat. This study includes an evaluation of experimental studies and its results carried out upon the methods applied on coating with thermal barrier in diesel engines, the effects of coating on {{the performance}} of engine using rice bran oil biodiesel blends of B 10, B 20, B 40, B 100 with the diesel fuel. By using rice bran biodiesel blends with diesel fuel, the result showed that brake thermal efficiency and mechanical efficiency of different blends with diesel fuel were less as compared to conventional diesel. Fuel consumption was increased with blending percentage in the engine. Emission level of HC decreased (40 - 50 %) with blending percentage increased with all type of fuel <b>modes.</b> <b>NOx,</b> CO also decreased with blending percentage increased with diesel fuel.

40|$|A Lean, Premixed, Prevaporized (LPP) {{combustion}} {{technology has}} been developed that converts liquid fuels into a substitute for natural gas. This fuel can then be burned with low emissions in virtually any combustion device in place of natural gas. This technology offers {{the possibility of using}} unprocessed oil-field Natural Gas Condensate (NGC) for local or export power generation using a DLN-equipped gas turbine rather than flaring, as is common practice in some regions. The ability to run a turbine on natural gas condensate with NOx and CO emissions comparable to those of natural gas has been demonstrated using a surrogate fuel made up from a mixture of naphtha (representing C 4 and greater) and methane (representing <C 4). The naphtha was vaporized using an LPP system, mixed with methane, and used to generate power in a 30 kW Capstone C 30 microturbine. The LPP Gas ™ was tailored to match the modified Wobbe Index (MWI) of methane. NOx emissions in pre-mix mode on the surrogate NGC fuel were sub 5 ppm, indistinguishable from those when running on methane. CO emissions were sub 20 ppm, comparable to those on methane. At lower loads (in diffusion <b>mode),</b> <b>NOx</b> and CO emissions on surrogate NGC-based LPP Gas ™ remain comparable to those on methane. No changes were required to the DLN gas turbine combustor hardware...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe NADPH oxidases are {{important}} transmembrane proteins producing {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS). Within the <b>Nox</b> family, different <b>modes</b> of activation can be discriminated. Nox 1 - 3 are dependent on different cytosolic subunits, Nox 4 seems to be constitutively active and Nox 5 is directly activated by calcium. With the exception of Nox 5, all Nox family members are thought {{to depend on the}} small transmembrane protein p 22 phox. With the discovery of the CRISPR/Cas 9 -system, a tool to alter genomic DNA sequences has become available. So far, this method has not been widely used in the redox community. On such basis, we decided to study the requirement of p 22 phox in the Nox complex using CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated knockout. Knockout of the gene of p 22 phox, CYBA, led to an ablation of activity of Nox 4 and Nox 1 but not of Nox 5. Production of hydrogen peroxide or superoxide after knockout could be rescued with either human or rat p 22 phox, but not with the DUOX-maturation factors DUOXA 1 /A 2. Furthermore, different mutations of p 22 phox were studied regarding the influence on Nox 4 -dependent H 2 O 2 production. P 22 phox Q 130 * and Y 121 H affected maturation and activity of Nox 4. Hence, Nox 5 -dependent O 2 •− production is independent of p 22 phox, but native p 22 phox is needed for maturation of Nox 4 and production of H 2 O 2...|$|R
40|$|Highlights •A custom {{test was}} {{designed}} to investigate transient engine operation. •Waste cooking biodiesel (primary fuel) and triacetin (highly oxygenated additive) were used. •Turbocharger lag caused an overshoot in NOx, PM and PN emissions. •Oxygenated fuels showed higher PN and lower PM overshoots compared to diesel. •Oxygenated fuels emitted smaller particles during transient compared to diesel. Abstract: This research studies the influence of oxygenated fuels on transient and steady-state engine performance and emissions using a fully instrumented, 6 -cylinder, common rail turbocharged compression ignition engine. Beside diesel, the other tested fuels were based on waste cooking biodiesel (primary fuel) with triacetin (highly oxygenated additive). A custom test was designed in this study to investigate the engine performance and emissions during steady-state, load acceptance and acceleration operation modes. Furthermore, to study the engine performance and emissions during a whole transient cycle, a legislative cycle (NRTC), which contains numerous discrete transient modes, was utilised. In this paper, the turbocharger lag, engine power, NOx, PM, PN and PN size distribution were investigated. During steady-state operation, compared to diesel, the oxygenated fuels showed lower indicated power, while they showed higher values during turbocharger lag and acceleration. Also, during acceleration and load increase <b>modes,</b> <b>NOx,</b> PM and PN peaked over the steady-state counterpart, also, the accumulation mode count median diameter moved toward the larger particle sizes. Increasing the fuel oxygen content increased the indicated specific NOx and PN maximum overshoot, while engine power, PM, PN and PM maximum overshoot decreased. Also, the accumulation mode count median diameter moved toward the smaller particle sizes. Keywords:Turbocharger lag; Fuel oxygen; NOx; PM; PN; Particle size distributio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLean NOx trap (LNT) and Selective Catalytic Reduction {{catalysts}} (SCR) are {{two leading}} candidates for Diesel NOx after-treatment. Each technology exhibits good properties to reduce efficiently Diesel NOx emissions {{in order to}} match the forthcoming EURO 6 standards. NOx reduction in LNT is made through a two-step process. In normal (lean) mode, Diesel engine exhausts NOx is stored into the NOx trap; then when necessary the engine runs rich during limited time to treat the stored <b>NOx.</b> This operating <b>mode</b> has the benefit of using onboard fuel as NOx reducer. But NOx trap solution is restrained by limited active temperature windows. On the other hand, NH 3 -SCR catalysts operate in {{a wider range of}} temperature and do not contain precious metals. However, NH 3 -SCR systems traditionally use urea-water solution as reducing agent, requiring thus additional infrastructure to supply the vehicles with enough reducer. These pros and cons are quite restrictive in classical LNT or NH 3 -SCR architecture. The present paper presents an after-treatment architecture combining a NOx trap and a passive NH 3 -SCR. Synergy of the two systems is possible if the SCR takes advantage of the LNT ability to produce Ammonia (NH 3). Indeed, during the rich phases (purges), small amounts of Ammonia are formed as by-product, which can be used in the downstream catalyst as the NOx reducing agent. A major difficulty to operate the proposed architecture is the real-time management of the NOx purge: for future control and diagnosis applications, it is crucial to have accurate but low-complexity models. A complete reduced model of the physicochemical phenomena involved is proposed in the present paper. Based on simplified chemical assumptions and time scale separation, the latter is suitable for on-board diagnostics and model-based control. Validation has been achieved through extensive experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{particulate}} matter {{is probably one}} of the most critical issues of the diesel engine emissions. After years of research, people begin to understand it further, with respect to its impact on the environment and human health, its formation mechanism inside and outside the diesel engine, and most importantly, the methods to control its formation. This study has focused on the {{particulate matter}} emission control in diesel engines. It started with the application of two closely coupled Diesel Particle Filters (DPFs), consisting of an assistant DPF and a main standard honeycomb DPF, to replace the standard Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) + DPF system, commonly applied on diesel engines these days. This new after-treatment system showed a great potential to be adopted in the future, not only for the tighter emission regulations but also for the great cost reduction of the total after-treatment system by the reduction of the main DPF’s size and weight and more options of other cheaper materials. The back pressure problem revealed in the experiment was then studied through a one dimensional model simulation and its influence to the engine performance was discussed. Fuel injection parameters which are related with the engine performance and emissions were also investigated in the study. After careful calibrations, a single injection induced Partially Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) combustion was achieved, in which <b>mode,</b> <b>NOx</b> and smoke emissions were reduced by more than 80 % compared with using the normal multiple injections. Following that, the non-volatile particulate emissions under the pilot injection’s impacts were studied and the key parameters of the pilot control such as fuel quantity and injection timing were examined. The particulate number concentrations and size distributions were investigated under different engine operation conditions and the results illustrated how a pilot injection alongside a main injection could influence particulates and what these effects were closely related to. The research continued with the investigation of bio-fuels on the particle emission reduction, when 10 % alternative diesel fuel blends (Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL)) were used. They indicated that without any modification to the engine, adding selected alternative fuels, even at a low percentage, could result in a noticeable reduction of the particle numbers, both in the total and the non-volatile parts; however, the number of nucleation mode particles could increase in certain cases. It was also revealed that the engine suffered very high numbers of the nucleation mode particulates during warming up. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
