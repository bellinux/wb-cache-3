40|$|Theories for {{the origin}} of life require the {{availability}} of reduced nitrogen for the formation of such species as amino acid and nucleic acids. In a strongly reducing atmosphere, compounds essential to the chemical evolution of life, such as amino acids, can form by reactions between HCN, NH 3, and carbonyl compounds produced in spark discharges. However, under non-reducing atmospheres, electric discharges produced NO rather than HCN or NH 3. This raises the questions of; how ammonia can be formed under a neutral atmosphere, and what conditions are needed such formation to occur? On possibility is the conversion of NO into nitric and <b>nitrous</b> <b>acids</b> (through HNO) and rained into the oceans. The reduction of nitrite by aqueous Fe(II) (6 Fe(+ 2) + 7 H(+) + NO 2 (-) yields 6 Fe(III) + 2 H 2 O + NH 3) such as was present on the early Earth could then have produced ammonia. However, this reaction does not proceed at pHs less than 7. 3. An alternative is reduction by other forms of Fe(II), such as FeS. We will present results that show that FeS can reduce nitrite to ammonia at pHs as low as pH 5 under a variety of conditions...|$|R
30|$|NOB {{were not}} {{detected}} in the granular aggregates though the granules could retain slow-growing strains from washout. The absence of NOB in the microbial aggregates could partially {{be explained by the}} alternating inhibitions of free ammonia (FA, ~ 140  mg-NH 3 -N/L) and free <b>nitrous</b> <b>acids</b> (FNA, ~ 0.15  mg-HNO 2 -N/L) at {{the beginning and the end}} of the aerobic phases, respectively (Anthonisen et al. 1976). These values are much higher than the inhibition thresholds on NOB reported previously. Kim et al. pointed out 0.1 – 1.0  mg/L of FA will inhibit NOB, while AOB exhibit a much stronger tolerance to FA, withstanding concentrations up to 10 – 160  mg/L (Kim et al. 2005). Vadivelu et al. (2006) reported that NOB is thoroughly inhibited when concentration of FA and FNA reach 6 and 0.02  mg/L, respectively. Low DO concentration exerts a competitive inhibition by AOB over NOB due to the higher half-saturation coefficient of DO affinity for NOB (Picioreanu et al. 1997). NOB were more severely inhibited under low DO conditions than AOB, which partially account for the absence of NOB in granular activated sludge. Apart from nitrifying organisms, clones related with various potential denitrifiers, such as Pseudomonas spp. Burkholderia and Lactobacillus, were observed. Clones associated with Pseudomonadales, Burkholderiales and Lactobacillales bacteria accounted for more than 70 % of the library.|$|R

The denitrification reactor converts ammonia into inert gas N 2, {{in addition to other}} important advantages connected to the alkaline character of the biochemical pathway of the denitrifying bacteria. Firstly the trickling water crossing the denitrification reactor, underwent a notable increase in pH (from an average pH= 7. 3 to 8. 0) which prevented the acidic inhibition of the nitrifying bacteria due to the build-up of nitric and <b>nitrous</b> <b>acids.</b> Secondly, the increase in pH created the ideal conditions for the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria.

The results of the biofilm observation using a scanning confocal laser microscope, are reported together with the identification of degrading bacteria genera in the biotrickling filter.

40|$|Denitrifying {{phosphorus}} removal (DPR) by denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating organisms (DPAOs) is a promising approach for reducing energy and carbon usage. However, influent fluctuations or interruptions frequently expose the DPAOs biomass to starvation conditions, reducing biomass activity and amount, and ultimately degrading {{the performance of}} DPR. Therefore, {{a better understanding of}} the endogenous metabolism and recovery ability of DPAOs is urgently required. In the present study, anaerobic starvation (12 days) and recovery were investigated in nitrite- and nitrate-cultivated DPAOs at 20 ± 1 °C. The cell decay rates in nitrite-DPAOs sludges from the end of the anaerobic and aerobic phase were 0. 008 day and 0. 007 day, respectively, being 64 % and 68 % lower than those of nitrate-DPAOs sludges. Nitrite-DPAOs sludges also recovered more rapidly than nitrate-DPAOs sludge after 12 days of starvation. The maintenance energy of nitrite-DPAOs sludges from the end of the anaerobic and aerobic phase were approximately 31 % and 34 % lower, respectively, than those of nitrate-DPAOs sludges. Glycogen and polyphosphate (poly-P) sequentially served as the main maintenance energy sources in both nitrite-and nitrate-DPAOs sludges. However, the transformation pathway of the intracellular polymers during starvation differed between them. Nitrate-DPAOs sludge used extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (mainly polysaccharides) as an additional maintenance energy source during the first 3 days of starvation. During this phase, EPS appeared to contribute to 19 - 27 % of the ATP production in nitrate-DPAOs, but considerably less to the cell maintenance of nitrite-DPAOs. The high resistance of nitrite-DPAOs to starvation might be attributable to frequent short-term starvation and exposure to toxic substances such as nitrite/free <b>nitrous</b> <b>acids</b> in the parent nitrite-fed reactor. The strong resistance of nitrite-DPAOs sludge to anaerobic starvation may be exploited in P removal by shortcut denitrification processes...|$|R

Models currently used to predict soil NO fluxes {{are based on the}} assumption that NO flux is proportional to the gross rate of nitrification or N mineralization; however, this assumption has not been tested because of the difficulty in measuring gross N-cycling rates in situ. We measured soil NO fluxes, gross and net N-cycling rates, and a variety of other soil characteristics in the forest floor and intact soil cores at nine undisturbed forest and rangeland ecosystems of New Mexico, Utah, and Oregon, USA, to determine which soil variables were most closely related to soil NO flux. Soil NO fluxes ranged from a low of 0. 02 ng N·m 22 ·s 21, prior to wetting in a western hemlock–sitka spruce forest on the Oregon coast, to a high of 6. 74 ng N·m 22 ·s 21, one hour after soil wetting in a juniper woodland of central Oregon. In contrast to our expectations, neither gross nitrification nor gross mineralization was correlated with soil NO flux. Fluxes were positively correlated with net rates of mineralization and nitrification, soil NO 3 2 concentrations, bulk density, and pH, and negatively correlated with gross rates of NO 3 2 consumption in the forest floor, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil C:N, and soil water content. Principal-component analysis showed that NO flux after water addition (2 cm of water) had a strong negative correlation with microbial demand for N (as indicated by net mineralization, net nitrification, SOC, and C:N). Our results suggest that, even in well-drained soils, NO efflux is limited more by NO consumption than by NO production.
