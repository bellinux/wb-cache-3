40|$|High-speed {{turbines}} {{are used}} in tipper stage liquid engines of launch vehicles and the most common ones include LH 2 and LOX turbines used in the cryogenic stages. The main constraints in the design Of turbine system for a liquid engine are thermal loads, mass flow and pressure drops in various systems ahead of the turbine inlet. The temperature of the combustion products/gases reaching the turbine blades must be well below the ruching point of the turbine blade material and the mass flow rate must be sufficient to generate the required power. Turbine call be started in two ways, by generating gases using a solid propellant-based spinner motor, and using compressed gases stored in gas bottles. The first method involves design challenges but requires less space and weight. On the other hand, second method is simple but requires more space. Because of the space and weight constraints associated with the upper stages, first method is preferred and discussed in this paper. It consists of a solid propellant-based spinner motor with a convergent-divergent nozzle, a guiding duct connecting nozzle exit, and the turbine inlet manifold {{in the form of}} a torroid with <b>nozzle</b> <b>block</b> having, 39 guiding nozzles.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 59 This {{tutorial}} {{will present}} {{an overview of}} the operation and design of steam turbines used for driving reactor and boiler feed pumps, called a boiler feed pump turbine (BFPT). Overall, these turbines are designed {{in much the same way}} as other mechanical drive turbines; however, there are characteristics to these units that make them unique to this application. A feed pump turbine must be integrated and completely compatible with the pump and the main turbine generator (TG) unit because these pieces of equipment are so interrelated. One of the most unique features of these turbines is their ability to operate from two separate and very different steam supplies. To accommodate these steam sources, two separate inlets must be used, each with its own special characteristics. The high pressure (HP) inlet has a separate steam chest designed to accept the boiler pressure. This inlet will feed a <b>nozzle</b> <b>block</b> that has an arc of admission of 25 percent or less. The low pressure (LP) inlet generally utilizes approximately 50 percent of the arc and has a much larger flow passing area. This type of turbine varies in output across the operating range of the plant. There are two basic operating cycles. The two pump operating cycle usually runs between 40 percent and 110 percent main unit load (MUL), this operation is achieved by using all LP steam. The one pump operating cycle, startup to approximately 65 percent MUL, uses both steam sources. The percent of each is determined by the load required, as well as the LP steam conditions. As the load increases on the TG main unit, the LP pressure supply to the BFPT increases, the HP steam is used to start up the BFPT unit and supplemented by the LP steam source to achieve the required load. There are numerous other factors beside modes of operation to consider when designing a boiler feed pump turbine. These include the speed and power requirements of the pump, steam characteristics from the main unit and boiler, and exhaust pressure. From a mechanical perspective there are a number of design features available on the style turbine to consider for maintaining reliability. The most obvious design feature is the single flow versus double flow design. The rotating component of the turbine, the rotor, is the key for maintaining reliability. It consists of an integrally forged shaft, blades with various styles of fastening, and shrouds or blade covers. The blades have either an axial or radial entry design root to secure them to the disk portion of the shaft. Shrouding also has multiple variations. It can be riveted, integral, integral with wire, or an integral interlocking design. Stationary elements consist of the diaphragms and labyrinth seals. The diaphragms direct the flow between the rotating blade rows. All boiler feed pump turbines have two journal bearings and a thrust bearing. In most cases tilting pad journal bearings are used because of their inherent stability and damping characteristics. Thrust bearings are mostly the standard double acting type. Controlling the steam flow to the turbine is done with the valve operating gear assembly. This assembly consists of simple linkage arrangement that controls the lift of the diffuser valves feeding the low pressure chest and the high pressure valve. The entire assembly is raised and lowered by an oil controlled servo motor. There are various other peripherals such as turning gears, probes, and rounding brushes that may or may not be used, which will also be discussed...|$|E

More recently the MIEX Â® DOC Process was developed specifically for the removal of NOM in drinking water production. This process has been operating at the Mt Pleasant plant in South Australia since 2001 where it has been applied in two treatment streams in combination with conventional coagulation/filtration and membrane filtration. Plant operation has been closely monitored to ensure that any unforeseen problems are detected at an early stage as this is of particular concern when introducing a new technology such as MIEXÂ®.

This addition makes it possible to test the effectiveness of the localized arc filament plasma actuators (LAFPAs) for the purposes of noise mitigation and mixing enhancement over a wide range of temperatures. These actuators have been used successfully at GDTL in high Reynolds number, high-speed unheated jets.

A total of sixteen combinations of forcing azimuthal modes (m = 0, 1, 3, and Â± 4) and temperature ratios (To/Ta = 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, and 2. 5) at a wide range of forcing frequencies were collected to examine LAFPAs effectiveness for far-field noise mitigation. The results show that LAFPAs can consistently produce significant reductions in noise levels. Across the range of temperatures explored here, the effectiveness of LAFPAs improves as temperature increases. Possible reasons for the increase in effectiveness are discussed.

40|$|When coal bed methane (CBM) {{drainage}} boreholes cross fractured, soft, or water-swelling strata, they {{collapse and}} block frequently. Borehole blockages {{result in a}} rapid decrease in CBM extraction ability, {{which leads to a}} reduction in CBM output and threatens coal mine safety production. To solve these problems, a novel method that uses a self-propelled water-jet <b>nozzle</b> to dredge <b>blocked</b> boreholes in coal seams has been proposed {{on the basis of the}} existing technology. Based on a theoretical analysis of the reason for borehole caving and the theory of blockage removal, we optimized the nozzle inlet pressure and selected an appropriate high-pressure resin pipe. A field experiment on the blockage removal of blocked CBM drainage boreholes using the proposed method was run in the Fengchun coal mine, Qijiang, Chongqing, southwest China. In this field trial, the time spent to unblock a borehole varied between 18. 52 and 34. 98 min, which is much shorter than using a drilling rig. After blockage removal, the average pure volume of the methane drainage of a single borehole was increased from 0. 03 L/min to ~ 1. 91 â€“ 7. 30 L/min, and the methane drainage concentration of a single borehole increased from 5 % to ~ 44 %â€“ 85 %. The extraction effect increased significantly...|$|R
