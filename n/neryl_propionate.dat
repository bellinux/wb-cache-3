40|$|Despite the {{sanitary}} {{importance of}} the European house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Trouessart, 1897), the pheromonal communication in this species has not been sufficiently studied. Headspace analysis using solid phase micro extraction (SPME) revealed that nerol, neryl formate, pentadecane, (6 Z, 9 Z) - 6, 9 -heptadecadiene, and (Z) - 8 -heptadecene are released by both sexes whereas <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate</b> was released by males only. Tritonymphs did not produce any detectable volatiles. In olfactometer experiments, pentadecane and <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate</b> were attractive to both sexes {{as well as to}} tritonymphs. (Z) - 8 -heptadecene was only attractive to male mites. Therefore it is discussed that pentadecane and <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate</b> are aggregation pheromones and (Z) - 8 -heptadecene is a sexual pheromone of the European house dust mite D. pteronyssinus. To study the potential use of pheromones in dust mite control, long-range olfactometer experiments were conducted showing that mites can be attracted to <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate</b> over distances of at least 50 cm. This indicates that mite pheromones might be useable to monitor {{the presence or absence of}} mites in the context of control strategies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{essential}} oils obtained by water distillation from the aerial parts of two Helichrysum italicum ssp. growing in Corsica (France). Tuscany and Sardinia (Ita 1 y) were analysed by GC-RI and GC-MS. The {{essential oils}} prepared from Corsican and Tuscan Helichrysum italicum subsp. italicum exhibited two different compositions. Corsican oils {{were characterized by}} the pre-eminence of oxygenated compounds: neryl acetate (major compound), <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate,</b> nerol, acyclic ketones and -diketones. Conversely, Tuscan oils were found to exhibit higher contents of hydrocarbons (-pinene, -caryophyllene, - and -selinenes). The comparison of essential oils hydrodistiIled from Corsican and Sardinian Helichrysum italicum subsp. microphyllum showed almost similar chemical compositions. The main constituents were: neryl acetate, nerol, <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate,</b> linalool, eudesm- 5 -en- 11 -ol and -curcumene...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of Sardinian dwarf curry plant (Helichrysum italicum G. Don ssp. microphyllum (Willd.) Nym.) essential oils was studied. Oil samples were isolated by water and steam distillation of flowering tops collected at different locations. The constituents of the oils {{were analyzed by}} GC/MS. Since both the {{chemical composition}} and physicochemical characteristics of the oils obtained during these trials were significantly different, they {{were divided into two}} groups. One oil was rich in nerol (10. 7 %), neryl acetate (28. 9 %), <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate</b> (11. 4 %) and γ-curcumene (11. 4 %), while the other was rich in linalool (14. 9 %) and γ-curcumene (18. 2 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} essential oils isolated from the aerial parts of Anthemis pignattiorum Guarino, Raimondo & Domina and A. ismelia Lojac. and the aerial parts and flowers of Anthemis cupaniana Tod. ex Nyman, three endemic Sicilian species belonging to the section Hiorthia, was determined by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. (Z) -Muurola- 4 (14), 5 -diene (27. 3 %) was recognized as the main constituent of the A. pignattiorum essential oil, together with isospathulenol (10. 6 %), sabinene (7. 7 %), and artemisyl acetate (6. 8 %), while in the oil obtained from the aerial parts of A. ismelia, geranyl propionate (8. 8 %), bornyl acetate (7. 9 %), β-thujone (7. 8 %), <b>neryl</b> <b>propionate</b> (6. 5 %), and t-muurolol (6. 5 %) prevailed. α-Pinene was the main compound of both the aerial part and flower oils of A. cupaniana (18. 4 and 13. 2 %, resp.). Also noteworthy are the considerable amounts of artemisyl acetate (12. 7 %) and β-thujone (11. 8 %) found in the oil from the aerial parts and those of tricosane (9. 8 %) and sabinene (7. 6 %) evidenced in the flower oil. Furthermore, {{an update on the}} main compounds identified in the essential oils of all the Anthemis taxa studied so far was presented, and cluster analyses were carried out, to compare the essential oils of these taxa...|$|E
