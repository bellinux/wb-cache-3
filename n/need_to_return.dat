5|$|Curtin {{replied to}} Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December, and again {{stressed}} the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> the 9th Division to Australia {{as soon as}} possible to make good the Army's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific. In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Black Pearl, which Elizabeth {{saw as a}} child, attacks Port Royal {{searching for}} the medallion. The crew of the Black Pearl capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa for negotiations. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner, to conceal her {{identity}} as the governor's daughter, but Barbossa takes her prisoner. Elizabeth learns that after Barbossa's crew took the cursed treasure of Cortés from Isla de Muerta, {{they were forced to}} bear the curse of undeath; they appear as heavily decomposed corpses in moonlight. To lift the curse, they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> all 882 gold pieces of eight with the blood of the owner of each piece. Elizabeth's medallion is the final piece.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role {{of one of the}} three Jack {{brothers}} – Jack Frost, Jack Lantern, or Jack Skelton – who have visited the human world for Halloween, and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to the fairy world before the portal connecting the two worlds closes. The player needs to make their way through six areas, which consist of a number of floors, defeating enemies by using character-specific attacks and collecting keys to be able to advance to the next floor. It received generally positive reception for its gameplay, but was criticized for the lack of puzzle elements and under-utilization of the Virtual Boy's 3D effect.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E
25|$|Fishing nets, {{usually made}} of plastic, {{can be left}} or lost in the ocean by fishermen. Known as ghost nets, these {{entangle}} fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other creatures, restricting movement, causing starvation, laceration, infection, and, in those that <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to the surface to breathe, suffocation.|$|E

Event-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform certain actions when specific circumstances occur. For example, driving past the local library cues the remembrance of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> an overdue book. Time-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action at a particular point in time. For example, seeing that it is 10:00 PM acts as a cue to watch a favorite television show.|$|E

25|$|The league {{believes}} that the players would gladly trade the fairness of a longer championship series {{for an opportunity to}} play a winner-take-all title game in a major league ballpark. It gives each player a goal that is both selfish and team-oriented: play in Busch Stadium twice in one year. The one-game finale also grants the league definitive closure. With student-athletes that <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to campus in August, the conclusion of the season is set {{before the end of the}} previous calendar year.|$|E
25|$|Ethnicity, age, education, employment, marital status, and {{location}} are reported factors of delayed breastfeeding and infant under nutrition. Low- income mothers are specifically {{at risk for}} under nutrition and high mortality rates amongst their infants because they replace breast milk with formula. They {{do so because they}} lack a supportive environment, embarrassment of nursing, or the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to school or work. About 16.5% of low-income mothers breastfed for the recommended time. Studies suggest that scarce financial and social resources are consistent with the high mortality rates amongst the infants of low-income mothers.|$|E

25|$|Because Haukeland is {{situated}} in a residential area, the noise pollution for landings is significant. The Civil Aviation Authority has in its concession limited the number of aircraft movements at the hospital to 400 per year, which forces Haukeland to revert the majority of flights to Grønneviksøren. However, helicopters which arrive from Rogaland and Sogn og Fjordane normally need to refuel before returning and therefore have to also land at Grønneviksøren before returning. Local helicopters <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to base at Grønneviksøren. There is some noise pollution at Grønneviksøren, although it is significantly smaller than at the hospital.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great degree}} of {{internal}} debate about which training program best prepares an MT for industry work. Yet, whether one has learned medical transcription from an online course, community college, high school night course, or on-the-job training in a doctor's office or hospital, a knowledgeable MT is highly valued. In lieu of these AHDI certification credentials, MTs who can consistently and accurately transcribe multiple document work-types and return reports within a reasonable turnaround-time (TAT) are sought after. TATs set by the service provider or agreed to by the transcriptionist should be reasonable but consistent with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> the document to the patient's record in a timely manner.|$|E

25|$|From {{the point}} of view of the author of a routine, raising an {{exception}} is a useful way to signal that a routine could not execute normally - for example, when an input argument is invalid (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function) or when a resource it relies on is unavailable (like a missing file, a hard disk error, or out-of-memory errors). In systems without exceptions, routines would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated by the semipredicate problem, in which users of the routine need to write extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones.|$|E
25|$|During 1953 and 1954, further {{reductions}} in the RAN saw one carrier taken off active duty {{for use as a}} training vessel, eliminating the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> Hobart to service. Other options for reactivating the cruiser were explored, including conversion to a guided missile ship, but by April 1955, all proposals were abandoned. Despite the conversion work to date having cost £A1 million, the modification was cancelled, and Hobart was returned to the reserve fleet and marked for disposal. Hobart was sold for scrap on 22 February 1962 to Japanese firm Mitsui & Co (Aust) Pty Ltd. The ship left Sydney under tow on 3 March, and arrived in Osaka on 2 April for breaking up.|$|E
25|$|Finnish coastal {{artillery}} made {{modifications to}} the gun mountings during the interwar period. The most significant of these was inverting the gun so that the recuperating spring {{was on top of}} the gun which allowed increasing the maximum elevation and thus the range. Inverting the gun however required also strengthening the recuperator, adding an equilibrator to correct the changed balance and other changes to the mounting and elevation mechanism. Increased maximum elevation also allowed using the gun as an anti-aircraft weapon. To increase maximum range even more the ammunition for the guns was modified by adding a ballistic cap to existing ammunition which increased the range by a factor of 1.5. Additionally Finns changed the gun loading practice to allow reloading without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> the gun to zero elevation after each shot. This practice increased the rate of fire.|$|E

25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or immobilization. Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. The next step is to facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feeling about the experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) in problem solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} amniotes, including stem-reptiles (those amniotes {{closer to}} modern reptiles than to mammals), were largely overshadowed by larger stem-tetrapods, such as Cochleosaurus, and remained a small, inconspicuous {{part of the}} fauna until the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse. This sudden collapse affected several large groups. Primitive tetrapods were particularly devastated, while stem-reptiles fared better, being ecologically adapted to the drier conditions that followed. Primitive tetrapods, like modern amphibians, <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to water to lay eggs; in contrast, amniotes, like modern reptiles– whose eggs possess a shell {{that allows them to}} be laid on land– were better adapted to the new conditions. Amniotes acquired new niches at a faster rate than before the collapse and at a much faster rate than primitive tetrapods. They acquired new feeding strategies including herbivory and carnivory, previously only having been insectivores and piscivores. From this point forward, reptiles dominated communities and had a greater diversity than primitive tetrapods, setting the stage for the Mesozoic (known as the Age of Reptiles). One of the best known early stem-reptiles is Mesosaurus, a genus from the early Permian that had returned to water, feeding on fish.|$|E
25|$|The Goa'uld ruled Earth for {{thousands}} of years, in the personae of gods from Earth's classical religions. It is never clarified, however, whether the Goa'uld impersonate deities that already existed in human mythology or if they themselves were the origin of those deities. From the humans, the Goa'uld engineered the Jaffa, who serve as soldiers and incubators for their young. They also transplanted significant numbers of humans from Earth throughout the galaxy via the Stargate network to serve as slaves and potential hosts. After Ra's rule over Earth {{came to an end}} with a rebellion in the third millennium BC, after which the Stargate was buried in the ground to render it unusable, Earth was largely forgotten and for some reason never revisited; this is possibly because Earth contained no notable natural resources such as naqahdah, and the Goa'uld had already established sustainable human slave populations of sufficient size for genetic diversity elsewhere, obviating the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to our inconveniently distant planet. Earth passed into legend amongst the human and Jaffa populations of the galaxy, until the 20th century, when the Stargate was discovered and eventually activated.|$|E
25|$|Such a community-wide collapse, {{involving}} many pollinator species, {{can occur}} suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass {{a critical point}} and recovery from such a collapse might not be easy.
