40|$|Abstract—An optimal {{negotiation}} agent {{should have}} capability for maximizing its utility even for negotiation with incomplete information {{in which the}} agents do not know opponent’s private information such as reserve price (RP) and deadline. To support negotiation with incomplete negotiation, this work focuses on designing learning agents called Bayesian learning (BL) based negotiation agents (BLNA) adopting a time-dependent negotiation model. In BLNA, BL is used for estimating opponent’s RP and the corresponding deadline is computed using the estimated RP. BLNA also has the capability of maximizing its utility using estimated <b>deadline</b> <b>information</b> when its <b>deadline</b> is shorter {{than or equal to}} the estimated deadline. To evaluate the performance of BLNA, BLNA is compared to an agent with complete information and an agent with incomplete information. Empirical results showed that BLNA achieved: 1) always higher utility than the agent with incomplete information for all cases, 2) close to or slightly lower utility than the agent with complete <b>information</b> when its <b>deadline</b> is lower and equal to opponent’s deadline, and 3) lower utility than the agent with complete <b>information</b> when <b>deadline</b> is higher than opponent’s deadline.

40|$|Automated {{methods to}} detect <b>new</b> <b>information</b> in {{clinical}} notes may be valuable for navigating and using information in these documents for patient care. Statistical language models were evaluated {{as a means}} to quantify <b>new</b> <b>information</b> over longitudinal clinical notes for a given patient. The <b>new</b> <b>information</b> proportion (NIP) in target notes decreased logarithmically with increasing numbers of previous notes to create the language model. For a given patient, the amount of <b>new</b> <b>information</b> had cyclic patterns. Higher NIP scores correlated with notes having more <b>new</b> <b>information</b> often with clinically significant events, and lower NIP scores indicated notes with less <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> Our analysis also revealed “copying and pasting ” to be widely used in generating clinical notes by copying information from the most recent historical clinical notes forward. These methods can potentially aid clinicians in finding notes with more clinically relevant <b>new</b> <b>information</b> and in reviewing notes more purposefully which may increase the efficiency of clinicians in delivering patient care...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we present the {{conceptualisation}} {{of a recent}} Belief Revision approach to Information Retrieval. After a brief introduction of the approach, the conceptualisation is presented. It follows the framework pro-posed by Lalmas and Bruza for comparison of dierent logical approaches to Information Retrieval. Finally, future lines of work are commented. 1 Belief Revision and Information Retrieval Belief Revision (BR) deals {{with the issue of}} updating a knowledge base in the light of <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> The trivial case appears when the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> does not con-tradict the previous knowledge, and the revision simply expands the knowledge base with the <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> When con icts arise, the basic policy is that the revised knowledge base must imply the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> and retain as much old knowledge as possible. Therefore, some criterion is needed in order to decide what parts of the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> are closest to the old information. Model-based approaches to BR es-tablish an order among the models of the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> induced by the knowledge base. Models of the revised theory are the minimal models of the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> i...|$|R

40|$|Rational {{decision}} making under uncertainty requires forming beliefs that integrate prior and <b>new</b> <b>information</b> through Bayes rule. Human decision makers typically deviate from Bayesian updating by either overweighting the prior (conservatism) or overweighting <b>new</b> <b>information</b> (e. g. the represen tativeness heuristic). We investigated these deviations through measurements of electrocortical {{activity in the}} human brain during incentivized probability updating tasks and found evidence of extremely early commitment to boundedly rational heuristics. Participants who overweight <b>new</b> <b>information</b> display a lower sensibility to conflict detection, captured by an event related potential (the N 2) observed around 260 ms after the presen tation of <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> Conservative decision makers (who overweight prior probabilities) make up their mind before <b>new</b> <b>information</b> is presented, {{as indicated by the}} lateralized readiness potential in the brain.

50|$|In {{addition}} to processing novel information {{in which the}} meaning behind the information is enough to transfer it to long term memory, another way that elaborative rehearsal works is by associating <b>new</b> <b>information</b> with information that is already held in long term memory.

30|$|A {{realistic}} {{model for}} information propagation {{may be a}} state dependent variant of the model where propagation events (attempts of influence) occur only for <b>new</b> <b>information</b> (or probability for <b>new</b> <b>information</b> is higher).

However, when <b>new</b> <b>information</b> is perceived {{that does not}} fit a schema, many things can happen. The most common reaction is to simply ignore or quickly forget the <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> This can happen on a deep level— frequently an individual does not become conscious of or even perceive the <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> People may also interpret the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> {{in a way that}} minimizes how much they must change their schemata. For example, Bob thinks that chickens don't lay eggs. He then sees a chicken laying an egg. Instead of changing the part of his schema that says [...] "chickens don't lay eggs", he is likely to adopt the belief that the animal in question that he has just seen laying an egg is not a real chicken. This is an example of disconfirmation bias, the tendency to set higher standards for evidence that contradicts one's expectations. However, when the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> cannot be ignored, existing schemata must be changed or new schemata must be created (accommodation).|$|R

The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) {{has resulted in}} rapid text proliferation within clinical care. Clinicians' use of copying and pasting functions in EHR systems further compounds this by creating {{a large amount of}} redundant clinical information in clinical documents. A mixture of redundant information (especially outdated and incorrect <b>information)</b> and <b>new</b> <b>information</b> in a single clinical note increases clinicians' cognitive burden and results in decision-making difficulties. Moreover, replicated erroneous information can potentially cause risks to patient safety. However, automated methods to identify redundant or relevant <b>new</b> <b>information</b> in clinical texts have not been extensively investigated. The overarching goal of this research is to develop and evaluate automated methods to identify new and clinically relevant information in clinical notes using expert-derived reference standards. Modified global alignment methods were adapted to investigate the pattern of redundancy in individual longitudinal clinical notes as well as a larger group of patient clinical notes. Statistical language models were also developed to identify new and clinically relevant information in clinical notes. Relevant <b>new</b> <b>information</b> identified by automated methods will be highlighted in clinical notes to provide visualization cues to clinicians. <b>New</b> <b>information</b> proportion (NIP) was used to indicate the quantity of <b>new</b> <b>information</b> in each note and also navigate clinician notes with more <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> Classifying semantic types of <b>new</b> <b>information</b> further provides clinicians with specific types of <b>new</b> <b>information</b> that they are interested in finding.

40|$|Unlike the AGM {{framework}} of belief revision, where <b>new</b> <b>information</b> {{is added to}} the current belief state as it is (while attempting to preserve logical consistency), we model the following more natural proposal: agents seek a justification (explanation) for the <b>new</b> <b>information</b> before "accepting" it and incorporate this justification into their current belief state together with the <b>new</b> <b>information.</b> We model this proposal using the process of abductive inference. The resulting process is called abductive expansion and is characterised by a set of intuitive postulates. Constructions, similar in spirit to those proposed for AGM contraction and revision, are discussed. 1.
