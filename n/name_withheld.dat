40|$|<b>Names</b> <b>withheld</b> {{for blind}} review prediction, {{temporal}}-difference learning, temporal abstraction, options, TD networks, reinforcement learning Temporal-difference (TD) networks {{have been proposed}} {{as a way of}} representing and learning a wide variety of predictions about the interaction between an agent and its environment (Sutton & Tanner, 2005). These predictions are compositional in that their targets are defined in terms of other predictions, and subjunctive in that that they are about what would happen if an action or sequence of actions were taken. In conventional TD networks, the inter-related predictions are at successive time steps and contingent on a single action; here we generalize them to accommodate extended time intervals and contingency on whole ways of behaving. Our generalization is based on the options framework for temporal abstraction (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999). The primary contribution {{of this paper is to}} introduce a new algorithm for intra-option learning in TD networks with function approximation and eligibility traces. We present empirical examples of our algorithm’s effectiveness and of the greater representational expressiveness of temporally-abstract TD networks. 1...|$|R
