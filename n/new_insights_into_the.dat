5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} <b>new</b> <b>insights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were {{composed}} of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time}} that the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008, <b>new</b> <b>insights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{effect of}} Internet usage on {{cognition}} were {{gleaned from the}} results, reported in a press release, of {{a study conducted by}} UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.|$|E

5|$|These {{features}} were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, {{which may be}} far older than {{was assumed to be}} the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served—at least partially—as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with <b>new</b> <b>insights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{administration}} {{was marked by}} a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, Titus faced {{a number of major}} disasters during his brief reign. On August 24, 79, barely two months after his accession, Mount Vesuvius erupted, resulting in the almost complete destruction of life and property in the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava, killing thousands of citizens. Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort, while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano. Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year. The city was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748. Since then, its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city {{at the height of the}} Roman Empire, frozen at the moment it was buried on August 24, 79. The Forum, the baths, many houses, and some out-of-town villas like the Villa of the Mysteries remain surprisingly well preserved. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Italy and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On-going excavations reveal <b>new</b> <b>insights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Roman history and culture.|$|E

25|$|The 20th century brought <b>new</b> <b>insights</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> play.

Also in 1961, Frank Kermode wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of Macrobius, Apuleius, and Giordano Bruno. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the First Epistle to the Corinthians by Paul the Apostle, dealing with divine love.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational waves can {{penetrate}} {{regions of}} space that electromagnetic waves cannot.
