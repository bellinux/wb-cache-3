5|$|Mido entered {{talks with}} Wigan Athletic over signing on a six-month loan deal, and he {{completed}} the move on 23 January 2009. He scored on his debut with the equalizing goal against Liverpool with a penalty kick in a 1–1 draw on 28 January. He scored for Wigan in a 4–1 defeat against Arsenal and {{he finished the}} loan spell with 12 appearances and 2 goals. Following Middlesbrough's relegation to the Championship, he failed to report to pre-season training, and he was eventually fined by the club after <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> up after a fortnight. He returned to training a day after this.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{is called}} {{into a room}} in the library by Jenny’s group, who try to bribe her into <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> them in to the Hearst police. However, she denies and records their {{conversation}} as further proof. They are hiding a third ID machine, and Veronica tells Weevil to go and find it. Dick shows Logan a sex tape of Piz and Veronica that has been circulating in an email. Because Logan thinks Piz posted the tape, he attacks Piz and hits him incessantly. Weevil does have a student ID machine, and Logan walks into Mars Investigations with Piz’s blood on him.|$|E
5|$|At Queen Square, the Morris {{family lived}} in a flat {{directly}} above the Firm's shop. They were joined by Janey's sister Bessie Burton {{and a number of}} household servants. Meanwhile, changes were afoot at the Firm as Faulkner left, and to replace him they employed a business manager, Warrington Taylor, who would remain with them till 1866. Taylor pulled the Firm's finances into order and spent much time controlling Morris and ensuring that he worked to schedule. During these years the Firm carried out a number of high-profile designs; from September 1866 to January 1867, they redecorated the Armoury and Tapestry Room in St. James' Palace, in the latter year also designing the Green Dining Room at the South Kensington Museum (it is now the Morris Room at the Victoria and Albert Museum). The Firm's work received increasing interest from people in the United States, resulting in Morris's acquaintance with Henry James and Charles Eliot Norton. However, despite its success, the Firm was <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> over a large net profit, and this, coupled with the decreasing value of Morris' stocks, meant that he had to decrease his spending.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Chatsworth Farm did {{not achieve}} {{the success that}} Joan had envisaged, and was <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> a profit. A trainer had worked there until 1967, but he left {{because he did not}} get on with Robinson, and by 1969 Robinson was {{considering}} selling the place. Joan wanted to keep it running, however, and persuaded Diane Settegast, a friend from Dallas, to take on the temporary role of trainer.|$|E

That same day, a covered walkway above Washington Street from the inbound platform of the York and Washington Streets station to the Brooklyn Bridge was opened.|$|E

At one of the group's concerts in Washington, DC in 1912, the then-owner of Monticello, Jefferson Monroe Levy, was in attendance and was publicly baited for <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> Monticello over outright to the United States government.|$|E

25|$|Historically, two doctrines {{concerning}} {{executive power}} have developed that enable {{the president to}} exercise executive power {{with a degree of}} autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, , that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, , that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.|$|E
25|$|South Australia were {{a tougher}} {{proposition}} and Len Hutton, back as captain, decided to bat first on a pitch that looked full of runs (but wasn't). Bill Edrich was out for another duck and only Denis Compton, flown {{in the day}} before after a knee operation in England, made any headway with 113. The rotund slow left arm bowler Jack Wilson took 5/81 despite the wicket <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> and they were out for 246. South Australia overtook this the next day regardless of 5/62 from Frank Tyson as Les Favell increased his hopes of Test selection with 84, adding 119 for the first wicket with David Harris (48). They reached the MCC total at 246/7 {{by the end of}} the day, but after the rest day only wicket-keeper Gil Langley (38 not out) added any more runs as they fell to 254 all out, a lead of only 8. Batting again the MCC innings revolved around Hutton's steadfast 98 as they were out for 181, Jack Wilson (4/32) again the destroyer. Their innings ended at stumps and there was a crowd of 6,000 to see the local team beat the tourists. As in the first innings Les Favell (47) did well, but like the MCC innings only the first man in made any runs as South Australia slipped from 95/2 to 152 all out thanks to Bob Appleyard (5/46). The crowd did not appreciate the MCC's 21 run win and booed them off the ground.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1660s, {{frustration}} was growing that the colonies were <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> a profit. [...] The Order still owed money to France {{for the initial}} purchase of the islands, and on Malta the knights debated whether they should sell them back. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, {{much more interested in}} colonization than Mazarin, was now in power in King Louis XIV's court, and he applied pressure to the Knights to sell. In 1665, the Knights sold their colony to the newly formed Compagnie des Indes occidentales.|$|E

500|$|Before {{turning to}} acting, Behan {{had a brief}} career in journalism in Ireland: [...] "I interviewed {{everyone}} from priests to prostitutes before my Dublin paper folded." [...] Behan was also involved in theatre work [...] he was a costume assistant during the original production of Tom Murphy's adaptation of Liam O'Flaherty's 1925 novel The Informer on 13 October 1981 at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin. He participated in various other plays in Dublin, but finding them [...] "all very over the top, very amateurish, full of people turning up drunk or <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> up at all", he decided to leave Ireland and pursue art studies in Berlin.|$|E
500|$|While claymation {{has been}} used in Indian {{television}} commercials, the film's title sequence—a representation of Ishaan's imagination—marked its first instance in a Bollywood film. Khan gave claymation artist Dhimant Vyas free rein over the various elements. The storyboarding took one and a half months and the shooting required 15days. The [...] "3 into 9" [...] sequence, in which Ishaan delves into his imagination to solve a math problem, was originally conceived as a 3D animation. Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> out as he had envisioned it. Khan scrapped the project and hired Vaibhav Kumaresh, who hand-drew the scene as a 2D animation.|$|E

500|$|This {{prompted}} showrunner Glen Mazzara {{to respond}} to such criticism. In his interview with The Daily Beast, he stated: [...] "The producers and writers of The Walking Dead are fully aware that the morning-after pill would not induce an abortion or miscarriage, we exercised our artistic creative license to explore a storyline with one of our characters, not to make any pro-life or pro-choice political statement. We sincerely hope that people are <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> to the fictional world of The Walking Dead for accurate medical information." [...] The episode itself does not, in fact, claim the morning after pills will work, as Glenn questions Lori over that fact, to which she replies {{that she does not}} know.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, BBC One {{broadcast}} Mutual Friends, a six-part {{television series}} written by Anil Gupta, which {{was compared to}} Cold Feet. While the BBC wanted the series to match the success of Cold Feet, producer Rob Bullock stressed that [...] "Cold Feet is about a different period of life. It's about people in their early thirties. Mutual Friends moves things on—what's happening to our characters as they approach 40 is very different. Why do so many lives fall apart at 40? Because things haven't worked out how we hoped and we've had to turn to Plan B. The drama {{is all about the}} crisis caused by things <b>not</b> <b>turning</b> out as the characters planned." [...] Later in 2008, ITV commissioned Married Single Other, a comedy drama executive-produced by Andy Harries and directed by Declan Lowney, about three contemporary couples living in Leeds.|$|E
