50|$|Signal Mountain is an {{isolated}} summit standing 7720 ft above sea level. The mountain {{is located in}} Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming.

Though located adjacent to the Tetons, Signal Mountain was not formed in the same manner or period. The mountain originally was formed by volcanic ashfall from one of the eruptions of the Yellowstone hotspot.

The present work gives quasi-radial approximation to the full magnetohydrodynamic equations for axisymmetric, polytropic solar wind flow to simulate this polar hole, with the benefit that model temperature and magnetic field intensities and distributions in this particular polar hole can be deduced. It is concluded that from 2 out to 5 solar radii the temperature varies only slightly with radius, but is larger {{near the center of}} the polar hole than at the edge. It is also found that the magnetic field intensity at 2 solar radii could be about 1 gauss at the center of the hole, decreasing toward the edge of the hole.

40|$|Waves are {{important}} for the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind. We have examined a long spectral time series of a <b>northern</b> coronal <b>hole</b> observed on the 20 th October 1996, with the SUMER spectrometer onboard SoHO. The observations were obtained in a transition region N IV 765 A line and in a low coronal Ne VIII 770 A line. Our observations indicate the presence of compressional waves with periods of ~ 25 min. Using Fourier techniques, we measured the phase delays between intensity as well as velocity oscillations in the two chosen lines. From this {{we are able to}} measure the travel time of the propagating oscillations and, hence, the propagation speeds of the waves producing the oscillations. We found that there is a difference {{in the nature of the}} propagation in bright ('network') and dark ('internetwork') regions with the latter sometimes showing evidence for downwardly propagating waves that is not seen in the former. As, in all cases, the measured propagation speeds are subsonic, we concluded that the detected waves are slow magnetoacoustic in nature. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

We find an overall temperature rise from 3. 0 keV in the core to 5. 5 keV at 120 kpc and a metallicity profile that rises slowly from 0. 5 solar to 0. 6 solar inside 60 kpc, but drops to 0 ̃. 4 solar at 120 kpc. Spatially resolved spectroscopy in small cells shows that the temperature distribution in the Perseus cluster is not symmetrical. There is a wealth of structure in the temperature map on scales of 10 arcsec (5. 2 kpc) showing swirliness and a temperature rise that coincides with a sudden surface brightness drop in the X-ray image. We obtain a metallicity map of the Perseus cluster core and find that the spectra extracted from the two central X-ray holes {{as well as the}} western X-ray hole are best-fit by gas with higher {{temperature and}} higher metallicity than is found in the surroundings of the holes. A spectral deprojection analysis suggests, however, that this is due to a projection effect; for the <b>northern</b> X-ray <b>hole</b> we find tight limits on the presence of an isothermal component in the X-ray hole, ruling out volume-filling X-ray gas with temperatures below 11 keV at 3 sigma.

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} between {{open and}} closed magnetic {{field in the}} corona is believed to {{play a crucial role}} in the corona/heliosphere coupling. At large scale, the exchange of open/closed connectivity is expected to occur in pseudo-streamer structures. However, there is neither clear observational evidence of how such coupling occurs in pseudo-streamers, nor evidence for how the magnetic reconnection evolves. Using a newly-developed technique, we enhance the off-limb magnetic fine structures observed with AIA and identify a pseudo-streamer-like feature located close to the <b>northern</b> coronal <b>hole.</b> After extrapolating the magnetic field with the PFSS model, we obtain a pseudo-streamer magnetic topology, null-point related topology bounded by open field. We compare the magnetic configuration with the UV observations and identify the magnetic structures expected to be involved in the event. Using an 3 D MHD simulation of interchange reconnection, we showed that the evolution of the UV structures follows the magnetic field dynamics and the UV emitting structures have a pattern very similar to the plasma emission derived from the simulation. Our results highlight that the exchange between open and closed in the pseudo-streamer topology related to an observed event occurs at least partially at the null-point, similarly to the interchange reconnection in a single null-point topology. However, our results also indicate that the interchange reconnection in pseudo-streamers is a gradual physical process which opposes to the impulsive reconnection of the solar-jet model...|$|R

The largest estimated excess pore-pressure values lie within the interpreted décollement zone at Site 949 and range from 1600 to 1900 kPa. Combining {{results from this study}} with previous data from Leg 110, two generalized functions of void ratio vs. hydraulic conductivity for high and low permeability sediments are developed that are characteristic for sediments of low and high smectite content. By applying these functions to the Site 671 (ODP Leg 110) porosity profile, it is possible to demonstrate the occurrence of a zone of low permeability immediately above the décollement. This is consistent with the concept that low permeability sediments will develop higher excess pore pressures, and therefore, are more susceptible to shear failure...|$|R

The Šawāwī are nomadic pastoralists {{who live in the}} mountainous interior of Oman, and are distinguished from the sedentary populace of the towns and villages of the mountain region by their lifestyle, patterns of social interaction, and dialect. The aim of the present study is to describe certain structural features of the dialect and to place the findings within the broader Omani typological context. The primary classificatory division of Omani dialects is that of the familiar socially based sedentary (S) versus Bedouin (B) dichotomy, the former being spoken among the historically settled populations of the mountain regions, and the latter by the nomadic and recently settled communities of the deserts. In the present study it is shown that in spite of the nomadic background of the Šawāwī, their dialect conforms in all respects with the Omani S type (Holes 1989, 1996).

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} {{between the}} open and closed magnetic fields in the corona is believed to {{play a crucial role}} in the corona/heliosphere coupling. At large scale, the exchange of open/closed connectivity is expected to occur in pseudo-streamer (PS) structures. However, there is neither clear observational evidence of how such coupling occurs in PSs, nor evidence for how the magnetic reconnection evolves. Using a newly developed technique, we enhance the off-limb magnetic fine structures observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and identify a PS-like feature located close to the <b>northern</b> coronal <b>hole.</b> We first identify that the magnetic topology associated with the observation is a PS, null-point (NP) related topology bounded by the open field. By comparing the magnetic field configuration with the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission regions, we determined that most of the magnetic flux associated with plasma emission are small loops below the PS basic NP and open field bounding the PS topology. In order to interpret the evolution of the PS, we referred to a three-dimensional MHD interchange reconnection modeling the exchange of connectivity between small closed loops and the open field. The observed PS fine structures follow the dynamics of the magnetic field before and after reconnecting at the NP obtained by the interchange model. Moreover, the pattern of the EUV plasma emission is the same as the shape of the expected plasma emission location derived from the simulation. These morphological and dynamical similarities between the PS observations and the results from the simulation strongly suggest that the evolution of the PS, and in particular the opening/closing of the field, occurs via interchange/slipping reconnection at the basic NP of the PS. Besides identifying the mechanism at work in the large-scale coupling between {{the open and}} closed fields, our results highlight that interchange reconnection in PSs is a gradual physical process that differs from the impulsive reconnection of the solar-jet model...|$|R

Located in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Wyoming, Grand Teton National Park is 10 mi south of Yellowstone National Park which was established in 1872, when Wyoming, Idaho and Montana were still territories and the region was very sparsely settled. By the late 19th century, conservationists were working to provide further protection to surrounding regions, leading President Grover Cleveland to create the Teton Forest Reserve, which included a portion of <b>northern</b> Jackson <b>Hole.</b> By 1902, the reserve had been combined into the Yellowstone Forest Reserve, then was divided again in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt, establishing the Teton National Forest, which protected most of the Teton Range. By 1907, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a temporary dam at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake. This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete Jackson Lake Dam replaced it by 1911. The dam was further enlarged in 1916, raising lake waters 39 ft {{as part of the}} Minidoka Project, designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho. Though efforts to protect the Teton Range and Jackson Hole as part of an expanded Yellowstone National Park dated back to the late 19th century, proposals to construct more dams on some of the other lakes in Jackson Hole led Yellowstone National Park superintendent Horace Albright to block such efforts. Albright was originally an advocate of the expanded Yellowstone plan which was very unpopular with local residents. By the mid-1920s local sentiment had changed as a result of proposals for a new national park including only the Teton Range and six lakes {{at the base of the}} range.

This scenario can reasonably account for the unusual behavior of the wave front over the coronal cavity. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|R

40|$|Ulysses {{observed}} a stable strong CIR from early 1992 through 1994 {{during its first}} journey into the southern hemisphere. After the rapid latitude scan in early 1995, Ulysses {{observed a}} weaker CIR from early 1996 to mid- 1997 in the northern hemisphere as it traveled back to the ecliptic at the orbit of Jupiter. These two CIRs are the observational basis of {{the investigation into the}} latitudinal structure of CIRs. The first CIR was caused by an extension of the <b>northern</b> coronal <b>hole</b> into the southern hemisphere during declining solar activity, whereas the second CIR near solar minimum activity was caused by small warps in the streamer belt. The latitudinal structure is described through the presentation of three 26 -day periods during the southern CIR. The first at ∼ 24 °S shows the full plasma interaction region including fast and slow wind streams, the compressed shocked flows with embedded stream interface and heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and the forward and reverse shocks with associated accelerated ions and electrons. The second at 40 °S exhibits only the reverse shock, accelerated particles, and the 26 -day modulation of cosmic rays. The third at 60 °S shows only the accelerated particles and modulated cosmic rays. The possible mechanisms for the access of the accelerated particles and the CIR-modulated cosmic rays to high latitudes above the plasma interaction region are presented. They include direct magnetic field connection across latitude due to stochastic field line weaving or to systematic weaving caused by solar differential rotation combined with non-radial expansion of the fast wind. Another possible mechanism is particle diffusion across the average magnetic field, which includes stochastic field line weaving. A constraint on connection to a distant portion of the CIR is energy loss in the solar wind, which is substantial for the relatively slow-moving accelerated ions. Finally, the weaker northern CIR is compared with the southern CIR. It is weak because the inclination of the streamer belt and HCS decreased as Ulysses traveled to lower latitudes so that the spacecraft remained at about the maximum latitudinal extent of the HCS...|$|R

We measure the magnetic flux, using data from the SOHO/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), in the regions that seem most likely to be related to plasma removal. Then, we compare these magnetic flux measurements to the flux in the associated magnetic cloud (MC). Here, we present our analysis of the well-studied event on 12 May 1997 that took place just after solar minimum in a simple magnetic configuration. We present a synthesis of results already published and propose that driven “interchange reconnection” between the expanding CME structure with ‘`open’' field lines of the <b>northern</b> coronal <b>hole</b> region led to the asymmetric temporal and spatial evolution of the two main dimming regions, associated with this event. As a result of this reconnection process, we find the southern-most dimming region to be the principal foot-point of the MC. The magnetic flux from this dimming region and that of the MC are found to be in close agreement within the same order of magnitude, 1021 Mx.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we derive a Differential Emission Measure (DEM) dis- tribution from a region {{dominated}} by spicules. We use spectral {{data from the}} Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) spectrometer on-board the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) covering the entire SUMER wavelength range taken off-limb in the <b>Northern</b> polar coronal <b>hole</b> to construct this DEM distribution using the CHIANTI atomic database. This distribution is then used to study the thermal properties of the emission contributing to the 171 Å channel in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). From our off-limb DEM {{we found that the}} radiance in the AIA 171 Å channel is dominated by emission from the Fe ix 171. 07 Å line and has sparingly little contribution from other lines. The product of the Fe ix 171. 07 Å line contribution function with the off-limb DEM was found to have a maximum at logTmax (K) = 5. 8 indicating that during spicule observations the emission in this line comes from plasma at transition region temperatures rather than coronal. For comparison, the same product with a quiet Sun and prominence DEM were found to have a maximum at logT max (K) = 5. 9 and logTmax (K) = 5. 7, respectively. We point out that the interpretation of data obtained from the AIA 171 Å filter should be done with foreknowledge of the thermal nature of the observed phenomenon. For example, with an off-limb DEM we find that only 3. 6...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{examples}} of explosive events observed with SUMER in transition region spectral lines are reported here; one detected in C iv 1548 ˚A, {{in a region}} within the <b>northern</b> polar coronal <b>hole,</b> {{and the other in}} O vi 1032 ˚A, in an active region. The event measured in C iv lasted ∼ 3 min and extended approximately a region of 8 arc sec along the slit (N-S) and 8 arc sec in the E-W direction. Velocities reached around 150 km s − 1 in the blue wing and 100 km s − 1 in the red wing. The active region events were more energetic and in total lasted ∼ 6 min. At the point of maximum activity, a region of 8 arc sec along the slit is covered by one explosive event located in the northern section of the observed region, while in the southern section we observe two events very closely located and extended over a maximum of 14 arc sec along the slit. More precisely, in the northern section we have at least two consecutive events occurring in a short time interval (∼ 12 min) separated by ∼ 3 arc sec. In the E-W direction the raster length covered by each of these events was approximately 4 arc sec. The explosive events seen in O vi showed a very complex structure of subsonic and supersonic velocity flows, both red-shifted and blue-shifted. The apparent maximum velocity reached in the blue wing was approximately 250 km s − 1 and 215 km s − 1 in the red wing. Key words: Sun: flares – Sun: UV radiation 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} SUMER to obtain deep {{exposures}} of the 1300 - 1400 A spectrum, {{at the extreme}} limb and off-limb. Previous "translimb" studies in the thermal infrared had revealed remarkable extensions of cold material (T approximately 3000 K) [...] traced by carbon monoxide emission lines [...] {{into the heart of}} the hot chromosphere. A main objective of our program was to search for corresponding far-UV signatures of the "thermally-bifurcated" low chromosphere; for example, radiatively fluoresced emissions of the CO A-X 4 th-positive system (collisional excitation would be negligible in cold gas). We conducted two separate observing programs with SUMER. Both made use of the 1 "-diameter circular aperture, translated across the limb in the minimum motor step increments of 0. 375 ", along the central meridian in the <b>Northern</b> polar coronal <b>hole.</b> The first program executed for nine hours beginning 19 UT 25 Oct 1996. The full wavelength range was 1340 - 1400 A. It was recorded in two overlapping segments, placing key regions of the spectrum alternately on the KBr and bare parts of the detector, to help isolate 2 nd-order features. Each segment was integrated for 500 s, and 32 pairs were obtained to span a 12 " swath centered on the optical limb. The second program was conducted 00 - 09 UT 01 Dec 1996. It consisted of a single wavelength setting (1300 - 1340 A) with exposure time 500 s, but twice the spatial coverage of the earlier series: 64 steps, for a total displacement of 24 ". The strong chromospheric resonance lines of atomic oxygen (1302 - 1305 A) and ionized carbon (1334 - 1335 A) were observed on the bare part of the MCP camera. We report our progress in cataloging the rich, diverse translimb emission spectrum; and our efforts to deduce fundamental properties of the thermally heterogeneous chromosphere...|$|R
40|$|Jadin Evgeny ALEXANDROVICH (Central Aerological Observatory, Moscow) is researching several topics {{dealing with}} ozone {{and stayed in}} Japan Meteorological Research Institute by September 1994. I {{introduce}} some of his papers. (1) Dynamics of ozone anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere In the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere "mini-ozone <b>holes</b> (below 275 D. U.) " have appeared many times. The causes of formation of mini-ozone <b>holes</b> over the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere in January 1986 and 1987 are discussed. Comparison of the calculated three-dimensional flows and total ozone content variations showed that the formation and evolution of ozone mini-holes over the North Atlantic, Europe, and Siberia are determined by variations in wave activity and {{the direction of the}} eddy transport of ozone by planetary waves. Weakness of wave activity and anomalous transport from lower latitudes may be the cause of mini-ozone holes. (2) Interannual ozone anomalies and temperature variations over the Atlantic The causes of the interannual total ozone variations in the Northern Hemisphere in wintertime are considered. The mechanism of the influence of the interannual SST variation on the ozone anomalies in wintertime is associated with interannual variations of stratospheric wave activity. It is shown that the interannual total ozone variations over Europe in wintertime correlate well with the interannual Atlantic temperature variations in the west-east direction. (3) A long-term cycle in the sea surface temperature variations, lower stratospheric temperature, and total ozone in mid-latitudes The analysis of interannual variability of upper tropospheric temperature at mid-latitudinal stations of South America in winter showed that temperature variations are correlated with the surface temperature of the Central Pacific Ocean rather than with the 11 -year solar cycle. It has also been found that interannual variations in the number of cyclones crossing the North Atlantic in winter in year with the western phase of the quasibiennial cycle agrees well with the behavior of the first orthogonal eigenfunction of the interannual variation in the temperature of the Atlantic. Higher negative correlations of the Pacific surface temperature with the variations in total ozone content at Mauna Loa (19 °N, 155 °W) in winter are found. These and other data confirm the hypothesis about the existence of a long-term cycle in the range of low-frequency variability of the temperatures of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This cycle may be responsible for long-term variations in atmospheric parameters...|$|R
