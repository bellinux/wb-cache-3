25|$|But, at {{the quantum}} phase transition, the {{localization}} lengths of the electrons becomes infinite (i.e. they delocalize) and this compromises the Fermi-liquid assumption of an inherently free electron gas (where individual electrons must be well-distinguished). The quantum Hall transition will therefore {{not be in}} the Fermi-liquid universality class, but in the F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical percolation picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.|$|E
25|$|Rational {{design of}} a protein relies on an {{in-depth}} knowledge of the protein structure, {{as well as its}} catalytic mechanism. Specific changes are then made by site-directed mutagenesis in an attempt to change the function of the protein. A drawback of this is that even when the structure and mechanism of action of the protein are well known, the change due to mutation is still difficult to predict. Therefore, an advantage of DE {{is that there is no}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> mechanism of the desired activity or how mutations would affect it.|$|E

25|$|Fisheries {{research}} {{was interrupted by}} the U.S. participation in World War II from 1941 to 1945, when manpower was short and many fishing vessels were commandeered {{for the support of}} the war effort. Sette nonetheless remained influential in U.S. West Coast fisheries management, serving as a paid consultant for the San Francisco Sardine Association and the California Sardine Products Institute from 1942 to 1947 and as Area Coordinator of Fisheries for California from 1943 to 1945. He commanded such respect in his paid consultancy that the sardine organizations followed his advice without question even when he refused to endorse their proposals for increased catches, and in his area coordinator role he succeeded in strictly controlling all fishing vessels and fish processing plants operating in California and off its coast, assigning fishing boats to plants and then shifting them around to ensure that all plants would remain in operation and no waste would occur – all despite a fiercely competitive environment in the California fishing industry. Throughout the period, he held that proper management of fisheries required an understanding of the causes of fluctuation in fish populations and in 1943 published a paper that emphasized the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> causes of mortality of fish early in their life cycle to truly understand fishery fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{readers of}} 18th-century {{literature}} now <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> {{history of the}} period more than most readers of other literature do. The authors were writing for an informed audience and only secondarily for posterity. Even the authors, who criticised writing that lived for only a day (like Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, in The Dedication to Prince Posterity of A Tale of a Tub and Dunciad, among other pieces) were criticising specific authors, who are unknown to those without historical knowledge of the period. Poetry of all forms was in constant dialogue, and each author was responding and commenting upon the others. Novels were written against other novels (like the battles between Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding, who, along with Eliza Haywood, wrote a novel satirising Richardson's Pamela, and between Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett). Plays were written {{to make fun of}} plays or to counter the success of plays (like the reaction against and for Cato and, later, Fielding's The Author's Farce). Therefore, history and literature are linked in a way rarely seen at other times. On one hand, the metropolitan and political writing can seem like coterie or salon work, but on the other hand, it was the literature of people deeply committed to sorting out a new type of government, new technologies and newly-vexatious challenges to philosophical and religious certainty.|$|E

500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have been ripped away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game {{that will make you}} rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you {{to come to terms with}} its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short you in any respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E
