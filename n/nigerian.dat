The first step towards changing this attitude, the paper argues, is to carefully identify the causes of misrule in Nigeria. One’s degree of success in articulating strategies for efficient leadership, is determined by one’s degree of success in discovering the possible causes of misrule. As a nation, the accuracy of <b>Nigerians</b> in identifying the causes of misrule in Nigeria and their sincerity in redressing misrule in Nigeria, have serious implications for the efficient leadership that <b>Nigerians</b> are in dire need of, the Paper argue...|$|R
