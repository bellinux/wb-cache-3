5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis using a residue as a <b>nucleophile.</b> The {{reactivity of}} the nucleophilic residue is increased by the functional {{groups of the}} other triad members. The <b>nucleophile</b> is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.|$|E
5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one <b>nucleophile</b> to another. This {{can be inferred}} when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such <b>nucleophile</b> switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases {{use different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a <b>nucleophile.</b> In order to activate that <b>nucleophile,</b> they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. The chemical and physical constraints on enzyme catalysis have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
50|$|The azide {{can act as}} a soft {{electrophile}} that prefers soft <b>nucleophiles</b> such as phosphines. This is {{in contrast}} to most biological <b>nucleophiles</b> which are typically hard <b>nucleophiles.</b> The reaction proceeds selectively under water-tolerant conditions to produce a stable product.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that the scope of [...] "soft" [...] <b>nucleophiles</b> can be expanded to include some pronucleophiles that have much higher pKas than ~25. Some of these [...] "soft" [...] <b>nucleophiles</b> have pKas ranging {{all the way to}} 32, and even more basic pronucleophiles (~44) have been shown to act as soft <b>nucleophiles</b> with the addition of Lewis acids that help to facilitate deprotonation.The improved pKa range of [...] "soft" [...] <b>nucleophiles</b> is critical because these <b>nucleophiles</b> are the only ones that have been explored for enantioselective reactions until very recently (although non-enantioselective reactions of [...] "hard" [...] <b>nucleophiles</b> have been known for some time). By increasing the scope of pronucleophiles that act as [...] "soft" [...] <b>nucleophiles,</b> these substrates can also be incorporated into enantioselective reactions using previously reported and well characterized methods.|$|R
50|$|Enamines {{are both}} good <b>nucleophiles</b> and good bases. Their {{behavior}} as carbon-based <b>nucleophiles</b> is explained {{with reference to}} the following resonance structures.|$|R
5|$|Within {{protease}} superfamilies {{that contain}} {{a mixture of}} nucleophiles (e.g. the PA clan), families are designated by their catalytic <b>nucleophile</b> (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the <b>nucleophile,</b> which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The <b>nucleophile</b> is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid {{is often}} used as a solvent for {{reactions}} involving carbocations, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation. For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of camphene to isobornyl acetate; here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a <b>nucleophile</b> to trap the rearranged carbocation.|$|E
50|$|Primary and {{secondary}} amides do not react favorably with carbon <b>nucleophiles.</b> Grignard reagents and organolithiums {{will act as}} bases rather than <b>nucleophiles,</b> and will simply deprotonate the amide. Tertiary amides do not experience this problem, and react with carbon <b>nucleophiles</b> to give ketones; the amide anion (NR2−) {{is a very strong}} base and thus a very poor leaving group, so nucleophilic attack only occurs once. When reacted with carbon <b>nucleophiles,</b> N,N-dimethylformamide, or DMF, can be used to introduce a formyl group.|$|R

The Hammett (log k 2 vs σX) and Brönsted [log k 2 vs pKa(X) ] plots are biphasic concave downwards for substituent X {{variations in the}} <b>nucleophiles</b> with a break point at X = H. The signs of the cross-interaction constants (ρXZ) are positive for both the strongly and weakly basic <b>nucleophiles.</b> Considerably great magnitude of ρXZ (= 6. 56) value is observed with the weakly basic <b>nucleophiles,</b> while ρXZ = 0. 91 with the strongly basic <b>nucleophiles.</b> Proposed reaction mechanism is a stepwise process with a rate-limiting leaving group expulsion from the intermediate involving a backside nucleophilic attack with the strongly basic <b>nucleophiles</b> and a frontside attack with the weakly basic <b>nucleophiles.</b> The kinetic results are {{compared with those of}} the benzylaminolysis of O,O-diphenyl Z-S-aryl phosphorothioates...|$|R
40|$|Department of ChemistrySpecific and {{efficient}} incorporation of covalent tags into a protein {{is of great}} significance in chemical biology. One common strategy involves targeting electrophilic functional groups in proteins with specific <b>nucleophiles</b> harboring fluorophores or affinity tags. We designed some novel <b>nucleophiles</b> with neighboring groups for intramolecular catalytic effects for more efficient bioconjugation under mild conditions in aqueous buffers. Our <b>nucleophiles</b> are based on hydrazine and aminooxy groups, which {{are known for their}} enhanced nucleophilicity. Chapter 1 describes our investigation on these <b>nucleophiles</b> for reactions with acyl phosphates. Phosphoaspartate (pAsp), an acyl phosphate, is a key element in two-component systems (TCSs), which are crucial in bacterial virulence, survival, and pathogenicity. Fast and specific labeling of pAsp-containing proteins will enable facile detection, isolation, and identification of these modified proteins from cell lysates, and it will lay the foundation for the further studies on TCSs, as well as the development of novel antibacterial strategies. We tested a number of <b>nucleophiles</b> on various conditions using a model acyl phosphate and the results are described herein. Chapter 2 discusses our progress on the utilization of novel alpha-nucleophiles for bioconjugation to aldehydes/ketones and thioesters. Aldehyde and ketone handles are commonly used for bioconjugation via the formation of hydrazones and oximes, but their slow kinetics with <b>nucleophiles</b> in neutral conditions hampered their widespread applications. Recently, it was found that aniline catalyst can accelerate these reactions, but very high concentration (> 100 mM) of these catalysts are required for practically useful reaction rates. To address this issue, we aimed at the development of novel <b>nucleophiles</b> for fast bioconjugation without the need of catalysts. Moreover, our <b>nucleophiles</b> can yield cyclic stable products with aldehydes. So further studies on our <b>nucleophiles</b> can lead to superior <b>nucleophiles</b> for aldehyde/ketone bioconjugation. Thioesters are another group of electrophiles utilized for protein bioconjugation. Hydrazinylation and aminoxylation of thioesters have been reported to site-specifically label proteins. However, these reactions are very slow in neutral conditions and large excess (> 100 mM) of <b>nucleophiles</b> are typically used. We tested our <b>nucleophiles</b> to thioesters, and our novel alpha-nucleophiles might turn out be a solution to this issue. clos...|$|R
5|$|Several {{evolutionarily}} independent enzyme superfamilies {{with different}} protein folds use the N-terminal residue as a <b>nucleophile.</b> This commonality of active site but difference of protein fold {{indicates that the}} active site evolved convergently in those families.|$|E
5|$|Since {{no natural}} amino acids are {{strongly}} nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad polarises and deprotonates the <b>nucleophile</b> {{to increase its}} reactivity. Additionally, it protonates the first product to aid leaving group departure.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's <b>nucleophile),</b> catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} <b>nucleophiles</b> {{have been}} reported to be effective for this reaction. Some of the most common <b>nucleophiles</b> include malonates, enolates, primary alkoxides, carboxylates, phenoxides, amines, azides, sulfonamides, imides, and sulfones.|$|R

50|$|<b>Nucleophiles</b> {{preferentially}} add to even-hapticity polyene ligands at a terminus. <b>Nucleophiles</b> add to odd-hapticity acyclic polyene ligands at {{a terminal}} position if the metal is highly electrophilic, otherwise they add at an internal site.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a <b>nucleophile</b> that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advantage}} of this method over addition of organometallic reagents to more typical acyl compounds is that it avoids the common problem of over-addition. For these latter reactions, two equivalents of the incoming group add to form an alcohol rather than a ketone or aldehyde. This occurs even if the equivalents of <b>nucleophile</b> are closely controlled.|$|E
5|$|The {{second stage}} of {{catalysis}} is {{the resolution of the}} acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's <b>nucleophile,</b> releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.|$|E
50|$|Many ethyl-containing {{compounds}} {{are generated}} by electrophilic ethylation, i.e. treatment of <b>nucleophiles</b> with sources of Et+. Triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate Et3OBF4 {{is such a}} reagent. For good <b>nucleophiles,</b> less electrophilic reagents are employed, such as ethyl halides.|$|R
25|$|Aziridines are {{reactive}} substrates in ring-opening reactions {{with many}} <b>nucleophiles</b> {{due to their}} ring strain. Alcoholysis and aminolysis are basically the reverse reactions of the cyclizations. Carbon <b>nucleophiles</b> such as organolithium reagents and organocuprates are also effective.|$|R
50|$|Reactions of organocopper {{reagents}} involve species containing copper-carbon bonds {{acting as}} <b>nucleophiles</b> {{in the presence}} of organic electrophiles. Organocopper reagents are now commonly used in organic synthesis as mild, selective <b>nucleophiles</b> for substitution and conjugate addition reactions.|$|R
5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their catalytic <b>nucleophile.</b> Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary alcohol (i.e. has a methyl group). The methyl group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the methyl clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or the histidine base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine {{in order to avoid}} such steric clashes.|$|E
5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their catalytic <b>nucleophile.</b> Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or histidine base. Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it N-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated <b>nucleophile</b> attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
50|$|Further {{functionalization}} {{can take}} place at the carbon alpha to the ferrocene by substituting the dimethylamine with various <b>nucleophiles.</b> This is usually accomplished by quaternization of the amine with methyl iodide or acetic acid, which upon heating eliminates, resulting in a stable α-ferrocenylethyl cation intermediate. Addition of <b>nucleophiles</b> results substitution that is usually completely stereoretentive. Amines, carboxylates, alcohols, thiols, and posphines are all competent <b>nucleophiles.</b> This is a common phenomenon for α-substituted ferrocenes.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a <b>nucleophile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the <b>nucleophile</b> member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a <b>nucleophile</b> to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
