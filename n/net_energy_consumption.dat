In this study, two different models were used in order to train the neural network. In one of them, population, gross generation, installed capacity and years are used in the input layer of the network (Model 1). Other energy sources are used in input layer of network (Model 2). The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> is in the output layer for two models. Data from 1975 to 2003 are used for the training. Three years (1981, 1994 and 2003) are used only as test data to confirm this method. The statistical coefficients of multiple determinations (R 2 -value) for training data are equal to 0. 99944 and 0. 99913 for Models 1 and 2, respectively.

The objective was to assess typical vehicle usage on different road types, but also to study the implication on vehicle <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> due to the drive cycle’s characteristics. For this evaluation, three reference vehicles were designed after different set performance requirements, with data on existing BEVs as a frame of reference. An available traction motor, power electronic module and battery cell were utilized, where the motor was scaled by active length. Finally, the consequence of downsizing the electric drive system in terms of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> and performance was also studied. Through comparison between legislative together with official real-world cycles and measured drive cycles, it was found that even though the measured cycles reach higher peak acceleration levels for a certain speed level, they still spend only slightly more time at higher levels of acceleration compared to the official cycles, at least on average over a group of similar cycles.
