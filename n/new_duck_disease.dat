5000|$|Riemerella anatipestifer is {{a member}} of the Flavo{{bacteria}}ceae family. It is a Gram-negative bacteria that causes septicaemia and death in young ducks and geese throughout the world. There are 21 known serotypes and infection is spread horizontally between birds. Infection may be referred to as Duck Septicaemia, Goose 'flu, Riemerellosis, <b>New</b> <b>Duck</b> <b>Disease</b> and Polyserositis.|$|E

Riemerella anatipestifer infection accounts for major economic losses to industry through death, weight loss, and condemnation. In order to control this infection, it is necessary to develop an effective vaccine. According to cam gene sequence(Crasta et al., 2002), we produced the recombinant protein Cam by use the pET System. Besides this, we cultured the Riemerella anatipestifer in an iron lacked environment, and then extracted the outer membrane protein. Furthermore, because of the recent studies showed that use the interleukin as an adjuvant can improve cell mediate immune responses. So we prepared eight types of vaccine: bacterin contained approximately 109 CFU of RA/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA and 100 μg Cam recombinant protein/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA and 0. 125 ml OMP/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA and 2 μg IL- 18 /ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA, 100 μg Cam recombinant protein, 0. 125 ml OMP, and 2 μg IL- 18 /ml; 100 μg Cam recombinant protein/ml; 0. 125 ml OMP/ml. The experiment was divided into A-I 9 groups, and each group immuned different vaccine individually. All vaccines were injected subcutaneously in the neck of day-old mule ducks. Ducklings were challenged subcutaneously in the neck at 2 weeks of age. According to challenged dose, each group divided 4 subgroups(3. 5 × 109 CFU, 3. 5 × 108 CFU, 3. 5 × 107 CFU, and 3. 5 × 106 CFU /duck), in order to determined each groups' LD 50. Mortality was recorded for a period of 14 days after challenge. And then killed surviving ducks, recorded gross lesion. The result of experiment prove that only used Cam recombinant protein or OMP(at iron lacked environment) can't provide enough protection. And add those kinds of proteins in bacterin(contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA/ml) all can get quite improvement. 第一章 緒言……………………………………………… 1 第二章 文獻探討………………………………………… 2 第一節 Riemerella anatipestifer之歷史背景…… 2 第二節 Riemerella anatipestifer 生物學特性… 2 第三節 血清學分類…………………………………… 3 第四節 Riemerella anatipestifer感染症………… 3 2 - 4. 1 自然宿主…………………………… 4 2 - 4. 2 臨床症狀與病理病變……………… 4 2 - 4. 3 感染及傳播途徑…………………… 5 第五節 Riemerella anatipestifer毒力因子之研究 5 2 - 5. 1 VapD 1 ……………………………… 5 2 - 3. 2 CAMP cohemolysin……………… 5 第六節 於缺鐵環境下細菌細胞膜之改變…………… 6 第七節 Interleukin於疫苗之應用………………… 7 第八節 Riemerella anatipestifer疫苗之發展…… 7 2 - 8. 1 全菌菌苗…………………………… 7 2 - 8. 2 Riemerella anatipestifer次單位疫苗的研究 7 第三章 材料與方法…………………………………………… 9 第一節 Riemerella anatipestifer之分離與鑑定… 9 3 - 1. 1 Riemerella anatipestifer之分離………… 9 3 - 1. 2 聚合酶連鎖反應鑑定……………… 9 3 - 1. 3 BIOLOG 96 項生化測定鑑定試驗……………… 11 第二節 各菌株之分群………………………………… 11 3 - 2. 1 高度免疫血清之製備…………………………… 11 3 - 2. 2 平板凝集試驗………………………………… 12 第三節 菌株毒力試驗………………………………… 12 第四節 Cam重組蛋白之製備………………………… 12 3 - 4. 1 重組載體之構築………………………………… 12 3 - 4. 2 第二次重組載體之構築………………………… 14 3 - 4. 3 Cam重組蛋白之表現與純化…………………… 16 第五節 RA菌外膜蛋白之製備………………………… 18 第六節 IL- 18 之製備………………………………… 18 第七節 疫苗之製備…………………………………… 19 3 - 7. 1 RA生長曲線建立立…………………………… 19 3 - 7. 2 疫苗之製作……………………………………… 19 第八節 疫苗之動物試驗……………………………… 20 第四章 結果……………………… [...] …………………………… 21 第一節 分離菌株之分群……………………………… 21 第二節 毒力試驗……………………………………… 21 第三節 Cam重組蛋白之製備………………………… 21 4 - 3. 1 Cam基因之增幅………………………………… 21 4 - 3. 2 含cam 基因之重組載體構築…………………… 21 4 - 3. 3 重組蛋白之電泳分析與確認………………… 22 第四節 IL- 18 之製備………………………………… 22 第五節 G 28 菌株生長曲線之建立…………………… 22 第六節 疫苗之動物實驗……………………………… 23 4 - 6. 1 LD 50 的計算…………………………………… 23 4 - 6. 2 對鴨隻增重之影響……………………………… 23 4 - 6. 3 疫苗對臟器保護力之比較……………………… 23 4 - 6. 4 疫苗之綜合評估………………………………… 24 第五章 討論……………………… [...] …………………………… 40 參考文獻…………………………………………………………… 4...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{establish}} an accurate, rapid, and a quantifiable method {{for the detection}} of the newly emerged duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) that recently caused a widespread infectious <b>disease</b> in <b>ducks</b> in China, we developed a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay by using E gene-specific primers and a TaqMan probe. This real-time PCR assay was 100 times more sensitive than the conventional PCR. The reproducibility and specificity of the real-time PCR assay were confirmed using plasmids containing E genes or RNAs and DNAs extracted from well-known viruses causing <b>duck</b> <b>diseases.</b> The reliability of this real-time PCR assay was confirmed in 19 of the 24 swab samples, 22 of the 24 tissue samples collected from experimentally infected ducks, as well as 15 of the 21 clinical samples collected from sick ducks since they were verified as DTMUV-positive. The results reveal that the newly established real-time PCR assay might be a useful diagnostic method for epidemiologically investigating and closely observing the newly emerged DTMUV. </p...|$|R

The avian influenza virus not only spread across the country of China, Thailand and Vietnam, but also in Indonesia, Bali is no exception. This is evidenced by the discovery of cases of death due to bird flu virus in some areas in Bali, among others: the regency of Karangasem, Badung, Tabanan, Klungkung and Jembrana.
