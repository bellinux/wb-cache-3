40|$|Green <b>roof</b> <b>installation</b> {{has been}} used as a {{sustainable}} approach for many years in order to reduce the adverse impacts of environmental issues all around the world. These environmental issues include: global warming, air pollution, flood, carbon footprint and so on. Green roofs are practical as a sustainable approach, especially in developed countries; however, there is an increasing trend of implementing green roofs in developing countries. This paper is reviewing the benefits of green <b>roof</b> <b>installation</b> and how green roof might contribute to reduce the negative environmental issues. The environmental problems that can be solved or reduced by these benefits are discussed separately in this paper. It is concluded that due to the environmental benefits of green <b>roof</b> <b>installation,</b> it leads to many economic benefits. Moreover, green roof implementation is beneficial in both urban areas and rural places...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar energy {{conversion}} is one promising technology {{to provide the}} building required energy. Generally, the main used technologies are the PV and thermal flat panels, but this situation provides separately electricity and thermal energy. Electrical and Thermal power combined production is available for the concentrating solar but, usually, this technology is applied to devices working at high concentration factor (over 100), which are large and, therefore, are <b>not</b> suitable for <b>roof</b> <b>installations.</b> At lower concentrating factors (less of 50 suns) small linear, mono-axial, roof integrated devices can be designed and built. The solar receiver {{plays a key role}} in the performance of energy generation because it houses the solar cells and itis used to recover the thermal solar power: actually, this is the device where solar energy is converted in electrical and thermal power. The radiation flux distribution on the receiver affects the efficiency of the linear solar concentrator system, because in a mono-axial sunrays are not perpendicular to the receiver. This paper describes the numerical and experimental investigation useful to evaluate the performance of a linear low (20 suns) CPV device and to understand the thermal working condition of the solar receiver. The experimental study focuses to a quantitative analysis of the energy transfer from sun to the water. The numerical activity is a CFD conjugate analysis where the solid volume and the fluids are investigated together; the scope is to individuate how the energy flux cross the device...|$|R

By a combined simulative and experimental study, we investigate the mutual interdependencies of the angle of light incidence, the absorber layer thickness and the photon harvesting efficiency within a typical organic photovoltaic device. For thin absorber layers, we find a steady decrease of the effective photocurrent towards increasing angles. For 90 - 140 nm thick absorber layers, however, we observe an effective photocurrent enhancement, exhibiting a maximum yield at angles of incidence of about 50 °. Both effects mainly originate from the angle-dependent spatial broadening of the optical interference pattern inside the solar cell and a shift of the absorption maximum away from the metal electrode...|$|R
