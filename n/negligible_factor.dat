40|$|The {{behavior}} {{of a number of}} motile flagellated bacteria toward viscosity characteristics of their fluid environments was observed. All showed an increase in velocity (micrometers per second) in more viscous solutions. Velocity reached a maximum at a characteristic value, however, and thereafter decreased with higher viscosities.

Effects of temperature, and possible utilization of chemical constituents in the viscous solutions, were studied and found to be <b>negligible</b> <b>factors</b> under the experimental conditions used. Different agents produced the same phenomenon, thus indicating that there probably were no chemically induced metabolic effects. Loss of available water and the possibility of a variable energy supply to the flagellar propulsive system were considered but are believed minimal.

40|$|A risk {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} experimental heat resistance data. This analysis is an approach for processing experimental thermo-bacteriological data in order to study the variability of D and z values of target microorganisms depending on the deviations range of environmental factors, to determine the critical factors and to specify their critical tolerance. This analysis is based on sets of sensitivity functions applied to a specific case of experimental data related to the thermoresistance of Clostridium sporogenes and Bacillus stearothermophilus spores. The effect of the following factors was analyzed: the type of target microorganism; nature of the heating substrate; pH, temperature; type of acid employed and NaCl concentration. The type of target microorganism to be inactivated, {{the nature of the}} substrate (reference or real food) and the heating temperature were identified as critical factors, determining about 90 % of the alteration of the microbiological risk. The effect of the type of acid used for the acidification of products and the concentration of NaCl can be assumed to be <b>negligible</b> <b>factors</b> for the purposes of engineering calculations. The critical non-uniformity in temperature during thermobacteriological studies was set as 0. 5 % and the critical tolerances of pH value and NaCl concentration were 5 %.

40|$|Abstract. The physics items {{presented}} in the HE 2. 2 - 2. 5 sessions include a variety of results concerning neutrino oscillations, dark matter and anti-matter, supernova neutrinos and proton decay. The OG 2. 5 - 2. 7 sessions concern detector R&D and operations in gamma and neutrino astronomy. I report here about a selection of the presented results. These indicate that Neutrino Astronomy is in a mature phase. Challenging detectors are being operated and produce results of interest. Their sensitivity is now getting {{closer and closer to}} the region of interest for various predictions. For galactic sources, if expected neutrino fluxes are derived from measured gamma fluxes, it is possible that a few years of opera-tion of cubic-km detectors are needed to produce a statistically significant discovery. The era of the cubic-km detectors is now a reality in the Antarctic ice. The Mediterranean sea and Lake Baikal are hosting smaller scale detectors and proposing future extensions to the cubic-kilometer scale. Long baseline experiments and Super-Kamiokande are measuring with increasing precision the neutrino mixing matrix elements while waiting for dedicated experiments to measure θ 13. Indirect detection of dark matter (DM) with gammas and neutrinos covers a complementary parameter space than LHC and direct detection experiments. Even if these measurements are affected by astrophysical uncertainties, they can provide a hint on the nature of the dark matter particle. Anti-matter limits on deuterons and anti-protons from PAMELA and balloon experiments, such as BESS-Polar, are of high interest and AMS- 02 will extend the sensitivity to higher energy and lower fluxes. While past conferences (such as ICRC 2003) where dominated by MeV-GeV neutrino results on atmo-spheric and solar oscillations, this conference was dominated by gamma astronomy results. The field is rich of R&D programs that are especially intriguing for what concerns photo-detectors, such is the case of Geiger-APDs.
