The nonlinear dynamics of the wave mode is modeled with a <b>complex</b> <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude,</b> and {{is characterized by the}} formation of coherent structures in phase space, caused by wave-particle interaction.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the concept of "keyholes " in MIMO {{channels}} could be responsible for a reduced transmit/receive diversity performance, and therefore a reduction of capacity with respect the maximum available radio link capacity. In the present work, we further analyse this effect in terms of coupling between an input wave impinging on the keyhole, and several output waves due to diffraction. As a consequence in terms of MIMO channels modelling within a small antenna size approximation, the channel transfer function matrix can be expressed in terms of steering matrices for the emitting and receiving arrays, and of a connecting matrix relating the <b>complex</b> <b>wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> at the two antennas. The rectangular or non diagonal character of this matrix is due to junctions in the wave paths, which leads to a keyhole when the matrix is full. This approach also allows to take into account explicitly the double directional dependence of the radio scenario[1], and lends itself easily to geometric based stochastic modelling of MIMO channels. The generalization to nonideal multiport antennas, incorporating coupling and enhanced correlations between sensors, is immediate. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It is {{well known}} from {{asymptotic}} ray theory that the <b>complex</b> <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> along a ray undergoes a phase shift every time the ray touches a caustic surface. If the slowness surface associated with the propagation of this ray is not convex, which is possi-ble for quasi-shear waves in anisotropic elastic media, the phase shift may be opposite in sign from the isotropic case. We present a simple explanation for this phenomenon based on the relation between slowness surfaces and the delay time function. We demonstrate that both the approaching and the receding wavefronts are convex toward the caustic in the anomalous case. This is exactly {{the opposite of the}} more familiar isotropic case. Since the magnitude of the phase shift is p/ 2 in both cases, neglecting the possibility of an anomalous phase shift may introduce a phase error of ±p in the calculated wavefield. Nonconvex quasi-S slowness surfaces frequently arise in naturally occurring anisotropy, and curved reflecting boundaries and other heterogeneities lead to a profusion of caustics. Therefore, encountering this problem is quite likely in practical exploration geophysics using shear-wave imaging. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{resonance of}} cylindrical acoustic standing waves {{of an ideal}} gas contained between two coaxial cylinders is theoretically investigated by the method of multiple scales. The wave motion concerned is excited by a small-amplitude harmonic oscillation of the radius of the outer cylinder, and the formulation of the problem includes the wave phenomenon in a hollow cylinder without the inner one as a limiting case. The spherical standing wave in two concentric spheres is also studied in parallel. The resonance occurs if the driving frequency falls in a narrow band around the linear resonance frequency, and in the weakly nonlinear regime, no shock wave is formed {{in contrast to the}} plane wave resonance. A cubic nonlinear equation for <b>complex</b> <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> can then be derived by the method of multiple scales. Using a first integral of the cubic nonlinear equation, we shall demonstrate that the resonant oscillation is accompanied by a periodic modulation of amplitude and phase when the dissipation effect due to viscosity and thermal conductivity is negligible. The period of the modulation varies as the minus two-thirds power of the acoustic Mach number defined at the outer cylinder or sphere and decreases with an increase in the radius ratio of the inner and outer cylinders or spheres. When the dissipation effect is small but not negligible, the modulation is slowly weakened and the resonant oscillation approaches a steady state oscillation, which corresponds to the steady solution examined in earlier works. © 2006 American Institute of Physic...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} the free {{electron}} and positron {{can be considered as}} different, independent particles, each of which is characterized by the complete set of the Dirac plane waves. This completely symmetric representation of the particles makes it necessary to choose another solution of the Dirac equation for the free particle propagator as compared to that currently used in QED. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is studied in the ladder approximation with using these free propagators. A new branch of electron-positron bound states which represent the massless composite bosons, have been found for the actual coupling equal to the fine structure constant. We have obtained that: 1) the massless boson states have the <b>normalized</b> <b>complex</b> <b>wave</b> functions; 2) the average distance between the electron and positron diverges as the boson kinetic energy goes to zero; 3) the spatial contraction of the wave function of the transverse motion of strongly coupled electron-positron pair is continuously occurred with increasing the boson kinetic energy. Unlike the usual annihilation process in which nothing remains from the electron and positron, a similar annihilation-like process in which the reaction products are two or three gamma quanta and the massless boson, is predicted. In this symmetric representation one could expect states, which have a certain symmetry relative to Ps states, but have negative masses. For these states the equal-time bound-state equation was derived neglecting the interaction retardation and interaction through the vector potential. It turned out that the wave functions of the negative mass boson states are not normalized. Beyond these assumptions, the existence of these negative mass states remains unclear. Comment: In the previous version Eq. (32) has the wrong sign. Therefore, all that related only to the negative mass bosons was a regrettable mistake. This subject requires further stud...|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} {{in which the}} electron and positron are treated as ordinary, different particles, each being characterized by the complete set of the Dirac plane waves, is examined. This completely symmetric representation that is beyond the standard QED, makes it necessary to choose another solution of the Dirac equation for the free particle propagator as compared to that used currently. The Bethe-Salpeter equation with these particle propagators is studied in the ladder approximation. A new branch of the massless composite bosons formed by the coupled electron-positron pairs with the coupling equal to the fine structure constant, has been found. It has been obtained that: 1) the massless bosons have the <b>normalized</b> <b>complex</b> <b>wave</b> functions, which are transversely compressed plane waves; 2) the transverse radius of the wave functions diverges as the boson energy goes to zero that is, the composite bosons cannot be at rest; 3) {{the extension of the}} transverse wave function in the momentum space and the compression of the coordinate wave function are continuously occurred with increasing the boson energy. The reaction e^-e^+→ Bγγ products of which are the massless composite boson and two photons, is investigated. The cross-section of this reaction is derived for the non-relativistic colliding beams of the spin-polarized electrons and positrons. In this case the 2 γ angular correlation spectrum is characterized by a narrow peak with the full-width-at-half-maximum not exceeding 0. 2 mrad. It is shown that to establish whether there is the conventional annihilation of singlet electron-positron pair with the two-photon emission or the investigated reaction, products of which are the three particles, experiments with the extremely non-relativistic colliding beams should be conducted.

40|$|As {{shown in}} [1], {{nonlinear}} plane waves may propagate without distortion along {{the surface of}} a dielectric liquid in a strong horizontal electric field. This situation occurs in ideal liquids with high permittivity. In this work, it will be shown that this unusual property can be generalized to the 3 D case. Waves of arbitrary geometry (including those without planar symmetry) may propagate without distortion in or against the direction of the electric field, and the <b>amplitude</b> of a <b>wave</b> does not influence its velocity. This implies that the 3 D equations of motion have exact solutions containing an arbitrary function of two variables that describes the initial wave profile [2]. The effect of nonlinearity on the propagation of waves along the surface of dielectric liquids in a tangential electric field (or along the surface of magnetic liquids in the magnetic field; these problems are mathematically equivalent [3, 4]) was usually studied for the spectrally narrow wave packets in the approximation of a small surface inclination angle (see, e. g., [5 – 7] and references therein).

S. inhibiting preparation raises the proximal part. 6) The quality of H <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> is represented by following formulas and values; frequency distribution, arithmetic mean, mode, median, quartile distance, relative quartile distance from the point of mode, relative quartile distance from the point of median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness and binomial probability. From these analysis it is considered that the physiological differences between the normal and the spastic or the rigid lie in disturbances of mechanism which controls the form of frequency distribution of H <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude.</b> Two different pathological representative forms of rigidity and spasticity might be derived from the difference of the disturbances. It is evident, however, that rigidity and spasticity have common faulty factors in part among them. Analysis of the frequency distribution of H <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> should be considered as a useful method in clinical neurology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We have {{observed}} sensing errors in third generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillators {{that appear to}} be caused by variation in the R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> during sinus rhythm, particularly after premature beats. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify spontaneous R wave variability during sinus rhythm and to determine whether abrupt changes in cycle length further augment R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> variability. Background, Pacemaker sensing algorithms presume a relatively constant R wave signal to establish a sensing threshold. The concept of a fixed sensing threshold is not as applicable in third-generation cardioverter-defibrillators, which depend on automatic gain amplifiers to rapidly detect ventricular fibrillation. These devices may be susceptible to undersensing during sinus rhythm if significant variability in R wave signal characteristics occurs. Methods. Twelve patients with combination bradycardia pacing cardioverter-defibrillators were studied. The device used (Cadence, Ventritex) allowed recording of real time, telemetered electrograms from the sensing lead system. Measurements were made of the maximal range of the R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> during sinus rhythm and in response to abrupt changes in heart rate produced by premature atrial and ventricular stimuli. Results. The maximal range in R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> during sinus rhythm was 1. 7 ± 1. 3 mV, or 23. 7 ± 19. 2 % of the mean R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude.</b> The R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> variability increased with abrupt changes in cycle length, with a range of 2. 8 ± 1. 5 mV, or 38. 8 ± 18. 3 % of the mean R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> (p < 0. 05 compared with sinus rhythm). In most patients, R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> and coupling interval demonstrated an inverse proportional relation. Conclusions. There is substantial variability in the R <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> during sinus rhythm measured by permanent ventricular sensing lead systems, and this variability is further augmented by abrupt changes in cycle length. This phenomenon may explain the occurrence of undersensing of sinus rhythm in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators with automatic gain sense amplifiers...|$|R
40|$|The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura {{satellite}} {{has been}} used to measure temperatures in the stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The data used here are from August 2004 to December 2010 and latitudes 75 ° N to 75 ° S. The temperature data reveal the regular presence of a westward-propagating 16 -day planetary wave with zonal wavenumber 1. The <b>wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> maximise in winter at middle to high latitudes, where monthly-mean amplitudes can be as large as ~ 8 K. Significant <b>wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> are also observed in the summer-time mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and at lower stratospheric heights of up to ~ 20 km at middle to high latitudes. <b>Wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> in the Northern Hemisphere approach values twice as large as those in the Southern Hemisphere. <b>Wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> are also closely related to mean zonal winds and are largest in regions of strongest eastward flow. There is a reduction in <b>wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> at the stratopause. No significant <b>wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> are observed near the equator or in the strongly westward background winds of the atmosphere in summer. This behaviour is interpreted as a consequence of wave/mean-flow interactions. Perturbations in <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> summer MLT are compared to those simultaneously observed in the winter stratosphere of the opposite hemisphere and found to have a correlation coefficient of + 0. 22, suggesting a small degrees of inter-hemispheric coupling. We interpret this to mean that some of the summer-time MLT wave may originate in the winter stratosphere of the opposite hemisphere and have been ducted across the equator. We do not observe a significant QBO modulation of the 16 -day <b>wave</b> <b>amplitude</b> in the polar summer-time MLT. <b>Wave</b> <b>amplitudes</b> were also observed to be suppressed during the major sudden stratospheric warming events of the Northern Hemisphere winters of 2006 and 2009. © Author(s) 2011.
