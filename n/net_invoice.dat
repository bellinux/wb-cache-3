40|$|The Competition Act in 1991 {{repealed}} all {{legally binding}} Orders in Ireland {{except for the}} 1987 Groceries Order. Article 11 of this Order categorically prohibits retail pricing in the grocery sector below the <b>net</b> <b>invoice</b> price of the wholesaler or manufacturer. The vast range of products retailed through outlets and the convenience of 2 ̆ 7 one stop 2 ̆ 7 shopping result in imperfect costumer information and consumer switching costs. This enables retailers to price below cost on Known-Value-Items (KVIs) to attract customer entry and subsequently impose higher price-cost mark-ups on other non-KVIs, a practice defined as loss leading. This practice was deemed to be essentially predatory in effect by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in 1987. In this paper we examine the potential legitimacy of below cost selling by modeling the optimal pricing of a multi-product retailer in a game-theoretic framework. We show that loss leading is an equilibrium outcome that is socially desirable in an imperfectly competitive market. We also model the repercussions of introducing the ban for equilibrium profits, corresponding services and concentration levels in the market. Our analysis suggests that a removal of the ban in favour of the 1991 Competition Act would be welfare improving...|$|E

Sales reported by a firm are usually net sales, which deduct returns, allowances, and early payment discounts from the charge on an <b>invoice.</b> <b>Net</b> income is always the amount after taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated.

40|$|Commodity {{foods are}} {{available}} to child nutrition programs (CNP) through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Distribution Program. Using USDA commodity foods creates costs for CNP due to non-value-added expenses such as storage and delivery. Programs such as <b>net</b> off <b>invoice</b> (NOI) have been implemented {{in the past five}} years to remove non-value costs. Use of these programs is voluntary by the state distribution agency, manufacturers, and distributors. The purpose of this research was to compare CNP director perceptions on cost and value of commodity foods in states that use NOI and perceptions of CNP directors in states that do not use NOI as a value pass through (VPT) method;Methods. Qualitative and quantitative research using focus group and a survey design method were used to determine CNP director use of NOI and perceptions of cost and nutrient content of commodity foods in CNP. A total of 2, 868 letters containing a website link to an Internet survey were emailed to CNP directors in 8 purposely selected states. Four states used NOI (Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas) and 4 states did not (Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Washington). States were selected based on volume of commodities used, number of CNP directors to obtain a similar sample size of those using NOI and not using non-NOI, and availability of email addresses;Results. Study results indicated 75 % of CNP directors had unused commodity foods at the end of the school year with 95 % reporting end-of-year delivery as the reason for unused commodity foods. CNP directors in NOI states reported left over entitlement dollars and commodity food inventory remaining at the end of the year less often than CNP directors in non-NOI states do. NOI was the VPT system preferred by the majority of CNP directors in NOI and non-NOI states. CNP directors in NOI and non-NOI states agreed that diverting bulk commodity foods to manufacturers for further processing reduced labor costs and allowed directors to serve commodities in forms students preferred. More CNP directors in NOI states agreed or strongly agreed nutrition was more important than cost when making food purchase decisions for CNP;Conclusions and applications. Increased use of NOI by more states, distributors, and manufacturers may reduce the non-value-added cost of using commodity foods, allow more flexibility for CNP directors to receive commodity foods through commercial distribution channels, therefore provide more options to choose commodity foods with nutrient content desired. Eliminating commodity food storage will help remove non-value-added costs in commodity distribution for CNP directors. Research is needed to quantify the amount of commodity food inventory and entitlement dollars left at the end of the school year and determine reasons for end-of-year delivery;Additional research is needed to determine how commodity distribution decisions are made at the state level. To continue improving commodity programs, increased education for CNP directors, state distribution agencies, and manufacturers on efficient commodity processing programs is needed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} emergence, evolution, and demise of below cost {{legislation}} in the grocery industry in the republic of Ireland. The paper adds {{to our understanding of}} the legislation by adopting the view that, by using the <b>net</b> <b>invoice</b> price as its definition of cost, the legislation increased two streams of quasi-rents, first on suppliers’ brandeds and second on retailers’ own brands which acted to depress competitive forces and direct supplier-buyer negotiations to off-invoice discounts. Supplier generated quasi-rents financed discounts, and when coupled with retailers’ higher margins on their own brands, provided little incentive for a return to a price competitive environment. Two factors undermined this situation: the substitution of discounters’ products for suppliers’ brands as the discounters share of the market grew and the increase in cross border shopping. These had the combined effect of reducing the available quasi-rents earned in the Irish market resulting in the breakdown of the status quo and a return to price competition. Through its impact on negotiations, the legislation also introduced inefficiencies to both retailers’ and suppliers businesses representing additional waste that could have been more productively used to reduce consumer prices. The paper endorses the Government’s decision to rescind the order and remove an important constraint on both vertical and horizontal competition. Lessons from the Republic of Ireland suggest that the competitive response to the removal of below cost legislation, and reductions in prices, may take time and will depend on economic circumstances and a change in the prevailing norms of organizational behaviour and quasi-rent seeking opportunitie...|$|E
