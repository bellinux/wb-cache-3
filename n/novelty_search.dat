5000|$|A [...] "novelty search" [...] is a {{prior art}} search {{that is often}} {{conducted}} by patent attorneys, patent agents or professional patent searchers before an inventor files a patent application. A <b>novelty</b> <b>search</b> helps an inventor {{to determine if the}} invention is novel before the inventor commits the resources necessary to obtain a patent.

Thomas Edison, for example, did not get a patent on the basic concept of the light bulb. It was already patented and therefore in the prior art. Instead, Edison got a patent on his improvements to the light bulb. These improvements included a very thin filament and a reliable technique for joining the white hot filament to the room temperature lead wires.|$|E

40|$|An ambitious {{challenge}} in artificial {{life is to}} craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of welladapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit.

40|$|Biological brains {{can adapt}} {{and learn from}} past experience. Yet neuroevolution, i. e. {{automatically}} creating artificial neural networks (ANNs) through evolutionary algorithms, has sometimes focused on static ANNs that cannot change their weights during their lifetime. A profound problem with evolving adaptive systems is that learning to learn is highly deceptive. Because it is easier at first to improve fitness without evolving the ability to learn, evolution is likely to exploit domain-dependent static (i. e. non-adaptive) heuristics. This paper analyzes this inherent deceptiveness {{in a variety of}} different dynamic, reward-based learning tasks, and proposes a way to escape the deceptive trap of static policies based on the <b>novelty</b> <b>search</b> algorithm. The main idea in <b>novelty</b> <b>search</b> is to abandon objective-based fitness and instead simply search only for novel behavior, which avoids deception entirely.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{demand-based}} theory of how platform maturity affects {{the adoption of}} platform complements. We argue that differences between early and late adopters of the platform include willingness {{to pay for the}} platform-and-complement bundle, risk preferences, preference for <b>novelty,</b> and <b>search</b> behavior. These differences create heterogeneous demand conditions for complements that affect both average complement performance and variance in the types of complements that are more or less successful. Using a novel dataset of 2, 921 sixth-generation console video games, we find that platform maturity has a negative relationship on video games’ unit sales. Furthermore, as the platform matures, we find that the sales disparity between new intellectual property (IP) games and games based on existing video game properties or media tie-ins grows to the detriment of new IP games. We find that the sales disparity between superstar games and flops also widens as the platform matures. These effects are accentuated by the introduction of a next generation platform, which further skews the complement’s customer pool as early adopters migrate away from the current generation platform. Robustness tests that control for unobserved heterogeneity help rule out alternative explanations and support our argument that these performance implications are truly driven by heterogeneity in demand...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{challenge}} for current evolutionary algorithms is to yield highly evolvable representations {{like those in}} nature. Such evolvability in natural evolution is encouraged through selection: Lineages better at molding to new niches are less susceptible to extinction. Similar selection pressure is not generally present in evolutionary algorithms; however, the first hypothesis in this paper is that <b>novelty</b> <b>search,</b> a recent evolutionary technique, also selects for evolvability because it rewards lineages able to continually radiate new behaviors. Results in experiments in a maze-navigation domain in this paper support that <b>novelty</b> <b>search</b> finds more evolvable representations than regular fitnessbased search. However, though <b>novelty</b> <b>search</b> outperforms fitnessbased search in a second biped locomotion experiment, it proves no more evolvable than fitness-based search because delicately balanced behaviors are more fragile in that domain. The second hypothesis is that such fragility can be mitigated through selfadaption, whereby genomes influence their own reproduction. Further experiments in fragile domains with <b>novelty</b> <b>search</b> and self-adaption indeed demonstrate increased evolvability, while, interestingly, adding self-adaptation to fitness-based search decreases evolvability. Thus, selecting for novelty may often facilitate evolvability when representations are not overly fragile; furthermore, achieving the potential of self-adaptation may often critically depend upon the reward scheme driving evolution.

40|$|<b>Novelty</b> <b>search</b> is a {{recently}} proposed method for evolutionary computation designed {{to avoid the}} problem of deception, in which the fitness function guides the search process away from global optima. <b>Novelty</b> <b>search</b> replaces fitness-based selection with novelty-based selection, where novelty is measured by comparing an individual's behavior {{to that of the}} current population and an archive of past novel individuals. Though there is substantial evidence that <b>novelty</b> <b>search</b> can overcome the problem of deception, the critical factors in its performance remain poorly understood. This paper helps to bridge this gap by analyzing how the behavior function, which maps each genotype to a behavior, affects performance. We propose the notion of descendant fitness probability (DFP), which describes how likely a genotype's descendants are to have a certain fitness, and formulate two hypotheses about when changes to the behavior function will improve novelty search's performance, based on the effect of those changes on behavior and DFP.

However, we know relatively little about user behavior, especially browsing and clicking behavior, for longer search session solving complex search tasks. In this paper, we characterize and compare user behavior in relatively long search sessions (10 minutes; about 5 queries) for search tasks of four different types. The tasks differ in two dimensions: (1) the user is locating facts or is pursuing intellectual understanding of a topic; (2) the user has a specific task goal or has an ill-defined and undeveloped goal. We analyze how search behavior as well as browsing and clicking patterns change during a search session in these different tasks. Our results indicate that user behavior in the four types of tasks differ in various aspects, including search activeness, browsing style, clicking strategy, and query reformulation. As a search session progresses, we note that users shift their interests to focus less on the top results but more on results ranked at lower positions in browsing. We also found that results eventually become less and less attractive for the users. The reasons vary and include downgraded search performance of query, decreased <b>novelty</b> of <b>search</b> results, and decaying persistence of users in browsing.

40|$|Many systems, {{particularly}} in biology and chemistry, involve {{the interaction of}} discrete quantities, such as individual elements or molecules. When {{the total number of}} elements in the system is low, the impact of individual reactions becomes non-negligible and modeling requires the simulation of exact sequences of reactions. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that can infer an exact stochastic reaction model based on sparse measurements of an evolving system of discrete quantities. The algorithm is based on simulating a candidate model to maximize the likelihood of the data. When the likelihood is too small to provide a search gradient, the algorithm uses the distance of the data to the model's estimated distribution. Results show that this method infers stochastic models reliably with both short time gaps between measurements of the system, and long time gaps where the system state has evolved qualitatively far between each measurement. Furthermore, the proposed metric outperforms optimizing on likelihood or distance components alone. Traits measured on the <b>search</b> <b>novelty,</b> age, and bloat suggest that this algorithm scales well to increasingly complex systems...|$|R
