5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. <b>Next</b> <b>on</b> the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E

5|$|US-60 {{would be}} realigned through {{many of the}} towns it served in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The highway was {{adjusted}} through Fairland to use Connor Avenue, a shorter, straighter route through town; this change was approved on July 11, 1949. The highway's route through Nowata was altered <b>next,</b> <b>on</b> November 13, 1950. Previously, US-60 followed Delaware Avenue to Oak Street, where it turned south, before {{turning back to the}} east on Cherokee Avenue; after the change, it turns south on Pine Street and joins Cherokee Avenue further west. On the same date, the highway was realigned through Bartlesville. The US-60 system through Ponca City was next to be reworked, on July 14, 1952. The previous US-60 and US-77 Belt Line routes and City Routes were removed in favor of a new US-60 route bypassing the city to the south on Harding Avenue and proceeding east across a new Arkansas River bridge—the present day route. Further west, US-60 and US-177 were realigned in Tonkawa on May 4, 1953, replacing an alternate US-60/US-177 that previously paralleled the main highway there.|$|E

He lost the sprint to the line and crossed the line in fourth. Cancellara's next success came in the Tour de Luxembourg, where he won the stage four individual time trial by fourteen seconds over the second-place finisher.

5|$|The most cycles hit by {{a player}} in Nippon Professional Baseball is three, {{accomplished}} by Bobby Rose. Playing for the Yokohama BayStars, Rose hit his first cycle on May 2, 1995, the <b>next</b> <b>on</b> April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 30, 1999. Other than Rose, only three other NPB players have hit multiple cycles: Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix Braves and Kosuke Fukudome with the Chunichi Dragons and the Hanshin Tigers, all with two. Fujimura is also the only player to have hit a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era. The 2003 NPB season saw the most cycles hit in a single season—five.

The next day, Shinjiro Hiyama became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days. Conversely, the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle is one day shy of 6years. The drought has lasted from Michihiro Ogasawara's cycle in 2008 until Rainel Rosario's in 2014.|$|E
