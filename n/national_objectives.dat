25|$|Issei women's {{lives were}} {{somewhat}} similar, despite differences in context, {{because they were}} structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and {{as a source of}} happiness. The Issei women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late Meiji Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to <b>national</b> <b>objectives</b> and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology. Substantive evidence of the working lives of Issei women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.|$|E
