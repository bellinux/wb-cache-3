5|$|The {{regiment}} was mobilised in August 1914 in the 1st South Western Mounted Brigade, but did {{not proceed}} to France until December 1915. In May 1916, two squadrons joined the XV Corps cavalry unit, with two further squadrons joining IX Corps Cavalry regiment. During 1916–17, duties mainly involved policing, traffic control, despatch riding and similar activities. In March 1917, the regiment played its only part in the War as horsed cavalry, during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. Over an eleven-day period, German forces retreated 20–25 miles to prepared positions. The RWY formed part of the advanced guard of the British Army, attempting {{to keep in touch}} with the German rearguards, but this was difficult owing to the broken <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> behind the original German lines. Contact was made several times with Uhlans and a lance captured in one of these engagements is still in possession of the regiment.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{building}} the Great mill {{was started by}} the millwright Humphrey of Cranbrook in 1813. Owing to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> the mill was built on {{it was necessary to}} lay deep foundations. Lack of funds meant that the mill was left as an unfinished base {{for a couple of years}} before Thomas Webb, who owned the Little Mill, bought the unfinished mill and financed its completion in 1816. A steam engine was added in 1889 as auxiliary power. The mill was worked by wind until 1905, when the sails and stage were removed. It worked by steam engine until 1918, and was demolished in 1924. The mill's brick base was left, serving as a corn store in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|After a spell in Army Reserve, 50th Division {{returned}} to the line, and the summer of 1917 was spent in vigorous trench warfare, with constant patrols, raids, and constructing or repairing defences. It then moved to join the last phase of the Third Ypres Offensive, known as the Second Battle of Passchendaele. Because of the waterlogged <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> the German defences were based on concrete pillboxes and shell-holes rather than dugouts and trenches. 149th Brigade attacked on 26 October, with 446 Field Company in support.

The division was relieved on 9 November.|$|E

25|$|Hancock's {{men began}} {{assembling}} near the Brown farm that evening, about 1200 yards {{north of the}} Mule Shoe, in a torrential rainstorm. The men and junior officers were poorly prepared for the assault, lacking basic information about the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to be covered, the obstacles to expect, or how the Confederate line was configured. Confederates could hear their preparations through the storm, but could not decide whether an attack was imminent or the Union Army was preparing to withdraw. Allegheny Johnson became suspicious and requested to Ewell that his artillery be returned. Ewell agreed, but somehow the order did not reach the artillery units until 3:30a.m. on May 12, 30 minutes before Hancock's assault was planned to start.|$|E
25|$|The {{heights in}} rear of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe, are {{somewhat}} lower than those on the opposite or Fleurus side of the valley; and, from the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> troops, particularly artillery, were more exposed on the former than on the latter, where the undulations afford better cover. The descent from either side into the villages of Wagnelée, Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and Saint-Amand, was gentle: between the latter point and Mont-Potriaux {{the sides of the}} valley descend more rapidly: and below that village they become steep, particularly about Tongrinne, Boignée, and Balâtre: while the ground above commanded alternately from side to side. Above Mont-Potriaux, the bed of the valley was soft, and occasionally swampy: below that Mont-Potriaux the ground was still softer. The buildings in the villages were generally of stone, with thatched roofs, and comprised several farm houses with courtyards, presenting great capabilities for defence. Saint-Amand and Boignée were the most salient points of the position, the central portion of which retired considerably, particularly near Mont-Potriaux.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{began on}} February 3, 1863 with the breaching of a levee on the Mississippi River, allowing water to {{flow from the}} river into a former channel that connected with the Yazoo River {{through a series of}} other waterways. The attacking fleet passed through the cut into Moon Lake, through the Yazoo Pass to the Coldwater River, and then into the Tallahatchie, which combines with the Yalobusha to form the Yazoo River, which met the Mississippi a short distance above Vicksburg. From the start, the expedition was delayed by natural obstacles that were more serious than the perfunctory Confederate resistance, so forward motion was as little as ten miles (16km) a day. Because progress was so slow, the Confederate Army under Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton was able to set up a fort and block passage of the Federal fleet near the town of Greenwood, Mississippi. The Federal fleet did not approach the fort until March 11; then, the ironclad gunboats of the fleet were repulsed in a series of gunfire exchanges on three separate days. The Army troops present could not contribute significantly to the battle because of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> much of which was under water.|$|E

25|$|According to Polybius (bold {{emphasis}} added) Just at this time, Gaius Atilius, {{the other}} Consul, had reached Pisa from Sardinia with his legions {{and was on}} his way to Rome, marching in the opposite direction to the enemy. When the Celts were near Telamon in Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated all that had recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news surprised him but at the same time made him very hopeful, as he thought he had caught the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at marching pace in so far as the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> allowed the attack in line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get the largest share of credit for the result.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, when Hawthorn {{entered the}} VFA, the council was {{required}} {{to build a new}} dressing shed to meet the standards of the VFA competition. These dressing sheds were erected in the north-west corner of the ground, where the Tuck Stand now resides, and were later moved to the Rathmines Road Reserve in Hawthorn where it still exists today. In 1922 the ground was widened by 30 yards and lengthened westward by 50 yards - taking in the previous outer reserve ground - to the dimensions that remain today. The 1922 ground improvements also resulted in Glenferrie Oval's first main stand, which was a wooden structure {{to be known as the}} Kennon-Owen Stand, and had been purchased from the East Melbourne Cricket Ground in late 1921 when that ground was closed due to expansion of the Jolimont railyards. The Kennon-Owen Stand was located where the Victorian Weightlifting Building is now situated. Glenferrie Oval is universally known for its famous art-deco Grandstand, built in 1937 and later named the Michael Tuck stand after the club great, and housed the new changerooms and administration of the club. It is now heritage protected as one of the most significant buildings of the era. The Kennon-Owen Stand was replaced by the Dr A S Ferguson Stand, a new brick stand opened in 1966 which was 185 feet long and could seat 1450, with 400 undercover. It was later to be home of the Past Players Association and the original Museum. The northern part of the Ferguson stand was demolished to make way for the Victorian Weightlifting Building. In 1963 the large scoreboard was erected at the eastern end of the ground. After the club won the 1961 premiership it was decided to buy some houses on the other side of Linda Crescent to build the Social Club which opened in 1962. The ground was relatively small by VFL standards, but the intimate <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> (with the grandstands and train line surrounding the ground) made for a terrific atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|On 15 November the {{commander}} of Desert Mounted Corps, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, issued orders for the Yeomanry Mounted Division (Major General G. de S.

On {{the same day the}} Yeomanry Mounted Division reached the Jerusalem road after a cavalry charge by the 6th Mounted Brigade (Brigadier General C. A. C. Godwin) at Abu Shusheh. This charge has been described as even more daring than that at Mughar Ridge, owing to the rocky <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> over which the horsemen attacked. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (Brigadier General W. Meldrum) secured the left flank of the EEF by occupying Jaffa on 16 November. This city was captured {{as a result of the}} victory at Ayun Kara two days earlier, which forced the Ottoman Eighth Army to withdraw over the Nahr el Auja, which enters the sea [...] north-north-east of Jaffa. The Eighth Army's withdrawal placed them to the north of the Ottoman Seventh Army and opened up that army's right flank to attack. As a result, the Seventh Army was forced to move further away from the coastal sector into the Judean Hills. Here, in front of Jerusalem, Ottoman infantry units created a defensive screen.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to present difficulty with below-grade development, {{some areas of}} southern Florida, especially Miami Beach, are beginning to engineer specifically for sea level rise and other potential effects of climate change. This includes a five-year, US$500 million project for the installation of 60 to 80 pumps, building of taller sea walls, and the physical raising or road tarmac levels, as well as possible zoning and building code changes, which could eventually lead to retrofitting of existing and historic properties. Miami Beach sees sunny day flooding of certain roads during the annual king tides, though some argue {{this has been the}} case for decades, as the parts of the western side of South Beach are at virtually [...] above normal high tide, [...] with the entire city averaging only [...] above mean sea level (AMSL). A study by the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of Miami Beach flooding incidents from 1998 to 2013 tidal flooding was increasing with time, coinciding with an increase in the rate of sea level rise locally. The fall 2015 king tides exceeded expectations in longevity and height. Some streets and sidewalks were raised about [...] over previous levels; the four initial pumps installed in 2014 are capable of pumping 4,000 US gallons per minute. Several other cities in the county already have building codes that exceed Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mandates. Traditional sea level rise and storm mitigation measures including sea walls and dykes, such as those in the Netherlands and New Orleans, may not work in South Florida due to the porous <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and limestone beneath the surface.
