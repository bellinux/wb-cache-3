Includes bibliographical references. In {{the view}} of the high {{investment}} and tooling cost of a CNC machining center, the cutting and idle times should be optimized by considering the tool consumption and the <b>non-machining</b> <b>time</b> components for an effective utilization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new module {{as a part of the}} overall computer-aided process planning system, which will improve both the system effectiveness and provide consistent process plans. In this thesis, it is proposed to build a detailed mathematical model for the operation of a CNC lathe which will include the system characterization, the cutting conditions and tool life relationship, and related constraints. Then an algorithm is presented to find tool-operation assignments, machining conditions, appropriate tool magazine organization, and an operations sequence which will result in a minimum production cost.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} generic computer aided optimization techniques for the minimization of residence time of a multi-component pallet in a horizontal machining centre. A general methodology has been established to take a part program for a multi-faced pallet, that involves many components, typically 20 - 30, and tool changes, segment it to extract the position and machining conditions embedded in it, automatically re-sequence the machining operations to find the optimum total tool path, and regenerate a new part program with the optimized machining sequence. A range of case studies has been used to: validate the software, and to demonstrate its ability to minimize the total pallet residence time. The techniques developed {{can be used for}} semi-automatic part programming of the entire pallet with multi-components, and with an auto-selection multi-tool facility. The software is capable of achieving a large reduction in part programming time, as well reducing the <b>non-machining</b> <b>time.</b> It is shown that the use of the optimization package with a range of part programs reduces the total pallet residence time by a factor between 9. 5 and 36 %, and consequently has the potential to achieve considerable economic gains...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{solve the}} non-identical {{parallel}} CNC machine scheduling problem. We have two objectives: minimizing the manufacturing cost (comprising machining, non-machining and tooling costs) and minimizing the total weighted tardiness. The tooling constraints affect the <b>non-machining</b> <b>times</b> {{as well as}} the machining conditions, such as cutting speed and feed rate, which in turn specify the machining times and tool lives. We propose a two-stage algorithm to find optimal machining conditions and to determine machine allocation, tool allocation and part scheduling decisions. The proposed algorithm generates different schedules according to the relative importance of the objectives...|$|R

Main goal is to evaluate machining cost accord-ing to change of tools feedrate speed and proposed production technology. During experimental production was monitored the tool wearing VBB of roughing and finishing mill cutter depending on machining time tA.
