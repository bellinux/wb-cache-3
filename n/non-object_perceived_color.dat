2500|$|Finally, since a beam {{of light}} can be {{composed}} of many different wavelengths, {{to determine the extent to}} which a physical color C in Hcolor stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to w), over the interval , of C(w)·s(w), of C(w)·m(w), and of C(w)·l(w). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color C (which is an element in Hcolor) a particular <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> (which is a single point in R3color). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the [...] "physical" [...] space Hcolor can all result in the same single <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> in R3color, so a <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> is not unique to one physical color.|$|R
40|$|Color subjectivists claim that, despite {{appearances}} to the contrary, {{the world}} {{external to the}} mind is colorless. However, in giving an account of color perception, subjectivists {{about the nature of}} <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> must address the nature of perceived spatial location as well. The argument here will be that subjectivists’ problems with coordinating the metaphysics of <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> and <b>perceived</b> location render <b>color</b> perception implausibly mysterious. Consequently, some version of color realism, the view that colors are (physical, dispositional, functional, sui generis, or some other) properties of physical objects, is correct...|$|R

40|$|Using {{real time}} eye tracking, gaze-contingent {{displays}} can modify their content to represent depth (e. g., through additional depth cues) or to increase rendering performance (e. g., by omitting peripheral detail). However, {{there has been}} no research to date exploring how gaze-contingent displays can be leveraged for manipulating <b>perceived</b> <b>color.</b> To address this, we conducted two experiments (color matching and sorting) that manipulated peripheral background and object colors to influence the user's color perception. Findings from our color matching experiment suggest that we can use gaze-contingent simultaneous contrast to affect color appearance and that existing color appearance models might not fully predict <b>perceived</b> <b>colors</b> with gaze-contingent presentation. Through our color sorting experiment we demonstrate how gaze-contingent adjustments can be used to enhance color discrimination. Gaze-contingent color holds the promise of expanding the <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> gamut of existing display technology and enabling people to discriminate color with greater precision.

5000|$|The {{development}} of the OSA-UCS took place during many years, from 1947-1977. Not long after the first mathematical color model {{was developed by the}} CIE, David MacAdam showed that when selecting a color on the CIE chromaticity diagram, it could not be guaranteed that colors of the same <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> difference around this color were at the same color distance with respect to the reference color. [...] More simply, the Euclidean distance between any two colors on the chromaticity diagram could not be used as a uniform measure of <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> difference. Immediately following this discovery work began to create a space that would behave uniformly in all directions of color difference.|$|R

The aims of this thesis are to develop the color density which is denoted by comb g and to propose the color density based chromaticity difference formulas. Color density is derived from the discrimination ellipse parameters and color positions in the xy, xyY and CIELAB color spaces, and the color based chromaticity difference formulas are compared with the line element formulas and CIE 2000 color difference formulas. As a result of the thesis, color density represents the <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> difference accurately, and it could be used to characterize a color by the attribute of <b>perceived</b> <b>color</b> difference from this color...|$|R
5000|$|Color {{blindness}} {{or color}} vision deficiency is the inability or decreased {{ability to see}} <b>color,</b> or <b>perceive</b> <b>color</b> differences, under normal lighting conditions. Color blindness affects many individuals in the population. There is no actual blindness, {{but there is a}} deficiency of color vision. The most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that <b>perceive</b> <b>color</b> in light and transmit that information to the optic nerve. This type of color blindness is usually a sex-linked condition. The genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome; if some of these genes are missing or damaged, color blindness will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome.|$|R
