The elastic {{fracture toughness}} of the three steels increased with increasing specimen width and thickness. The fatigue-crack-growth data for all three steels fall into relatively narrow scatter bands on plots of rate against stress-intensity range. An equation is shown to predict the upper bounds of the scatter bands reasonably well.

The method employs a new entity, the activation fluence (time-integrated specific activation rate), as the independent variables in a regression model. Temperature at which the irradiation takes place is also a variable. Although the method was tested for a specific type of damage (change in <b>nil-ductility</b> transition temperature for A 302 -B steel) it has no inherent restrictions and is limited only by the imagination of the user...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{fracture}} toughness of an ASTM A 533, Grade B steel plate was determined at several {{temperatures in the}} ductile-brittle transition region. Crack-tip loading rates ranged from approximately 10 (sup 3) to 10 (sup 5) MPa m/s. The {{fracture toughness}} was shown to decrease with increased loading rate. The dynamic fracture toughness was compared with results from previous investigations, and it was shown that the decrease in toughness due to increased loading rate at the highest test temperature was not as severe as reported in previous investigations.

40|$|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Klc {{curve is}} a {{function}} of test temperature (T) normalized to a reference <b>nil-ductility</b> temperature, RTNDT, namely, T- RTWDr. It was constructed as the lower boundary to the available Klc database. Being a lower bound to the unique but limited database, the ASME Klc curve concept does not discuss probability matters. However, a continuing evolution of fracture mechanics advances has led to employment of the Weibull distribution function to model the scatter of fracture toughness values in the transition range. The Weibull statistic /master curve approach was applied to analyze the current ASME Kfc database. It is shown that the Weibull distribution function models the scatter in Klc data from different materials very well, while the temperature dependence is described by the master curve. Probabilistic-based tolerance-bound curves are sug-gested to describe lower-bound Klc values...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nil-ductility</b> {{transition}} temperature data for A 302 -B ferritic steel {{were analyzed by}} using multiple regression. Four independent variables were used - i. e., specimen temperature during irradiation, and time-integrated specific activations (activation fluences) of fast-, intermediate-, and thermal-neutron detectors. The results of these analyses were predictive equations having the increase in {{transition temperature}} as the dependent variable. For a reference point, a similar analysis was also performed using the flux integral above 1 MeV and the irradiation temperature as independent variables. Also, the effect of excluding irradiation temperature from these analyses was studied. The results of the analyses showed that excellent correlation was achieved by using activation fluences and irradiation temperature as the independent variables. Irradiation temperature was found to account for from 29 to 46 % of the data variability depending on the model used...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{method is}} presented {{for the evaluation}} of dynamic initiation and propagation toughness using small compact type specimens. The experiment involves coupled Hopkinson pressure bars preloaded in tension. A fast release of the energy stored in the pressure bars to the two compact specimens is obtained through the failure of a brittle notched specimen. The dynamic crack initiation event is characterized by a stress intensity rate KI of 3 x 106 Mpa√m s- 1. The crack then rapidly propagates under a constant crack opening displacement rate. The design and development of the experimental apparatus is described, along with an evaluation of its effectiveness based on dynamic fracture experiments conducted on 4340 steel and A 533 B nuclear pressure vessel steel. The experiments with the A 533 B steel were performed at testing temperature of 50 and 64 °C above the <b>nil-ductility</b> transition temperature...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNuclear {{pressure}} vessel steels {{are subjected to}} irradiation embrittlement which is monitored using Charpy tests. Reference index temperatures, such as the temperature for which the mean Charpy rupture energy is equal to 56 J (T 56 J), are used as embrittlement indicators. The safety integrity evaluation is performed assuming that the shift of the <b>nil-ductility</b> reference temperature RTNDT due to irradiation {{is equal to the}} shift of T 56 J. A material model integrating a description of viscoplasticity, ductile damage and cleavage brittle fracture is used to simulate both the Charpy test and the fracture toughness test (CT geometry). The model is calibrated on the Charpy data obtained on an unirradiated A 508 Cl. 3 steel. It is then applied to irradiated materials assuming that irradiation affects solely hardening. Comparison with Charpy energy data for different amounts of irradiation shows that irradiation possibly also affects brittle fracture. The model is then applied to predict the fracture toughness shifts (ΔTKIc, 100) for different levels of irradiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is an estimation of the crack-arrest toughness, particularly of irradiated materials, from voltage versus time output of an instrumented setup during a test on a Charpy V-notch (CVN) specimen. This voltage versus time trace (which {{can be converted to}} force versus displacement) displays events during fracture of the specimen. Various stages of the fracture process can be identified on the trace, including an arrest point indicating arrest of brittle fracture. The force at arrest, F{sub a}, versus test temperature, T, relationship is examined to explore possible relationships to other experimental measures of crack-arrest toughness such as the drop-weight <b>nil-ductility</b> temperature (NDT), or crack-arrest toughness, K{sub a}. For a wide range of weld and plate materials, the temperature at which F{sub a} = 2. 45 kN correlates with NDT with a standard deviation, sigma, of about 11 K. Excluding the so-called low upper-shelf energy (USE) welds from the analysis resulted in F{sub a} = 4. 12 kN and {sigma} = 6. 6 K. The estimates of the correlation of the temperature for F{sub a} = 7. 4 kN with the temperature at 100 -MPa{radical}m level for a mean American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) type K{sub Ia} curve through crack-arrest toughness values show that prediction of conservative values of K{sub a} are possible...|$|E
40|$|The Charpy V-notch (C/sub v/) upper-shelf {{energy is}} usually defined as that {{temperature}} range {{in which the}} surface of the C/sub v/ specimen exhibits an appearance indicative of a 100 percent ductile fracture. In an attempt to avoid the need for interpretation, the selection of the C/sub v/ upper-shelf energy is based on the results from an instrumented impact test which provides a permanent record of the load-deflection history of a C/sub v/ specimen during the testing sequence. In the brittle-ductile transition temperature regime, a precipitous drop in the load trace occurs. The amount of the drop decreases at higher temperatures until it is zero, and the zero-drop-in-load temperature is identical to the onset of the C/sub v/ upper shelf. This relationship between the drop in load and energy in an instrumented impact test provides incontestable assurance that the C/sub v/ upper shelf has been obtained. This relationship between drop in load and temperature permits a prediction of the onset of the upper-shelf temperature with as few as two instrumented impact tests. It is also shown that <b>nil-ductility</b> temperature (NDT) (determined by the drop-weight test) is released to the C/sub v/ upper shelf. For the SA- 508 Class 2 and SA- 533 Grade B Class 1 steels employed in the fabrication of pressure vessels for light-water reactors, C/sub v/ testing at NDT + 180 $sup 0 $F (100 $sup 0 $C) will provide upper-shelf energy values.

40|$|Application of the Master Curve {{method and}} {{associated}} reference temperature of ASTM E 1921 {{to define the}} ductile to brittle transition in ferritic structural steels used in commercial nuclear reactor vessels requires extensive experimental verification. Recent suggestions have proposed replacing the <b>nil-ductility</b> reference temperature RTNDT of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code with a RTTo reference temperature. This reference temperature could then be used to position the median and lower bound transition toughness curves {{for the purpose of}} thermal shock evaluations or for life extension of existing US commercial nuclear power stations. In this experimental program different C(T), SE(B), and pre-cracked Charpy specimen geometries have been investigated including both deep and shallow cracked SE(B) geometries. Two or more test temperatures were used for each geometry and at least 6 identical specimens of each specimen configuration have been tested at each temperature. Specimen geometries have ranged from 5 mm thick SE(B) specimens to standard 1 T (25 mm by 50 mm) three point bend specimens and crack length to specimen width ratios for the SE(B) specimens ranged from a/W = 0. 12 to 0. 6. The material utilized was an A 533 Grade B steel obtained from the decommissioned Shoreham nuclear power plant pressure vessel. Three distinct populations of data appear to exist in the results of this program corresponding to C(T) specimens, SE(B) specimens, and shallow crack SE(B) specimens. The differences found between shallow and deep crack specimens is not surprising, but the magnitude of the differences found between the C(T) and deep crack SE(B) specimens was highly unexpected and {{does not appear to have}} been previously reported...|$|E

Design reviews continued to require considerable attention. The Inspection Engineering Dept. of the Jab. continued to act as an inspection agency for the ALC, witnessing inspections and tests during fabrication of components of the nuclear reactor system. An enviromnental analysis was made of safeguard aspects of operation of the N. S. Savannah at the NYSC site in Cannden. A study of the safety response of the reactor on the ORNL Analog Computer further defined the important role of the Doppler coefficient in controlling reactivity excursions. Health physics aspects of the operation were studied. Limited waste disposal studies indicated that sea disposal of exhausted demineralizer resins may be facilitated by casting the radioactive resins into concrete. Installation of a pressurized-water in-pile test loop in the ORR neared completion. The neutron flux distribution in the loop was determined by experimental measurements in a nuclear mockup of the in-pile section. Metallurgical activities included <b>nil-ductility</b> testing of steel from the reactor vessel, chemical analyses of primary system components, and investigations of the properties of electroless - nickel brazed joints. Limited fabrication studies were carried out on advanced fuel concepts which may have merit for future cores of the Savannah Reactor. Most of the latter effort was applied to swaged UO/sub 2 / rod-type elements. A series of physics calculations is being carried out in an attempt to evaluate the possible advantages of using Zircaloy instead of stainless steel as the structural material for Core III. Use of Zircaloy instead of stainless steel for the fuel element cans was found to result in a marked reduction in enrichnnent for a given initial cold reactivity.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to develop ductile fracture toughness data {{in the form of}} J-R curves for modified A 302 grade B plate materials typical of those used in fabricating reactor pressure vessels. A previous experimental study at Materials Engineering Associates (MEA) on one particular heat of A 302 grade B plate showed decreasing J-R curves with increased specimen thickness. This characteristic has not been observed in numerous tests made on the more recent production materials of A 533 grade B and A 508 class 2 pressure vessel steels. It was unknown if the departure from norm for the MEA material was a generic characteristic for all heats of A 302 grade B steels or just unique to that one particular plate. Seven heats of modified A 302 grade B steel and one heat of vintage A 533 grade B steel were provided to this project by the General Electric Company of San Jose, California. All plates were tested for chemical content, tensile properties, Charpy transition temperature curves, drop-weight <b>nil-ductility</b> transition (NDT) temperature, and J-R curves. Tensile tests were made in the three principal orientations and at four temperatures, ranging from room temperature to 550 {degrees}F (288 {degrees}C). Charpy V-notch transition temperature curves were obtained in longitudinal, transverse, and short transverse orientations. J-R curves were made using four specimen sizes (1 / 2 T, IT, 2 T, and 4 T). None of the seven heats of modified A 302 grade showed size effects of any consequence on the J-R curve behavior. Crack orientation effects were present, but none were severe enough to be reported as atypical. A test temperature increase from 180 to 550 {degrees}F (82 to 288 {degrees}C) produced the usual loss in J-R curve fracture toughness.

40|$|Construction of reliable, {{economically}} feasible and ice-capable vessels and structures for the Arctic {{has been a}} subject of great interest in recent years, {{in spite of the}} concerns that the undertaking clearly faces profound technical difficulties. One of the technical challenges for modern Arctic shipbuilding is to produce high-quality welds, {{due to the fact that}} a weld is usually the weakest part of any structure. Welding is especially difficult for the high strength steels (HSS), which are used in shipbuilding for weight-reduction purposes. The submerged arc welding (SAW) process is one of the most commonly applied welding processes in shipbuilding, because of its high productivity and the outstanding quality of the resultant welds. The objective of the thesis is to explore the usability, development possibilities and parameters of high deposition rate SAW processes and their modifications for welding of thick cold-resistant HSS plates typically used in Arctic shipbuilding applications. Meeting this objective required in-depth understanding of the welding and material science background, which includes the quality requirements of welded joints intended for Arctic service as described in various standards (ISO 19906; ASME 31. 3; Norsok M- 001 and Russian Maritime Register of Shipping), properties of cold-resistant HSS and description of testing methods used to validate welding joints for low temperature conditions. The thesis is based on two research methods: literature review and experimental work. The SAW process and welding requirements, cold-resistant HSS and the Arctic operating conditions and challenges from the engineering perspective are first studied. A literature review of materials and welding requirements for Arctic applications according to various standards, experimental testing of advanced SAW processes and assessment of their suitability for application to Arctic conditions, examination of the effects of the SAW process on HSS for Arctic service, and a proposed suitable range of parameters for welding HSS for Arctic conditions was carried out. Based on this analysis, it became possible to design and conduct experiments to present new experimental data that improve understanding of SAW process and its modifications to weld thick quenched and tempered (QT) and thermo-mechanically processed (TMCP) HSS plates. Experiments were conducted to develop high deposition rate SAW welding procedures of modified SAW (conventional single wire, tandem wire welding, and three-wire and four-wire arrangements) to weld several thick (12 – 35 mm) high strength (580 – 650 MPa tensile strength) cold-resistant (intended operational temperature - 40 °C ~ - 60 °C) steel grades, i. e. E 500, F 500 W, X 70 and AB 2. The welds were evaluated by a wide range of industrial tests: analyses of chemical, microstructural and mechanical properties; hardness tests; and cold resistance evaluation tests: the Charpy V-notch impact test, the <b>Nil-ductility</b> transition temperature (NDT) test, the three-point bending (Tkb) test and the Crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) test. Acceptable welding parameters and recommendations were developed, and the results of the experiments show that highquality welds can be obtained using heat input up to 3. 5 kJ/mm. This thesis provides a practical approach and clarifies the difficulties to SAW process parameter selection for welding thick HSS plates intended for Arctic shipbuilding applications. The experimental results can be directly adapted to industrial applications, and the theoretical observations can be used to gain deeper understanding of state-of-theart of SAW processes and its novel developments...|$|E
