His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a scene. He's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

50|$|We {{just try}} to obey basic rules of continuity. We try to avoid stories where a {{character}} is taking a big step like marriage and then <b>not</b> <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> it. I think by doing that, then in the future when we have big changes, the audience knows that they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be living with those changes for a while. So it's not just a thrown-away bit. It kind of endows that story beat with more power because it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> last. It's <b>not</b> just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a reset button.|$|R

5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. It {{was expected to}} be a three-day mission with four crew members, and would launch INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following problems with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be flown. It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|E

The Federation made an {{emergency}} appeal for funding from the public in order {{to cover the cost of}} transporting the Australian team to Barcelona. A variety of small donations allowed Cooper and other Australian athletes to compete. She won three gold and two silver medals, and broke two world records and three Paralympic records. She was offered a non-residential Australian Institute of Sport Athletes with a Disability swimming scholarship in 1993 and was supported until 2000.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's distant cousin, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II (grandson {{of former}} vice {{president}} Adlai Stevenson I), was considered his primary competition for the nomination, but had not committed before the convention. Richard Russell, Jr. and Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver were also interested in the nomination. Kentucky's delegation to the 1952 Democratic National Convention announced that they would support Barkley, and Truman encouraged Missouri's delegates to do so. Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.|$|E

He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E

Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. KogÄƒlniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of DincÄƒ, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Alan Eagleson, a {{longtime}} {{executive director of}} the National Hockey League Players Association, was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to mail fraud and embezzling {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} from the National Hockey League Players' Association pension funds. His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should be expelled from the Hall. Originally, the Hall of Fame was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including Bobby Orr, Ted Lindsay and Brad Park, campaigned for Eagleson's expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.|$|E

On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner {{to attack the}} northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a pincer attack. By that evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin. At his afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler was told Steiner's forces had not moved. Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be carried out. He openly declared {{for the first time}} the war was lostâ€”and blamed his generals. He announced he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.|$|E
