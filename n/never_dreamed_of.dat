500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of.</b> You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand what he means to them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|E
500|$|Maruyama's {{left wing}} {{survivors}} {{were ordered to}} retreat back to the area west of the Matanikau River while Shoji's right wing was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga perimeter. The left wing soldiers, who {{had run out of}} food several days before, began the retreat on 27 October. During the retreat, many of the Japanese wounded succumbed to their injuries and were buried along the Maruyama road. One of Maruyama's men, Lieutenant Keijiro Minegishi, noted in his diary, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> retreating over the same mountainous trail through the jungle we crossed with such enthusiasm... we haven't eaten in three days and even walking is difficult. On the up hill my body swayed around unable to walk. I must rest every two meters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harlan {{observed}} that the state can never act except through its officers, and this decision would deprive {{the state of the}} representation of its officers in court. He therefore condemned the decision as a [...] "radical change in our government system" [...] that [...] "would place the states of the Union in a condition of inferiority <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> when the Constitution was adopted or when the Eleventh Amendment was made a part of the supreme law of the land." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{for many}} other queer writers Chin {{included}} experiences from his own life and everyday in his writings. Not only things and happenings are included from the actual world Chin lived in, but [...] "attitudes, values and desires". In the book Mongrel: Essays, Diatribes + Pranks Chin is carefully describing the identity navigation in school: “The stigma of being associated with the queens who were so resoundingly ribbed and teased and tormented made me nestle in my comfy closet: I was on the swim team, I participated in sports – something the queens <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> doing”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first {{published}} by Avalon Hill in 1985 as a successor to the award-winning Squad Leader series, on which the game is based and from which the rules and components were directly developed. [...] By the time the fourth and final installment of Squad Leader debuted, there were four separate rulebooks in existence with poorly integrated and sometimes contradictory rules. For example, U.S. forces had lower morale and were disadvantaged {{by the use of}} morale ratings to determine the ability to push ordnance through snow or mud, but there is no real reason for morale to affect such an attempt. [...] It was clear that the system had grown in ways <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> in 1977; large amounts of [...] "nutmail" [...] to Avalon Hill convinced the developers of the need to streamline the rules.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1859 the {{botanist}} Asa Gray {{negotiated with}} a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, however, he learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning {{to exploit the}} absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin wrote in January, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> my Book being so successful with general readers: I believe I should have laughed {{at the idea of}} sending the sheets to America." [...] and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5 per cent royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid January, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, {{but it is not clear}} if this was the first printing alone as there were four that year.|$|E
