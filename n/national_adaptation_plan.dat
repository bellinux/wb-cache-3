30|$|In all {{the three}} sites, {{government}} interventions, {{largely in the}} form of food aid, were seen by participants as important in enhancing their ability to cope with the impacts of droughts (Table  3). Food aid by the national government consisted of distribution of a few bags of cereals (mainly millet, sorghum, and maize) to the affected households. Most of the food aid by the national government was donated by the foreign governments, particularly {{in the case of the}} severe drought of 2005 in Niger. However, food aid by the government is not always regular and is often not well targeted, largely due to dependence of the government on foreign donations and government bureaucracy in the distribution of aid. Another major problem with government assistance in coping with droughts in pastoral and agro-pastoral communities is that it is often reactive and mainly focused on relief service (Barton et al. 2001) for those made destitute by drought, which suggests absence of a long-term <b>national</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>plan</b> and financing mechanisms in coping with the impacts of climate change. According to the workshop participants, drought-related assistance from NGOs to the communities was minimal or none except for the drought of 2005 (Table  3) which attracted worldwide attention due to its severity.|$|E

40|$|The {{threat of}} climate change is {{emerging}} {{at a time of}} rapid growth for many economies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Dominant narratives comprising ambitious development plans are common and often based around sectors with strong inter-dependencies that are highly exposed to climate variability. Using document analysis and key informant interviews, this paper examines how climate change is addressed in policy, how it is being mainstreamed into water, energy and agriculture sector policies {{and the extent to which}} cross-sectoral linkages enable coordinated action. These questions are addressed through a case study of Tanzania, highlighting broader lessons for other developing countries, particularly those in SSA facing similar challenges. The paper finds that, while the agriculture and water sectors are increasingly integrating climate change into policies and plans in Tanzania, practical coordination on adaptation remains relatively superficial. Publication of the Tanzania <b>National</b> <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Plan</b> of Action (NAPA, 2007) marked a step change in the integration {{of climate change}} in sectoral policies and plans, however, it may have reinforced a sectoral approach to climate change. Examining the policies for coherence highlights overlaps and complementarities which lend themselves to a coordinated approach. Institutional constraints (particularly structures and resources) restrict opportunities for intersectoral action and thus collaboration is confined to ad hoc projects with mixed success to date. The results highlight the need for institutional frameworks that recognize and address these constraints to enable development goals to be pursued in a more sustainable and climate resilient manner...|$|E
40|$|CIAT’s {{research}} {{showed that}} coffee production is highly sensitive {{to climate change}} and that by 2050 coffee growing areas will move approximately 300 meters up the altitudinal gradient and push farmers at lower altitudes out of coffee production, increase pressure on forests and natural resources in higher altitudes and jeopardize the actors along the coffee supply chain. For cocoa the picture is not as dramatic as coffee but shifts in production areas {{are also likely to}} happen by 2050. Recognising these impacts, the Nicaraguan Government in their <b>National</b> <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Plan</b> for agriculture prioritized the adaptation of smallholder coffee farmers’ livelihoods, and market-based diversification of coffee-based income at the national level. The National Policy led the government of Nicaragua to request IFAD support in developing climate change adaptation actions within in the coffee and cocoa supply chain. IFAD has committed USD 24. 12 million to facilitate productive investments and provide technical assistance to improve productivity and increase adaptation capacities to climate change of poor smallholder producers of cacao and coffee in Nicaragua. These efforts will be complemented by the strengthening of relevant public institutions and policies oriented at providing improved climate-proofed inputs to production, improved information systems on weather events, as well as a general strengthening of the public sector to formulate incentive-based public policies for smallholder farmers. In addition to these investments, private sector investments were also leveraged based on CIAT’s research.

40|$|To guide climate {{adaptation}} {{policies and}} investments, {{the majority of}} least developed countries (LDCs) have developed <b>National</b> <b>Adaptation</b> Programmes of Action (NAPAs). Agricultural biodiversity is an important, but often overlooked, element in climate adaptation; new crop varieties, cropping and farming systems will be important under future climates. This paper analyzes {{the extent to which}} agricultural biological diversity is included as part of <b>national</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>planning</b> in the 50 NAPAs developed by LDCs as of December 2014. The paper presents an analytical framework that was used for the analysis of the NAPAs. It identifies 48 activities included in the NAPAs that do (or at least could) increase biodiversity in agricultural production systems or in research and development chains as part of strategies to adapt to climate change. These activities are clustered, first, by sectors (crops/forages, livestock, fisheries, forestry, agroforestry and natural resources) and then by biodiversity levels (genetic/intra-species, species and ecosystems). The highest concentration of activities was found in the combined crops/forages sector and at the ecosystem level. The analysis highlights that agricultural biodiversity is not incorporated within and across the NAPAs in a comprehensive manner, demonstrating {{that there is not a}} commonly adopted approach to integrating agricultural biodiversity into strategic planning. In light of these findings, one of the paper’s conclusions is that country teams developing <b>national</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>plans</b> (NAPs) in the future would benefit from the guidelines for integrating genetic diversity considerations into climate change <b>adaptation</b> <b>planning</b> being considered by the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture during its fifteenth session in January 2015.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a reality. Furthermore, {{as a result of}} human activity, the climate will {{continue}} to change for the coming decades. Climate change will have a profound impact on the way we live our lives. To keep this impact bearable, we need both to mitigate and adapt. The precise change in climate is difficult to predict, especially on a smaller geographical scale like Belgium. Belgian research in this field will continue. Nevertheless, national and international research reveals several future challenges for Belgium. The most obvious are sea level rise and inundations which will affect the coastal and lower areas and droughts and heat waves which will affect the forests {{in the southern part of}} the country. In Belgium a substantial part of the necessary adaptation to the climate change has already been initiated from the bottom up. Both on local level as on sector specific level, the sense of urgency has inspired many people to take action in fields as diverse as health, tourism, agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, ecosystems, water, coastal, marine and tidal areas, production systems and physical infrastructure. To cope with the climatic changes, they started to construct monitoring schemes, to build physical barriers and to induce changes in people’s behaviour. For these areas a quick overview of the effects of climate change and the adaptation measures already taken, have been included. It is interesting to note that the actions in these fields are not only based on the defence against threats, but also on finding new possibilities and capitalising on favourable changes. Belgium now faces the challenge to further extend the scope of adaptation in order to cover all areas influenced by climate change. This holds especially for aspects which fall between the classic policy areas. Extensive linkages between the different policy areas and their adaptation efforts could lead to synergies and could further avoid maladaptation. This will ultimately lead to a more complete and coherent adaptation policy. In order to further facilitate adaptation (from a policy point of view) a set of principles, an outline and a roadmap have been identified that describe a route to a future and comprehensive <b>national</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Antenatal care (ANC) is {{a widely}} used {{strategy}} to improve the health of pregnant women and to encourage skilled care during childbirth. In 2002, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania developed a <b>national</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>plan</b> based on the new model of the World Health Organisation (WHO). In this study we assess the time health workers currently spent on providing ANC services and {{compare it to the}} requirements anticipated for the new ANC model in order to identify the implications of Focused ANC on health care providers' workload. Methods: Health workers in four dispensaries in Mtwara Urban District, Southern Tanzania, were observed while providing routine ANC. The time used for the overall activity {{as well as for the}} different, specific components of 71 ANC service provisions was measured in detail; 28 of these were first visits and 43 revisits. Standard time requirements for the provision of focused ANC were assessed through simulated consultations based on the new guidelines. Results: The average time health workers currently spend for providing ANC service to a first visit client was found to be 15 minutes; the provision of ANC according to the focused ANC model was assessed to be 46 minutes. For a revisiting client the difference between current practise and the anticipated standard of the new model was 27 minutes (9 vs. 36 min.). The major discrepancy between the two procedures was related to counselling. On average a first visit client was counselled for 1 : 30 minutes, while counselling in revisiting clients did hardly take place at all. The simulation of focused ANC revealed that proper counselling would take about 15 minutes per visit. Conclusion: While the introduction of focused ANC has the potential to improve the health of pregnant women and to raise the number of births attended by skilled staff in Tanzania, it may need additional investment in human resources. The generally anticipated saving effect of the new model through the reduction of routine consultations may not materialise because the number of consultations is already low in Tanzania with a median of only 4 visits per pregnancy.

This paper has explore subjective qualitative evaluation of climate change risk management framework strategic and link its with poverty reduction strategy in the Sahel. Sahel {{is one of the}} most vulnerable areas in the world with lower HDI(0. 2 %) and have the highest poverty rate (over 45 % of the people live below the poverty line). The study was focused on 9 Sahel countries (Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Burkina-Faso, Nigeria, Chad, Soudan and Eritrea) and their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) and National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) by assessing criteria such as: a) the consideration of climate change scenarios and the vulnerabilities of the country; b) the analysis of poverty-climate links; and c) the climate change institutional framework of the country. However Soudan and Eritrea don’t have PRSP and Nigeria don’t have NAPA. The results show that most Sahel countries does not included Climate change 2 effect in their PRSP (except Burkina-Faso) but have a better performance with NAPA framework elaboration. Burkina-Faso is Climate risk management model country in the region but policies have failed because of farmer’s difficult conditions to get access to credit and lack of good technical supports. NAPA and PRSP objectives did not achieved because majority of poor were excluded, inefficiency in domestic accounting systems and inefficient monitoring. Furthermore, donors funding problems, natural disasters such as floods or droughts; biophysical modeling and simulation insufficient data, lack of skilled labor are others reason. To conclude, it is illustrates that mainstreaming natural hazards into PRSP and the development of NAPA are a step forward into establishment of institutional process to incorporate climate change into national policies. The World Bank and the UNFCCC should coordinate efforts to support developing countries in their efforts to incorporate adaptation to climate change in PRSP. Country need to strength the coordination, networks and information flows between ministries, at different levels of government and civil society to have more efficient integration of climate change variables into poverty reduction and development strategies. Country's should also have sustainable funding and should not rely only on donor. Policies should target more vulnerable peoples, need good policies implementation and good monitoring.

These include formulating actions, frameworks and programs to address climate change and embedding these within the long-term national development plans. This working paper provides understanding of the current state of national climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for agriculture and provides baseline information for subsequent assessments of climate change adaptation and mitigation. In each country, specific government departments such as Environmental Protection Authority (Ethiopia), Ministry of Environment, Water and Mineral Resources (Kenya), Vice President’s Office (Tanzania) and Ministry of Water and Environment (Uganda) are mandated to coordinate climate change initiatives. In all countries, the Ministry of Agriculture is the focal point for all climate change initiatives related to agriculture. Agricultural Sector Development Plans that provide strategies to boost agricultural productivity and spur economic growth have been prepared either as standalone plans or as part of National Development Plans (NDP). Irrigation, capacity building, enhancing private-public partnership for market development, and creating legal and regulatory environment that can attract investments are some of the priority areas identified for attention in agriculture to enhance climate resilience. All countries have submitted draft <b>National</b> <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Plan</b> of Actions (NAPAs) and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) to UNFCCC, indicating priority interventions. Due to ineligibility to UNFCCC funding, Kenya initiated the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) and prepared a detailed National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) that identified priority immediate, medium and long-term adaptation strategies in agriculture and other sectors. Government research institutions are equally actively involved. The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute and Uganda Ministry of Water and environment have established Climate Change Units, while the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research is taking pivotal role in developing livestock and crop programs geared towards contributing to a Climate Resilient Green Economy. Other initiatives include enhancing capacity of researchers and professionals 4 in climate change in East Africa, where training is offered by universities as part of their curriculum and short courses in selected research institutions. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives is hampered by lack of a clearly defined strategy and national policy. In addition, there is lack of documentation of completed and on-going projects thus making it difficult to coordinate initiatives and avoid duplications. To fund climate change initiatives in agriculture, all governments across the region are sourcing financing from various sources (other governments, foundations and research and development organizations). However, Kenya also seeks financing from local sources within the country such as the Local Authority Transfer Fund (LATF) and the Constituency Development Fund (CDF). the document is available on www. ccafs. cgiar. orgCGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAF...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{world is}} facing climate change, which {{impacts on the}} {{international}} community at large. Such a problem requires a global response followed by local actions {{to deal with this}} new challenge. This response is characterized by the crossing of mitigation measures, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and adaptation measures for reducing the risk and damage from current (ex post aspect) and future (ex ante aspect) harmful impacts. Among the different effects compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we could note for instance rising sea level or more frequent flash floods and marine submersion. Statistical studies have shown that natural disasters will be increasingly important in the next few years. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to draw up adaptation and risk reduction measures and all the instruments of public policy, such as normative instrument / law, have to be mobilized. These last years, France has established a real adaptation to climate change policy through the development of the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC) provided for in the Grenelle Act of 2009. Indeed, this plan is consistent with the European strategy of adaptation to climate change adopted in 2013 by the European Commission, which invites every Member State to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies. When analysing on a legal point of view these different plans or strategies adopted at national or European level, one may see there weak normative force. Even if the Grenelle Act of 2009 makes provision in Article 42 for “the preparation of a <b>National</b> <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Plan</b> for a variety of areas of activity by 2011 ”, one may say that it has no legal value. Indeed, the plan has not been adopted by the French Parliament or the Government through a regulatory act. Only a consultation was carried out in 2010 bringing together panels from the Grenelle Environment Forum (elected representatives and local authorities, the state, employers, employee unions and non-profit associations). At the European level, the Strategy of adaptation to climate change has been drawn up through a communication of the European Commission. These two plans can be both described as soft law instruments used to improve stakeholders support (Dreyfus & Patt, 2011). Even if such an intention can be laudable, it must be remembered that States are responsible for human security. This responsibility belongs to the political and legal domains. From an intern and European legal point of view, there is no explicit obligation stating that a State has to protect its population against the consequences of climate change impacts. Yet, the French disaster law is composed of the protection principle, which enjoins the State and local authorities to protect effectively their population when a natural disaster happens (Cans at al., 2014). At the European level, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) protects the right to life and imposes positive obligations on Member States to guarantee this fundamental right (Gouritin, 2009). In order to avoid any action for damages against public authorities and to constrain actors to prepare effectively to climate change consequences, the implementation of a real arsenal of hard law provisions is necessary. But how can we incorporate this variable “climate change“, characterized by its uncertainty and its permanent evolution in progress, into normative instrument which are traditionally looking for a certain degree of legal certainty?The purpose of this communication is to analyse some French legislative instruments directly or indirectly used in the field of flood risk management (flood risk prevention plan (PPRI), flood risk management plan [PGRI], local urban planning scheme [PLU], local urban planning scheme [PLU, territorial consistency plan [SCoT]) from a climate change perspective. The main issue for this topic is to what extent these different instruments can be a vehicle for adaptation to climate change. On conclusion to this study, concrete propositions will be made in order to better integrate data linked to climate change into these legal instruments...|$|E

Climate change will, among other impacts, bring increased risks to health and well-being from more frequent and intense heatwaves, as well as increased droughts threatening the security of affordable water supplies in the UK. This report: ■introduces the concept of vulnerability to climate change within the context of social justice; ■examines two early case studies of adaptation in the south-west of England: the implementation of the national Heatwave Plan; and the trend towards differential water pricing based on usage (including the trial of a rising block tariff for water); and ■highlights the need for a more systematic consideration of current and future vulnerabilities in local, sectoral and <b>national</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

Such challenges include the legal and normative framework applicable to environmentally induced displacement and migration. There remains a lack of clarity {{on issues such as}} the legal status of people fleeing environmental disasters, the need for better data collection and monitoring, and the consideration of migration as a de facto <b>adaptation</b> strategy in <b>national</b> climate change strategies, for example in <b>National</b> <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Plans</b> of Action (NAPAs). The GMG works together to prepare inputs on these challenges for events such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which will be held this year in Durban, South Africa from 28 November to 9 December (17th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).|$|R
