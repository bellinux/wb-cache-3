5|$|After the battle, Steuart {{was sent}} as a {{prisoner}} of war to Charleston, South Carolina, and was later imprisoned at Hilton Head, where he and other officers were placed under the fire of Confederate artillery. The fighting at Spotsylvania was to prove the end of his brigade. Johnson's division, 6,800 strong {{at the start of the}} battle, was <b>now</b> <b>so</b> severely reduced in size that barely one brigade could be formed. On May 14 the brigades of Walker, Jones, and Steuart were consolidated into one small brigade under the command of Colonel Terry of the 4th Virginia Infantry.|$|E

Some more dance-y things I did about 10 years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. They're all pretty much ready to go.|$|E

These markets were for buying and selling; there was no question of distributing emergency aid.|$|E
5|$|There {{were still}} fine mediaeval screens {{in the church}} in 1810, {{possibly}} lost when repairs were done in 1813–16; they were gone by 1862. According to the History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan (1810) by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick: The chancel and north transept are separated {{from the rest of}} the church by light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they display, were probably erected about the time of Henry the Seventh. They are coloured red, green and yellow, and though once very brilliant, are <b>now</b> <b>so</b> covered with dirt as to be scarce perceptible.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is <b>now</b> <b>so</b> widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E
5|$|Film noir {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into {{a life of crime}} (Gun Crazy), or simply a victim of circumstance (D.O.A.). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, films <b>now</b> <b>so</b> described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; {{the alternative}} name Capra was {{more commonly used}} in classical times. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table {{of the first two}} batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star. It is <b>now</b> <b>so</b> entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star with the designations α Aurigae, HR 1708, HD 34029, and HIP 24608, which suggests only the primary component of the Capella system should receive that name. The IAU's own documentation makes it explicit that the proper name should strictly only be applied to the visually brightest component. In this case it is somewhat uncertain which of the components is the brightest and the IAU list does not specify.|$|E

5|$|The {{two months}} {{following}} the verdict were ones of great activity {{between the two parties}} and the citizens of Paris. As judicial duels were <b>now</b> <b>so</b> rare, no established battleground had been set aside, and a jousting arena at the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs north of the city agreed to host the combat. Both Carrouges and Le Gris endured bouts of illness in the weeks following the verdict but recovered with the aid of their families and supporters, who had joined the hundreds of people flocking to the city from nearby regions to witness the fight. Indeed, the event was so popular that when King Charles VI believed that his return to Paris in time for the combat would be held up in Flanders due to bad roads, he sent a fast messenger to Paris delaying the duel by a month in order that he would be present to witness it. This Royal intervention set the date for the combat back to 29 December 1386.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons for}} revelation were both {{political}} and practical.

The key decision to proceed had been taken in 1975, four years previously, and cancellation {{would be unlikely to}} save money at that point. Even if it were to be cancelled, a replacement would have to be ordered in any case. Shortly afterwards the Thatcher government decided that the successor system should be the Trident system and ordered the C4 variant.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in the 1940s, the Inuit {{were given}} disc numbers, {{recorded}} {{on a special}} leather ID tag, like a dog tag. They were required to keep the tag with them always.

The numbers were assigned with a letter prefix that indicated location (E = east), community, and then {{the order in which}} the census-taker saw the individual. In some ways this state renaming was abetted by the churches and missionaries, who viewed the traditional names and their calls to power as related to shamanism and paganism.|$|E
25|$|In modern cricket, the {{two lines}} usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the {{so-called}} corridor of uncertainty, the area just outside the batsman's off stump, or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as off theory (contrast leg theory), but it is <b>now</b> <b>so</b> routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.|$|E
25|$|By 1982, most pornographic {{films were}} being {{shot on the}} cheaper and more {{convenient}} medium of videotape. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because of the different image quality that video tape produced; however, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realised that continuing to shoot on film {{was no longer a}} profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This {{was the end of the}} age of big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since filming was <b>now</b> <b>so</b> inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands now were, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.|$|E
