40|$|Purpose:Continuous EEG {{screening}} using spectrograms or compressed spectral arrays (CSAs) by <b>neurophysiologists</b> has shorter review {{times with}} minimal loss of sensitivity for seizure detection {{when compared with}} visual analysis of raw EEG. Limited data {{are available on the}} performance characteristics of CSA-based seizure detection by neurocritical care nurses. Methods:This is a prospective cross-sectional study that was conducted in two academic neurocritical care units and involved 33 neurointensive care unit nurses and four <b>neurophysiologists.</b> Results:All nurses underwent a brief training session before testing. Forty two-hour CSA segments of continuous EEG were reviewed and rated for the presence of seizures. Two experienced clinical <b>neurophysiologists</b> masked to the CSA data performed conventional visual analysis of the raw EEG and served as the gold standard. The overall accuracy was 55. 7 % among nurses and 67. 5 % among <b>neurophysiologists.</b> Nurse seizure detection sensitivity was 73. 8 %, and the false-positive rate was 1 -per- 3. 2 hours. Sensitivity and false-alarm rate for the <b>neurophysiologists</b> was 66. 3 % and 1 -per- 6. 4 hours, respectively. Interrater agreement for seizure screening was fair for nurses (Gwet AC 1 statistic: 43. 4 %) and <b>neurophysiologists</b> (AC 1 : 46. 3 %). Conclusions:Training nurses to perform seizure screening utilizing continuous EEG CSA displays is feasible and associated with moderate sensitivity. Nurses and <b>neurophysiologists</b> had comparable sensitivities, but nurses had a higher false-positive rate. Further work is needed to improve sensitivity and reduce false-alarm rates.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD on July 22, 2003. The DVD includes bonus features including an audio commentary, six deleted scenes, three documentaries, two music videos, three trailers, interactive menus and subtitles. The audio commentary presents Ellis, Perry, Bress, and Gruber providing information about {{the making of the}} film and their intentions overall. Deleted scenes are a cross-examination with Isabella's husband Marcus Hudson (Roger Cross), a conversation between Eugene and Nora, a car chase concerning Kimberly's reckless driving, and Eugene's meeting with Death at the hospital, and extended versions of Kimberly's interrogation at the police station and the encounter with Bludworth. The first documentary labelled Bits & Pieces: Bringing Life To Death runs for 30 minutes and recalls the history of splatter film, on top of accounts in relation to the visual effects of the film. The second documentary entitled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back progresses for 18 minutes and brings out people recounting their own real-life experiences with death. The Terror Gauge, the third documentary, is a test screening system of the film in which viewers are subjected to biofeedback and neurological examination under <b>neurophysiologist</b> Dr. Victoria Ibric. Other featurettes of the DVD include the interactive game Choose Your Fate, the music videos of Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory and Seven Days a Week by The Sounds, the theatrical trailers of this film and its antecedent, in addition to informative trivias provided throughout the featurettes.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Quantitative EEG (QEEG) {{can be used}} {{to assist}} with review of large amounts of data {{generated}} by critical care continuous EEG monitoring. This study aimed to identify current practices regarding the use of QEEG in critical care continuous EEG monitoring of critical care patients. METHODS: An online survey was sent to 796 members of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS), instructing only <b>neurophysiologists</b> to participate. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 75 <b>neurophysiologists</b> that use QEEG in their practice. Survey respondents reported that <b>neurophysiologists</b> and neurophysiology fellows are most likely to serve as QEEG readers (97 % and 52 %, respectively). However, 21 % of respondents reported nonneurophysiologists are also involved with QEEG interpretation. The majority of nonneurophysiologist QEEG data review is aimed to alert <b>neurophysiologists</b> to periods of concern, but 22 % reported that nonneurophysiologists use QEEG to directly guide clinical care. Quantitative EEG was used most frequently for seizure detection (92 %) and burst suppression monitoring (59 %). A smaller number of respondents use QEEG for monitoring the depth of sedation (29 %), ischemia detection (28 %), vasospasm detection (28 %) and prognosis after cardiac arrest (21 %). About half of the respondents do not review every page of the raw critical care continuous EEG record when using QEEG. Respondents prefer a panel of QEEG trends displayed as hemispheric data, when applicable. There is substantial variability regarding QEEG trend preferences for seizure detection and ischemia detection. CONCLUSIONS: QEEG is being used by <b>neurophysiologists</b> and nonneurophysiologists for applications beyond seizure detection, but practice patterns vary widely. There is a need for standardization of QEEG methods and practices...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the {{sensitivity and specificity}} of a panel of quantitative EEG (qEEG) trends for seizure detection in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients when reviewed by <b>neurophysiologists</b> and non-neurophysiologists. METHODS: One hour qEEG panels (n = 180) were collected retrospectively from 45 ICU patients and were distributed to 5 <b>neurophysiologists,</b> 7 EEG technologists, and 5 Neuroscience ICU nurses for evaluation of seizures. Each panel consisted of the following qEEG tools, displayed separately for left and right hemisphere electrodes: rhythmicity spectrogram (rhythmic run detection and display; Persyst Inc), color density spectral array, EEG asymmetry index, and amplitude integrated EEG. The reviewers did {{not have access to}} the raw EEG data. RESULTS: For the reviewer's ability to detect the presence of seizures on qEEG panels when compared with the gold standard of independent raw EEG review, the sensitivities and specificities are as follows: <b>neurophysiologists</b> 0. 87 and 0. 61, EEG technologists 0. 80 and 0. 80, and Neuroscience ICU nurses 0. 87 and 0. 61, respectively. There was no statistical difference among the three groups regarding sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative EEG display panels are a promising tool to aid detection of seizures by non-neurophysiologists as well as by <b>neurophysiologists.</b> However, even when used as a panel, qEEG trends {{do not appear to be}} adequate as the sole method for reviewing continuous EEG data...|$|R

30|$|Epileptic seizure is a physiopathological {{disease that}} {{is known as a}} {{neurological}} disorder caused by the transient and unexpected electrical disturbance of the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG), which is a common method for detection of the epileptic seizure, constructs a representative signal containing information about the brain’s electrical activity. Interpretation of EEG signals for manual detection of the epileptic seizure is not an easy task and requires high skills of <b>neurophysiologists.</b> Moreover, manual interpretation of the long recordings is tedious and time consuming. Therefore, an automated system to help <b>neurophysiologists</b> in detecting epileptic seizures is in great demand. Such an automated system is composed of two main parts [1 – 4]: EEG feature extraction and classification. While EEG feature extraction enables to characterize EEG signals, classification finds different categories in the input EEG signals.|$|R

2500|$|Sir Charles Scott Sherrington [...] (27 November 1857 – 4 March 1952) was an English <b>neurophysiologist,</b> histologist, bacteriologist, and a pathologist, Nobel laureate and {{president}} of the Royal Society in the early 1920s. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian, in 1932 for their work on the functions of neurons. Prior to the work of Sherrington and Adrian, it was widely accepted that reflexes occurred as isolated activity within a reflex arc. Sherrington received the prize for showing that reflexes require integrated activation and demonstrated reciprocal innervation of muscles (Sherrington's law). Through his seminal 1906 publication, The Integrative Action of the Nervous System, he had effectively laid to rest the theory that the nervous system, including the brain, can be understood as a single interlinking network. His alternative explanation of synaptic communication between neurons helped shape our understanding of the central nervous system.|$|E
