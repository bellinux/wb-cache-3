50|$|A {{common type}} of short circuit occurs when the {{positive}} and <b>negative</b> <b>terminals</b> of a battery are connected with a low-resistance conductor, like a wire. With a low resistance in the connection, a high current will flow, causing the delivery of {{a large amount of}} energy {{in a short period of}} time.|$|R
25|$|A railgun {{consists}} of two parallel metal rails (hence the name) connected to an electrical power supply. When a conductive projectile is inserted between the rails (at the end connected to the power supply), it completes the circuit. Electrons flow from the <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> of the power supply up the negative rail, across the projectile, and down the positive rail, back to the power supply.|$|E
25|$|The simple {{half-wave}} rectifier {{can be built}} in two electrical configurations with the diodes pointing in opposite directions, one version connects the <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> of the output direct to the AC supply and the other connects the positive terminal of the output direct to the AC supply. By combining both of these with separate output smoothing {{it is possible to}} get an output voltage of nearly double the peak AC input voltage. This also provides a tap in the middle, which allows use of such a circuit as a split rail power supply.|$|E
500|$|The codes were {{refined and}} adapted {{as they were}} used. [...] By 1867 numerals had {{been added to the}} five-needle code. [...] This was {{achieved}} through the provision of a sixth wire for common return making it possible to move just a single needle. [...] With the original five wires it was only possible to move the needles in pairs and always in opposite directions since there was no common wire provided. [...] Many more codes are theoretically possible with common return signalling, but not all of them can conveniently be used with a grid indication display. [...] The numerals were worked in by marking them {{around the edge of the}} diamond grid. [...] Needles 1 through 5 when energised to the right pointed to numerals 1 through 5 respectively, and to the left numerals 6 through 9 and 0 respectively. [...] Two additional buttons were provided on the telegraph sets to enable the common return to be connected to either the positive or <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> of the battery according to the direction it was desired to move the needle.|$|E

2500|$|This {{concept is}} called grid bias. Many early radio sets had a third battery called the [...] "C battery" [...] (unrelated to the present-day C cell, {{for which the}} letter denotes its size and shape). The C cell's {{positive}} terminal {{was connected to the}} cathode of the tubes (or [...] "ground" [...] in most circuits) and whose <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> supplied this bias voltage to the grids of the tubes.|$|E
25|$|All {{tantalum}} capacitors are polarized components, with distinctly marked {{positive or}} <b>negative</b> <b>terminals.</b> When subjected to reversed polarity (even briefly), the capacitor depolarizes and the dielectric oxide layer breaks down, {{which can cause}} it to fail even when later operated with correct polarity. If the failure is a short circuit (the most common occurrence), and current {{is not limited to}} a safe value, catastrophic thermal runaway may occur.|$|R

2500|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized {{electrolytic capacitors}} whose anode electrode (+) {{is made of}} a pure aluminum foil with an etched surface. The aluminum forms a very thin insulating layer of [...] aluminium oxide by anodization that acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A non-solid electrolyte covers the rough surface of the oxide layer, serving in principle as the second electrode (cathode) (-) of the capacitor. A second aluminum foil called “cathode foil” contacts the electrolyte and serves as the electrical connection to the <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> of the capacitor.|$|E
2500|$|Inside {{a source}} of emf that is open-circuited, the {{conservative}} electrostatic field created by separation of charge exactly cancels the forces producing the emf. Thus, [...] the emf has the same value but opposite sign as the integral of the electric field aligned with an internal path between two terminals A and B of {{a source of}} emf in open-circuit condition (the path is taken from the <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> to the positive terminal to yield a positive emf, indicating work done on the electrons moving in the circuit).|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} battery is a device consisting {{of one or}} more electrochemical cells with external connections provided to power electrical devices [...] such as flashlights, smartphones, and electric cars. When a battery is supplying electric power, its positive terminal is the cathode and its <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> is the anode. The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device. When a battery is connected to an external circuit, electrolytes are able to move as ions within, allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the external circuit. It is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work. Historically the term [...] "battery" [...] specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells, however the usage has evolved additionally to include devices composed of a single cell.|$|E
50|$|The Hofmann {{voltameter}} {{is often}} used as a small-scale electrolytic cell. It consists of three joined upright cylinders. The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow the addition of water and the electrolyte. A platinum electrode is placed {{at the bottom of}} each of the two side cylinders, connected to the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>terminals</b> of a source of electricity. When current is run through the Hofmann voltameter, gaseous oxygen forms at the anode (positive) and gaseous hydrogen at the cathode (negative). Each gas displaces water and collects {{at the top of the}} two outer tubes, where it can be drawn off with a stopcock.|$|R
50|$|Most {{battery voltage}} testers and {{chargers}} {{that can also}} test 9V need another snap clip to hold the battery, while cylindrical batteries often share a holder that may be adjustable in size. Because of {{the proximity of the}} positive and <b>negative</b> <b>terminals</b> {{at the top of the}} battery and relatively low current of most common batteries, one informal method of testing voltage is to place the two terminals across a tongue. A strong tingle would indicate a battery with a strong charge, the absence, a discharged battery. While there have been stories circulating of unfortunate outcomes, the process is rarely dangerous under normal circumstances, though it may be unpleasant.|$|R
50|$|Ground noise {{appears at}} the {{negative}} input of an amplifier for several reasons, including ground loop. Other causes can deliver a different input signal to the amplifier's <b>negative</b> input <b>terminal</b> and not also simultaneously to the amplifier's positive input terminal.|$|R

The {{first is the}} positive terminal {{and the second is}} the <b>negative</b> <b>terminal.</b> The positive terminal looks like a metal cap and the <b>negative</b> <b>terminal</b> looks like a metal disc. The current flows from the positive terminal, and out through the <b>negative</b> <b>terminal,</b> replicative of current flow (positive (+) to negative (-) flow).|$|E

50|$|A Hofmann {{voltameter}} is {{an apparatus}} for electrolyzing water, invented by August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892) in 1866. It {{consists of three}} joined upright cylinders, usually glass. The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow addition of water and an ionic compound to improve conductivity, such as {{a small amount of}} sulphuric acid. A platinum electrode is placed inside the bottom of each of the two side cylinders, connected to the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>terminals</b> of a source of electricity. When current is run through Hofmann's voltameter, gaseous oxygen forms at the anode and gaseous hydrogen at the cathode. Each gas displaces water and collects {{at the top of the}} two outer tubes.|$|R
50|$|The first {{starting}} and charging systems {{were designed to}} be 6-volt and positive-ground systems, with the vehicle's chassis directly connected to the positive battery terminal.

40|$|BEEST Project: Applied Materials is {{developing}} new tools for manufacturing Li-Ion batteries that could dramatically increase their performance. Traditionally, {{the positive and}} <b>negative</b> <b>terminals</b> of Li-Ion batteries are mixed with glue-like materials called binders, pressed onto electrodes, and then physically kept apart by winding a polymer mesh material between them called a separator. With the Applied Materials system, many of these manually intensive processes {{will be replaced by}} next generation coating technology to apply each component. This process will improve product reliability and performance of the cells {{at a fraction of the}} current cost. These novel manufacturing techniques will also increase the energy density of the battery and reduce the size of several of the battery’s components to free up more space within the cell for storage...|$|R
