All materials were fire-retardant, and <b>non-skid</b> Pirelli flooring was fitted at the entrances and service areas; in blue {{to match the}} carpets in the first class areas, and in maroon for the second class areas. Following customer feedback, the seating arrangements in the economy cars were reorganised to place the centres of back-to-back seats in line with pillars between windows.|$|E
25|$|After the war Glanville {{remained}} with the RRL {{and concentrated on}} research into roads. The organisation soon adopted a radical new form of study, implementing experiments on live highways. This method resulted in improvements to surfacing materials, road marking paint, and <b>non-skid</b> treatments. The laboratory was significantly enlarged in 1946 and took on a wider remit to investigate road safety and traffic management. Research in this area lead to better tyre materials, zebra crossings, speed limits, and laws regarding the wearing of safety helmets and seat belts. The RRL also investigated headlight dazzle and braking distances.|$|E

5000|$|The {{team was}} founded by Firestone as an amateur {{industrial}} team. Like other industrial teams of the era, the players were company employees with year-round jobs who were not paid for basketball but owed their jobs to their basketball skills. The <b>Non-Skids</b> first competed professionally in the 1932-33 National Basketball League and defeated the Indianapolis Kautskys in the championship game. In 1935, the <b>Non-Skids</b> joined the Midwest Basketball Conference. In 1937, Firestone, General Electric, and Goodyear created the National Basketball League from company-sponsored teams and independent teams. [...] The <b>Non-Skids</b> were NBL champions in 1939 and 1940, defeating the Oshkosh All-Stars both years in the Finals. Following the 1940-1941 season, the Akron Firestone <b>Non-Skids</b> disbanded, leaving the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots as the only NBL team representing Akron.|$|R

2500|$|Strategic Expeditionary Landing Field (SELF) is a {{military}} airfield with an aluminum matted surface that is designed for sustained operations in an amphibious objective area. The runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas are constructed entirely of AM-2 aluminum matting. The AM-2 surface matting is a fabricated aluminum panel 1.5" [...] thick, which consists of a hollow, extruded, one-piece main section with extruded end connectors welded to each end. The top surface of the AM-2 matting is coated with a <b>non-skid</b> material.|$|E

Positive flotation is provided by large blocks of foam contained inside the cockpit seats and in the bow. A <b>non-skid</b> pattern is molded into deck and cockpit surfaces. There are two fixed lights in the cabin top for visibility and interior illumination. The deck is reinforced with plywood that is sandwiched into the laminate. All hardware is either bolted through or tapped into metal which is bonded into the laminate.|$|E
2500|$|Jet blast {{deflectors}} aboard {{aircraft carriers}} {{are placed in}} very {{close proximity to the}} [...] temperatures of modern jet fighter exhaust. The <b>non-skid</b> decking surface of the deflector suffers heat damage and requires frequent maintenance or replacement. Additionally, the hot deflector surface cannot be used as normal decking until it has cooled enough to allow aircraft tires to roll over it. To mitigate the heat problem, active cooling systems were installed in the 1970s, tapping the fire mains (fire suppression water systems) to use seawater circulating through water lines within the deflector panel. However, the water cooling system adds more complexity and failure points, and requires additional maintenance. The most recent method tried by the United States Navy for solving the heat problem was introduced in 2008 with USS George H.W. Bush which uses heavy-duty metal panels covered in heat-dissipating ceramic tiles similar to those used on the Space Shuttle. The tiled panels can be changed quickly and easily—the ship carries a large replacement supply. Without active water lines, the passively-tiled deflector is expected to require much less maintenance.|$|E

Sable was converted at the Erie Plant of American Shipbuilding Company at Buffalo, New York. The cabins and superstructure of the ship were removed leaving the main deck. Along with additional supports, a steel flight deck was installed instead of the originally planned Douglas-fir wooden deck similar to what was installed on [...] The steel deck also allowed Sable to be used for the testing a variety of <b>non-skid</b> coatings applied to the flight deck. The deck of Sable was equipped with eight sets of arresting cables as well. A [...] bridge island or superstructure was constructed on the starboard side of the ship along with outriggers forward of the island for storing damaged aircraft. On the main deck a lecture room, along with projection equipment, was constructed that could accommodate more than forty aviators with bunks for twenty one aviators. She was also equipped with a sick bay, operating room, laundry, tailor shop, crew quarters, a cafeteria style galley for the crew, a mess hall for the officers, storerooms and a refrigerator. Sable lacked a hangar deck, elevators or armament, as her role was for the training of pilots for carrier take-offs and landings. A number of crew members assigned to the Sable prior to her commissioning were survivors of the USS Lexington which had been lost earlier during the Battle of the Coral Sea. Sable was commissioned on 8 May 1943 with Captain Warren K. Berner in command.|$|E
