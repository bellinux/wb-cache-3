Characterization of a variant encoded by the mutant allele nfp- 2 revealed the sensitivity of this protein to the endoplasmic reticulum quality control mechanisms, affecting its trafficking to the plasma membrane. Further analysis revealed that the extensive N-glycosylation of the protein is not essential for biological activity. In the NFP extracellular region, two CXC motifs and two other Cys residues were found to be involved in disulphide bridges and these are necessary for correct folding and localization of the protein. Analysis of the intracellular region revealed its importance for biological activity but suggests that it does not rely on kinase activity.

40|$|Sinorhizobium meliloti {{contains}} phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) {{as major}} membrane lipids. PE is formed in two steps. In the first step, phosphatidylserine synthase (Pss) condenses serine with CDP-diglyceride to form phosphatidylserine (PS), {{and in the}} second step, PS is decarboxylated by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd) to form PE. In this study we identified the sinorhizobial psd gene coding for Psd. A sinorhizobial mutant deficient in psd is unable to form PE but accumulates the anionic phospholipid PS. Properties of PE-deficient mutants lacking either Pss or Psd were compared with those of the S. meliloti wild type. Whereas both PE-deficient mutants grew in a wild-type-like manner on many complex media, they were unable to grow on minimal medium containing high phosphate concentrations. Surprisingly, the psd-deficient mutant could grow on minimal medium containing low concentrations of inorganic phosphate, while the pss-deficient mutant could not. Addition of choline to the minimal medium rescued growth of the pss-deficient mutant, CS 111, to some extent but inhibited growth of the psd-deficient mutant, MAV 01. When the two distinct PE-deficient mutants were analyzed for their ability to form a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> root nodule <b>symbiosis</b> with their alfalfa host plant, they behaved strikingly differently. The Pss-deficient mutant, CS 111, initiated nodule formation {{at about the same time}} point as the wild type but did form about 30 % fewer nodules than the wild type. In contrast, the PS-accumulating mutant, MAV 01, initiated nodule formation much later than the wild type and formed 90 % fewer nodules than the wild type. The few nodules formed by MAV 01 seemed to be almost devoid of bacteria and were unable to fix nitrogen. Leaves of alfalfa plants inoculated with the mutant MAV 01 were yellowish, indicating that the plants were starved for nitrogen.

40|$|Establishment of the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> {{nodulation}} <b>symbiosis</b> between legumes and rhizobia requires plant-wide reprogramming {{to allow}} infection {{and development of}} nodules. Nodulation is regulated principally via a mechanism called autoregulation of nodulation (AON). AON is dependent on shoot and root factors and is maintained by the nodulation autoregulation receptor kinase (NARK) in soybean. We developed a bioassay to detect root-derived signalling molecules in xylem sap of soybean plants which may function in AON. The bioassay involves feeding of xylem extracts via the cut hypocotyl of soybean seedlings and monitoring of molecular markers of AON in the leaf. Transcript abundance changes occurring in the leaf in response to feeding {{were used to determine}} the biological activity of the extracts. To identify transcript abundance changes that occur during AON, which may also be used in the bioassay, we used an RNA-seq-based transcriptomics approach.

Differential expression responses were detected for genes involved in jasmonic acid metabolism, pathogenesis and receptor kinase signalling. We identified an inoculation- and NARK-dependent candidate gene (GmUFD 1 a) that responds in both the bioassay and intact, inoculated plants.

40|$|SummaryPlants form root symbioses with fungi and {{bacteria}} {{to improve their}} nutrient supply. SYMBIOSIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SYMRK) is required for phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza, {{as well as for}} the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> root nodule <b>symbiosis</b> of legumes [1] and actinorhizal plants [2, 3], but its precise function was completely unclear. Here we show that the extracytoplasmic region of SYMRK, which comprises three leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a malectin-like domain (MLD) related to a carbohydrate-binding protein from Xenopus laevis [4], is cleaved to release the MLD in the absence of symbiotic stimulation. A conserved sequence motif—GDPC—that connects the MLD to the LRRs is required for MLD release. We discovered that Nod factor receptor 5 (NFR 5) [5 – 8] forms a complex with the SYMRK version that remains after MLD release (SYMRK-ΔMLD). SYMRK-ΔMLD outcompeted full-length SYMRK for NFR 5 interaction, indicating that the MLD negatively interferes with complex formation. SYMRK-ΔMLD is present at lower amounts than MLD, suggesting rapid degradation after MLD release. A deletion of the entire extracytoplasmic region increased protein abundance, suggesting that the LRR region promotes degradation. Curiously, this deletion led to excessive infection thread formation, highlighting the importance of fine-tuned regulation of SYMRK by its ectodomain...|$|R
40|$|The {{nodulation}} {{genes of}} rhizobia are {{regulated by the}} nodD gene product in response to host-produced flavonoids and appear to encode enzymes involved {{in the production of}} a lipo-chitose signal molecule required for infection and nodule formation. We have identified the nodZ gene of Bradyrhizobium japon&um, whose product is required for the addition of a 2 - 0 -methylfucose residue to the terminal reducing N-acetylglu-cosamine of the nodulation signal. This substitution is essential for the biological activity of this molecule. Mutations in nodZ result in defective nodulation of siratro. Surprisingly, although nodZ clearly codes for nodulation function, it is not regulated by NodD and, indeed, shows elevated expression in planta. Therefore, nodZ represents a unique nodulation gene that is not under the control of NodD and yet is essential for the synthesis of an active nodulation signal. Leguminous plants are infected (nodulated) by the gram-negative, soil bacteria Rhizobium, Azorhizobium, and Bradyrhi-zobium species, which establish a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>symbiosis</b> within the roots.

To identify plant genes required for successful symbiotic infection, we screened an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of Lotus japonicus for mutants defective in IT formation and cloned the responsible gene, ERN 1, encoding an AP 2 /ERF transcription factor. We performed phenotypic analysis of two independent L.  japonicus mutant alleles and investigated the regulation of ERN 1 via transactivation and DNA-protein interaction assays. In ern 1 mutant roots, nodule primordia formed, but most remained uninfected and bacterial entry via ITs into the root epidermis was abolished. Infected cortical nodule cells contained bacteroids, but transcellular ITs were rarely observed. A subset exhibited localized cell wall degradation and loss of cell integrity associated with bacteroid spread into neighbouring cells and the apoplast.

The B. japonicum nifA gene product was shown to activate B. japonicum and K. pneumoniae nif promoters (using nif::lacZ translational fusions) both in Escherichia coli and B. japonicum backgrounds. In the heterologous E. coli system activation was shown to be dependent on the ntrA gene product.

50|$|Parniske {{identified}} {{a set of}} plant mutants defective in plant root symbioses with both arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria. These mutants enforced the idea that plant root endosymbioses with bacteria and fungi share a common genetic basis. Because arbuscular mycorrhiza {{dates back to the}} first land plant and the root nodule symbiosis is much younger, this common gene set revealed that the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> root nodule <b>symbiosis</b> evolved by co-opting genes from the existing arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. By map-based identification of so-called “common symbiosis genes”, the Parniske lab contributed to the identification of several components directly or indirectly involved in a plant signal transduction process required for both symbioses. These include a receptor-like kinase, nucleoporins, potassium channels required for nuclear calcium oscillations and a nuclear localized complex comprising a calcium-and-calmodulin dependent protein kinase and its phosphorylation target CYCLOPS, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator. The discovery of these genes and the postulated signal transduction processes had a major impact on this research field.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{bacterial}} Hfq {{protein is}} able to interact with diverse RNA molecules, including regulatory small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), and thus it is recognized as a global post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. Loss of Hfq has an extensive impact in bacterial physiology which in several animal pathogens influences virulence. Sinorhizobium meliloti is a model soil bacterium known {{for its ability to}} establish a beneficial <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> intracellular <b>symbiosis</b> with alfalfa. Despite the predicted general involvement of Hfq in the establishment of successful bacteria-eukaryote interactions, its function in S. meliloti has remained unexplored. Results Two independent S. meliloti mutants, 2011 - 3. 4 and 1021 Δ hfq, were obtained by disruption and deletion of the hfq gene in the wild-type strains 2011 and 1021, respectively, both exhibiting similar growth defects as free-living bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling of 1021 Δ hfq revealed a general down-regulation of genes of sugar transporters and some enzymes of the central carbon metabolism, whereas transcripts specifying the uptake and metabolism of nitrogen sources (mainly amino acids) were more abundant than in the wild-type strain. Proteomic analysis of the 2011 - 3. 4 mutant independently confirmed these observations. Symbiotic tests showed that lack of Hfq led to a delayed nodulation, severely compromised bacterial competitiveness on alfalfa roots and impaired normal plant growth. Furthermore, a large proportion of nodules (55 %- 64 %) elicited by the 1021 Δ hfq mutant were non-fixing, with scarce content in bacteroids and signs of premature senescence of endosymbiotic bacteria. RT-PCR experiments on RNA from bacteria grown under aerobic and microoxic conditions revealed that Hfq contributes to regulation of nifA and fixK 1 /K 2, the genes controlling nitrogen fixation, although the Hfq-mediated regulation of fixK is only aerobiosis dependent. Finally, we found that some of the recently identified S. meliloti sRNAs co-inmunoprecipitate with a FLAG-epitope tagged Hfq protein. Conclusions Our results support that the S. meliloti RNA chaperone Hfq contributes to the control of central metabolic pathways in free-living bacteria and influences rhizospheric competence, survival of the microsymbiont within the nodule cells and nitrogen fixation during the symbiotic interaction with its legume host alfalfa. The identified S. meliloti Hfq-binding sRNAs are predicted to participate in the Hfq regulatory network. </p...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{are exposed}} to many {{different}} microbes in their habitat. These microbes may be benign or pathogenic, {{but in some cases}} they are beneficial. The rhizosphere provides an especially rich palette for colonization by beneficial (associative and symbiotic) microorganisms, which raises the question as to how roots can distinguish such ‘friends’ from possible ‘foes’ (i. e., pathogens). Plants possess an innate immunity system that can recognize pathogens, through an arsenal of protein receptors. These receptors include receptor-like kinases (RLK) and receptor-like proteins (RLP) located at the plasma membrane, as well as intracellular receptors (so called NBS-LRR proteins or R proteins) that recognize molecules released by microbes into the plant cell. The key rhizobial, symbiotic signaling molecule (called Nod factor) is perceived by the host legume plant using LysM-domain containing RLKs. Perception of the symbiotic Nod factor triggers signaling cascades leading to bacterial infection and accommodation of the symbiont in a newly formed root organ, the nodule, resulting in a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> root nodule <b>symbiosis</b> (RNS). The net result of this symbiosis is the intracellular colonization of the plant with thousands of bacteria; a process that seems to occur in spite of the immune ability of plants to prevent pathogen infection.

This nodule inhibition response was used to assess the relative importance of key structural components within and around the CLE domain sequences of these genes. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, mutants were produced at each amino acid within the CLE domain (RLAPEGPDPHHN) of GmRIC 1. This approach identified the Arg 1, Ala 3, Pro 4, Gly 6, Pro 7, Asp 8, His 11, and Asn 12 residues as critical to GmRIC 1 nodulation suppression activity (NSA).

40|$|International audienceResearch on the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>symbiosis</b> {{has been}} so far focused on two model legumes, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, which use a {{sophisticated}} infection process involving infection thread formation. However, in 25 % of the legumes, the bacterial entry occurs more simply in an intercellular fashion. Among them, some semi-aquatic Aeschynomene species present the distinctive feature to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on both roots and stems following elicitation by photosynthetic bradyrhizobia that do not produce Nod factors. This interaction is believed to represent a living testimony of the ancestral state of the rhizobium-legume symbiosis. To decipher the molecular mechanisms of this unique Nod-independent <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> we previously identified A. evenia C. Wright as an appropriate model legume, because it displays all the requisites for molecular and genetic approaches. To advance {{the use of this}} new model legume species, here we characterized the intraspecific diversity found in A. evenia. For this, the accessions available in germplasm banks were collected and subjected to morphological investigations, genotyping with RAPD and SSR markers, molecular phylogenies using ITS and single nuclear gene sequences, and cross-compatibility tests. These combined analyses revealed an important intraspecific differentiation that led us to propose a new taxonomic classification for A. evenia comprising two subspecies and four varieties. The A. evenia ssp. evenia contains var. evenia and var. pauciciliata whereas A. evenia ssp. serrulata comprises var. serrulata and var. major. This study provides information to exploit efficiently the diversity encountered in A. evenia and proposes subsp. evenia as the most appropriate subspecies for future projects aimed at identifying plant determinants of the Nod-independent symbiotic process...|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} tools for forward and reverse genetic {{analysis of the}} legume Lotus (Lotus japonicus). A structured population of M 2 progeny of 4, 904 ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized M 1 embryos is available for single nucleotide polymorphism mutation detection, using a TILLING (for Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) protocol. Scanning subsets of this population, we identified a mutation load of one per 502 kb of amplified fragment. Moreover, we observed a 1 : 10 ratio between homozygous and heterozygous mutations in the M 2 progeny. This reveals a clear difference in germline genetics between Lotus and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In addition, we assembled M 2 siblings with obvious phenotypes in overall development, starch accumulation, or <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> root nodule <b>symbiosis</b> in three thematic subpopulations. By screening the nodulation-defective population of M 2 individuals for mutations {{in a set of}} 12 genes known to be essential for nodule development, we identified large allelic series for each gene, generating a unique data set that combines genotypic and phenotypic information facilitating structure-function studies. This analysis revealed a significant bias for replacements of glycine (Gly) residues in functionally defective alleles, which may be explained by the exceptional structural features of Gly. Gly allows the peptide chain to adopt conformations that are no longer possible after amino acid replacement. This previously unrecognized vulnerability of proteins at Gly residues could be used for the improvement of algorithms that are designed to predict the deleterious nature of single nucleotide polymorphism mutations. Our results demonstrate the power, as well as the limitations, of ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis for forward and reverse genetic studies.

40|$|The har 1 - 1 mutant of Lotus japonicus line Gifu is characterised by {{increased}} nodulation and significantly inhibited root {{growth in the}} presence of its microsymbiont Mesorhizoboium loti (for example strain NZP 2235). A sexual cross between the mutant and another L. japonicus genotype Funakura (with wild-type root and nodule morphology) demonstrated Mendelian recessive segregation of both phenotypes (for root and nodule) in 242 F 2 individuals. No separation of phenotypes was observed, suggesting a single mutation with pleiotropic effects. Reciprocal grafting showed that the har 1 - 1 controlled phenotype is governed by the shoot. Using a skeletal genetic map of arbitrary molecular markers produced from a Gifu x Funakura cross, the har 1 - 1 locus was positioned between two markers at about 7 and 13 cM distance. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transgene sequences were detected by allele-specific PCR in DNA isolated from small (1 mg mass) individual seeds and half-cotyledon of the model legume Lotus japonicus, allowing fast determination of a seedling’s genomic status. This permitted a shortening of the breeding cycle for multi-trait seed lines. Fast neutron mutagenesis of Lotus japonicus wild-type genotype Gifu resulted in the first time isolation of a stable mutant (FNN 5 - 2) unable to form <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> nodules in <b>symbiosis</b> with Mesorhizobium loti, though being infected by mycorrhizal fungi. The mutation behaves as a loss-of-function recessive, and has no other apparent phenotypic effects. Molecular characterization indicates a partial loss of the LjNFR 1 LysM type receptor kinase gene. Additionally part of the LjNIN gene (encoding a putative transcription factor needed for nodulation) is also missing. Transcript levels for both genes are severely reduced. As LjNIN and LjNFR 1 are in the same chromosomal region we tested whether this terminal portion is lacking. PCR analysis confirms that genes within the relevant interval (such as LjPAL 1 (encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and LjEIL 2 (encoding an ethylene insensitive-like response regulator)) are present, suggesting that the mutational event induced by the fast neutrons was either a double hit coincidently involving two nodulation-related genes, a major genome rearrangement, or a major segmental inversion. To develop an integrated nodule developmental model based on gene interactions in autoregulation, nodulation and plant hormone response deficient lines, HE double mutants have been built using the har 1 - 1 mutant (hypernodulation and aberrant root) and the ethylene insensitive transgenic line Etr 1 - 1. The homozygous loss-of-function mutant har 1 - 1 has increased nodulation and decreased root growth. Ethylene insensitivity mediated by the transgene 35 S::AtETR 1 - 1 restores the normal root growth. The HE double mutants were confirmed by triple response test and allele- or gene-specific PCR. The current results in this study indicate that a) HE double mutants shown the same nodulation pattern as har 1 - 1 and normal root formation as Etr 1 - 1, suggesting that nodule and root control diverge at some stage with root control being ethylene-mediated and the Har 1 gene, the orthologue of GmNARK is involved in nodulation. b) Grafting demonstrated that the shoot is the source of ethylene suppression of the har 1 - 1 induced inhibition of root growth. c) The mutated Etr 1 - 1 gene was able to replace AVG in BAP root inhibition; d) IPT-dependent cytokinin overproduction led to aberrant root architecture in har 1 - 1; e) Crosstalk between ethylene and cytokinin in HE double mutant by qRT-PCR...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen is a {{key element}} for plant growth. To meet {{nitrogen}} demands, some plants establish an endosymbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing rhizobium or Frankia bacteria. This involves formation of specialized root lateral organs, named nodules. These nodules are colonized intracellularly, which creates optimal physiological conditions for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by the microbial symbiont. Nitrogen-fixing endosymbioses are found among four related taxonomic orders that together form the nitrogen-fixation clade. Within this clade, nodulation is restricted to ten separate lineages that are scattered among mostly non-nodulating plant species. This limited distribution suggests that genetic adaptations that allowed nodulation to evolve occurred in a common ancestor. A major aim of the scientific community is to unravel the evolutionary trajectory towards a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> nodule <b>symbiosis.</b> The formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules is best studied in legumes (Fabaceae, order Fabales); especially in Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula, two species that serve as model. Legumes and Parasponia (Cannabaceae, order Rosales) represent the only two lineages that can form nodules with rhizobium bacteria. Studies on M. truncatula, L. japonicus and Parasponia showed, amongst others, that nodule formation is initiated upon perception of rhizobial secreted lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) signals. These signals are structurally related to the symbiotic signals produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These obligate biotropic fungi colonize roots of most land plants and form dense hyphal structures inside existing root cortical cells. Rhizobial and mycorrhizal LCOs are perceived by LysM-domain-containing receptor-like kinases. These activate a signaling pathway that is largely shared between both symbioses. Symbiotic LCO receptors are closely related to chitin innate immune receptors, and some receptors even function in symbiotic as well as innate immune signaling. In Chapter 2, I review the intertwining of symbiotic LCO perception and chitin-triggered immunity. Furthermore, I discuss how rhizobia and mycorrhiza might employ LCO signaling to modulate plant immunity. In a perspective, I speculate on a role for plant hormones in immune modulation, besides an important function in nodule organogenesis. In legumes, nodule organogenesis requires activation of cytokinin signaling. Mutants in the orthologous cytokinin receptor genes MtCRE 1 and LjLHK 1 in M. truncatula and L. japonicus, respectively, are severely affected in nodule formation. However, how cytokinin signaling is activated in response to rhizobium LCO perception and to what extent this contributes to rhizobium LCO-induced signaling remained elusive. In Chapter 3, I show that the majority of transcriptional changes induced in wild-type M. truncatula, upon application of rhizobium LCOs, are dependent on activation of MtCRE 1 -mediated cytokinin signaling. Among the genes induced in wild type are several involved in cytokinin biosynthesis. Consistently, cytokinin measurements indicate that cytokinins rapidly accumulate in M. truncatula roots upon treatment with rhizobium LCOs. This includes the bioactive cytokinins isopentenyl adenine and trans-zeatin. Therefore, I argue that cytokinin accumulation represents a key step in the pathway leading to legume root nodule organogenesis. Strigolactones are plant hormones of which biosynthesis is increased in response to nutrient limitation. In rice (Oryza sativa) and M. truncatula, this response requires the GRAS-type transcriptional regulators NSP 1 and NSP 2. Both proteins regulate expression of DWARF 27 (D 27), which encodes an enzyme that performs the first committed step in strigolactone biosynthesis. NSP 1 and NSP 2 are also essential components of the signaling cascade that controls legume root nodule formation. In line with this, I questioned whether the NSP 1 -NSP 2 -D 27 regulatory module functions in rhizobium symbiosis. In Chapter 4, I show that in M. truncatula MtD 27 expression is induced within hours after treatment with rhizobium LCOs. Spatiotemporal expression studies revealed that MtD 27 is expressed in the dividing cells of the nodule primordium. At later stages, its expression becomes confined to the meristem and distal infection zone of the mature nodule. Analysis of the expression pattern of MtCCD 7 and MtCCD 8, two additional strigolactone biosynthesis genes, showed that these genes are co-expressed with MtD 27 in nodule primordia and mature nodules. Additionally, I show that symbiotic expression of MtD 27 requires MtNSP 1 and MtNSP 2. This suggests that the NSP 1 -NSP 2 -D 27 regulatory module is co-opted in rhizobium symbiosis. Comparative studies between legumes and nodulating non-legumes could identify shared genetic networks required for nodule formation. We recently adopted Parasponia, the only non-legume lineage able to engage in rhizobium symbiosis. However, to perform functional studies, powerful reverse genetic tools for Parasponia are essential. In Chapter 5, I describe the development of a fast and efficient protocol for CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated mutagenesis in Agrobacterium tumefaciens-transformed Parasponia andersonii plants. Using this protocol, stable mutants can be obtained in a period of three months. These mutants can be effectively propagated in vitro, which allows phenotypic evaluation already in the T 0 generation. As such, phenotypes can be obtained within six months after transformation. As proof-of-principle, we mutated PanHK 4, PanEIN 2, PanNSP 1 and PanNSP 2. These genes are putatively involved in cytokinin and ethylene signaling and regulation of strigolactone biosynthesis, respectively. Additionally, orthologues of these genes perform essential symbiotic functions in legumes. Panhk 4 and Panein 2 knockout mutants display developmental phenotypes associated with reduced cytokinin and ethylene signaling. Analysis of Pannsp 1 and Pannsp 2 mutants revealed a conserved role for NSP 1 and NSP 2 in regulation of the strigolactone biosynthesis genes D 27 and MAX 1 and root nodule organogenesis. In contrast, symbiotic mutant phenotypes of Panhk 4 and Panein 2 mutants are different from their legume counterparts. This illustrates the value of Parasponia as comparative model - besides legumes - to study the genetics underlying rhizobium symbiosis. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the Parasponia lineage is embedded in the non-nodulating Trema genus. This close relationship suggests that Parasponia and Trema only recently diverged in nodulation ability. In Chapter 6, I exploited this close relationship to question whether the nodulation trait is associated with gene expression differentiation. To this end, I sequenced root transcriptomes of two Parasponia and three Trema species. Principal component analysis separated all Parasponia samples from those of Trema along the first principal component. This component explains {{more than half of the}} observed variance, indicating that the root transcriptomes of two Parasponia species are distinct from that of the Trema sister species T. levigata, as well as the outgroup species T. orientalis and T. tomentosa. To determine, whether the transcriptional differences between Parasponia and Trema are relevant in a symbiotic context, I compared the list of differentially expressed genes to a list of genes that show nodule-enhanced expression in P. andersonii. This revealed significant enrichment of nodule-enhanced genes among genes that lower expressed in roots of Parasponia compared to Trema. Among the genes differentially expressed between Parasponia and Trema roots are several involved in mycorrhizal symbiosis as well as jasmonic acid biosynthesis. Measurements of hormone concentrations, showed that Parasponia and Trema roots harbor a difference in jasmonic acid/salicylic acid balance. However, mutants in jasmonic acid biosynthesis are unaffected in nodule development. Therefore, it remains a challenge to determine whether the difference in root transcriptomes between Parasponia and Trema are relevant in a symbiotic context. In Chapter 7, I review hormone function in nitrogen-fixing nodule symbioses in legumes, Parasponia and actinorhizal species. In this chapter, I question whether different nodulating lineages recruited the same hormonal networks to function in nodule formation. Additionally, I discuss whether nodulating species harbor genetic adaptations in hormonal pathways that correlate with nodulation capacity...|$|R
