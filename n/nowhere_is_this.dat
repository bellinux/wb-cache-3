5|$|While {{the designs}} for the corps de logis were {{confined}} by the foundations of Harrison's earlier plan, the secondary wings and precincts were not. Abandoning completely Harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath the corp de logis, Blore's assistant architect, Hunt, opted for the typical vast sprawling wings and servants' quarters of the 19th century English country house. These took {{full advantage of the}} gradients and topography of the site, and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval, fortified town of towers and high castellated walls. <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> more evident than the Shuvalov Passage, an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between the high walls of two wings, leading from the castellated Western Gatehouse to the forecourt before the northern facade. The passage, which twists and turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge, resembles the street of a medieval town, rather than the approach to a country house.|$|E
25|$|Idyllic and {{pleasant}} as this concept was for those living upstairs, {{it was bad}} news for the servants, as the first and most obvious solution was to bury them. <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> more evident than at Castle Coole in Northern Ireland. The entire servant's quarters were put underground into cellars, lit only by windows at the bottom of grated pits. The only means of approach was through a single underground tunnel, the entrance of which was concealed by the brow of a landscaped hill some distance from the house.|$|E
500|$|As Cutt argues, [...] "the great {{overriding}} {{metaphor of}} all [...] {{work is the}} representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden)[...] [...] No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed {{in the sight of}} God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God." [...] Demers has referred to this [...] "consciously double vision" [...] as the quintessentially Romantic element of Sherwood's writing. <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> theme more evident than in Sherwood's The History of the Fairchild Family, the first part of which was published in 1818.|$|E

500|$|... "Shivers" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and became a}} major underground success in Australia, bringing more national attention to the band. Nick Cave cited it in hindsight as {{the main reason for}} the Boys Next Door's eminence. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Will Lerner wrote that [...] "it's impressive how, even at this early stage, Nick Cave was a confident and unique singer, perfectly aware of the strengths and limitations of his voice … he knows how to come across in a scary and theatrical manner that perfectly complements the music. <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> more apparent than on … 'Shivers', an unashamedly melodramatic example of post-adolescent anguish". [...] "Shivers", along with other songs Howard composed, were [...] "crucial to guiding the band in the darker, wilder direction" [...] that defined the Birthday Party's music, according to Dan Lawrence of Stereogum. The song has since been considered an Australian classic and labelled by ABC Television as [...] "possibly Australia's most enduring cult hit".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Joey Lynch of Billboard compared the song's demo {{to the studio}} versions, claiming that [...] "The studio version of 'Joan of Arc' is a massive improvement on the illegally leaked demo that preceded news of the album itself. [...] <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> more apparent than on 'Joan of Arc,' a solid album track that sounds 10 times better than the leaked version." [...] While reviewing the three tracks released prior to the album, Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called it [...] "arguably the standout of the whole over-blown affair," [...] noting that the song [...] "sounded like a highlight even in its more acoustic demo form, but the album version is a full-on stunner... The song sounds {{a bit like a}} Cardigans leftover circa 'Long Gone Before Daylight'. It's the strongest (anti-)ballad of Madonna's last few albums, and a strong argument for artists responding to the denigration of their art through the more considered medium of the art itself, rather than snap public statements. [...] More than any of the previously released songs, 'Joan of Arc' also establishes one of the foundational themes of Rebel Heart, albeit one not always evident when wading through the poorly sequenced album." [...] Adding to the previous review, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised the juxtapositions in the album's lyrical content, which according to her, [...] "make some of her most vulnerable, engaging work in years— in particular 'Joan of Arc'." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> more {{apparent}} than in his portrait [...] (1908), in which the subject is seen wearing a Persian costume, a pearl encrusted turban, and strumming an Indian tambura, accoutrements all meant to convey sensuality and mystery. If Sargent used this portrait to explore issues of sexuality and identity, {{it seems to have}} met with the satisfaction of the subject's father, Asher Wertheimer, a wealthy Jewish art dealer.|$|E

2500|$|Aesthetics are {{a central}} {{component}} of Russian Orthodox worship services; <b>nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> {{more evident than}} through {{the study of the}} architecture of Russian churches and cathedrals. [...] Services are designed so as to stimulate the five senses, and the structure and layout of the churches themselves regulate the sensory perceptions of the worshipers. [...] The mystic environment cultivated through church services is enhanced through the regulation of light, movement, smoke, and sound. [...] Icons, visual representations of holy figures, are the most ancient and important visual aspect of worship. [...] Icons adorn the space in a multitude of ways and become a part of Orthodox churches’ architecture.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps <b>nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> {{level of}} {{commitment}} more strongly expressed than in the university's Pride Rock tradition, which began in 1994. Pride Rock is a 60-pound, engraved granite stone bearing the actual paw print of Leo II, UNA's second live lion mascot. [...] Placed just behind the north end zone of all UNA home games, Pride Rock is touched by players as they file past {{on their way to}} the field. [...] Pride Rock serves not only as a motivational tool for the players but also as a tangible expression of the deep well of pride, community and tradition associated with the University of North Alabama and particularly with its athletic program.|$|E
2500|$|Some Protestants, however, {{reject the}} {{position}} that contraceptive use {{is a matter of}} conscience. Although some Quiverfull adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents may argue that the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of Unless The Lord Magazine, states, [...] "The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal {{in the sense that it}} is not something unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century." [...] Charles D. Provan additionally argues:"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.|$|E

2500|$|Germans {{tended to}} be shown as being either weak or barbaric, but also stupid, and obsessed with Nazism and Nazi imagery. [...] This {{could be seen in}} comic books such as Captain America No. 1, who cover {{features}} the superhero punching out Hitler, while a number of menacing and feral looking officers shoot at Captain America. [...] This existed in cartoons as well. [...] The Popeye cartoon, Seein' Red, White, 'N' Blue (aired on February 19, 1943), ends with a distinctly American Uncle Sam fist punching a sickly looking Hitler. [...] Perhaps <b>nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> unattractive portrayal of Germans better known than in the somewhat controversial Donald Duck cartoon, Der Fuehrer's Face (aired on January 1, 1943). [...] Best known for portraying Donald Duck as a Nazi living in Germany, the cartoon also features caricatures of Benito Mussolini, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, and Herman Göring performing in an oompa-band marching past swastika clouds, bushes, windmills, fire hydrants, and telephone lines, among other things. [...] Donald Duck, living in a house with a striking resemblance to Hitler, is shown to a swastika fence surrounding it, and swastika wallpaper, an alarm clock that gives the Nazi salute and with each number replaced by a swastika, a cuckoo clock with the same number pattern, and a Hitler cuckoo, and numerous pictures of Hitler and the other Axis leaders decorating the walls. [...] Donald Duck then is forced to his job at a munitions factory (appropriately decorated with even more swastikas) where he must [...] "work 48 hours a day for the Führer" [...] under heavy guard. [...] While screwing in shells on a conveyor belt, pictures of Hitler occasionally pass him which he must salute, all while a loudspeaker extols the glory of Hitler: [...] "Is this not wonderful? [...] Is not the Führer glorious?" ...|$|E

60|$|Often has nature been {{described}} as falling asleep {{in the arms of}} winter, and awaking at the touch of spring; but <b>nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> simile so strikingly illustrated as in these hyperborean climes, where, for eight long, silent months, nature falls into a slumber so deep and unbroken that death seems a fitter simile than sleep, and then bursts into a life so bright, so joyous, so teeming with animal and vegetable vitality, and, especially when contrasted with her previous torpidity, so noisy, that awakening from sleep gives no adequate idea of the change.|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, Serbia {{sought to}} revive the empire of Stefan Dusan, and the latecomers in the Balkan nation-building, the Bulgarians, the medieval Bulgarian Empires.

Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831.

40|$|Scholars of {{diplomacy}} have shown how the embassy in early modern Europe was {{a forum for}} exchanges: not just of gifts and communiqués, but of statuses, loyalties and of political ambition too.

Here and there {{the base of the}} cliffs is strewn with masses of rock, {{undermined}} by the waves, and tumbled headlong below, where, sometimes, the water completely surrounds them, showing in shattered confusion detached rocks, pyramids, and obelisks, rising half-revealed from the surf--the Tadmores of the wasteful desert of the sea. <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> desolation more marked than for those fifty miles of coast between Flamborough Head and the Spurm.|$|E
60|$|This word, sir, is much used {{on board}} a man-of-war, and in all its {{convertible}} significations. From the inferior to the superior, it comes as natural {{as if it were}} a gift from above; from equal to equal, it has a ceremonious and be-on-your-guard air that sometimes means respect, sometimes disrespect; while from a captain to a quartermaster, it always means reproof, if it do not mean menace. In discussions of this sort, it is wisest for the weaker party to be silent; and <b>nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> truth sooner learned than on shipboard.

And these changes {{must be dealt with}} by statesmen, must be guided with one hand while the war is being prosecuted with the other. The task is colossal. In no previous war have the British given more striking proof of their inherent quality of doggedness. Greatness, as Confucius said, does not consist in never falling, but in rising every time you fall. The British speak with appalling frankness of their blunders. They are fighting, indeed, for the privilege of making blunders--since out of blunders arise new truths and discoveries not contemplated in German philosophy.|$|E

6000|$|... § I. The {{decay of}} the city of Venice is, in many respects, like that of an outwearied and aged human frame; the cause of its decrepitude is indeed at the heart, but the outward {{appearances}} of it are first at the extremities. In the centre {{of the city}} there are still places where some evidence of vitality remains, and where, with kind closing of the eyes to signs, too manifest even there, of distress and declining fortune, the stranger may succeed in imagining, for a little while, what must have been the aspect of Venice in her prime. But this lingering pulsation has not force enough any more to penetrate into the suburbs and outskirts of the city; the frost of death has there seized upon it irrevocably, and the grasp of mortal disease is marked daily by the increasing breadth of its belt of ruin. <b>Nowhere</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> seen more grievously than along the great north-eastern boundary, once occupied by the smaller palaces of the Venetians, built for pleasure or repose; the nobler piles along the grand canal being reserved for the pomp and business of daily life. To such smaller palaces some garden ground was commonly attached, opening to the water-side; and, in front of these villas and gardens, the lagoon was wont to be covered in the evening by gondolas: the space of it between this part {{of the city and the}} island group of Murano being to Venice, in her time of power, what its parks are to London; only gondolas were used instead of carriages, and the crowd of the population did not come out till towards sunset, and prolonged their pleasures far into the night, company answering to company with alternate singing.|$|E
