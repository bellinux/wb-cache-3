40|$|This {{research}} entitled Study Parameters UO 2 -fueled Reactor with D 2 O Cooler and Moderator aims {{to determine}} the critical dimension of the reactor and obtain the value of K to achieve optimal reactor conditions. Reactor critical condition can be obtained when the value of keff and k∞ equals 1. This value is obtained by varying the radius of the inner fuel, the radius of inner cladding, the radius and the numbers of moderator layers and also the radius of outer cladding. For the calculation and data processing of these dimension, WIMS software was being used to simplify the calculation of keff and k∞. This software works using a multigroup diffusion equation with a grouping of 69 <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>group.</b> The result obtained from this study can be concluded that the parameters used to achieve the value of k infinitive 1. 03 and k effective 1. 00 are 0. 955 cm of inner fuel radius, 1. 0 cm of inner cladding radius, 8. 9 cm of outer moderator radius, the numbers of moderator layers is 11 and 9. 1 cm of outer cladding radius.

40|$|A three-group {{method is}} {{developed}} for analyzing lightwater UO/sub 2 / cores of low enrichment. The method {{is composed of}} a series of subroutines that are consolidated to produce a set of self-consistent multigroup parameters. The thermal cross sections are determined by averaging the cross section over a "hardened" or shifted Maxwellian spectrum, the amount of hardening being a function of the macroscopic absomption-to-slowing-down ratio. The disadvantage factor is calculated using diffusion theory for the moderator and a transport condition at the surface of the rod, the accuracy of the calculation being comparable to a g a shielding effects even for very close-packed lattices. The fast-fission factor is calculated relative to the experimental measurements for UO/sub 2 /. The diffusion coefficients are found by averaging the measured cross sections over the appropriate neutron flux in each <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>group.</b> The slowing-down cross section is defined as the diffusion coefficient divided by the neutron age, the age being determined by calculating equivalent transport and slowing-down factors relative to light-water measurements.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Two new {{concepts}} have been explored {{in solving the}} neutron diffusion equation in one and two dimensions. At the present time, the diffusion equation is solved using source iterations. These iterations are performed in a mathematical form which {{has a great deal}} of physical significance. Specifically, the neutron production term is on the right-hand side, while the absorption and leakage terms are on the left side. In performing a single source iteration, a distribution for the neutron flux is assumed so that the production term can be calculated. This provides a "known" right-hand side. Solving the difference equation for the flux, which corresponds to this assumed source distribution, gives the next estimate for the flux distribution. This type of iteration has the physically significant characteristic of finding directly, for each iteration, a flux which corresponds to an assumed source distribution. In this thesis it was found that by subtracting the absorption term from both sides of the diffusion equation, and performing "source iterations" with both absorption and production terms on the right-hand side (and only the leakage term on the left-hand side), improved convergence rates were attained in many cases. In one <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>group,</b> this new idea of putting the absorption term on the right-hand side worked best with only one region, and where reactor dimensions were large compared to the thermal neutron diffusion length (a>>L). In small reactors, where a=L, convergence behavior was similar for both forms of iteration. This new idea was also found to work quite well in one-group multiregion problems. However, due to problems with numerics (inherent asymmetric treatment of the scattering terms), the method does not work at all in a multi-energy group formulation. Secondly, in two dimensions, a closed-form solution to a single source iteration has been found. At this time, the standard method of solution for a two-dimensional source iteration is to perform "inner iterations" to approximately solve for the flux that corresponds to an assumed source. The alternative, up until now, was to solve a giant matrix of the order (N² x N²). This is a sparse matrix, but it has always been considered as highly undesirable to work with a solution (even though it may be closed-form) where the matrix to be solved increases in order roughly as the fourth power of the number of mesh intervals. The new algebraic form for this closed-form solution involves a matrix of order (N x N), not (N² x N²). The matrix is, however, a full matrix. What is done, essentially, is to solve simultaneously for all the flux values along the vertical centerline of the two-dimensional problem, and then use a reflective boundary condition across the core centerline, and then the difference equation itself (in vector form) as a set of flux-vector generating equations to generate the entire flux field, line by line. In solving for the first flux vector (at the x = o, or z = o, core centerline), the right-hand side of the matrix problem incorporates all of the source values in the entire problem space. The initial inversion of the full (N x N) matrix algebraically guarantees that the (M+ 1) th flux vector (on the problem space boundary) will go to zero. This matrix method for two-dimensional neutronic analysis was shown to work well in both cartesian and cylindrical coordinates...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityEnergy {{levels are}} {{characterized}} by the following properties: excitation energy, Q, angular momentum, parity, level width, isobaric spin, magnetic moment and configuration. They may be studied experimentally by the following methods: (1) measurement of the energy spectra of nuclear reaction products, (2) measurement of peaks in the yield curve {{as a function of}} incident particle energy to obtain levels in the compound nucleus, (3) measurement of gamma ray intensity as a function of bombarding particle energy, (4) measurement of the maximum beta decay energy to locate levels in the residual nucleus, (5) measurement of input particle energy thresholds for production of neutrons, (6) measurement of angular distributions and angular correlations to find the spin and parity of a level. The accurate measurement of neutron spectra is difficult because the uncharged neutron must be detected by indirect means. Cloud chambers, proportional counters, threshold detectors, time-of-flight methods, and nuclear emulsions have all been used successfully. Nuclear emulsions detect neutrons by the track of developable silver halide crystals left by a recoil proton after being struck by a neutron. The range of the recoil proton and the angle it made with the incident neutron beam are measured. Knowledge of the range-energy curve for the emulsion and application of the laws of conservation of energy and momentum determines the energy of the incident neutron. The emulsion consists of a high concentration of silver halide crystals embedded in gelatin. The following is a description of the nuclear emulsion method: A beam of particles strikes a target, neutrons are emitted, and they are detected by plates placed at several different angles with respect to the incident beam. Development of the plates must be done soon after exposure, since the latent image fades rapidly. In this experiment, a combination of the two-solution and low temperature development techniques was used. The plates are scanned with a microscope and the following quantities are measured: (1) θ, the dip angle in the processed emulsion, (2) l, the projection in the x-y plane of the track length in the processed emulsion, and (3) φ the angle l makes with the x axis. φ and θ are measured {{at the beginning of the}} track. To avoid large errors, only tracks which fall within certain acceptance criteria are measured. This experiment required the following criteria to be satisfied: (1) if φ≤ 10 °, tan θ≤ 0. 075, (2) if 10 ° 15 ° it is not accepted, and (4) the track must lie wholly within the emulsion. Scanning is done in strips one field of view wide and about half the plate length long. At each x and y coordinate setting the entire depth of the emulsion is searched for tracks, then the x coordinate is changed by about half a field of view, and the process is repeated. Strips are separated by two or three fields of view so that overlapping does not occur. Length measurements are made in eyepiece scale divisions, which must be converted to microns by calibrating against a stage micrometer. The emulsion thickness must be measured daily since it varies with humidity. Neutron energies are calculated by converting the measured track length to length in the unprocessed emulsion, and then applying conservation of energy and momentum. The number of tracks obtained per energy interval as a function of energy is tabulated. Two corrections are needed because: (1) the neutron-proton scattering cross section is strongly energy dependent, and (2) the probability of the recoil proton escaping from the emulsion increases with energy. Results are plotted in histogram form. The Q value for each neutron group is calculated; the highest <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>group</b> usually represents formation of the ground state, the next highest represents the first excited state, etc. The energy resolution of the nuclear emulsion method is limited by the following factors: (1) Range straggling of protons in the emulsion, (2) energy straggling of the beam in the target, (3) energy spread of the beam, (4) multiple scattering of the protons in the emulsion, (5) length and angle measurement errors, (6) finite target size and angular spread of neutrons incident on the emulsion. This experiment was performed to measure the mass of p^ 28, by means of the reaction Si^ 28 (p,n) p^ 28. The target, a suspension of natural silicon in polystyrene, was bombarded by protons from the Princeton cyclotron, with an energy of 17. 45 ± 0. 15 Mev. The target thickness corresponded to an energy loss of 100 kev for 17 Mev protons, so the average proton energy reaching the plates was 17. 4 ± 0. 2 Mev. Ilford C- 2 plates, 400 microns thick, were placed 4. 5 in. from the target in an evacuated scattering chamber. Plates were mounted at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 degrees. At each angle two plates were sandwiched together, emulsions facing, and wrapped in aluminun 1 and lead foils. The beam was collimated by graphite apertures and was stopped by a graphite cup, relatively far from the plates. Plates were scanned at 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The range-energy relation of Rotblat was used. Data was corrected for n-p scattering and geometry. Five hundred tracks were measured at 30 ° and 90 °, and 250 tracks at 60 °. The ground state of p^ 28 was resolved only at 30 °, and actually the peak found in the 30 ° spectrum is probably due to both the ground and first excited states in p^ 28. Q for the ground state is - 14. 71 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass defect of p^ 28 is 0. 68 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass of p^ 28 is 28. 00073 ± 0. 00024 amu. The differential cross section at 30 ° for formation of the ground and first excited states of p^ 28 is 0. 27 ±. 018 mb/steradian. If one corrects for the Coulomb energy difference and the neutron-proton mass difference, the mass of p^ 28 is 9. 39 Mev greater than that of Si^ 28. This means that the ground state of p^ 28 probably corresponds to the lower of two levels in Si^ 28, located at about 9. 39 Mev. This is in excellent agreement with the hypothesis of charge independence of nuclear forces. The reactions Si^ 29 (p,n) p^ 29 and Si^ 30 (p,n) p^ 30 were observed. No new levels were found in either p^ 29 or p^ 30...|$|E

40|$|At thermal ultra-cold neutron (UCN) sources (neutrons in thermal {{equilibrium}} with the moderator) {{only a very}} small fraction of neutrons have velocities ~ 6 m/s. Therefore, the UCN production rate cannot be substantially increased by simply lowering the temperature of the moderator.

We want to investigate scattering kernels for a super-thermal UCN source based on a two-layer arrangement of D 2 O and solid D 2.

The evaluation combines the results of nuclear model calculations and the complete existing experimental data base {{in order to obtain}} the most accurate description of the cross sections possible within our present knowledge. The evaluation was performed in the following way: The cross sections from the EFF - 2 file (results of model calculations) and their estimated covariances are used as prior information which is successively improved by adding experimental data and by applying Bayes' theorem to obtain the posterior information. For this process the code GLUCS was used. For some cross sections, not covered in EFF - 2, priors were taken from BROND and recent nuclear model calculations. As results we obtained evaluated cross sections and their covariances for a chosen set of 15 independent cross sections in a group structure of 31 <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>groups</b> 0. 2 - 1 MeV wide. The evaluated cross sections thus are the average cross sections over the respective <b>energy</b> <b>group.</b> Thus before use as evaluated data file, fine structure of the various cross sections has to be added whenever such fine structure has been established with sufficient accuracy. A final coupled set of evaluated cross sections and covariances was obtained by a last GLUCS run including the experimental data for 'redundant' cross sections, that is all cross sections which can be expressed as sum or difference of the basic cross sections chosen for the evaluation.

The first version of the solver is implemented in any number of <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>groups,</b> and in 3 D Cartesian geometries; thus it mainly addresses PWR and BWR core simulations. The details about the generalization to multigroups and 3 D, as well as the implementation of the method are given. The transverse integration procedure is the scheme chosen to extend the ACMFD formulation to multidimensional problems. The role of the transverse leakage treatment in the accuracy of the nodal solutions is analyzed in detail: the involved assumptions, the limitations of the method in terms of nodal width, the alternative approaches to implement the transverse leakage terms in nodal methods – implicit or explicit _, and the error assessment due to transverse integration. A new approach for solving the control rod ‘‘cusping” problem, based on the direct application of the ACMFD method, is also developed and implemented in ANDES.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Engineering Sciences in Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. This {{research}} {{focuses on}} modelling reflectors in typical material testing reactors (MTRs). Reflectors present some challenges to the usual approach to full-core calculational models. Diffusion theory is standardly used in full-core calculations and {{is known to be}} inaccurate in regions where the flux is anisotropic, for example within the reflectors. Thus, special consideration should be given to reflector models. In this research, normalised generalised equivalence theory is used to homogenise cross-sections and calculate equivalent nodal parameters and albedo boundary conditions for the reflector surrounding a typical MTR reactor. Various studies have shown that equivalence theory can be used to accurately generate equivalent nodal parameters for the core and reflector regions of large reactors, such as pressurised and boiling water reactors, in one dimension and for two <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>groups.</b> This has not been tested for smaller reactors where leakage, environment sensitivity and multi-group spectrum dependency are much larger. The SAFARI- 1 MTR reactor is modelled in this work. A thirty day operational cycle is simulated for this reactor, using the nodal diffusion code MGRAC. NGET reflector equivalent nodal parameters are calculated using the codes NEWT and EQUIVA. The impact of different reflector models are evaluated, based on their effect on the core power, flux distribution, reactivity and neutron leakage over the duration of the operational cycle. It is found that homogenisation introduces some environment dependencies in the reflector parameters, particularly in the corners of the reactor core. In full-core calculations, the reflector parameters show some sensitivity to the in-core reflector structures, but not the fuel composition. A practical reflector model for SAFARI- 1 is proposed, which proves that NGET equivalence theory can be used for multi-group reflector modelling in a small MTR reactor. This approach to reflector modelling simplifies the core model, increases the accuracy of a diffusion calculation, and increases the efficiency (shorter calculational time and better convergence behaviour) of computer simulations.
