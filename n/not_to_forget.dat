25|$|This was a {{persistent}} irritation for Meck {{and not necessarily}} a warning of her cutting off her patronage of Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, one logical explanation of giving him a year's allowance at once would be that she feared not having the funds to send later, in their usual arrangement of monthly installments. Others discount this idea. Most tellingly, Meck asked Tchaikovsky, in her final letter, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> her.|$|E
25|$|The Urapmin have {{replaced}} traditional rituals with new, Christian methods for removing sin (Tok Pisin: sin, Urapmin yum, lit. debt). The Urapmin have innovated {{an institution of}} confession (Tok Pisin: autim sin), which was not present in the Baptist Church which they belong to. Confessions are held {{at least once a}} month, and some Urapmin keep lists of sins in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> to confess them. Pastors and other leaders regularly give haranguing lectures (Urapmin: weng kem) about avoiding sin.|$|E

25|$|The {{case of the}} Bali Nine Australian heroin traffickers {{convicted in}} Indonesia in 2005 {{resulted}} in six death sentences being imposed either at trial or on appeal. Four of these were struck down on further appeal. In January 2015, Indonesian President Joko Widodo refused to grant clemency for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two remaining Australians facing death sentences after their convictions as the orchestrators of the enterprise. The Australian Government pleaded with Indonesia not to execute the two Australians and some Australian tourists chose to boycott Bali in protest. Prime Minister Tony Abbott called for Indonesia <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> Australia's billion dollars worth of assistance after the Aceh tsunami in 2004. Sukumaran and Chan were executed on 29 April 2015. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott recalled the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia and suspended ministerial contact for about six weeks.|$|E
25|$|According to Michel Christol though, this {{interpretation}} overly restricts {{the meaning of}} the word libertas. In Christol’s view, it is important <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> that the emperor’s decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the spectre of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed “concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbours”. This would explain the honour that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, protector of the pagus) '.|$|E

During World War II, despite his aversion to Nazi Germany and fascism, {{he was forced to}} work as an artillery director in Italy. At war's end, he returned to work as a mechanic, retiring in 1960. In his later years, he was active in urging others <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> the lessons learned after the first World War, and in 2003 he was made a Grand Officer in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. He died in January 2005, a month after having turned 110 and achieving supercentenarian status. At the time of his death, he was Italy's oldest survivor of the First World War, the last remaining trench infantryman and the last survivor from Italy's entry into the war.|$|E

She achieved a silver AA at the Spartakiade of Russian Federation Sports Schools meet, and bronze AA at the USSR Cup, being the top scorer on both beam and bars. Shortly after, Davydova won the AA title at the prestigious Chunichi Cup in Japan defeating Maxi Gnauck. Her win by 0.55 points remains the joint 3rd highest margin of victory in the competition's 34-year history. She also won gold on the bars and vault at the Tokyo Cup. As a result, she was chosen {{to be a member of}} the USSR team at the World Championships at Strasbourg in France. However, on the day of competition she was named as an alternate, and unable to compete. Although as alternate she still received a team gold medal it was a disappointment she was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget.</b>|$|E

They beg the aid of Matoya once more, who grants them access to the Antitower, an upside-down edifice whose nadir crosses into the aetherial sea. There, they discover that Minfilia has become the avatar of the Mothercrystal, Hydaelyn, and reveals the existence of thirteen reflections of the planet, remnants of her battle with the dark deity Zodiark. The Ascians succeeded in shattering seven, each driving Zodiark's revival and sapping Hydaelyn of strength, which necessitated Minfilia's permanent symbiosis. In Ishgard, Aymeric works towards a conference to announce his intentions to end the Dragonsong War not with violence, but peace. The conference is temporarily delayed when protesters urge the crowd <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> their desire for vengeance. Sensing flagging Ishgardian unity, Aymeric organizes a set of joint military exercises with the Eorzean Alliance to reignite national pride. With the conference back on track, Vidofnir arrives and accepts the Ishgardians' proposal for peace. However, Nidhogg crashes the event with a dire warning—that his next assault will be the last, promising Ishgard's total annihilation.|$|E

Maria Amélia, who was not yet three years old, was taken during the early hours of 24 September 1834 to Pedro's deathbed. Very weak, Pedro raised his hands to bless her and said: [...] "Always tell this child of the father who loved her so dearly... <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> me... always to obey her mother... those are my last wishes".

Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E

500|$|In 1840 {{the playwright}} Friedrich Hebbel wrote a poem in German titled [...] "Requiem", its Latin title {{alluding}} to [...] "" [...] (eternal rest), {{the first words}} of the Mass for the Dead. The poem opens with an apostrophe to a [...] "soul" [...] in a plea, [...] "" [...] (Soul, forget them not, soul, forget not the dead). These words appear to echo various psalms, such as , [...] "Bless the Lord, O my soul". Hebbel, however, evokes an [...] "eternal rest" [...] that is distinctly non-religious: the poem offers no metaphysical reference, Christian or otherwise, but calls for remembrance {{as the only way}} to keep the dead alive. The first lines, in which the speaker calls upon the soul <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> the dead, are repeated in the centre of the poem and again at its conclusion, as a refrain that sets apart two longer sections of verse. The first of these sections describes how the dead, nurtured by love, enjoy a final glow of life. In contrast, the latter section portrays a different fate for souls that have been forsaken: who are relegated to an unending, desolate struggle for renewed existence. The musicologist Katherine FitzGibbon notes that the speaker of this narrative is not identified, but may be [...] "a poetic narrator, divine voice, or even the dead".|$|E

[...] Blessy Chettiar of DNA India, noted the music of the film and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film: [...] "For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls", he wrote, giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, [...] "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts." [...] He also praised the performance of the cast, highlighting it as one of the main positives of the film, but points out that the film's length [...] "sucks some fun of out of the ride" [...] and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. On the contrary, Raja Sen of Rediff held that the film [...] "tried too hard to be cool" [...] and gave it 1.5/5 stars.|$|E
500|$|The first May Day {{demonstration}} in Cuba {{was held in}} 1890, and consisted of a march followed by a meeting addressed by 18 anarchist speakers. In the following days, strikes by workers in many industries led to the colonial government once again closing the Círculo de Trabajadores, only to rescind the decision {{when faced with a}} manifesto issued in protest by 2,300 workers. Later that year, 11 anarchists were tried for the murder of Menéndez Areces, a director of the moderate Uníon Obrera (Workers' Union). Though all 11 were found innocent, Captain-General Camilo García Polavieja used the situation as pretext for shutting down production of El Productor, and repression of anarchists in general. In 1892, another labor congress was held in which it reconfirmed its revolutionary syndicalist principles and expressing solidarity with the women in the working class (a new idea for a predominantly male working class that felt competed against by women in the workplace), declaring, [...] "It is an urgent necessity <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> women, who are beginning to fill the workshops of several industries. They are driven by necessity and by bourgeois greed to compete with us. We cannot oppose it; let us help them." [...] However, the outcome of this was government suppression of the movement by means of deportation, imprisonment, the suspension of the right to free assembly, and closing of organizations' headquarters to quell organizing efforts.|$|E

[...] Marcotte noted that the [...] "Resistance" [...] is lead, for the audience, by two women in Johnson and Simmons, reflecting the 2017 Women's March, and also that Hydra gained power using fear of Inhumans just as [...] "Trump was able to ride a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment into power". She also highlighted Simmons' warning to a young boy that all Hydra agent are Nazis, calling this a warning [...] "to the audience, reminding them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> exactly what kind of authoritarian monster has been put in the White House." [...] Michal Schick of Hypable noted that the political commentary had been running throughout the season, with Nadeer and the Humans First movement, but that [...] "in the face of murderous demons with combustable craniums and body-swapping LMD’s, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. largely kept the commentary in the background. That changed—drastically—as the show entered" [...] the final pod. Schick highlighted the fact that [...] "for all of the clear allusions to Trump’s America, the president himself remains unparodied. The mistress of the Framework’s perversities is Aida, as Madame Hydra, and it’s hard to imagine a more different figure from Trump ... By omitting this easiest and most obvious point of satire, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. broadens its message beyond straight contemporary commentary. It is easy (and desperately tempting) to place blame all of our ills and evils on a current administration, and easy to pin all the ills of the Framework on Aida. But an element of individual responsibility burns through, both in our own lives and in this fiction." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Dream Pool Essays is {{certainly}} his most extensive and important work, Shen Kuo wrote other books as well. [...] In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the Xining Fengyuan Li ( [...] ; The Oblatory Epoch astronomical {{system of the}} Splendid Peace reign period), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song Dynasty bibliography. [...] This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court's official calendar system. [...] During his years of retirement from governmental service, Shen Kuo compiled a formulary known as the Liang Fang ( [...] ; Good medicinal formulas). Around the year 1126 it was combined with a similar collection by the famous Su Shi (1037–1101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo's faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court, yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates. Shen wrote the Mengqi Wanghuai Lu ( [...] ; Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook), which was also compiled during Shen's retirement. [...] This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China. [...] Only quotations of it survive in the Shuo Fu (...) collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions. [...] Shen Kuo also wrote the Changxing Ji ( [...] ; Collected Literary Works of [...] Changxing). [...] However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen. By the 15th century (during the Ming Dynasty), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained. [...] This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited. [...] Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former's Collection of Shen Kua's Extant Poetry (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958). In {{the tradition of the}} popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'), Shen Kuo also wrote the Register of What <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> <b>Forget,</b> a traveler's guide to what type of carriage is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.|$|E
