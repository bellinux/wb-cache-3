2500|$|Many {{types of}} battery have been commercialized and {{represent}} an important practical application of electrochemistry. Early wet cells powered the first telegraph and telephone systems, {{and were the}} source of current for electroplating. The zinc-manganese dioxide dry cell was the first portable, <b>non-spillable</b> <b>battery</b> type that made flashlights and other portable devices practical. [...] The mercury battery using zinc and mercuric oxide provided higher levels of power and capacity than the original dry cell for early electronic devices, but has been phased out of common use due to the danger of mercury pollution from discarded cells.|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{diagram of}} the new PIMR-EBS (PEBS) braking system and its main parts are {{described}} in the article. The PIMR automotive road unit tests range is described in the article. The tests were carried out {{within the framework of}} N R 10 - 0006 - 04 / 2008 R&D Project. The results of the bench tests for the road unit consisting of Mitsubishi L 200 research vehicle and the PIMR N 1 semi-trailer (GVWR 4. 3 t) are presented in the paper. The PEBS braking system is designed for interoperation with the semi-trailers / trailers fitted with the air cushion suspension system. A way of mounting an additional mechanical pneumatic valve, which makes it possible to use the PEBS braking system in the vehicles fitted with the suspension systems with the leaf springs or with the rubber torsion shafts, is presented in the paper. During servicing the PEBS braking systems mounted in PIMR road units, which is being continued in 2011, it was stated {{that it is necessary to}} replace: a) two gel <b>non-spillable</b> <b>batteries</b> with the traditional acid ones, and b) unreliable air compressors manufactured in Taiwan with Thomas compressors made in the USA. The new PEBS electro-pneumatic-hydraulic braking system stands a chance of being use...|$|R
