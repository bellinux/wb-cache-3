50|$|Keeping the {{research}} problem in mind, {{the behavior of}} elements {{in the system and}} their interactions are studied. Elements of a system can interact positively or negatively, that is, the level of an element may activate or reduce the rate of production of other elements or of itself. These interactions are represented as positive (activation) or <b>negative</b> (<b>inhibition).</b> When elements are connected in a topologically circular way, they exert an influence on their own rate of synthesis and they form a feedback loop. A feedback loop is positive or negative according to whether it contains an even or odd number of negative interactions. In a positive loop, each element of the system exerts a positive effect on its own rate of synthesis, whereas in a simple negative loop, each element has a negative effect on its own rate of synthesis. A simple positive feedback loop results in epigenetic regulation and have multiple steady states and a simple negative feedback loop results in homeostatic regulation.Abstraction: A chain of positive interactions is equivalent to a direct positive interaction between the two extreme elements, and any two negative interactions cancel out each other’s effect. In this way, any simple feedback loop can be abridged to a one-element loop, positive or negative according to the number of negative interactions (even or odd) in the original loop. Accordingly, through extensive literature survey and the application of the above mentioned rules, a BRN is abstracted.|$|E

We conducted a series of experiments in rats to examine the role of histamine within the HPA axis. We first determined if histamine undergoes diurnal variations in the paraventricular nucleus, the periventricular nucleus, and the ventro-medial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the frontal cortex, septal nucleus, median eminence, posterior hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, supraoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dentate gyrus, and the CA 1, CA 2, and CA 3 cell fields of the hippocampus. We further examined the effect of adrenalectomy and corticosterone replacement in these areas to determine if the histaminergic system is susceptible to glucocorticoid <b>negative</b> feedback <b>inhibition.</b> Finally, histamine levels in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the periventricular nucleus, the median eminence, the posterior hypothalamus, the mammillary bodies, the supraoptic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus were measured in rats that were either intact, adrenalectomized (ADX), or ADX and treated with corticosterone and were stressed for various periods of time. The results suggest that (1) histamine may mediate basal plasma levels of ACTH through the regulation of paraventricular hypothalamic activity, (2) the histaminergic system may not be susceptible to glucocorticoid <b>negative</b> feedback <b>inhibition</b> under normal, non-stress conditions, (3) histaminergic neurons stimulate the HPA axis but {{may not be able to}} maintain their activity for extended periods of time, and (4) glucocorticoid <b>negative</b> feedback <b>inhibition</b> can occur but may only be effective within a specific period after HPA activation due to stress...|$|R

Experiments in vitro by others suggested that fragments of a monomeric enzyme might be exploited for this purpose. We report here dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition</b> of bacterial cell growth by expression of fragments of a tRNA synthetase. Inhibition is fragment-specific, as not all fragments cause inhibition. An inhibitory fragment characterized in more detail forms a specific complex with the intact enzyme in vivo, leading to enzyme inactivation. This fragment also associated stoichiometrically with the full-length enzyme in vitro after denaturation and refolding, and the resulting complex was catalytically inactive. Inhibition therefore appears to arise from an interruption in the folding pathway of the wild-type enzyme, thus suggesting a new strategy to design dominant negative inhibitors of monomeric enzymes...|$|E
40|$|The latent {{membrane}} protein 1 (LMP 1) oncogene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is selectively {{expressed in the}} Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells of EBV-associated Hodgkin's disease (HD). However, no differences in clinical presentation and course are found between EBV positive and EBV negative forms of HD suggesting a common pathogenetic mechanism. We have studied the LMP 1 associated signaling pathways and their dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition</b> in the myelomonocytic HD-MyZ and the B-lymphoid L- 428 HD cell lines. In both EBV negative cell lines expression of LMP 1 {{is associated with the}} formation of multinuclear RS cells. Dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition</b> of NF-kappa B mediated signaling at the step of I kappa B-alpha phosphorylation results in increased cell death with only a few typical RS cells resistant to overexpression of the dominant negative inhibitor I kappa B-alpha-N delta 54. However, dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition</b> of NF-kappa B mediated signaling at the early step of TRAF 2 interaction results in the formation of multinuclear cells in both cell lines and, in addition, in clusters of small mononuclear cells in the HD-MyZ cell line. In HD-MyZ cells overexpression of the powerful JBD-inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway is restricted to small cells and never observed in RS cells. These small cells undergo apoptosis as shown by the TUNEL technique. Apoptosis of small cells is still observed after co-transfection of JBD and LMP 1 but in addition a few apoptotic HD-MyZ cells with large fused nuclear masses are identified suggesting that specific inhibition of JNK leads also to apoptosis of LMP 1 induced RS cells. Thus, activation of the JNK signaling pathway is also important in the formation of Reed-Sternberg cells. Our findings are consistent with a model where all three LMP 1 associated functions, i. e. NF-kappa B mediated transcription, TRAF 2 dependent signaling, and c-Jun activation act as a common pathogenetic denominator of both EBV negative and EBV positive HD...|$|E

Our objective is to identify a new class of lead compounds that mimic the dominant negative PrPC mutants, which inhibit an abnormal isoform (PrPSc) formation. A computational search was conducted on the Available Chemicals Directory for molecules that mimic both the spatial orientation and basic polymorphism of PrP residues 168, 172, 215, and 219, which confer dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition.</b> The search revealed 1, 000 potential candidates that were visually analyzed with respect to {{the structure of}} this four-residue epitope on PrPC. Sixty-three compounds were tested for inhibition of PrPSc formation in scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells (ScN 2 a). Two compounds, Cp- 60 (2 -amino- 6 -[(2 -aminophenyl) thio]- 4 -(2 -furyl) pyridine- 3, 5 -dicarbonitrile) and Cp- 62 (N′ 1 -({ 5 -[(4, 5 -dichloro- 1 H-imidazol- 1 -yl) methyl]- 2 -furyl}carbonyl) - 4 methoxybenzene- 1 -sulfonohydrazide), inhibited PrPSc formation in a dose-dependent manner and demonstrated low levels of toxicity. A substructure search of the Available Chemicals Directory based on Cp- 60 identified five related molecules, three of which exhibited activities comparable to Cp- 60.

40|$|Satellite myoblasts {{serve as}} stem cells in {{postnatal}} skeletal muscle, but the genes responsible for choosing between growth versus differentiation are largely undefined. We {{have used a}} novel genetic approach to identify genes encoding proteins whose dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition</b> is capable of interrupting the in vitro differentiation of C 2 C 12 murine satellite myoblasts. The screen is based on fusion of a library of cDNA fragments with the lysosomal protease cathepsin B (CB), such that the fusion protein intracellularly diverts interacting factors to the lysosome. Among other gene fragments selected in this screen, including those of known and novel sequence, is the retinoblastoma protein (RB) pocket domain. This unique dominant negative form of RB allows us to genetically determine if MyoD and RB associate in vivo. The dominant negative CB-RB fusion produces a cellular phenotype indistinguishable from recessive loss of function RB mutations. The fact that the dominant negative RB inhibits myogenic differentiation {{in the presence of}} nonlimiting concentrations of either RB or MyoD suggests that these two proteins do not directly interact. We further show that the dominant negative RB inhibits E 2 F 1 but cannot inhibit a forced E 2 F 1 -RB dimer. Therefore, E 2 F 1 is a potential mediator of the dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition</b> of MyoD by CB-RB during satellite cell differentiation.

HERV-K encodes a protein of the Rev/Rex family, cORF, that supports cellular transformation and binds the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein implicated in spermatogenesis. Rev/Rex function invariably depends on multimerization. Here we show that cORF likewise self-associates to form higher-order oligomers. Amino acids (aa) 47 – 87 in cORF are sufficient, aa 75 – 87 essential for self-association. Consistently, this domain is predicted to form a hydrophobic α-helix that may represent an oligomerization interface.

We investigated whether supplementation of nine apparently healthy vegans with 2. 01 g ALA (4 ml linseed oil), 1. 17 g gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) (6 ml borage oil) or their combination increases the LCP omega 3 contents of erythrocytes (RBC) and platelets (PLT), and of plasma phospholipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG). The supplements changed the dietary LA/ALA ratio (in g/g) from about 13. 7 (baseline) to 6. 8 (linseed oil), 14. 3 (borage oil) and 6. 4 (linseed + borage oil), respectively.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{stress response}} is an integrated physiological and psychological reaction to real or perceived adversity. Glucocorticoids {{are an important}} component of this response, acting to redistribute energy resources to both optimize survival in the face of challenge and to restore homeostasis after the immediate challenge has subsided. Release of glucocorticoids is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, driven by a neural signal originating in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Stress levels of glucocorticoids bind to glucocorticoid receptors in multiple body compartments, including the brain, and consequently have wide-reaching actions. For this reason, glucocorticoids serve a vital function in <b>negative</b> feedback <b>inhibition</b> of their own secretion. <b>Negative</b> feedback <b>inhibition</b> is mediated by a diverse collection of mechanisms, including fast, non-genomic feedback {{at the level of the}} PVN, stress-shut-off at the level of the limbic system, and attenuation of ascending excitatory input through destabilization of mRNAs encoding neuropeptide drivers of the HPA axis. In addition, there is evidence that glucocorticoids participate in stress activation via feed-forward mechanisms at the level of the amygdala. Feedback deficits are associated with numerous disease states, underscoring the necessity for adequate control of glucocorticoid homeostasis. Thus, rather than having a single, defined feedback &# 8216;switch&# 8217;, control of the stress response requires a wide-reaching feedback &# 8216;network&# 8217; that coordinates HPA activity to suit the overall needs of multiple body systems...|$|R

Several methods are available for the detection of Salmonella in produce, but their relative efficiency for detecting Salmonella in commonly consumed vegetables, often associated with outbreaks of food poisoning, needs to be confirmed. In this study, the effectiveness of three molecular methods for detection of Salmonella in six produce matrices was evaluated and compared to the FDA microbiological detection method. Samples of cilantro (coriander leaves), lettuce, parsley, spinach, tomato, and jalapeno pepper were inoculated with Salmonella serovars at two different levels (105 and < 101 CFU/ 25 g of produce). The inoculated produce was assayed by the FDA Salmonella culture method (Bacteriological Analytical Manual) and by three molecular methods: quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Comparable results were obtained by these four methods, which all detected as little as 2 CFU of Salmonella cells/ 25 g of produce. All control samples (not inoculated) were negative by the four methods. RT-qPCR detects only live Salmonella cells, obviating the danger of false-positive results from nonviable cells. False <b>negatives</b> (<b>inhibition</b> of either qPCR or RT-qPCR) were avoided by the use of either a DNA or an RNA amplification internal control (IAC).

To discriminate between these models, the authors measured levels of adrenocorticopic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol at baseline and in response to dexamethasone in medically healthy subjects with and without PTSID. Under conditions of enhanced <b>negative</b> feedback <b>inhibition,</b> ACTH levels would not be altered relative to cortisol levels, but the ACTH response to dexamethasone would be augmented, in concert with the enhanced cortisol response to dexamethasone. In contrast, under conditions of reduced adrenal output, ACTH levels would be expected to be higher at baseline relative to cortisol levels, but the ACTH response to dexamethasone would be unchanged in PTSID relative to healthy comparison subjects. Method: The ACTH and cortisol responses to 0. 50 mg of dexamethasone were assessed in 19 subjects (15 men and four women) with PTSID and 19 subjects (14 men and five women) without psychiatric disorder.

The disorder is characterized by elevated free thyroid hormone levels and partial resistance to thyroid hormone at the cellular level. Distinct single amino acid substitutions in the ligand binding domain of the beta form of the thyroid hormone receptor have been described in two kindreds with this disorder. We used transient expression assays to characterize the functional properties of these receptor mutants, one containing a Gly to Arg change at amino acid 340 (G 340 R) {{and the other a}} Pro to His change at amino acid 448 (P 448 H). A nine amino acid carboxy terminal deletion (delta 448 - 456), analogous to an alteration that occurs in v-erbA, was also studied for comparison with the mutations that occur in the T 3 resistance syndrome. None of the receptor mutants were able to mediate thyroid hormone dependent activation (TreTKCAT) or repression (TSH alpha CAT) of reporter genes when compared with the wild type receptor. In addition, the mutants inhibited the activity of normal alpha and beta receptor isoforms when examined in coexpression assays. This activity, referred to as dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition,</b> was manifest with respect to both the positively and negatively regulated reporter genes. Although mutant receptor binding to DNA was unaffected, ligand binding studies showed that the G 340 R and delta 448 - 456 mutants failed to bind T 3, whereas the P 448 H mutant bound hormone with reduced affinity (approximately 10 % of normal) compared to the wild type receptor. Consistent with this finding, the P 448 H mutant receptor was partially active at higher T 3 concentrations. Furthermore, the dominant <b>negative</b> <b>inhibition</b> elicited by the P 448 H receptor mutant at higher T 3 concentrations was reversed in the presence of high doses of T 3. These findings indicate that mutant beta receptors in patients with thyroid hormone resistance have reduced affinity for T 3 and are functionally deficient, but impair the activity of normal receptors, thereby providing a mechanism for the dominant mode of inheritance in this disorder...|$|E

40|$|Salmonella enterica {{contamination}} in foods {{is a significant}} concern for public health. When DNA detection methods are used for analysis of foods, {{one of the major}} concerns is false-positive results from the detection of dead cells. To circumvent this crucial issue, a TaqMan quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay with an RNA internal control was developed. invA RNA standards were used to determine the detection limit of this assay as well as to determine invA mRNA levels in mid-exponential-, late-exponential-, and stationary-phase cells. This assay has a detection limit of 40 copies of invA mRNA per reaction. The levels of invA mRNA in mid-exponential-, late-exponential-, and stationary-phase S. enterica cells was approximately 1 copy per 3 CFU, 1 copy per CFU, and 4 copies per 103 CFU, respectively. Spinach, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and serrano peppers were artificially contaminated with four different Salmonella serovars at levels of 105 and less than 10 CFU. These foods were analyzed with qRT-PCR and with the FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual Salmonella culture method (W. A. Andrews and T. S. Hammack, in G. J. Jackson et al., ed., Bacteriological analytical manual online, [URL] 2007). Comparable results were obtained by both methods. Only live Salmonella cells could be detected by this qRT-PCR assay, thus avoiding the dangers of false-positive results from nonviable cells. False <b>negatives</b> (<b>inhibition</b> of the PCR) were also ruled out through the use of an RNA internal control. This assay allows for the fast and accurate detection of viable Salmonella spp. in spinach, tomatoes, and in both jalapeno and serrano peppers...|$|R
40|$|In 2 experiments, {{possible}} {{adult age}} differences in negative priming were explored using several variants of the Stroop color-word task. Negative priming {{was at least}} as high in the older adults as in the younger adults in every variant. Negative priming varied {{as a function of}} condition, but the age equivalence was unaffected. This result was true even when the possibility of general slowing was taken into account. Across conditions, interference and negative priming were positively correlated. The results do not permit a clear choice between the 2 major theoretical explanations of <b>negative</b> priming, <b>inhibition</b> and memory retrieval; they do show that negative priming can be systematically manipulated within an experimental paradigm...|$|R
