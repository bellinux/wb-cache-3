5000|$|The {{elections}} were {{managed by the}} <b>National</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Board</b> of Ethiopia, {{also known as the}} NEBE, which maintains about 43,500 polling stations throughout its 547 constituencies. According to its official English website, [...] "The Board is accountable to the House of Peoples' Representatives and is an independent and autonomous organ for conducting elections having its own legal personality." [...] It consists of nine members nominated by the Prime Minister and appointed by the HPR, effectively allowing the ruling party to heavily control elections from a regulatory side, especially considering the 100% win of 2015 and the similar, though not 100% margins of earlier elections.|$|E
50|$|At the {{invitation}} of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the African Union Commission Chairperson, HE Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma deployed an African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) to the 24 May 2015 Parliamentary elections in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The Long-Term Observers (LTOs) deployed pre-election observed that the political climate was calm and stable during this period. However, there were some concerns about the Media law, the Anti-terrorism law, and the Civil Society Law which arguably limited the ability of citizens to participate in political activities The African Union observers {{also noted that the}} <b>National</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Board</b> of Ethiopia (NEBE) was adequality resourced to manage the elections. Although NEBE together with the Ethiopian Broadcasting Authority allocated 600 hours of free electronic media airtime and 700 columns in the state-owned print media for all political parties contesting, the African Union observers report that some political parties alleged that the media were unable to air their campaign messages in the original forms.|$|E
50|$|In the 1994 elections, {{international}} observers noted many {{irregularities in}} the voter lists, {{and the opposition}} PRD immediately charged the Central <b>Electoral</b> <b>Board</b> and the PRSC with fraud.

50|$|The {{opposition}} {{complained that}} the ruling EPRDF engaged in widespread vote rigging and intimidation, alleging fraud in 299 constituencies. The ruling party {{complained that the}} main opposition party CUD's AEUP sub party had engaged in intimidation. All allegations were investigated by the <b>National</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Board</b> of Ethiopia in cooperation with election monitors, a process which delayed {{the release of the}} final results. In June 2005, with the results of the election still unclear, a group of university students protested these alleged discrepancies, encouraged by supporters of the Coalition for Unity opposition party, despite a ban on protests imposed by the government. On June 8, 26 people were killed in Addis Ababa as a result of rioting, which led to the arrest of hundreds of protesters. On September 5, 2005, the National Elections Board of Ethiopia released the final election results, which confirmed that the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front retained its control of the government, but showed that opposition parties had increased their share of parliamentary seats, from 12 to 176. The Coalition for Unity and Democracy won all the seats in Addis Ababa, both for the Parliament and the City Council.|$|E
40|$|By {{the end of}} 2005 Prime Minister Meles Zenawi {{finds himself}} in several predicaments. Close to 150 000 Ethiopian solders are {{stationed}} at the tense ‘border’ with Eritrea, and the United Nations ’ Security Council is agonising to avert the resumption of the 1998 - 2000 war in which an estimated 70 000 people perished. Internally, the Prime Minister’s response to EPRDF’s election debacle has been desperate and diabolical. This has angered many people, including his allies in the West. Intergovernmental institutions and human rights organizations are appalled by the Prime Minister’s ‘intransigence ’ and ‘disproportionate ’ response. Donors have started to freeze much needed support. More recently, the European Parliament has opened a Pandora box in calling for “the immediate establishment of an independent international commission of inquiry, optimally under the UN responsibility, to investigate the human rights abuses and to identify and bring to justice those responsible. ” Notwithstanding Meles’s December 12, 2005 statement did not contain real political solutions. This paper contributes to the Ethiopian literature on institutions of accountability and proposes {{a plan for the}} resolution of the crisis. Using microeconomic and audit analytical frameworks, it examines the credibility of the election statistics issued by the <b>National</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Board</b> of Ethiopia (NEBE), based on which Prime Minister Meles’s “new government ” is seeking legitimacy. It concludes by proposing a two-stage peace plan. The plan has two essential components:- a negotiation framework and a methodology for an independent investigation into alleged human rights abuses and election fraud...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{long history}} of donor {{relationship}} with Ethiopia going hack at least to the early 1940 s. Since then, the number of bi- and multi-lateral donors providing assistance to the country has grown substantially. At present, the U. S., Japan and the Scandinavian countries are the major bilateral donors, while the World Bank, the EU and agencies in the UN system provide the bulk of the multilateral assistance. The international assistance that was offered to the country with the change of regime may be grouped into three categories: a) development assistance; b) humanitarian assistance; and c) assistance for democratization and good governance. Ethiopia has conducted a number of elections in the post-conflict period, the last one being in 2000. At present, the country is bracing itself for a third round of national elections in 2005. A comparison of election costs for selected African countries with Ethiopia shows that the cost of elections in Ethiopia has been quite low given the country's enormous size and its lack of experience in running democratic elections. Ethiopia has received considerable international electoral assistance since 1991 and such assistance has strengthened the capacity of the <b>National</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Board</b> and civil society and human rights organizations in monitoring and supervising elections. Donor assistance has also been provided to political parties to make the electoral process more competitive. However, the impact of such assistance in democratizing the election process has been limited because the ruling party has failed to broaden its political power base and provide a level playing field for all contestants. Human rights and advocacy organizations began to be established {{for the first time in}} the country following the fall of the Derg and the change of government. This has meant that the human rights record of the present government has been more systematically monitored and rights violations more extensively compiled than at any time in the past. Donor assistance to human rights has primarily been financial assistance to advocacy organizations on the one hand, and financial support as well as training and technical support to government institutions on the other. Assistance lias been provided for: a) preparatory work for setting up a government human right commission and ombudsman institution; b) reform of legal institutions, and training of law enforcement agencies; c) support to legislative bodies and training of legislators; d) financial support to civil society organizations active in monitoring human rights, human rights protection and advocacy. One of the first acts of the Transitional Government was to enact a press law, which turned out to have a dramatic impact on the country's media. At present, there are a large number of private papers published regularly. However, the free press is faced by a host of problems: structural, economic, and professional. International assistance to the media (both public as well as private) has been limited in scope, and relatively insignificant in terms of its impact. International donors have failed to make a strategic intervention in the media sector and have been limited to low level support with only limited results. Donor assistance to the democratization process in Ethiopia has been comparatively limited. In contrast, donors have invested heavily in the humanitarian and relief effort on the one hand, and in the socioeconomic development sectors on the other. Assistance to both sectors has been growing in the last ten years, and in particular assistance to the humanitarian sector has been increasing markedly in this period. On the other hand, financial support to civil society, especially local human rights and advocacy organizations, has been instrumental in enabling the growth of the voluntary sector in the country. Without such support, civil society would have faced serious difficulties, and its achievements, especially in the areas of human rights monitoring, training and advocacy, would have been more limited. On the other hand, the impact of international assistance on the democratization process in this country has been quite limited. The achievements registered to date in the areas of elections, human rights and press freedom have primarily been a product of local initiative, local organizations, and struggles by stakeholders...|$|E
