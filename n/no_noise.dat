5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing <b>no</b> <b>noise,</b> he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E

25|$|Sudden {{infant death}} {{syndrome}} (SIDS), also known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained {{death of a child}} less than one year of age. Diagnosis requires that the death remains unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. SIDS usually occurs during sleep. Typically death occurs between the hours of 00:00 and 09:00. There is usually no evidence of struggle and <b>no</b> <b>noise</b> produced.|$|E

500|$|Mastras had Jesse buy a Roomba {{because he}} {{believed}} it was appropriate for Jesse's frame of mind: [...] "You don't need it, it's kind of inane. ... He's just trying to fill his world with noise and with these things." [...] During the final shot of the episode, a steadicam shot filmed by Andrew Voegeli, Jesse turns his stereo system {{all the way up}} and leans directly against the pulsating speaker to try to shut out his pain. MacLaren wanted the speakers to pulse, but they could not actually play loud music without harming actor Aaron Paul. The special effects crew unsuccessfully tried several methods to make the speakers pulse, such as shaking them and pulling on strings, but they did not appear realistic. It was achieved after MacLaren visited a local stereo store and an employee provided her a bass tester which would run the stereo system with <b>no</b> <b>noise,</b> but cause the speakers to pulse as if music was playing. That employee was hired to come on the set and run the system, and the lights and pulsing were timed to match music which was later dubbed in.|$|E
500|$|Slow lorises have a round head, {{a narrow}} snout, large eyes, {{and a variety}} of {{distinctive}} coloration patterns that are species-dependent. Their arms and legs are nearly equal in length, and their trunk is long and flexible, allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. [...] Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. [...] The toxin is obtained by licking a gland on their arm, and the secretion is activated by mixing with saliva. Their toxic bite is a deterrent to predators, and the toxin is also applied to the fur during grooming as a form of protection for their infants. The secretion from the arm contains a chemical related to cat allergen, but may be augmented by secondary toxins from the diet in wild individuals. Slow lorises move slowly and deliberately, making little or <b>no</b> <b>noise,</b> and when threatened, they stop moving and remain motionless. Their only documented predators—apart from humans—include snakes, changeable hawk-eagles and orangutans, although cats, civets and sun bears are suspected. Little is known about their social structure, but they are known to communicate by scent marking. Males are highly territorial. Slow lorises reproduce slowly, and the infants are initially parked on branches or carried by either parent. They are omnivores, eating small animals, fruit, tree gum, and other vegetation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accident}} report said {{due to the}} damage to the aircraft upon impact with the ground, investigators were unable to conclude if any of the eight aboard used the oxygen system. However, the report stated [...] "The absence of a distress radio call, or an attempt to descend the aircraft, and the likelihood that the pilot did not don his oxygen mask, suggested that the pilot was unaware that the aircraft was unpressurised or depressurising." [...] The passengers, the report added, were also likely not wearing their oxygen masks, as there was <b>no</b> <b>noise</b> recorded on the ATC transmissions indicating they were attempting to assist the pilot.|$|E

The trains were designed by the Chubu HSST Development Corporation, which also operates a test track in Nagoya.|$|E
2500|$|Some purpose-designed {{insurgency}} {{weapons were}} designed for a dual use–that is for use by both insurgents and conventional soldiers. The Welrod pistol was a simple, bolt-action pistol developed by the SOE for use in World War II. It was designed [...] for supplying to foreign British-aligned insurgents and for use by covert British forces. The pistol was designed with an integral sound suppressor, and was ideal for killing sentries and other covert work; the bolt-operated action meant that cocking the gun produced almost <b>no</b> <b>noise,</b> and the bulky but efficient suppressor eliminated {{nearly all of the}} muzzle blast. Welrod pistols included a magazine that doubled as a hand-grip, and were originally produced with no markings save a serial number.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experience}} of driving an EV1 was unlike a conventional gasoline or diesel vehicle. The EV1's [...] {{was the lowest}} of any production automobile in history, while typical contemporary production cars had a drag coefficient in the range [...] The EV1's clean shape meant it produced less wind noise at highway speeds, providing a more comfortable driving experience for its occupants. At lower speeds, and when stationary, the car produced little to <b>no</b> <b>noise</b> at all, save for a slight whine from the single-speed gear reduction unit. The car's smooth shape, waterfall tail and rear fender skirts gave it a distinctive appearance. The EV1 had no analog dials, and all instrumentation readouts were displayed in a single thin curved strip mounted high on the dashboard, just underneath the windshield.|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre, {{believing that}} the gang {{intended}} to shoot the whole party, fled on Kennedy's horse. Several shots were fired at McIntyre as he dashed down the creek but none reached him, the rifles apparently being empty by that stage and only the revolvers available. Ned later wrote that he never intended to kill M'Intyre [...] "as I {{did not like to}} shoot him after he had surrendered". McIntyre galloped through the scrub for two miles, and then his horse, evidently wounded, became exhausted. Suffering from a severe fall during his escape and with his clothes in tatters, McIntyre concealed himself in a wombat hole until dark. At dark, he walked for an hour with his boots off to make <b>no</b> <b>noise</b> before collapsing from exhaustion. After a rest, and using a bright star and a small compass, he travelled about 20 miles until he reached a farm outside Mansfield, on Sunday afternoon. He then travelled by buggy to a police camp at the township, where he reported to Sub-Inspector Pewtress.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Rothe {{had been}} {{across the street}} {{attending}} a meeting with Warden Powell and some architects who were designing the new facility Powell wanted to build. [...] Rothe returned to his desk inside the prison at {{a few minutes before}} 4:00, oblivious to the inmate takeover. [...] To this point, there had been almost <b>no</b> <b>noise,</b> few scuffles, and no casualties. [...] He chatted with a guard for a few minutes before sitting behind his desk, which was in view of the door where inmates came to receive their medication. [...] Myles, Smart, and a third inmate named Toms came up to the door, where Myles asked to receive some pills for his migraines. [...] The guard on duty, Officer Cox, turned to retrieve them as another guard opened the door to let a third guard out. [...] As soon as the door opened, Myles rushed through, brandishing a meat cleaver he had acquired from the kitchens. [...] Toms threatened the other guards with a knife, and they allowed themselves to be herded into a nearby lavatory. [...] Myles burst into Deputy Warden Rothe's office and attacked Rothe with the cleaver. [...] Rothe deflected the blow with a plywood letterbox.|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{contract}} is terminated, every breach of a substantially performed contract {{gives rise to the}} right to a remedy. A court's power to award remedies is the final sanction against non-performance and, unless the defendant is insolvent, the objective is to achieve full compensation for the innocent party as if the contract were performed. This measure of the remedy to protect [...] "expectations" [...] forms a principal distinction between contracts as obligations from torts or unjust enrichment. In cases where performance is defective, the courts generally award money for the cost of curing the defect, unless the sum would be disproportionate and another sum would adequately achieve the same compensatory objective. In Ruxley Electronics Ltd v Forsyth although a £17,797 swimming pool was built 18inches too shallow, the land's market value was exactly the same. The House of Lords' solution, rather than awarding the cost of rebuilding it at £21,560 and rather than reject any award at all, was to reflect the forgone [...] "consumer surplus" [...] or the [...] "loss of amenity" [...] with an award of £2,500. Greater recognition of benefits in contracts other than purely financial ones has also been seen in cases concerning contracts where pleasure, enjoyment, relaxation or the avoidance of stress are construed as being [...] "important terms". In Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd Lord Denning MR held that a council worker could get not just his money back, but also a small sum to reflect his disappointment after his dream-holiday to the Swiss Alps, contrary to the promises in Swan Tours' travel brochure, proved a boring disaster, complete with sub-standard yodelling. And in Farley v Skinner the House of Lords held that a homebuyer close to Gatwick airport could recover money for lack of peaceful enjoyment, and the disruption of what would otherwise be his [...] "quiet contemplative breakfast" [...] from the house surveyor who assured there would be <b>no</b> <b>noise.</b> The market value of the property was unchanged, but ensuring peace and quiet had been an important term in their agreement. The courts have, however, remained reluctant to allow recovery for disappointment over any breach of contract, particularly in employment where a flood of people might claim damages for stress and upset after a wrongful dismissal.|$|E
