5|$|After {{the second}} year, {{as the child}} begins to see the {{caregiver}} as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed. Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly. For example, whereas babies cry because of pain, two-year-olds cry to summon their caregiver, and if that does <b>not</b> <b>work,</b> cry louder, shout, or follow.|$|E

5|$|Although Jardine was a {{qualified}} solicitor he did <b>not</b> <b>work</b> much in law, choosing instead to devote {{most of his}} working life to banking and, later on, journalism.

While on a business trip in 1957, he became ill with what proved to be lung cancer and died, aged 57, in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Among more {{negative}} reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several jokes in the episode did <b>not</b> <b>work,</b> {{such as the}} reveal that Krusty the Clown has been sleeping with Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy {{most of the other}} jokes and applauded the development of Nelson's character.|$|E

5|$|Beginning around 1890, Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} from angina. While this ailment initially wore him down gradually, the stresses concurrent with the 1905 Revolution {{and its aftermath}} greatly accelerated its progress. After December 1907, his illness became severe, and he could <b>not</b> <b>work.</b> In 1908 he died at his Lubensk estate near Luga (modern day Plyussky District of Pskov Oblast), and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg, next to Borodin, Glinka, Mussorgsky and Stasov.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would <b>not</b> <b>work</b> for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E

5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began. Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, and they did <b>not</b> <b>work</b> closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that}} the impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, because the next pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may <b>not</b> <b>work</b> if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did <b>not</b> <b>work</b> regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
