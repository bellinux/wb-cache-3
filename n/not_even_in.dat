5|$|The Morris Academy is {{entitled}} {{to be called a}} pioneer institution because of its 'open door' policy in coeducation. It was not the first in the United States, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Connecticut, but none of the other early academies opened their doors as wide and kept them open as long. No other coeducational academy spread its influence so far.|$|E
5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of the}} King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth {{to the top of the}} wig, representing the coif.|$|E

25|$|The town of Chatham {{is famous}} {{historically}} for the Royal Dockyard {{but it is}} not known if there was any connection between the dockyard and the cricket club. The Chatham Club ultimately folded and there is no real modern equivalent, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Kent league cricket. There are some local cricket clubs, such as Lordswood CC and Sherwood CC.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{the vacuum}} of one {{observer}} is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> {{the space of}} quantum states of the other. In technical terms, this comes about because the two vacua lead to unitarily inequivalent representations of the quantum field canonical commutation relations. This is because two mutually accelerating observers {{may not be able}} to find a globally defined coordinate transformation relating their coordinate choices.|$|E

In Latin texts, on the other hand, Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII (161–215). Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.|$|E
25|$|Bat Masterson {{became more}} widely {{known as a}} gunfighter {{as a result of}} a {{practical}} joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter asked Dr. W.S. Cockrell about mankillers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby and said it was Bat and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Bat's exploits, and the reporter wrote them up for the New York Sun. The story was then widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Bat, who insisted he was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Gunnison at the time.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{between the}} Fabre and Olympio factions of the UFC {{remained}} evident after the election. UFC militants, allegedly acting on instructions from Fabre and other UFC leaders, threw stones at a motorcade carrying Olympio to a protest in mid-April 2010, and Olympio, protected by security forces, then returned home. Some {{of those involved}} {{said that they had}} thrown stones because Jean-Claude Homawoothe CENI representative who had, in the eyes of Fabre supporters, demonstrated disloyalty during the run-up to the electionwas present in the motorcade, but Homawoo said that he was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Togo at the time. Later in the month, Olympio reiterated his support for Fabre's candidacy.|$|E

25|$|The Great Assembly {{that was}} held between January and August, 1651, {{addressed}} {{a number of important}} issues. The first one was that of the stadholderate. Friesland and Groningen led the opposition to Holland, arguing that the Union of Utrecht required the appointment of provincial stadtholders by implication, as the articles 9 and 21 of the treaty stipulated mediation by stadtholders in case of conflicts between provinces. In their interpretation the office of stadtholder thereby acquired a federal aspect. But the other provinces were not convinced. They decided to leave the office vacant indefinitely. It should be noted, however, that the office was not abolished, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Holland and Zeeland.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{extraordinary}} claim by the VVS’s Il-2s is that, {{over a period of}} four hours, they destroyed 240 tanks and in the process virtually wiped out the 17th Panzer Division. On 1 July, the 17th Panzer Division had only one tank battalion (the II./Pz Rgt 39), with 67 tanks, 173 less than claimed destroyed by the VVS. The 17th Panzer Division was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> the main attack sector, but further south with the 1st Panzer Army's 24th Panzer Corps. The 17th Panzer did not register any abnormal losses due to aircraft in the summer of 1943, and retreated westwards with Army Group South later in the year, still intact.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{as to whether}} or not a village and bridge existed at the time of the battle. One theory holds that there was no village at Stamford Bridge in 1066 and <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> 1086 when the Domesday Book was compiled. According to this theory, the name is locative and descriptive of crossing points over the River Derwent being derived from a combination of the words stone, ford and bridge i.e. stoneford and bridge. At the location of the present village, within the river bed, there is an outcrop of stone over which the river once flowed as a mini-waterfall. At low water levels one could easily cross over the river at this point, either on foot or horseback.|$|E

25|$|Hopper was {{reported}} to have an uncredited role in Johnny Guitar in 1954 but he has stated that he was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood when this film was made. Hopper made his debut on film in two roles with James Dean (whom he admired immensely) in Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956). Dean's death in a 1955 car accident affected the young Hopper deeply and it was shortly afterwards that he got into a confrontation with veteran director Henry Hathaway on the film From Hell to Texas. Hopper forced Hathaway to shoot more than 80 takes of a scene over several days before he acquiesced to Hathaway's direction. After filming was finally completed, Hathaway allegedly told Hopper that his career in Hollywood was finished.|$|E
25|$|In January 1936, Echols telephoned Howard Hughes {{to say the}} Air Corps was {{interested}} in purchasing the record-breaking Hughes H-1 Racer as a pursuit plane—it was faster than anything they had. Hughes agreed to fly the aircraft to Wright Field for a demonstration, but he {{failed to show up}} for the appointment that Echols had set up with higher Air Corps brass. After that snub, Echols never again gave Hughes a chance to bid on Air Corps projects, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> October 1941 when Hughes offered the twin-boom D-2 fighter-bomber design. Echols allowed Wright Field engineers to examine the D-2 but they concluded that it would be too heavy for its own engines after incorporating required military features such as armor plate, a bullet-resistant windshield and stronger landing gear.|$|E
25|$|The Hindu, another widely {{circulated}} {{newspaper in}} India, claimed the opposition's {{call for a}} nationwide shutdown on 1 December 2011, in protest of retail reform received a mixed response. Some states had strong support, while most did <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> states where opposition political parties are in power, many ignored the call for the shutdown. In Gujarat, Bihar, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Assam the call evoked a partial response. While a number of wholesale markets observed the shutdown, the newspaper claimed a majority of kirana stores and neighborhood small shops – for whom apparently the trade bandh had been called – remained open, ignoring the shutdown call. Conflicting claims {{were made by the}} organisers of the nationwide shutdown. Contrary to eyewitness reports, one Trader union's secretary general claimed traders across the country participated wholeheartedly in the strike.|$|E

25|$|The savage, like ourselves, {{feels the}} oppression of his {{impotence}} before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he respects more than Power, {{he is willing to}} prostrate himself before his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship. Pathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture, of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating the jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when what is most precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be appeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch — as such creeds may be generically called — is in essence the cringing submission of the slave, who dare <b>not,</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> his heart, allow the thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal Orsini {{attended}} the first Conclave of 1268-1271, {{and was one}} of the cardinals who signed the letter of complaint against the authorities and people of Viterbo for their treatment of the cardinals and the Curia. He was one of the six cardinals who were chosen by the rest of the Sacred College on September 1, 1271, to select a compromise candidate for election as pope. He was therefore instrumental in bringing to the papal throne the Archdeacon of Liège, Teobaldo Visconti, who was not a cardinal, and who was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> Italy, but in the Holy Land on crusade. He traveled with the Curia to France in 1273, and was present at the Ecumenical Council of Lyons. He was not one of the cardinals in the suite of Pope Gregory X when he left Lyons in 1275 to return to Rome, nor was he at Arezzo where the Pope died on 10 January 1276, before reaching the City. He did not attend the first conclave which began on 20 January 1276, and concluded the next day with the election of Peter of Tarantaise, who became Pope Innocent V. Pope Innocent V (Peter of Tarantaise) died in Rome at the Lateran, on 22 June 22, 1276.|$|E
25|$|Edmund Tilney lived a {{life which}} was spent in {{balancing}} one controversy against another. On the one hand he had the Lord Treasurer to contend with, {{and on the other}} there was the Lord Chamberlain from whom he took direct orders. Following his appointment as the Master, he grew increasingly popular and married Dame Mary Braye in 1583. She was the fourth wife of Sir Edmund Braye. There are no other details about whether they had any children or <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> his will written in 1610, {{there is no mention of}} either his wife or any issue. He spent the latter part of his life fighting various lawsuits and claims over property and debt. Towards the end, his financial circumstances had become severely strained. He lost a few properties through lawsuits as well. In his will he wished to be buried near his father without much pomp and ceremony. He bequeathed money to a few poor parishes, some servants and to his cousin Thomas Tilney. He lived in the town of Leatherhead, Surrey, in the building known as the Mansion House. In the 1990s, a new Wetherspoons in the Leatherhead High Street was named after him. He is buried in St. Leonard's Church, Streatham, London. A monument was erected in his memory.|$|E
