40|$|Context Organ {{failure is}} a major {{determinant}} of mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. These patients usually requireadmission to high dependency or intensive care units and consume considerable health care resources. Given a low incidence rate of organ failure and a lack of large <b>non-interventional</b> <b>studies</b> in the field of acute pancreatitis, the characteristics of organ failure that influence outcomes of patients with acute pancreatitis remain largely unknown. Therefore, the Pancreatitis Across Nations Clinical Research and Education Alliance (PANCREA) aims to conduct a meta-analysis of individual patient data from prospective <b>non-interventional</b> <b>studies</b> to determine the influence of timing, duration, sequence, and combination of different organ failures on mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. Methods Pancreatologists currently active with acute pancreatitis clinical research will be invited to contribute. To be eligible for inclusion patients will have to meet the criteria of acute pancreatitis, develop at least one organ failure {{during the first week of}} hospitalization, and not be enrolled into an intervention study. Raw data will then be collated and checked. Individual patient data analysis based on a logistic regression model with adjustment for confounding variables will be done. For all analyses, corresponding 95 % confidence intervals and P values will be reported. Conclusion This collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis will answer important clinical questions regarding patients with acute pancreatitis that develop organ failure. Information derived from this study will be used to optimize routine clinical management and improve care strategies. It can also help validate outcome definitions, allow comparability of results and form a more accurate basis for patient allocation in further clinical studies...|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In 2004, circulating tumor cells (CTC) enumeration by the CellSearch ® technique at baseline and during treatment {{was reported to}} be associated with prognosis in metastatic breast cancer patients. In 2008, the first evidence of the impact of CTC detection by this technique on survival of cM 0 (i+) patients were reported. These findings were confirmed by other <b>non-interventional</b> <b>studies,</b> whereas CTC were also in-vestigated as a surrogate for tumor biology, mainly for HER 2 expression/amplification. The aim of this report is to present the current prospective large interventional studies that have been specifically designed to demonstrate that CTC enumera-tion/characterization may improve the management of breast cancer patients: STIC CTC METABREAST (France) and Endocrine Therapy Index (USA) assess the CTC-guide...|$|R

40|$|AIM To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value (sensitivity, specificity) of positron emission mammography (PEM) {{in a single}} site <b>non-interventional</b> <b>study</b> using the maximum PEM uptake value (PUVmax). PATIENTS, METHODS In a singlesite, <b>non-interventional</b> <b>study,</b> 108 patients (107 women, 1 man) {{with a total of}} 151 suspected lesions were scanned with a PEM Flex Solo II (Naviscan) at 90 min p. i. with 3. 5 MBq 18 F-FDG per kg of body weight. In this ROI(region of interest) -based analysis, maximum PEM uptake value (PUV) was determined in lesions, tumours (PUVmaxtumour), benign lesions (PUVmaxnormal breast) and also in healthy tissues on the contralateral side (PUVmaxcontralateral breast). These values were compared and contrasted. In addition, the ratios of PUVmaxtumour[*]/[*]PUVmaxcontralateral breast and PUVmaxnormal breast[*]/[*]PUVmaxcontralateral breast were compared. The image data were interpreted independently by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians and compared with histology in cases of suspected carcinoma.

40|$|Background: Lower {{urinary tract}} {{symptoms}} (LUTSs) may develop in men {{with prostate cancer}} (PCa) and can impact quality of life (QoL). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists as androgen deprivation therapy are standard treatment for PCa, however, data are limited on their effects on LUTSs. A grouped analysis of national observational, <b>non-interventional</b> <b>studies</b> initiated in clinical practice was performed to assess the effectiveness of triptorelin in reducing moderate or severe LUTSs, measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in men with advanced or metastatic PCa. Methods: Men with PCa and LUTSs scheduled to receive triptorelin (3 -month or 1 -month extended release formulation) were recruited into prospective, <b>non-interventional</b> <b>studies</b> at centres in Algeria, Australia, Belgium, China, Hungary, Romania and South Korea. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the proportion of patients with moderate or severe LUTSs, assessed by IPSS, after 48 weeks. Secondary endpoints included: total IPSS, QoL due to urinary symptoms (IPSS Question 8) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at 24 and 48 weeks. Results: A total of 2701 patients were recruited; 1851 patients with moderate or severe LUTSs at baseline (IPSS > 7), received triptorelin and had follow-up IPSS (efficacy population). The proportion of patients with moderate or severe LUTSs was reduced to 67. 2 % from baseline at week 48, following a reduction to 75. 9 % at week 24 : the overall time effect was significant (p < 0. 001). QoL due to urinary symptoms significantly improved from a mean score of 3. 7 at baseline, to adjusted means of 2. 5 and 2. 1, at weeks 24 and 48, respectively (p < 0. 001 versus baseline). Mean PSA levels were reduced from 158. 8 ng/ml at baseline to 11. 5 and 16. 0 ng/ml at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. Conclusions: Within the limitations of these observational studies, improvements in LUTSs and QoL observed after 24 weeks and maintained at 48 weeks indicate that triptorelin-induced effects improve LUTSs in patients with advanced PCa.
