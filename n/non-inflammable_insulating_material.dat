Natural fibre based thermal <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> {{belong to}} {{progressive}} building materials representing {{one of the}} possible ways in sustainable development and which are characterised with low carbon trace and low value of primary bound energy. In case of industrially produced <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> (for instance using thermal connection method) the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> based on natural fibres showed comparable properties with industrially produced <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> on building markets. In the view of thermal insulating properties the natural <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> show slightly different behavior in comparison with synthetic <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> which is caused by fibrous structure of <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> and low thermal conductivity of natural fibres (contrary to glass or mineral fibres).

40|$|Abstract: The {{refrigeration}} is {{the process}} of removal of heat from the system under controlled conditions. <b>Insulating</b> <b>material</b> is the one of the main sub systems. The primary function of thermal <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> used in domestic refrigerator is to reduce the transfer of heat through the walls, pipes of the system. Hence the efficiency of the system is depends upon the on the <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> in the refrigerator. So the selection of proper <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> for the refrigerator system is therefore significant factors in order to improve the performance of the system.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the conditions under}} which we can obtain reasonable qualitative results in scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis of trace elements in <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> using a diluted ionic liquid (EMI-CH 3 COO) and changing probe current. Below 100 nA, electrical charging of <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> was prevented. The probe current of 10 nA was suitable for qualitative analysis because the intensities of peaks from these materials were strong enough to detect trace elements at the concentration of 0. 1 wt. % in the sample without interference by sum peaks. Diluted EMI-CH 3 COO can also be used for SEM-EDX quantitative analysis of <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> as discharging agents. In contrast, when <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> were electrically charged, the obtained spectra contained characteristic X-rays of the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> with low energies and of materials other than the samples such as the sample stage and the collimator in the X-ray detector. This is because electrons from the electron beam were decelerated by and deflected from the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials.</b> By coating the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> with the diluted EMI-CH 3 COO, the deceleration and deflection of the electron beam were prevented...|$|R

The specimens were tested under different electrical stress levels varying from 50 kV/mm to 130 kV/mm. Testing voltage was constantly applied to the specimen until breakdown.
