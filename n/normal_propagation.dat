50|$|Spatial {{buffering}} is {{a mechanism}} for the regulation of extracellular potassium concentration by astrocytes. Other mechanisms for astrocytic potassium clearance are carrier-operated or channel-operated potassium chloride uptake.The repolarization of neurons tends to raise potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid. If a significant rise occurs, it will interfere with neuronal signaling by depolarizing neurons. Astrocytes have large numbers of potassium ion channels facilitating removal of potassium ions from the extracellular fluid. They are taken up at one region of the astrocyte and then distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, and further to its neighbors via gap junctions. This keeps extracellular potassium at levels that prevent interference with <b>normal</b> <b>propagation</b> of an action potential.|$|E
50|$|Neural {{backpropagation}} is {{the phenomenon}} {{in which the}} action potential of a neuron creates a voltage spike both {{at the end of}} the axon (<b>normal</b> <b>propagation)</b> and back through to the dendritic arbor or dendrites, from which much of the original input current originated. It has been shown that this simple process can be used in a manner similar to the backpropagation algorithm used in multilayer perceptrons, a type of artificial neural network. In addition to active backpropagation of the action potential, there is also passive electrotonic spread. While there is ample evidence to prove the existence of backpropagating action potentials, the function of such action potentials and the extent to which they invade the most distal dendrites remains highly controversial.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of superconducting magnets {{has a high}} priority for particle accelerators, since the operational time and operational collision energy depend strongly on it. Local heat dissipation due to beam loss and conductor movement is inevitable, causing local hot spots in the conductor, possibly leading to magnet quench. For stability against local and transient energy deposition, the cable is the most important unit to investigate. Most superconducting accelerator magnets are wound from Rutherford cables with a flat cable layout, consisting of twisted strands. The mechanisms of <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation</b> in Rutherford cables have been described in detail with experimental and modeling data. The onset of a local normal zone forces current to redistribute in adjacent neighboring superconducting strands, reducing the longitudinal <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation.</b> Transversal <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation</b> in adjacent and crossing strands is caused by the redistribution of current and by heat exchange. The mechanism of <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation</b> depends on thermodynamics and electrodynamics. For the first time the criteria for the minimum quench energy of superconducting cables is described in detail. The Minimum Quench Energy is investigated for a large range of heat deposition volumes and the for the existing LHC dipole magnets and for the future SIS 300 quadrupole magnets. Possible enhancements that improve the level of stability located at the thin edge, which has the lowest minimum quench energy, are examined by calculations and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of high-current superconductors is challenging {{in the design}} of superconducting magnets. When the stability requirements are fulfilled, the protection against a quench must still be considered. A main factor {{in the design of}} quench protection systems is the resistance growth rate in the magnet following a quench. The usual method for determining the resistance growth in impregnated coils is to calculate the longitudinal velocity with which the normal zone propagates in the conductor along the coil windings. Here, we present a 2 D numerical model for predicting the <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation</b> velocity in Al stabilized Rutherford NbTi cables with large cross section. By solving two coupled differential equations under adiabatic conditions, the model takes into account the thermal diffusion and the current redistribution process following a quench. Both the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the superconductor and the metal cladding materials properties are included. Unlike common <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation</b> analyses, we study the influence of the thickness of the cladding on the propagation velocity for varying operating current and magnetic field. To assist in the comprehension of the numerical results, we also introduce an analytical formula for the longitudinal <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation.</b> The analysis distinguishes between low-current and high-current regimes of <b>normal</b> zone <b>propagation,</b> depending on the ratio between the characteristic times of thermal and magnetic diffusion.

The key idea behind this approach {{is to use a}} specific geometry of the silver thermal stabilizer that surrounds the superconducting tape. More specifically, a very thin layer of silver stabilizer is deposited on top of the superconductor layer, typically less than 100 nm, while the remaining stabilizer (still silver) is deposited on the substrate side. <b>Normal</b> zone <b>propagation</b> velocities up to 170 cm/s have been measured experimentally, corresponding to a stabilizer thickness of 20 nm on top of the superconductor layer.
