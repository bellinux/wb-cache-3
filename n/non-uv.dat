First CE-C 4 D was successfully applied to the direct enantiomeric separation of five basic drugs and nine amino acids. Derivatization of the compounds or {{the addition of a}} visualization agent as for indirect optical detection schemes was not needed. Non-charged chiral selectors were employed, hydroxypropylated cyclodextrin (CD) for the more lipophilic basic drugs and 18 -crown- 6 -tetracarboxylic acid (18 C 6 H 4) for the amino acids. Concurrent chiral separation of UV and <b>non-UV</b> active amino acids has been realized. Secondly, CE-C 4 D was used for the determination of different organic amines. Direct enantiomeric separation of 1 -phenylethylamine and 1 -cyclohexylethylamine was obtained with unprecedented high resolution by using a combination of dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and the chiral crown ether 18 C 6 H 4 as selectors. Then the enantiomeric separation of various amines was investigated, the use of contactless conductivity detection for the determination of different species in capillary electrophoresis was successfully demonstrated. The species tested included short chained aliphatic primary, secondary and tertiary amines, branched alipahtic amines, diamines, hydroxyl-substituted amines as well as species incorporating aromatic and non-aromatic cyclic moieties. The determination of the enantiomers of these amines which otherwise can only be achieved with difficulty was possible by using a combination of dimethyl-beta-CD and the chiral crown ether (+) -(18 -crown- 6) - 2, 3, 11, 12 -tetracarboxylic acid (18 C 6 H 4) as selectors. Thirdly the CE-C 4 D has also successfully been explored in the separation of diastereomers and enantiomers of various dipeptides, tripeptides and tetrapeptides composed of <b>non-UV</b> active amino acids. These peptides are essential compounds in biological systems as well as important chiral building blocks in pharmaceutical drugs. At last, the determination of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) with CE-C 4 D, which is a recently introduced party drug and difficult to be analyzed by on-site screening, was developed.

Through evolution flowers have adapted their colours to the visual system of the pollinator (CHITTKA et al. 1996). In our project we investigated this interaction in Costa Rica, Regio Golfo Dulce. We used photospectrometry to obtain the spectral reflectance pattern of the flowers. The results of the analysis clearly show that red <b>non-UV</b> reflecting flowers are pollinated almost exclusively by hummingbirds; flowers pollinated by hymenoptera or butterflies showed a variety of colours.

UV-induced changes in survival, autoantibody production, splenic B-cell activity, and target organ pathology were examined. After an acute UV exposure there were (10 / 15) deaths in the UV BXSB males and 4 / 15 in the UV BXSB females, compared to 1 / 15 in the <b>non-UV</b> BXSB male group and (0 / 15 in the <b>non-UV</b> BXSB females.

Equivalent doses of Mylar-filtered FS 40 UV (UVB deleted) resulted in no deaths in the UV BXSB male group. Acute and chronic UV also resulted in a significant increase in serum single-stranded DNA antibody production, splenic poly-clonal B-cell activity, and renal glomerular inflammatory changes in the UV BXSB male mice.

Crab spiders (Thomisidae) hunt mostly on flowers and need to find appropriate hunting sites. Previous studies have shown that some crab spiders that reflect UV light use UV contrast to enhance prey capture. The high UV contrast can be obtained either by modulation of body colouration or active selection of appropriate backgrounds for foraging. We show that crab spiders (Thomisus sp.) hunting on Spathiphyllum plants use chromatic contrast, especially UV contrast, to make themselves attractive to hymenopteran prey. Apart from that, they are able to achieve high UV contrast by active selection of <b>non-UV</b> reflecting surfaces when given a choice of UV-reflecting and <b>non-UV</b> reflecting surfaces in the absence of odour cues. Honeybees (Apis cerana) approached Spathiphyllum plants bearing crab spiders on which the spiders were high UV-contrast targets with greater frequency than those plants on which the UV-contrast of the spiders was low.

The values of peel adhesion and probe tack of the P(2 EHA-AA) / UAO blends were dramatically reduced by UV irradiation.

The mechanism of reduced PSA properties was investigated via dynamic mechanical properties, DSC, and dynamic contact angle DCA. Peel adhesion decreased monotonically with an increase of storage moduli E ' and loss moduli E " for all <b>non-UV</b> and UV cured blends. Since moduli values and glass transition temperatures Tg of these blends after UV irradiation were {{higher than those of}} these blends before UV irradiation, we judged that reduced peel adhesion and probe tack values were caused by the moduli increase and the Tg increase due to UV irradiation. In other words, the deformation energy of UV cured blends when conducting adhesive tests was reduced by the curing process.

We investigated the effect of <b>non-UV</b> light {{on the degradation of}} eight CPPs (chlorotoluron, prometryn, cinosulfuron, imidacloprid, lufenuron, propiconazole, fludioxonil, and benzovindiflupyr) by addition of <b>non-UV</b> light to standard OECD 307 guidelines. Time taken for 50 % degradation of benzovindiflupyr was halved from 373 to 183 days with the inclusion of light. Similarly, time taken for 90 % degradation of chlorotoluron decreased from 79 to 35 days under light conditions. Significant reductions in extractable parent compound occurred under light conditions for prometryn (4 %), imidacloprid (8 %), and fludioxonil (24 %) compared to dark controls. However, a significantly slower rate of cinosulfuron (14 %) transformation was observed under light compared to dark conditions. Under light conditions, nonextractable residues were significantly higher for seven of the CPPs. Soil biological and chemical analyses suggest that light stimulates phototroph growth, which may directly and/or indirectly impact CPP degradation rates.

The stained cells were observed using an epifluorescent microscope and photographed with a CCD camera under UV. Metal-doped TiO 2 coatings on Al plates were prepared and tested for <b>non-UV</b> germicidal activity without using UV.

Compromised cells are cells that grow very slowly after reculturing indicating a degree of reversible cell damage. Screening the germicidal activity using this staining method is accurate and efficient, and requires less time than the culture-based method.

40|$|International audienceFor many {{industrial}} applications, {{the combination}} of two different monomers in statistical or diblock copolymers enhances {{the properties of the}} corresponding polymer. However, during the polymerization reaction, homopolymers might be formed and can influence the properties for the applications. Consequently, the separation and the quantification of the homopolymers contained in copolymer samples are crucial. In addition, the charge density distribution of the statistical copolymer is an important characteristic for the applications. The purpose of this work was to study the characterization of a statistical copolymer of acrylic acid (AA) and diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC) by capillary electrophoresis (CE) in acidic conditions (cationic copolymers). For that purpose, a free solution electrophoretic separation was carried out according to the charge rate (chemical composition) independently of the molar mass. The second objective was to compare contactless conductivity detection and indirect UV absorbance modes for the quantification of DADMAC homopolymers present in copolymer samples. Different coated capillaries based on neutral or positively charged modification were also compared. The comparison of indirect absorbance UV and contactless conductimetric detection demonstrated that both detection modes can be used for a complete CE characterization of <b>non-UV</b> absorbing PAA-DADMAC copolymers...|$|E
40|$|Skin cancers {{including}} melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers are a high-cost {{and largely}} preventable form of cancer. While limiting exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) light via outdoor activities is {{a focus of}} public health efforts, indoor UV exposure via solaria or ‘tanning booths’ has also become a cause for concern. In recent decades the availability of less harmful <b>non-UV</b> self-tanning products such as sprays and lotions has increased. This review explores (i) the available data regarding the prevalence and behavioural factors associated with use of solaria and self-tanning products and (ii) data that may {{shed light on the}} likelihood of solaria users substituting self-tanning products as a less harmful alternative to solaria exposure. While there are insufficient data on which to draw a firm conclusion about the potential for substitution, it appears unlikely that most solaria users would readily substitute self-tanning products in place of solaria exposure. Public health advocates may need to consider whether a robust research study of the cost-effectiveness of encouraging substitutional use of self-tanners is desirable, or whether efforts to severely restrict access to solaria may be a better approach...|$|E
40|$|Focus {{measurements}} {{taken with}} WFPC 2 after the Second Servicing Mission indicated {{the need for}} a slight adjustment of the secondary mirror position, which was successfully carried out on March 18, 1997. The current focus position is about + 1 micron, as desired for optimal WFPC 2 performance and to facilitate alignment activities for the new instruments. No further focus moves are expected for the next 6 - 8 months. 1. The data The measurements described in this report derive from WFPC 2 observations of a single, isolated bright star placed {{near the center of the}} PC, through broad-band, <b>non-UV</b> filters such as F 555 W (primarily), F 439 W, F 675 W and F 814 W. The primary source of data are the two SMOV proposals 7017, especially designed for focus check and including a series of 8 exposures in each of three orbits, and 7016, primarily designed for contamination monitoring but which also includes two F 555 W exposures in the PC for each execution. Additional data have been taken from photometric monitoring proposals and the filter sweep. The target of most observations is a hot, bright, isolated white dwarf...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of water quality {{parameters}} on fouling rates of UV lamp sleeves, through the results of various published studies performed by different {{groups as well as}} by the author. As part of this study, a pilot UV system was installed at the effluent line of two different biological wastewater treatment plants. The first plant included biofilters supplemented by alum addition during the summer for phosphorus removal. The second plant used an oxidation ditch and no coagulants were added. Iron was added to the UV pilot system influent in both cases to simulate post-coagulation of phosphorus. The Trojan UV System 3000 pilot consisted of three separate channels each containing 2 lamps. Two channels were used as controls by having just the sleeves (without UV lamps) in one of them and <b>non-UV</b> lamps (i. e. lamps with visible light output only) in the other. The third channel contained sleeves with two low-pressure UV lamps. The flow in each channel was maintained around 1 [...] 1. 5 L/s and the ferric chloride concentration was varied from 0 to 6 mg/L.
