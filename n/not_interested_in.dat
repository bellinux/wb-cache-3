5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> this setting, but has {{remained}} open to reprise {{her role as}} Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment {{on the condition that}} she likes the story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|Angie (Drea de Matteo) and Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) {{move into}} a house on Wisteria Lane with their college-bound son, Danny (Beau Mirchoff).

5|$|Before {{and during}} their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career, but Tone was {{ultimately}} <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> being {{a movie star}} and Crawford eventually wearied of the effort. After Tone reportedly began drinking and becoming physically abusive, she filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and Tone much later rekindled their friendship and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he died in 1968, Crawford arranged {{for him to be}} cremated and his ashes scattered at Muskoka Lakes, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin was <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> publishing {{the game on}} the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to release the game for the console. In North America, Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood. Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars title.|$|E
5|$|Despite the game's {{receiving}} general {{critical acclaim}} and selling well, Peter Jackson, {{director of the}} Lord of the Rings film trilogy, stated that the video game tie-in for his next film, King Kong, would not be developed by EA but by Ubisoft. Jackson's manager claimed that despite EA saying the filmmakers were heavily involved {{in the making of}} the game, the developers were <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Jackson's input on the game. Additionally, Jackson had played Beyond Good & Evil, and wanted to work with producer Michel Ancel, who was at Ubisoft.|$|E

5|$|Director Hifumi Kono was <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{developing}} {{a sequel to}} the original Clock Tower at first, but was swayed after seeing the technical possibilities {{of the next generation}} consoles. Kono had difficulty in choosing the platform to develop on, but eventually settled for the new PlayStation despite its uncertain future. Clock Tower {{was one of the first}} games developed by Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine. The team felt challenged to create high-quality graphics after being impressed by the visuals of Resident Evil (1996), which was announced during development.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010 Archie Comics {{introduced}} an openly gay character, Kevin Keller in Veronica #202, {{though it was}} only published in the U.S. and Canada.

Kevin beats Jughead in a burger-eating contest, and he tells Jughead that he's <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Veronica because he's gay. Unbeknownst to Kevin, Jughead has a score to settle with Veronica. So, when Jughead requests for Kevin not tell Veronica about his sexuality, Kevin willingly agrees. The bulk of the story is about Veronica's cluelessness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Charlene {{acted as a}} backing singer for Scott and Mike Young's band. Scott and Mike entered a demo tape into a song competition, and the judges, Molly Meldrum and Brian Hanson (Jon Finlayson), sought out Charlene as they were {{impressed}} with her vocal ability. Molly and Brian invited Charlene to their music studio to record some tracks, but she soon realises that she is <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> singing and wants to complete her HSC instead. Scott also apologised to Charlene for being jealous of her talent.|$|E

5|$|Kurosaki {{originally}} {{became interested}} in becoming a performer during her elementary years. During this time, she {{wanted to become a}} theater artist, and she participated in an audition in her school during her sixth grade. She did not pass the audition as she lacked talent in performing, but her singing was praised. This event would leave an impression on her, and as her parents were <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> her taking up performance arts, she decided that she wanted to become a singer.|$|E
5|$|McBride {{attended}} Westminster College in Missouri, {{where he}} was a baseball, basketball, and track athlete. He set the school record in the 200-meter dash. McBride pitched in college, but when he attended a tryout session with the St. Louis Cardinals, personnel at the tryout were <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> McBride's pitching. They thought his running ability held promise. McBride was selected by the Cardinals in the 37th round of the 1970 MLB draft. Though McBride left college early to enter professional baseball, he later graduated from Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Mentzer and Mohan {{also wrote}} {{a series of}} generic RPG {{adventure}}s called Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master. They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called The Convert (1987); Mentzer had written the adventure as an RPGA tournament for D, but TSR was <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted. The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} the {{argument}} {{is connected to the}} immediate circumstances of the person spoken to.

If, in the second case (2) she is too heavy, or too old, she will <b>not</b> be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> studying and becoming a dancer. The argument is not logical, but profitable.|$|R

His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the backboard and fell into the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle was <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
