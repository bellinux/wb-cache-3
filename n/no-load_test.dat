40|$|In {{context of}} {{understanding}} {{problems faced by}} undergraduate students while carrying out laboratory experiments dealing with high voltages, {{it was found that}} most of the students are hesitant to work directly on machine. The reason is that error in the circuitry might lead to deterioration of machine and laboratory instruments. So, it has become inevitable to include modern pedagogic techniques for undergraduate students, which would help them to first carry out experiment in virtual system and then to work on live circuit. Further advantages include that students can try out their intuitive ideas and perform in virtual environment, hence leading to new research and innovations.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} an enhanced dynamic {{model of a}} self-excited induction generator (SEIG) with iron losses. The iron losses are represented in the induction machine model with an equivalent resistance connected in parallel with the magnetizing reactance. Since these losses vary with the air-gap flux and the stator frequency, a series of <b>no-load</b> <b>tests</b> were performed using sinusoidal supply of various frequencies to determine this variation. The air-gap flux influence on the iron losses can be expressed {{by means of the}} corresponding iron loss current. Consequently, an enhanced induction generator model, including the equivalent iron loss resistance as a function of both stator frequency and iron loss current, was built in the MATLAB Simulink environment. In addition, this is, to the best knowledge of the authors, the first SEIG model which includes variable iron losses that is entirely built in MATLAB Simulink. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed through simulation under various operating conditions and compared with the conventional SEIG model in which the iron losses are neglected. Theoretical results obtained from the proposed model have been verified experimentally. It is shown that neglecting the iron losses could cause severe inaccuracies in the SEIG analysis, especially when a SEIG is driven by a variable speed prime mover such as wind turbine...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{provides an}} overview of GE's H System{trademark} technology, and specifically, the design, development, and test activities associated with the DOE Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) program. There was intensive effort expended in bringing this revolutionary advanced technology program to commercial reality. In addition to describing the magnitude of performance improvement possible through use of H System{trademark} technology, this paper discusses the technological milestones during the development of the first 9 H (50 Hz) and 7 H (60 Hz) gas turbines. To illustrate the methodical product development strategy used by GE, this paper discusses several technologies that were essential to the introduction of the H System{trademark}. Also included are analyses of the series of comprehensive tests of materials, components and subsystems that necessarily preceded full scale field testing of the H System{trademark}. This paper validates one of the basic premises with which GE started the H System{trademark} development program: exhaustive and elaborate testing programs minimized risk at every step of this process, and increase the probability of success when the H System{trademark} is introduced into commercial service. In 1995, GE, the world leader in gas turbine technology for over half a century, in conjunction with the DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory's ATS program, introduced its new generation of gas turbines. This H System{trademark} technology is the first gas turbine ever to achieve the milestone of 60 % fuel efficiency. Because fuel represents the largest individual expense of running a power plant, an efficiency increase of even a single percentage point can substantially reduce operating costs over the life of a typical gas-fired, combined-cycle plant in the 400 to 500 megawatt range. The H System{trademark} is not simply a state-of-the-art gas turbine. It is an advanced, integrated, combined-cycle system in which every component is optimized for the highest level of performance. The unique feature of an H-technology combined-cycle system is the integrated heat transfer system, which combines both the steam plant reheat process and gas turbine bucket and nozzle cooling. This feature allows the power generator to operate at a higher firing temperature than current technology units, thereby resulting in dramatic improvements in fuel-efficiency. The end result is the generation of electricity at the lowest, most competitive price possible. Also, despite the higher firing temperature of the H System{trademark}, the combustion temperature is kept at levels that minimize emission production. GE has more than 3. 6 million fired hours of experience in operating advanced technology gas turbines, {{more than three times the}} fired hours of competitors' units combined. The H System{trademark} design incorporates lessons learned from this experience with knowledge gleaned from operating GE aircraft engines. In addition, the 9 H gas turbine is the first ever designed using ''Design for Six Sigma'' methodology, which maximizes reliability and availability throughout the entire design process. Both the 7 H and 9 H gas turbines will achieve the reliability levels of our F-class technology machines. GE has tested its H System{trademark} gas turbine more thoroughly than any previously introduced into commercial service. The H System{trademark} gas turbine has undergone extensive design validation and component <b>testing.</b> Full-speed, <b>no-load</b> <b>testing</b> of the 9 H was achieved in May 1998 and pre-shipment testing was completed in November 1999.

Testing of the 7 H began in December 1999, and full speed, <b>no-load</b> <b>testing</b> was completed in February 2000. The 7 H gas turbine will also be subjected to extensive demonstration and characterization testing at the launch site...|$|R

In order to accomplish accurate results, dynamic parameters of the induction machine is needed, and accordingly, extensive measurement series has been accomplished in order to identify these. A large number of locked-rotor <b>tests</b> and <b>no-load</b> <b>tests</b> with varying voltages and frequencies have been performed to find out the varying nature of the parameters due to skin effect and saturation. Regarding saturation, the effect of leakage flux saturation has been investigated. To incorporate for the skin effect and the effect of leakage flux path saturation in the calculations, a conventional dynamic mathematical description of the induction machine 5 th order Park model) is modified, which makes it applicable for various operating conditions. The fault-current prediction of the detailed model is compared with the prediction of the conventional fifth order model and a dynamically equivalent three-phase model, and also with measurements of symmetrical and asymmetrical short circuit faults, starts and locked-rotor tests. The different models presented are also discussed with respect to wind power as the main application. The proposed model shows excellent agreement, and also indicates the essentiality to incorporate for the saturation of the leakage flux path and the skin effect as the response due to severe faults is to be determined and if a high accuracy result is the objective. Incorporation of the main flux saturation, is of little importance for the short-circuit fault currents. Regarding the selection of a two- or three phase model, the most appropriate model as well as the more simple model, is generally the two axis model. The disadvantage is the inability to account for a zero sequence component. The possible choice of using a three phase model is however only an issue if the generator is wye connected and if the neutral point of the generator is connected. Wind turbine generators are mainly connected in delta which imply no neutral point and if they are connected in wye, the neural point is however not connected.
