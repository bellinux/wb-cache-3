5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; <b>non-combustible</b> substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|The Albert Dock is {{a complex}} of dock {{buildings}} and warehouses in Liverpool, England. Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick, it was opened in 1846, {{and was the first}} structure in Britain to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first <b>non-combustible</b> warehouse system in the world.|$|E

25|$|The dome, {{supported}} by 12 steel ribs, would rise 100ft above the floor, and be illuminated by an electric lantern 45ft in diameter — {{the only source}} of light, for the room had no windows. The building was constructed of <b>non-combustible</b> materials intended to protect the Jezreelites when the Last Trump was called and fire rained down upon the rest of existence.|$|E
25|$|Options for <b>non-combustible</b> {{construction}} include floors, {{ceilings and}} roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked {{to form the}} shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{combustible}} materials used on Grenfell Tower were considerably cheaper than <b>non-combustible</b> alternatives would have been. There {{appear to have}} been intense cost pressures over the Grenfell refurbishment. In June 2017 it was stated the project team chose cheaper cladding that saved £293,368, after the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation mentioned in an email the need for “good costs for Cllr Fielding Mellen ”.|$|E
25|$|Ash {{content of}} coal is the <b>non-combustible</b> residue left after coal is burnt. It {{represents}} the bulk mineral matter after carbon, oxygen, sulfur and water (including from clays) {{has been driven}} off during combustion. Analysis is fairly straightforward, with the coal thoroughly burnt and the ash material expressed {{as a percentage of}} the original weight. It can also give an indication about the quality of coal.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo marketed a 2.5-gallon and 1-quart {{extinguisher}} using M-X liquid discharged {{through a}} low-velocity shower head type nozzle, {{but it was}} met with limited success, as it was going up against Ansul's Met-L-X, {{which could be used}} on more types of metals and was <b>non-combustible.</b> M-X had the advantage of being easy to recharge and non-corrosive, since it was oil-based, but production did not last long due to its limited applications.|$|E
25|$|According to Arconic's {{website and}} {{brochure}} for the mainland European market {{at the time}} of the fire, the Reynobond PE cladding used was suitable only for buildings 10 metres or less tall; the fire-retardant Reynobond FR was suitable for buildings up to 30 metres tall; and above the latter height, such as the upper parts of Grenfell Tower, the <b>non-combustible</b> A2 version was supposed to be used (“As soon as the building is higher than the firefighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material”). After the fire, Arconic stopped sales of Reynobond PE worldwide for tower blocks.|$|E
25|$|Both the aluminium-polyethylene {{cladding}} and the PIR insulation plates failed {{fire safety}} tests conducted after the fire, {{according to the}} police. In 2014 safety experts cautioned that the planned insulation was only suitable for use with <b>non-combustible</b> cladding. The Guardian saw a certificate from the building inspectors’ organisation, Local Authority Building Control (LABC), which stated that the chosen insulation for the refit should be used on tall buildings only with fibre cement panels, which do not burn. Combustible panels with polyethylene were put {{up on top of}} insulation known as Celotex RS5000, made from polyisocyanurate, which burns when heated giving off toxic cyanide fumes.|$|E
25|$|A fuse {{consists}} of a metal strip or wire fuse element, of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a <b>non-combustible</b> housing. The fuse is arranged in series to carry all the current passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a soldered joint within the fuse, opening the circuit.|$|E
500|$|When it was {{constructed}} the Albert Dock {{was considered a}} state of the art docking system. Built almost entirely from cast iron, stone and brick, the Albert Dock was designed to be fireproof, and on completion was the world's first <b>non-combustible</b> warehouse system. It provided [...] of warehouse space and its dock basin had a water area of [...] In its construction over 23 million bricks were used and 47,000 tonnes of mortar. In total it cost £782,265 (approximately £41m today), whilst today its estimated to be worth £230 million.|$|E

2500|$|Celotex's Rainscreen Compliance Guide when specifying Celotex RS5000 in {{buildings}} above [...] sets out {{the conditions under}} which the product was tested and for which it has been certified as meeting the required fire safety standards. These include the use of (<b>non-combustible)</b> 12mm fibre cement rainscreen panels, ventilated horizontal fire breaks at each floor slab edge and vertical non-ventilated fire breaks. It states that any changes from the tested configuration [...] "will need to be considered by the building designer".|$|E
2500|$|Life {{and safety}} {{upgrades}} to the Kibbie Dome began [...] {{in the spring}} of 2009. The west wall was replaced with a <b>non-combustible</b> construction assembly; translucent plastic panels on the upper half and opaque metal siding on the lower. Concurrent with the end-wall replacement, a range of interior life safety work took place: field level exiting in the new west wall, addition of handrails in the seating aisles, provision of the required smoke exhaust systems; and other life safety and code mitigation improvements. The second phase of the project was completed in 2011 with the replacement of the east wall. A premium seating area (Litehouse Center) was established in 2011 in the former press box area above the south grandstand; a new press box was constructed above the north grandstand.|$|E
2500|$|Though the building's {{frame and}} ceiling tiling was {{classified}} as <b>non-combustible,</b> the Beverly Hills Supper Club made substantial use of wooden building materials, including floor joists for the two-story portion of the complex and framing on interior hallways. It was decorated throughout with [...] highly flammable carpeting and wood wall paneling; event rooms also used wooden tables and supports, as well as tablecloths, curtains, {{and a variety of}} other small combustible materials. The building did not have a fire-suppression sprinkler system installed—at the time, these were not required in venues such as the Supper Club— nor did it have an alarm system or smoke detectors. In addition, the majority of the paths of egress in each event room led not to the outside of the building, but to a variety of narrow interior corridors and service spaces.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{criticism}} of the assumptions that continue to make these model results possible appeared in the 1987 book Nuclear War Survival Skills (NWSS), a civil defense manual by Cresson Kearny for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to the 1988 publication An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war, Kearny's criticisms were directed at the excessive amount of soot that the modelers assumed would reach the stratosphere. Kearny cited a Soviet study that modern cities would not burn as firestorms, as most flammable city items would be buried under <b>non-combustible</b> rubble and that the TTAPS study included a massive overestimate on the size and extent of non-urban wildfires that would result from a nuclear war. The TTAPS authors responded that, amongst other things, {{they did not believe}} target planners would intentionally blast cities into rubble, but instead argued fires would begin in relatively undamaged suburbs when nearby sites were hit, and partially conceded his point about non-urban wildfires. Dr. Richard D. Small, director of thermal sciences at the Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation similarly disagreed strongly with the model assumptions, in particular the 1990 update by TTAPS that argues that some 5,075 Tg of material would burn in a total US-Soviet nuclear war, as analysis by Small of blueprints and real buildings returned a maximum of 1,475 Tg of material that could be burned, [...] "assuming that all the available combustible material was actually ignited".|$|E
60|$|The doctor looked indignant {{but held}} his peace. He and Mary Isabel had tacitly agreed never to discuss Louisa, because such {{discussion}} {{would not make}} for harmony. Mary Isabel's conscience would not let the doctor say anything uncomplimentary of Louisa, and the doctor's conscience would not let him say anything complimentary. So they left {{her out of the}} question and talked about the sea and the boats and poetry and flowers and similar <b>non-combustible</b> subjects.|$|E

50|$|When a mole of {{nitrous oxide}} decomposes, it {{releases}} half a mole of O2 molecules (oxygen gas), and one mole of N2 molecules (nitrogen gas). This decomposition allows an oxygen concentration of 33% to be reached. Nitrogen gas is <b>non-combustible</b> {{and does not}} support combustion. Air—which contains only 21% oxygen, the rest being nitrogen and other equally <b>non-combustible</b> and non-combustion-supporting gasses—permits a 12-percent-lower maximum-oxygen level than that of nitrous oxide. This oxygen supports combustion; it alone combines with gasoline, alcohol, or diesel fuel to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor, along with heat, which causes the former two products of combustion to expand and exert pressure on pistons, driving the engine.|$|E
