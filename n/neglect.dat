5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used {{to imply}} that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50years of <b>neglect.</b> Schiff points out that such <b>neglect</b> was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach {{in the years after}} his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Neglected</b> {{children}} are children that go unnoticed. The present {{study examined the}} amount of responsibility teenagers attribute to peers to help their <b>neglected</b> peers {{and the influence of}} gender and ethnicity hereupon. The hypotheses were that (1) overall teenagers will attribute a high responsibility of helping, (2) a teenager is attributed more responsibility to help an in-group <b>neglected</b> peer than an out-group <b>neglected</b> peer and (3) boys are less likely to attribute responsibility of helping <b>neglected</b> peers than girls. Method: To this aim 69 students (12 - 15 years) from a high school in the Netherlands completed a questionnaire with one vignette about a <b>neglected</b> child and subsequently the question to which extent a peer must help. Results: The data in this study confirmed the first and the third hypotheses, but rejected the second one. Discussion: Teenagers attribute a high responsibility of helping a <b>neglected</b> peer, whereby girls ascribe a higher responsibility rate than boys. They do not distinguish between in- and out-group <b>neglected</b> peers at this responsibility. Implications for further research are to examine the influence of education on helping and to conduct an experiment whereby the participants are non-informed...|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians <b>neglect</b> to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians <b>neglect</b> seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E

40|$|Background: In 1975 – 99, only 1 · 1 % of new {{therapeutic}} products {{had been}} developed for <b>neglected</b> diseases.

We analysed {{the research and development}} pipeline of drugs and vaccines for <b>neglected</b> diseases from 2000 to 2011. Methods: We searched databases of drug regulatory authorities, WHO, and clinical trial registries for entries made between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011. We defined <b>neglected</b> diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, <b>neglected</b> tropical diseases (NTDs; WHO definition), and other diseases of poverty according to common definitions. Findings: Of the 850 new therapeutic products registered in 2000 – 11, 37 (4 %) were indicated for <b>neglected</b> diseases, comprising 25 products with a new indication or formulation and eight vaccines or biological products.
