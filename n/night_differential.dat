In addition, another section of the proposed law would remove premium pay from the calculation of the $ 30, 000 fiscal year overtime and premium pay cap that Customs officers may not exceed. GAO's analysis of Customs data showed that had the provisions of H. R. 1833 been in effect during fiscal year 1999, many officers would have experienced significant pay decreases.

40|$|We have {{explored}} {{a sample of}} suspected A-type binaries in a systematic way, both spectroscopically and photometrically. Due to their location in the H-R diagram, indications of pulsation and/or chemical peculiarities among these suspected binary (or multiple) systems may be found. High-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the ELODIE and MUSICOS spectrographs was used in combination with a few <b>nights</b> of <b>differential</b> CCD photometry in order to search for pulsation(s). Of the 32 investigated targets, eight are spectroscopic binaries, {{one of which is}} a close binary also showing eclipses, and three have been identified as Delta Scuti pulsators with rapid line-profile variations. Among the latter stars, HD 217860 reveals interesting multiperiodic photometric and spectroscopic variations, with up to eight frequencies common to two large photometric data sets. We suggest that at least one radial overtone mode is excited among the two most dominant frequencies.

40|$|This study {{analysed}} the microhabitat use {{of three}} endangered fish species, Andalusian tooth- carp Aphanius baeticus, Iberian loach Cobitis paludica and sand smelt Atherina boyeri, in a coastal stream stretch. Plastic minnow traps were set both during daytime {{and at night}} {{on the bottom and}} at the surface. Depth and presence of effective refuge were recorded for each trap. To assess size-related changes in microhabitat use individuals of each species were classified in three size classes. The three species preferentially used bottom positions in the water column, though this behaviour was more evident in the case of Iberian loach. While large Iberian loach remained active at night Andalusian toothcarp and sand smelt were strongly diurnal, especially larger individuals. The three species showed a clear ontogenetic change in microhabitat pre- ferences towards deeper waters. Small Andalusian toothcarp and medium-sized Iberian loach used deeper microhabitat in the presence of refuge. Large Andalusian toothcarp consistently preferred exposed microhabitat at any time. Andalusian toothcarp using refuge were smaller at any time, while Iberian loach followed this pattern only at <b>night.</b> The <b>differential</b> vulnerability of these species to different predators (aerial and aquatic; diurnal and nocturnal) could explain the observed patterns in microhabitat use. Fish tended to co-occur in microhabitats either due to habitat characteristics independently of species or due to species independently of habitat. Andalusian toothcarp segregated spatio-temporally from sand smelt and Iberian loach, but these species occurred independently of each other. According to these co-occurrence patterns, Andalusian toothcarp would be more sensitive than Iberian loach or sand smelt to interspecificPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe study {{presented}} in this paper is aimed at analyzing the driversâ€™ speed profiles for the evaluation of speed differentials parameters (85 MSR, Î”V 85 and Î” 85 V) during day and <b>night</b> driving. Speed <b>differential</b> parameters are commonly used for design consistency evaluation, according to an advanced approach of road engineering, based on the study of the roadway's conformance to driver expectancy that can improve road safety performance. The research was carried out using a driving simulator where a section of 10 km of an existing two-lane rural road composed by 39 tangent-curve configurations was implemented. The speed profiles of 40 drivers were recorded both in simulated daylight and nightlight driving conditions. The study proposes new relationships between speed differential parameters for different visibility condition and geometries of tangent-curve configurations and increases the actual knowledge of driver's speed choices and driving behaviour under nighttime conditions. Specifically, results demonstrate different relations between speed differential parameters among four different classes of tangent-curve geometries and under day and night driving conditions. Relations are also compared with the main literature models that correlated speed differential parameters...|$|R

Forty-four {{breast cancer patients}} with bone metastases were randomised to receive intravenous ZA (4 [*]mg) at 1100 or 2300 hours every 28 days for four times. Urinary concentration N-telopeptide of type-I collagen (NTX) and deoxypyridinolines, and serum C-telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX), bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin and Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was measured {{in the morning at}} baseline and after 4, 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84 days. Urinary ZA concentration was also measured. Zoledronic acid caused significant decreases of NTX and CTX (P< 0. 001), without any difference in percent changes between night and morning arms. Bone ALP and osteocalcin were also significantly affected by ZA (P= 0. 001), without any difference between arms. Parathyroid hormone significantly increased in both the arms; PTH increase was lower in the night arm (P= 0. 001). From the second administration onwards, urinary ZA level was significantly higher in the night arm (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{intriguing}} exoplanet candidate KIC 12557548 b {{is believed}} to have a comet-like tail of dusty debris trailing a small rocky planet. The tail of debris scatters up to 1. 3 % of the stellar light in the Kepler observatory's bandpass (0. 42 - 0. 9 mu m). Observing the tail's transit depth at multiple wavelengths can reveal the composition and particle size of the debris, constraining the makeup and lifetime of the sub-Mercury planet. Early dust particle size predictions from the scattering of the comet-like tail pointed toward a dust size of similar to 0. 1 mu m for silicate compositions. These small particles would produce a much deeper optical transit depth than near-infrared transit depth. We measure a transmission spectrum for KIC 12557548 b using the SpeX spectrograph (covering 0. 8 - 2. 4 mu m) simultaneously with the MORIS imager taking r' (0. 63 mu m) photometry on the Infrared Telescope Facility for eight nights and one night in H band (1. 63 mu m) using the Wide-field IR Camera at the Palomar 200 inch telescope. The infrared spectra are plagued by systematic errors, but we argue that sufficient precision is obtained when using differential spectroscopic calibration when combining multiple <b>nights.</b> The average <b>differential</b> transmission spectrum is flat, supporting findings that KIC 12557548 b's debris is likely composed of larger particles greater than or similar to 0. 5 mu m for pyroxene and olivine and greater than or similar to 0. 2 mu m for iron and corundum. The r' photometric transit depths are all below the average Kepler value, suggesting that the observations occurred during a weak period or that the mechanisms producing optical broadband transit depths are suppressed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examined smaller reef fishes {{of commercial}} and recreational fishing significance (i. e. snappers, emperors and groupers) on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Four questions of importance to reef fish ecology and reef fisheries science were addressed. These were i) identification of patterns of distribution and abundance; ii) quantification of local patterns of inter- and intra-habitat movements of post-settlement reef fishes in six habitat types in a lagoon; and for Lutjanus fulviflamma, Lethrinus harak and L. lentjan, iii) the estimation of age, growth and mortality rates and iv) estimation of size and age at first sexual maturity. Antillean Z-traps {{were used to determine}} patterns of distribution and abundance of reef fishes in six types of habitat in a lagoon at Lizard Island, GBR. The habitats were 1) deep sand away from reefs (DSAR), ii) deep sand near reefs (DSNR), iii) rubble areas (RUBB), iv) slopes of reefs (SLOP), v) shallow sand near reefs (SSNR) and vi) tops of reefs (TOPS). Variations in catch composition and abundance between day and night soaks in these 6 habitats were measured on 7 sampling occasions over a period of 30 months. Data were analyzed using a 3 -way fixed ANOVA model (factors were 7 sampling occasions, 6 habitat types and 2 soak times). Habitat types and soak time were the most important factors in explaining variation in catch composition and abundance for most species of reef fish. In general, abundance and species richness were significantly higher at the TOPS and SLOP habitats and lower in the SSNR and DSAR habitats. The DSNR and RUBB habitats had intermediate numbers of species and individuals. DSNR and RUBB habitats were more similar to TOPS and SLOP habitats in terms of species composition than to SSNR and DSAR but were more similar to SSNR and DSAR in terms of abundances. Overall, more individuals and species were caught during night than day in all habitats except in TOPS. The abundances of many lutjanids and lethrinids were higher at night than day in sandy habitats (DSNR, DSAR and SSNR). The abundances of apogonids and holocentrids were higher at night than day in reefal habitats (TOPS and SLOP). In contrast, the abundances of pomacentrids and labrids were significantly higher during the day than at night in reefal habitats. A TWo-way INdicator SPecies ANalysis (TWINSPAN) on the catch information (120 species by 84 samples of 6 replicate traps; i. e. 7 sampling times by 6 habitat types by 2 soak times) revealed two distinct fish assemblages associated with a) reefal and rubble, and b) sandy habitats. These assemblages changed over a diel period with each of the two 'habitat-based' assemblages showing a distinct day and night fish composition. The nocturnal fish assemblage in sandy habitats further differentiated into two groups, one near and the other away from reefs. The results indicated the importance of habitats in the local distribution of reef fishes. The present study confirms the significance of habitats as a source of shelter and food resources for reef fishes. The shifts in fish composition between day and <b>night</b> suggested <b>differential</b> movement patterns of fishes from hiding places to feeding areas. Many of the lutjanids, apogonids and holocentrids hid whilst pomacentrids and labrids foraged in reefal habitats by day. By night, pomacentrids and labrids sought shelter whilst apogonids and holocentrids foraged within reefal habitats. Some lutjanids moved to sandy habitats near reefs, while others moved further away from reefs at night to forage. The sandy habitat appeared depauperate during the day but many species, particularly Lutjanus fulviflamma, Lethrinus lentjan and L. nebulosus, frequented this habitat at night. A mark-recapture technique was used to determine levels and patterns of movement within and between habitat types for lutjanids, lethrinids and serranids. Distances moved were categorized in intervals of 30 m, based on the minimum distance between deployed traps. Results showed that 74...|$|R
