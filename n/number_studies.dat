50|$|The {{pressure}} drag {{is related to}} cross section size, the friction drag is related to total skin surface (which is generally higher in tall people), and the wave-making drag decreases with body length because a longer body will generally generate less waves due to a decreasing Froude <b>number.</b> <b>Studies</b> have found that total drag does not increase as swimmer height increases, mostly due to the decrease in wave-making drag. Since taller swimmers tend to have bigger muscles and bigger hands and feet to propel them, then they are generally at an advantage.|$|E
50|$|Holocaust denial {{propaganda}} in {{all forms}} {{has been shown}} to influence the audiences that it reaches. In fact, even the well-educated—that is, college graduates and current university students alike—are susceptible to such propaganda when it is presented before them. This stems from the growing disbelief that audiences feel after being exposed to such information, especially since Holocaust witnesses themselves are decreasing in <b>number.</b> <b>Studies</b> centered on the psychological effects of Holocaust denial propaganda confirm this assertion. Linda M. Yelland and William F. Stone, in particular, show that Denial essays decrease readers' belief in the Holocaust, regardless of their prior Holocaust awareness.|$|E

40|$|Initial {{proof-of-concept}} {{results obtained}} {{in a pilot}} transonic tunnel, led to a U. S. decision to apply the cryogenic tunnel concept to the National Transonic Facility (NTF). The pilot tunnel was reclassified as a 'permanent' facility and renamed the 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (TCT). The 0. 3 -m TCT, with its ability to operate at temperatures ranging from about 78 K to 340 K, combined with a 6 atmospheres pressure capability, provides extremely high test Reynolds numbers at relatively low model loading. In addition, the ability to vary pressure and temperature independently of Mach number provides a unique capability to conduct studies at a constant dynamic pressure or at a constant Reynolds number with just one model.
