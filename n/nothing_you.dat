500|$|Dylan earned {{yet another}} {{distinction}} in a 2007 study of US legal opinions and briefs that found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers {{more than those}} of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by the Beatles, who were second. Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included [...] "you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows" [...] from [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues" [...] and [...] "when you ain't got <b>nothing,</b> <b>you</b> got nothing to lose" [...] from [...] "Like a Rolling Stone".|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Benn reiterated his {{opposition}} to the European Commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in the institution, saying: [...] "Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British Government, but we shall get it from Jacques Delors. They believe that a good king is better than a bad Parliament. I have never taken that view." [...] This argument has also been used by many on the right-wing Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, such as Daniel Hannan MEP. Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian that [...] "For , even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because the king's whim could change and there'd be <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ann Powers of Blender said, [...] "The hits {{collected}} on My Prerogative are as sticky as soda {{and almost as}} easy to rinse out. Spears {{will go down in}} history books, but not for anything she’s created, besides a world-class stir". She named [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] "the song that defined her legacy" [...] and also added: [...] "In less than five minutes, it contains an emotional storm that is both widely public and deeply personal. If only she had continued to prove worthy of that heroic task." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said that [...] "Listening to her hits all at once, you may be struck by the seductive severity of Ms. Spears's music: the beats are sharp as tines, the lyrics are filled with evocations of fear and control, the voice projects <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> might mistake for warmth".|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} {{took place}} in Helmand Province during Operation Herrick 14, part of the British effort in the War in Afghanistan. Blackman, of J company, 42 Commando, Royal Marines, {{was part of a}} Marine patrol that came across an Afghan fighter in a field wounded by Apache Helicopter gunfire. Blackman ordered the Afghan to be moved {{out of sight of the}} British Persistent Ground Surveillance System, a camera on a balloon above British Forward Operating Base Shazad, Helmand, covering the area Blackman's patrol had been sent to. Video evidence played at the Marines' subsequent trial shows some of the patrol dragging the man across the field and then kicking him. Blackman ordered Marine B and C to stop administering first aid to the insurgent and eventually shot the man in the chest with a 9mm pistol, saying: [...] "Shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt. It's <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't do to us." [...] He then added: [...] "I just broke the Geneva Convention." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene when}} Walter pleads with Gus {{demonstrates}} the paternal sense of protectiveness Walter has developed for Jesse. During that scene, Walter tells Gus, [...] "You kill me, you have <b>nothing.</b> <b>You</b> kill Jesse, you don't have me." [...] Jesse is visibly {{moved by the}} statement, which Aaron Paul described as [...] "the first moment that Jesse realizes that Walt's loyalty is to Jesse." [...] "Box Cutter" [...] also illustrated Skyler's growing involvement in Walter's illegal activities through the subplot in which she lies to a locksmith to break into Walter's house, {{going so far as}} to use her baby as a prop in her facade. After Skyler breaks into Walter's apartment, she finds the plastic eyeball of a teddy bear that has been part of the series since the second season. The eye has long been used as a symbol to identify Walter's gradual descent into a life of crime, and Skyler's discovery of it symbolizes her own similar descent.|$|E
500|$|On January 27, 1991, at a music {{industry}} {{party at the}} Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that Young [...] "began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway." [...] Dr. Dre later commented [...] "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know.

2500|$|AMPAS {{executive}} director Bruce Davis noted that Fawcett had been recognized for her [...] "remarkable television work" [...] at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2009. On the exclusion, he said: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> {{can say to}} people, particularly to family members, {{within a day or}} two of the show that helps at all. They tend to be surprised and hurt, and we understand that and we're sorry for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Berardinelli, on {{the other}} hand, {{negatively}} commented the songs as [...] "neither catchy nor memorable." [...] Tim Robey from The Daily Telegraph gave a negative review, {{saying that they were}} only [...] "OK—there’s <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> want to whistle on the way home." [...] Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian, who gave the movie two out of five stars, described the songs as [...] "sporting a laboured selection of Broadway-style show tunes," [...] and hence are actually added for profit.|$|E

2500|$|Gardiner would {{continue}} his work inside the PC {{party for the}} rest of the 1940s, chairing the resolution and policy committee himself at the 1948 federal leadership convention. Gardiner turned down several chances to run provincially and federally. Gardiner chose instead to concentrate on his own career in business. [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> can do in politics that makes the cash register ring." [...] Gardiner was even considered to run for the leadership of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party (and therefore provincial premier) in 1948, but chose to support Leslie Frost instead. Gardiner would become one of Frost's closest political confidantes and advisers.|$|E
2500|$|US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers {{also paid}} a visit, in the latter's yacht [...] "Kanawha". Twain's humorous talk was partly an {{introduction}} of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, [...] "In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I {{am not going}} to give him compliments. Compliments always embarrass a man. You do not know what to say. It does not inspire you with words. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> can say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. I always feel they have not said enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beaver and Wally both attend {{public schools}} and are {{encouraged}} to pursue college educations {{as a means to}} prepare for their futures. Ward and June attended prep school and boarding school, respectively, and both attended college; their sons are expected to do the same. While both boys consider prep-school educations – Wally at the Bellport Military Academy and Beaver at an eastern school called Fallbrook – both remain at home and attend Mayfield High with their friends. School and homework are the bane of Beaver's existence. In [...] "Beaver's Secret Life", the boy decides to become a writer in adulthood because [...] "you don't {{have to go to school}} or know <b>nothing</b> ... <b>You</b> only have to make up adventures and get paid for it." [...] Beaver's attitude toward education provides comic counterpoint to the backgrounds, values and ambitions of his parents.|$|E

He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think the one thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most.

Well, if you are an atheist and you don't believe in anything, if you die, what is there to go to? <b>Nothing.</b> <b>You</b> are worm dirt.
