5000|$|The DuPont formula, {{also known}} as the {{strategic}} profit model, is a common way to break down ROE into three important components. Essentially, ROE will equal the net profit margin multiplied by asset turnover multiplied by financial leverage. Splitting return on equity into three parts makes it easier to understand changes in ROE over time. For example, if the <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> increases, every sale brings in more money, resulting in a higher overall ROE. Similarly, if the asset turnover increases, the firm generates more sales for every unit of assets owned, again resulting in a higher overall ROE. Finally, increasing financial leverage means that the firm uses more debt financing relative to equity financing. Interest payments to creditors are tax deductible, but dividend payments to shareholders are not. Thus, a higher proportion of debt in the firm's capital structure leads to higher ROE. [...] Financial leverage benefits diminish as the risk of defaulting on interest payments increases. So if the firm takes on too much debt, the cost of debt rises as creditors demand a higher risk premium, and ROE decreases. Increased debt will make a positive contribution to a firm's ROE only if the matching Return on assets (ROA) of that debt exceeds the interest rate on the debt.|$|E

40|$|A methodological {{approach}} {{to determine the}} optimum time to control weeds that integrates aspects of weed biology, weed-crop competition, and economics is presented. The approach {{is based on the}} concept of Time Density Equivalent: this is defined as the density of weed plants that germinate with the crop and compete until harvest that causes the same yield loss caused by a group of weeds with a given density, time of emergence, and time of removal. A model was developed that accounts for pattern of weed emergence and permits determination of timing of weed control that minimizes economic loss due to weeds emerging both before and after treatments. The outcomes of the model are presented with two examples: corn in competition with velvetleaf and soybean in competition with Amaranthus cruentus. For both crops, six different weed control strategies involving preemergence, chemical, and mechanical postemergence treatments are considered. The results obtained with the model are compared with the calculation of <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> based on assumptions of simultaneous emergence of crop and weeds and no effect of different times of control. Different control strategies are compared considering not only maximum <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> but also its dependence on time of control, because a strategy with a lower value of maximum <b>net</b> <b>margin,</b> but a flatter <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> curve, allows more flexibility of time of control...|$|E

The objective of this work was to evaluate the economic behavior of four food crop and supplementary forage rotations using indicators of profitability and profit variability. Productive data were used from a long-term experiment (16 yr) in the central valley of Chile under conditions of irrigation. With productive data and information on historic input/output prices, the real <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> per rotation (RNMR) and its coefficient of variation (CV) were determined. The {{results indicated that the}} highest economic benefits and greatest economic stability were obtained with rotations that only included crops, namely sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris) -wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) -bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) -barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (CR 2) and corn (Zea mays L.) -wheat-bean-barley (CR 4). These rotations included crops with low CV of the <b>net</b> <b>margin,</b> such as wheat, barley and beans, with values between 0. 31 and 0. 34. The rotations with crops and pasture, sugar beet-wheat-red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) (2) (CR 1) and corn-wheat-red clover (2) (CR 3) had lower net margins and more variability of this indicator. Red clover had the highest CV value (1. 00). The selection of crops for rotations and their sequence were determining factors in the economic behavior of rotations, affecting the level of RNMR and the degree of inter-annual variability of this indicator. Thus, differences among rotations of 47 % in <b>net</b> <b>margin</b> were determined (CR 2 vs. CR 1), which only differed in the replacement of pasture with red clover (2) by bean-barley.
