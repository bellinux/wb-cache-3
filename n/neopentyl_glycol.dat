Various deformation rates ranging from 1 rnm/min to 1000 mm/min were employed. Amorphous poly (ethylene terephthalate) (aPET) exhibited considerably higher specific essential and nonessential work of fracture than the copolyesters containing either cyc 10 hexylenedimethylene (aPET-C) or <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycols</b> (aPET-N).

Starting with green fluorescent protein- and epitope-tagged human CFTR produced in mammalian cells known to properly fold and process CFTR, we devised a rapid tandem affinity purification scheme to minimize CFTR exposure to detergent {{in order to preserve}} its ATPase function. We compared a panel of detergents, including widely used detergents (maltosides, <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycols</b> (MNG), C 12 E 8, lysolipids, Chaps) and innovative detergents (branched alkylmaltosides, facial amphiphiles) for CFTR purification, function, monodispersity and stability. ATPase activity after reconstitution into proteoliposomes was 2 – 3 times higher when CFTR was purified using facial amphiphiles. ATPase activity was also demonstrated in purified CFTR samples without detergent removal using a novel lipid supplementation assay. By electron microscopy, negatively stained CFTR samples were monodisperse at low concentration, and size exclusion chromatography showed a predominance of monomer even after CFTR concentration above 1 mg/ml. Rates of CFTR aggregation quantified in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that detergents which best preserved reconstituted ATPase activity also supported the greatest stability, with CFTR monomer half-lives of 6 – 9 days in MNG or Chaps, and 12 – 17 days in facial amphiphile. Cryoelectron microscopy of concentrated CFTR in MNG or facial amphiphile confirmed mostly monomeric protein, producing low resolution reconstructions in conformity with similar proteins. These protocols can be used to generate samples of pure, functional, stable CFTR at concentrations amenable to biophysical characterization...|$|R

Unfortunately, recent technological advances in X-ray crystallography and EM cannot account for the poor solubility and stability of membrane protein samples. A limitation of conventional detergent-based methods is that detergent molecules destabilize membrane proteins, leading to their aggregation. The use of orthologues, mutants and fusion tags has helped improve protein stability, but at the expense of not working with the sequence of interest. Novel detergents such as glucose <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> (GNG), maltose <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> (MNG) and calixarene-based detergents can improve protein stability without compromising their solubilizing properties.

In addition, biodegradability studies in compost have been conducted. The copolymers displayed a high and similar thermal stability with respect to PPCE.

40|$|The {{application}} and suitability of micro-thermal analysis to detect {{changes in the}} chemical and physical properties of coating due to ageing and especially photo-degradation is demonstrated using a model polyester coating based on <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> isophthalic acid. The changes in chemical structure like chain scission and cross-linking are manifested by a shift of the LTA detectable T g and by a change of {{the slope of the}} part of the LTA graph responsible for the penetration of the hot sensor into the material after passing the glass transition temperature. As such LTA is a valuable tool to have a quick look into coating surfaces and especially their ageing. The photo-degradation of polyester in air leads to the formation of a cross-linked network at a surface layer of about 3 - 4 μm coupled with an increase in hardness and of the glass transition temperature by ∼ 90 K, the effect is less drastic for a photo-degradation in a nitrogen environment. Moreover, the presence of a non-equilibrium dense surface layer with a higher T g formed during the drying of the coating formulation and the film solidification can be shown. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

In {{the course of a}} crystallographic study on the multidrug ATP-binding cassette transporter BmrA, mass spectral analyses on samples purified with six selected detergents revealed unexpected protein contamination visible for the most part on overloaded SDS-PAGE. A major contamination from the outer membrane protein OmpF was detected in purifications with Foscholine 12 (FC 12) but not with Lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) or any of the maltose-based detergents. Consequently, in the FC 12 purified BmrA, OmpF easily crystallized over BmrA in a new space group, and whose structure is reported here. We therefore devised an optimized protocol to eliminate OmpF during the FC 12 purification of BmrA. On the other hand, an additional band visible at ∼ 110 kDa was detected in all samples purified with the maltose-based detergents. It contained AcrB that crystallized over BmrA despite its trace amounts. Highly pure BmrA preparations could be obtained using either a ΔacrAB E. coli strain and n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside, or a classical E. coli strain and lauryl maltose <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> for the overexpression and purification, respectively. Overall our results urge to incorporate a proteomics-based purity analysis into quality control checks prior to commencing crystallization assays of membrane proteins that are notoriously arduous to crystallize. Moreover, the strategies developed here to selectively eliminate obstinate contaminants should be applicable to the purification of other membrane proteins overexpressed in E. coli...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (PET) polymer {{has been}} the material of choice for packaging industry {{as a result of}} its excellent mechanical and physical properties. These properties are highly dependent on the microstructure, chemistry, and processing conditions of this material. PET is often oriented in the machine direction (MD), the transverse direction (TD) or both MD and TD, depending upon the resultant properties required. The orientation process causes polymer chain alignment and hence changes the original crystallinity, thermal properties, and lattice structure. In this work, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were utilized to gain microstructure knowledge about the orientation of PET. PET is often copolymerized with different diacids or diols to produce desired film properties such as thermoforming, heat sealing, heat shrinking, solvent seaming, etc. In this work, PET copolymerized with <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> (NPG) was investigated. These films can shrink about 75 % in TD on appropriate heat treatment. Their ability to solvent seam with tetrahydofuran (THF) solvent make them an excellent material for shrink-sleeve bottle-label applications. The solvent induced crystallization of these copolymer films was also studied at different exposure times varying from 0 min to 40 min. Tensile tests of seals made from solvent exposed film samples indicated that increased crystallinity in the film significantly decreases the solvent seaming ability. Hence, the hypothesis was proposed that amorphous material provides better surface for solvent adsorption, which results into stronger solvent seams and better printability...|$|E
40|$|Porous {{hydroxyapatite}} (HA) {{has been}} used as a bone graft material in the clinics for decades. Traditionally, the pores in these HAs are either obtained from the coralline exoskeletal patterns or from the embedded organic particles in the starting HA powder. Both processes offer very limited control on the pore structure. A new method for manufacturing porous HA with designed pore channels has been developed. This method is essentially a lost-mold technique with negative molds made with Stereolithography and a highly loaded curable HA suspension as the ceramic carrier. Implants with designed channels and connection patterns were first generated from a Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) software and Computer Tomography (CT) data. The negative images of the designs were used to build the molds on a stereolithography apparatus with epoxy resins. A 40 vol% HA suspension in propoxylated <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> diacrylate (PNPGDA) and iso-bornyl acrylate (IBA) was formulated. HA suspension was cast into the epoxy molds and cured into solid at 85 °C. The molds and acrylate binders were removed by pyrolysis, followed by HA green body sintering. With this method, implants with six different channel designs were built successfully and the designed channels were reproduced in the sintered HA implants. The channels created in the sintered HA implants were between 366 μm and 968 μm in diameter with standard deviations of 50 μm or less. The porosity created by the channels were between 26 % and 52 %. The results show that HA implants with designed connection pattern and well controled channel size can be built with the technique developed in this study. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publisher...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{detergents}} on {{the stability and}} function of the melibiose permeases of Escherichia coli (MelB(Ec)) and Salmonella typhimurium (MelB(st)) was studied. In n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (DDM) or n-undecyl-beta-Dmaltoside (UDM), WT MelBst binds melibiose with an affinity {{similar to that in}} the membrane. However, with WT MelB(Ec), or MelB(st) mutants (Arg 141 -? Cys, Arg 295 -? Cys, or Arg 363 -? Cys), galactoside binding is not detected in these detergents, but binding to the phosphotransferase protein IIA(Glc) is maintained. In the amphiphiles lauryl maltose <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> (MNG- 3) or glyco-diosgenin (GDN), galactoside binding with all of the MelB proteins is observed, with slightly reduced affinities. MelB(st) is more therrnostable than MelB(Ec) and the thermostability of either MelB is largely increased in MNG- 3 or GDN. Therefore, the functional defect with DDM or UDM likely results from the relative instability of the sensitive MelB proteins, and stability, as well as galactoside binding, is retained in MNG- 3 or GDN. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorirnetry of melibiose binding with MelB(st) shows that the favorable entropic contribution to the binding free energy is decreased in MNG- 3, indicating that the conformational dynamics of MelB is restricted in this detergent.

40|$|Soy-based {{adhesives}} inherently possess {{low water}} resistance and brittleness, which limit their application on plywood fabrication. This investigation involves using a long chain cross-linker, <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> diglycidyl ether (NGDE), {{to produce an}} intrinsic toughening effect to reduce the brittleness and improve the water resistance of a soybean meal–based adhesive. The solids content, viscosity, functional groups, fracture surface micrographs, and thermal stability of the adhesives were measured. Three-layer plywood was fabricated using the resultant adhesive, and the tensile shear strength of the plywood was measured. All adhesive properties were compared with a soybean meal/polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) adhesive and commercial melamine urea formaldehyde resin. The results showed that adding 6 g NGDE improved the water resistance of the soybean meal-based adhesive by 12. 5 %. This improvement is attributed to the following reasons: (1) a dense cross-linked network is formed by the chemical reaction between NGDE and protein molecules; (2) the toughness of the adhesive increases and a smooth and homogeneous fracture surface is created, which effectively prevents moisture intrusion; (3) the addition of NGDE increases the thermostability of the cured adhesive. The tensile shear strength of the plywood bonded with the soybean meal-based adhesive with 6 g NGDE was 286. 2 % higher than that without NGDE and attained 1. 12 MPa, which was attributed to {{the reduction in the}} adhesive’s viscosity, and the improvement in the water resistance and toughness of the adhesive. The tensile shear strength of the plywood bonded with 6 g NGDE was 19. 1 % higher than that with 6 g PAE and was similar to the MUF resin, which validated the novel adhesive being suitable for use as an industrial plywood adhesive...|$|E
30|$|An ideal {{lubricant}} {{for most}} purposes {{is one that}} maintains a constant viscosity throughout temperature changes. Variation in the viscosity with change in temperature of a lubricant is determined by viscosity index (VI). The importance of the VI can be shown easily by considering automotive lubricants. Oil having a high VI resists excessive thickening when the engine is cold, and consequently, promotes rapid starting and prompt circulation. It resists excessive thinning when the motor is hot and thus provides full lubrication and prevents excessive oil consumption. A very high VI is a desirable property of lubricant due to its ability to resist oxidation and thermal exposure [50]. The VI of an oil may be determined if its viscosity at any two temperatures is known. The viscosity index of JBL shown in Table  6 {{was found to be}} 204 using the kinematic viscosity values at 40 and 100  °C. Sripada [44] reported VI of 193 and 204 for the synthesis of biolubricant from methyl oleate and canola biodiesel, respectively. Similarly, Gryglewicz et al. [51] recorded high VI range of 209 – 235 for the synthesis of <b>neopentyl</b> <b>glycol</b> and trimethylolpropane esters of olive oil, rapeseed oil and lard fatty acids. Yunus et al. [6] found that TMP esters of palm and palm kernel oils exhibited very high VI of 167 – 187. According to Ghazi et al. [11] and Rao et al. [49], VI of 180 for Jatropha curcas-derived TMP esters and 162 – 172 for polyol esters of 10 -undecenoic acid were obtained. Furthermore, Åkerman et al. [52] reported that TMP esters of C 5 –C 18 fatty acids had VI of 80 – 208. When compared with previous results, JBL had shown a relatively favourable VI.|$|E
