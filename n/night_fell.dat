5|$|Again {{waiting until}} late afternoon, the Allies took the {{opportunity}} to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as <b>night</b> <b>fell.</b> These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as <b>night</b> <b>fell.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} continued unabated {{north of}} Taegu on the 15th. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, still fought {{to gain control}} of Hill 570 {{on the east side of}} the Tabu-dong highway. On the other side, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked Hill 401 where a North Korean force had penetrated in a gap between the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments. The fighting on Hill 401 was particularly severe. Both sides had troops on the mountain when <b>night</b> <b>fell.</b>|$|E

5|$|A third frigate {{was visible}} on the horizon. Emerald {{immediately}} set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The {{need to make the}} two captured frigates ready to sail delayed Leviathan, and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape. Leviathan then returned to rendezvous with Emerald, managing to take a further enemy brig before <b>night</b> <b>fell.</b> The following day, both British vessels sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.|$|E
5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the first <b>night</b> <b>fell</b> apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England, once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E
5|$|An {{air attack}} from the Formidable had {{disabled}} the cruiser Pola and Iachino, unaware of Cunningham's pursuing battlefleet, ordered a squadron of cruisers and destroyers to return and protect the Pola. Cunningham, meanwhile, was joining up with Pridham-Wippell's cruiser squadron. Throughout the day several chases and sorties occurred with no overall victor. None of the Italian ships were equipped for night fighting, and when <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> they made to return to Taranto. The British battlefleet equipped with radar detected the Italians shortly after 22:00. In a pivotal moment in naval warfare during the Second World War, the battleships Barham, Valiant and Warspite opened fire on two Italian cruisers at only 3,800 yards (3.5km), destroying them in only five minutes.|$|E

60|$|The winter <b>nights</b> <b>fell</b> early, {{the lamp}} was lighted before tea-time, the {{shutters}} were closed, {{they were all}} shut {{into the room with}} the tension and stress. Mrs. Brangwen went early to bed, Anna playing on the floor beside her. Brangwen sat in the emptiness of the downstairs room, smoking, scarcely conscious even of his own misery. And very often he went out to escape it.|$|R
5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe {{to give up the}} ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{failed to}} breach the Lacedaimonian defences and when <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> he withdrew {{back to his}} camp. According to Plutarch, Pyrrhus {{received}} an omen during the night. As he slept, he dreamt of Sparta being smitten and set alight by thunderbolts coming from his own hand. While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E
5|$|The Spartans {{were caught}} unawares by Pyrrhus' invasion. Areus {{had taken the}} {{majority}} of the Spartan army with him to Crete, where he was campaigning on behalf of Gortyn at the request of Ptolemaic Egypt. The result was that the settlement was lightly defended. Arriving at Sparta as <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack the city immediately. However, the Epiriote declined to as he was fearful of the damage that would be wrought by Gallic troops if they entered the city at night and moreover expected the sparsely defended city to surrender in the morning.|$|E

5|$|With no aid {{possible}} from the shore, <b>night</b> <b>fell</b> on 14January {{with most of the}} crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and not one of these small craft survived the passage.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00, Ceylon spotted Hamelin's {{ships in}} pursuit and her crew {{increased}} {{their efforts to}} escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> Gordon slowed Ceylon by shortening sail {{in the hope of}} meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with Ceylon, which began firing on the larger French frigate as she passed. Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing Ceylon and tuning across her bows to open a raking fire.|$|E
5|$|Murat and Kellermann {{immediately}} {{pounced on}} the supporting Liechtenstein Dragoons who were {{too slow to}} respond and routed them as well. The fleeing Austrian horsemen crashed {{into the ranks of}} Pilatti's rattled troopers and carried them away. As the mob of terrified cavalry stampeded past them, the exhausted Austrian infantry of the main body lost heart, provoking a wild rush to the rear. The gun teams fled, pursued by French cavalry, while their whole infantry line advanced westward. The second grenadier brigade under GM Karl Philippi von Weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed Boudet’s advance long enough for O’Reilly’s cavalry to return, and together with Frimont, they mounted a last defense around Marengo village as <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> allowing the Austrian centre to reach safety behind the Bormida. Ott with the Austrian left failed to intervene and found his retreat through Castel Ceriolo blocked by French troops advancing northwest from the centre, but managed to fight {{his way back to the}} Bormida bridgehead.|$|E

5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} the platoon, including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As <b>night</b> <b>fell</b> the North Vietnamese refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying more than two dozen wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through the North Vietnamese lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again stepped out into the open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven {{other members of the}} platoon were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded. The North Vietnamese forces lost 49.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong {{were able}} to pick off one South Vietnamese paratrooper after another, some as they descended and others when their parachutes became stuck in the trees. Those paratroopers who reached the ground and survived tried to move forward, but the Viet Cong {{soldiers}} in defilade position fired on the paratroopers exposed in the open rice paddies. Undeterred, the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion launched small-unit attacks, but on each occasion they were repelled, and sporadic fighting continued until sundown. By {{the end of the}} day, the airborne battalion had lost 19 soldiers killed in action and another 33 wounded. American advisers Captain Fletcher Ware and Sergeant Russell Kopti, who had parachuted in with the South Vietnamese, were also wounded. As <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> Hoang knew that South Vietnamese forces were closing in from three directions. The eastern flank remained open, and he ordered both elements of the 261st and 514th Battalions, exhausted and low on ammunition, to assemble {{at the south end of}} Ap Tan Thoi. They evacuated through the rice fields, taking their dead and wounded comrades.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's army heavily outnumbered Edward's, {{although}} sources {{differ on}} exact numbers. Lancastrian strength ranges from 10,000–30,000 men, with 7,000–15,000 on the Yorkist side. Facing this disadvantage, Edward hurried {{to meet the}} Lancastrians with a surprise attack. He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king. Edward reached Barnet in the evening, and without knowing the precise location of his foes, prepared the battle line. The Yorkist king deployed Hastings {{on the left and}} entrusted Gloucester to lead the right flank. Clarence would fight alongside Edward in the centre, although this was not due to faith in his ability—it was easier for the Yorkists {{to keep an eye on}} their twice-defected prince there. A contingent of reserves was kept at the rear, ready to deploy at Edward's call. As <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> Edward put his plan for surprise morning attack in motion. Under a strict order of silence, the Yorkist army crept closer to the Lancastrians. During the night, neither commander spotted the opposing army, an event that proved crucial in the battle the next day.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten more}} days, the ships spotted an inlet close Champotón, and a landing party {{discovered}} fresh water. Armed Maya warriors approached from the city, and communication was attempted with signs. <b>Night</b> <b>fell</b> {{by the time}} the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded. By sunrise the Spanish had been surrounded by a sizeable army. The massed Maya warriors launched an assault and all of the Spanish party received wounds in the frantic melee that followed, including Hernández de Córdoba. The Spanish regrouped and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them. By the end of the battle, the Spanish had lost over fifty men, more than half their number, and five more men died from their wounds in the following days. The battle had lasted only an hour. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba, so one was abandoned. The ship's pilot then steered a course for Cuba via Florida, and Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Diego Velázquez describing the voyage and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds.|$|E
5|$|Amid strong resistance, the Australians {{were made}} to fight {{their way through the}} maze of bunkers, punji stakes and booby traps but they were {{eventually}} able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance. The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches, one of which blew McFarlane and several of his men off their feet. The defenders subsequently withdrew, with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east. Suspecting they were being drawn into a trap—as one of the American battalions of the brigade had been previously during Operation Hump—the Australians moved into a tightly defended perimeter before dark and waited for the communists to counter-attack. As <b>night</b> <b>fell,</b> movement was detected along a trench on the C Company perimeter when a squad of Viet Cong attempted to infiltrate the Australian position. Initially believing the movement to be another Australian patrol that had just departed on a clearing patrol, the machine-gunner on sentry duty finally opened fire at the last safe moment, killing one of the infiltrators at point-blank range and wounding a number of others before they withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the {{combined}} squadron {{was ready to}} sail again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, having effected its own hasty repairs, set off in pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack {{the combined}} squadron as best they were able to. The fastest ship was HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless <b>night</b> <b>fell.</b> Superb fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun Real Carlos on fire and capturing the Saint Antoine. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, Real Carlos inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship San Hermenegildo, spreading the fire to its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as HMS Venerable took {{the lead of the}} British line, attacking the rearmost French ship Formidable under Captain Amable Troude. In a furious and protracted engagement, Venerable suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.|$|E
