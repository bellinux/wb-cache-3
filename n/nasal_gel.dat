40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nasal absorption of progesterone from carbopol-based <b>nasal</b> <b>gels</b> in rabbits. Progesterone <b>nasal</b> <b>gels</b> were prepared by dispersing carbopol 974 (1 %, 1. 5 %, and 2 %) in distilled water followed by addition of progesterone/progesterone–β cyclodextrin complex dissolved in propylene glycol then neutralization. The potential use of β cyclodextrin (CD) as nasal absorption enhancer by simple addition, as a physical mixture and as a complex with progesterone was investigated. The absolute bioavailability of progesterone from <b>nasal</b> <b>gels</b> in rabbits was studied by estimating the serum progesterone level by competitive solid-phase enzyme immunoassay in comparison to intravenous injection. The carbopol gel formulations produced a significant increase in bioavailability. CD complex promotes the nasal absorption of progesterone from carbopol gels as compared with gels where the CD is added by simple addition and gels which do not contain CD.

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and evaluate a mucoadhesive, thermoreversible in situ <b>nasal</b> <b>gel</b> of geniposide. The poloxamers (P 407, P 188) and the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were used as thermoreversible and mucoadhesive polymers, respectively. Borneol was used as a permeation enhancer. The hydrogel was prepared with the cold method and optimized by the response surface methodology-central composite design. Gelation temperature, pH, clarity, gel strength, mucoadhesive strength, in vitro and ex vivo release kinetics of formulations were evaluated. The optimized amounts of poloxamer 407 (P 407), poloxamer 188 (P 188) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were determined to be 19. 4 - 20. 5 %, 1. 1 - 4. 0 % and 0. 3 - 0. 6 % respectively. The second-order polynomial equation in terms of actual factors indicated a satisfactory correlation between the independent variables and the response (R 2 = 0. 9760). An ANOVA of the empirical second-order polynomial model indicated the model was significant (P< 0. 01). P 407, P 188, P 407 ×P 188, P 4072 and P 1882 were significant model terms. The effects of P 407 on gelation temperature were greater than those of other independent variables. The pH values of all the formulations were found to be within 6. 3 - 6. 5 which was in the nasal physiological pH range 4. 5 - 6. 5. The drug content, gel strength, mucoadhesive strength of the optimized formulations were 97 - 101 %, 25 - 50 sec and 4000 - 6000 dyn/cm 2 respectively. The in vitro release kinetics of cumulative release of geniposide was fitted to the zero-order model. The ex vivo cumulative release kinetics of geniposide was fitted to the Weibull model. This study concludes that the release of geniposide is controlled by gel corrosion, and that the permeation of geniposide is time-dependent.

The objective of the present investigation {{was to develop a}} mucoadhesive in situ gel with reduced nasal mucocilliary clearance in order to improve the bioavailability of the antiemetic drug, Metoclopramide Hydrochloride. The in situ gelation upon contact with nasal mucosa was conferred via the use of the thermogelling Methyl cellulose whereas mucoadhesion and drug release enhancement were modulated via the use of sodium alginate and polyethylene glycol polymers respectively. The results revealed that the mucoadhesive polymer increased the gel viscosity but reduced its sol gel transition temperatures and the drug release. The inclusion of polyethylene glycol polymer counteracted the effect of mucoadhesive polymer where by it decreased the gel consistency and increased the sol gel transition as well as in vitro drug diffusion. The in vitro tests performed for mucoadhesive strength and drug diffusion showed that nasal in situ gelling formulations prepared are having good mucoadhesive strength with nearly 100 % drug diffusion within four hours. So this study points to the potential of mucoadhesive in situ <b>nasal</b> <b>gel</b> in terms of ease of administration, accuracy of dosing, prolonged nasal residence and improved nasal bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to prepare mucoadhesive in situ nasal gels with mucilage isolated from fig fruits (Ficus carica, family: Moraceae) containing midazolam hydrochloride. Nasal gels of midazolam were prepared using three different concentrations (0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % w/v) of F. carica mucilage (FCM) and synthetic polymers (hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and Carbopol 934). Evaluation of FCM showed that it was as safe as the synthetic polymers for nasal administration. In situ gels were prepared with mixture Pluronic F 127 and mucoadhesive agents. Evaluation of the prepared gels was carried out, including determination of viscosity, texture profile analysis and mucoadhesive strength. In vitro drug permeation study was conducted with the gels prepared with and without permeation enhancer (0. 5 % w/v sodium taurocholate) using excised goat nasal mucosa. In vitro permeation profiles were evaluated, and histological study of nasal mucosae before and after permeation study was also conducted to determine histological change, if any. In vivo experiments conducted in rabbits further confirmed that in situ nasal gels provided better bioavailability of midazolam than the gels prepared from synthetic mucoadhesive polymers. It was observed that the <b>nasal</b> <b>gel</b> containing 0. 5 % FCM and 0. 5 % sodium taurocholate exhibited appropriate rheological, mechanical and mucoadhesive properties and showed better drug release profiles. Moreover, this formulation produced no damage to the nasal mucosa that was used for the permeation study, and absolute bioavailability was also higher compared to gels prepared from synthetic polymers...|$|E

The in situ gelation upon contact with nasal mucosa was conferred via the use of the thermogelling Pluronic flake 127 (18 %). Mucoadhesion was modulated via the use of hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (Na CMC) and sodium alginate (Na-alginate) whereas drug release was modified by varying concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000). The results revealed that the different mucoadhesives increased the gel viscosity but reduced its sol gel transition temperatures. The increase in viscosity was highest in formulations with Na-alginate and lowest in formulations with HPMC. PEG 6000 significantly decreased mucoadhesive strength of formula containing 0. 3 % HPMC (776. 6 ± 19. 55 to 713. 6 ± 5. 03), 0. 2 % Na CMC (656 ± 11. 13 to 575 ± 9. 07) and 0. 2 % Na-alginate (659 ± 11. 13 to 618. 3 ± 9. 45) whereas the gelation temperature increased by 3 to 4 °C. 100 % of drug diffusion was found at four hours for formulation F 5, F 9, and F 12. Formulation F 5 showed maximum permeability (0. 00949 ± 0. 00021 mg. cm/min) than other formulation containing PEG 6000. This study concluded the potential use of mucoadhesive in situ <b>nasal</b> <b>gel</b> in terms of ease of administration, accuracy of dosing, prolonged nasal residence and improved nasal bioavailability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Developing {{strategies}} for controlling {{the severity of}} pandemic influenza is a global public health priority. In {{the event of a}} pandemic there may be a place for inexpensive, readily available, effective adjunctive therapies to support containment strategies such as prescription antivirals, vaccines, quarantine and restrictions on travel. Inactivation of virus in the intranasal environment is one possible approach. The work described here investigated the sensitivity of influenza viruses to low pH, and the activity of low pH nasal sprays on the course of an influenza infection in the ferret model. Methods Inactivation of influenza A and avian reassortment influenza was determined using in vitro solutions tests. Low pH nasal sprays were tested using the ferret model with an influenza A Sydney/ 5 / 97 challenge. Clinical measures were shed virus, weight loss and body temperature. Results The virus inactivation studies showed that influenza viruses are rapidly inactivated by contact with acid buffered solutions at pH 3. 5. The titre of influenza A Sydney/ 5 / 97 [H 3 N 2] was reduced by at least 3 log cycles with one minute contact with buffers based on simple acid mixtures such as L-pyroglutamic acid, succinic acid, citric acid and ascorbic acid. A pH 3. 5 <b>nasal</b> <b>gel</b> composition containing pyroglutamic acid, succinic acid and zinc acetate reduced titres of influenza A Hong Kong/ 8 / 68 [H 3 N 2] by 6 log cycles, and avian reassortment influenza A/Washington/ 897 / 80 X A Mallard/New York/ 6750 / 78 [H 3 N 2] by 5 log cycles, with 1 min contact. Two ferret challenge studies, with influenza A Sydney/ 5 / 97, demonstrated a reduction in the severity of the disease with early application of low pH nasal sprays versus a saline control. In the first study there was decreased weight loss in the treatment groups. In the second study there were reductions in virus shedding and weight loss, most notably when a gelling agent was added to the low pH formulation. Conclusion These findings indicate the potential of a low pH nasal spray as an adjunct to current influenza therapies, and warrant further investigation in humans. </p...|$|E
