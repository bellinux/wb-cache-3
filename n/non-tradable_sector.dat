5000|$|The [...] "spending effect" [...] {{occurs as}} a result of the extra revenue brought in by the {{resource}} boom. It increases demand for labor in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> (services), at the expense of the lagging sector. This shift from the lagging sector to the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> is called indirect-deindustrialization. The increased demand for non-traded goods increases their price. However, prices in the traded good sector are set internationally, so they cannot change. This amounts to an increase in the real exchange rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{tradable}} sector of a country's economy {{is made up}} of the industry sectors whose output in terms of goods and services are traded internationally, or could be traded internationally given a plausible variation in relative prices. Most commonly, the {{tradable sector}} consists largely of sectors of the manufacturing industry, while the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> consists of locally-rendered services, including health, education, retail and construction.|$|E
50|$|However, other {{theories}} {{suggest that}} this is detrimental, for example when the natural resources deplete. Also, prices may decrease and competitive manufacturing cannot return {{as quickly as it}} left. This may happen because technological growth is smaller in the booming sector and the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> than the non-booming tradable sector. Because that economy had smaller technological growth than did other countries, its comparative advantage in non-booming tradable goods will have shrunk, thus leading firms not to invest in the tradables sector.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the total factor {{productivity}} of the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> in China. In this paper we estimate productivity growth of the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> by studying the relative price movements of the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> vis-à-vis the tradable sectors, i. e. changes in the internal real exchange rate. We find that prices of the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> have risen significantly faster than those of the tradable sectors, and China’s internal real exchange rate has appreciated at a faster pace than the renminbi real effective exchange rate. We also find the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> have seen much lower productivity growth than the tradable sectors, and such productivity differentials are large when compared to other economies. We argue that if productivity growth in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> remains slow, China will likely see more difficulty in rebalancing its growth pattern and higher inflationary pressures in the medium term.

The employment data covers 21 economic subsectors and 123 regions in 2000, 2005 and 2010. In the baseline model, for each new job in the tradable sectors, 4. 0 jobs were created locally in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors.</b> Also, it was estimated that each job in the high-tech tradable sectors creates 6. 9 jobs in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> in the long term...|$|R

The study found the local multiplier effect to be zero and occasionally negative in all regions of Italy. In explaining this discrepancy, the authors points to excessive government regulation in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector,</b> the government’s role in wage setting, and barriers to labor mobility.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{economic}} model describing Dutch disease {{was developed by}} the economists W. Max Corden and J. Peter Neary in 1982. In the model, there is a <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> (which includes services) and two tradable sectors: the booming sector, and the lagging (or non-booming) tradable sector. The booming sector is usually the extraction of natural resources such as oil, natural gas, gold, copper, diamonds or bauxite, or the production of crops, such as coffee or cocoa. The lagging sector is usually manufacturing or agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the span}} between 1973 to 1985, Thailand {{experienced}} a 36% fall in trade, stagnating GDP growth, sharp inflation, and increasing current account deficit coupled with increasing external debt. In order to counter this trend, Thailand entered into IMF backed adjustment {{program in which}} it devalued its currency while implementing stricter fiscal policies. The structural changes that this period of adjustment implemented resulted in 10 years of strong economic performance. Between 1987 to 1989, the GDP grew at over 10%, inflation dropped to just 5 percent, and current account deficit was less than 3% of the GDP. [...] Despite this, some argue that the short-term focused structural changes in the 1980's were the catalysts for Thailand's economic crisis just 10 years later in 1997. Specifically, most of {{the growth in the}} ten years following the 1983 IMF adjustments were in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> rather than the export-oriented tradable sector. Furthermore, the IMF adjustments cut infrastructure investment from 8.9% of total GDP to just 5.2% in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Rudi Dornbusch (1998) {{and others}} say that income rises can change the ratio of demand for goods and {{services}} (tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors).</b> This is because services tend to be superior goods, which are consumed proportionately more heavily at higher incomes.|$|R
50|$|The {{size of the}} {{multiplier}} effect on the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> {{is determined by the}} interplay of three factors: consumer preference for non-tradables, the types of jobs created, and the elasticity of local labor and housing supply. Consumer preference refers to certain non-tradable goods and services requiring more workers to provide them than others. If the tradable industry has high demand for a type of non-tradable good that needs more workers to be produced then the multiplier will be higher. Types of jobs created refers to the fact that certain job categories generally have higher pay than others. Higher pay results in larger amounts of disposable income that can be spent on the local economy. This results in a higher multiplier. Elasticity of local labor and housing supply refers to that the fact whenever there is an influx of new people with higher than average wages to an area, average prices will rise. This can in turn push out some residents with below average wages into lower cost areas. This results in a lower multiplier.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{scholars}} have found strong {{evidence for the}} presence of the local multiplier effect. Within tradable industries, Enrico Moretti discovered that, for each additional skilled job created, 2.5 jobs were also generated in the local non-tradable goods and services sectors, and an additional unskilled job created 1 job in the local <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector.</b> [...] Highly skilled sectors such as technology have the highest multiplier effect with five non-tradable jobs for each technology job. Moretti cites the example of Apple Computers which directly employs only 13,000 workers but generates 60,000 additional service jobs in the area. Of those 60,000, 36,000 are unskilled, such as restaurant or retail workers, while 24,000 are skilled jobs such as doctors or lawyers.Other academics have taken issue with the large magnitude of the local multiplier effect claimed by Moretti. One study reanalyzes the claim of Enrico Moretti that five non-tradable jobs are created for each highly skilled tradable job. Using a modified version of Moretti’s method it found that the true multiplier effect was only 1.02 non-tradable jobs created. Furthermore the study finds that there is no difference on the local multiplier effect between whether the tradable job is skilled or unskilled.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "by new machines" [...] {{effect is}} now rarely {{discussed}} by economists; {{it is often}} accepted that Marx successfully refuted it. Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the [...] "by new products" [...] effect can sometimes {{have a positive effect}} on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process' and 'product' innovations. Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation. The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved. One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job multiplier. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector.</b> His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job-creation in high-tech industries might have a more significant spillover effect than we have anticipated. Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect, showing local high-tech jobs could create five additional low-tech jobs.|$|E

The analysis focused on private sector workers, and compared workers in tradable sectors (sectors in direct competition with the foreign trade) with workers in <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> (not in direct competition with foreign goods).

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the tradable/non-tradable division to economic theory, there has been little empirical analysis reflecting this division {{due to a lack of}} reliable data. This working paper seeks to address the lack of adequate information on the classification, output and prices for the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> of the Australian economy, using a classification system developed by Dwyer (1992) as a starting point. In most previous analyses, the classification of output as tradable or non-tradable is based upon untested a priori reasoning. The output and price measures developed in this paper have attempted to address the acknowledged weaknesses of previous measures and the adopted methodology is an improvement upon previous methods. The improvements are due to the use of an objective and consistent classification system, the disaggregated level of the analysis, the ability to capture changes in the composition of sectors, the breakdown of the tradable sector into its importable and exportable components, the consideration of the choice of price index formula, and the detailed matching of price data to input-output industry. Several important features have been revealed in Australian data. The size of Australia's tradable sector is significantly smaller than many previous estimates have indicated. The composition of the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> has changed significantly between 1977 - 78 and 1989 - 90, and {{the importance}} of the exportable and tradable sectors has increased over the past decade. The relative importance of individual industries within the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> has also been identified. The development of price indexes for the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> of the Australian economy has revealed the relative volatility of the prices of tradable (especially exportable) commodities compared to non-tradable commodities, and a significant improvement in Australia's internal competitiveness (as measured by relative domestic prices) since 1980. Valuable information has been obtained about the size, composition and price movements for the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> in Australia over the period 1977 to 1995. To the extent that the adopted methodology provides an accurate representation of the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors,</b> the data presented in this paper can be applied to the empirical analysis of a range of topics to which the tradable/non-tradable dichotomy is relevant. Given {{the importance of}} this division to modelling the features of a small, open economy such as Australia, the development of this dataset opens up empirical research opportunities which the lack of adequate data had previously served to limit. Consideration is being given to releasing a tradables database, containing the series outlined in this working paper, on a regular basis. However, this is dependent upon sufficient interest being demonstrated in the sectoral profile, output and price index data compiled in this project...|$|R
40|$|The Balassa-Samuelson {{hypothesis}} - i. e. {{that real}} exchange rates between {{each pair of}} countries increase with the tradables sector productivities ratio between these countries, and decrease with their <b>non-tradables</b> <b>sector</b> productivities ratio - {{has been one of}} the most prominent frameworks in open economy macroeconomics for more than 40 years. However, empirical studies have often been unable to confirm it. We argue that this might at least in part be due to measurement errors leading to downward-biased estimates. We test the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis with innovative trade-based variety measures to differentiate between tradables and <b>non-tradables</b> <b>sector</b> productivities that do not suffer from such errors-in-variables. Using a pairwise regression approach, we find stable and very robust Balassa-Samuelson effects over all our specifications.

50|$|Reserve {{accumulation}} can be {{an instrument}} {{to interfere with the}} exchange rate. Since the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1948 to the foundation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, the regulation of trade is a major concern for most countries throughout the world. Hence, commercial distortions such as subsidies and taxes are strongly discouraged. However, there is no global framework to regulate financial flows. As an example of regional framework, members of the European Union are prohibited from introducing capital controls, except in an extraordinary situation. The dynamics of China’s trade balance and reserve accumulation during {{the first decade of the}} 2000 was one of the main reasons for the interest in this topic.Some economists are trying to explain this behavior. Usually, the explanation is based on a sophisticated variation of mercantilism, such as to protect the take-off in the tradable sector of an economy, by avoiding the real exchange rate appreciation that would naturally arise from this process. One attempt uses a standard model of open economy intertemporal consumption to show that it is possible to replicate a tariff on imports or a subsidy on exports by closing the current account and accumulating reserves. Another is more related to the economic growth literature. The argument is that the tradable sector of an economy is more capital intense than the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector.</b> The private sector invests too little in capital, since it fails to understand the social gains of a higher capital ratio given by externalities (like improvements in human capital, higher competition, technological spillovers and increasing returns to scale). The government could improve the equilibrium by imposing subsidies and tariffs, but the hypothesis is that the government is unable to distinguish between good investment opportunities and rent seeking schemes. Thus, reserves accumulation would correspond to a loan to foreigners to purchase a quantity of tradable goods from the economy. In this case, the real exchange rate would depreciate and the growth rate would increase. In some cases, this could improve welfare, since the higher growth rate would compensate the loss of the tradable goods that could be consumed or invested. In this context, foreigners have the role to choose only the useful tradable goods sectors.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact of bank consolidation (market power) and country-level institutional development on macroeconomic performance. In general, the empirical results from a sample of commercial banks in 11 Asian countries over the period 2002 - 2007, show that greater bank market power enhances macroeconomic performance, which {{would not be the}} case as economic freedoms increase. If we consider different economic sectors, greater bank market power only enhances tradable sector growth, but impedes <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> growth. On the contrary, as economic freedoms increase, greater bank market power deteriorates tradable sector growth, but boosts <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> growth. In countries with higher economic freedoms, therefore, enhancing bank competition is necessary, since greater bank market power impedes productive growth through tradable sector and spurs booms in <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector,</b> which may result in an increase in speculations. ...|$|E

For a skilled-intensive <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> we show that improvements {{in the terms of}} trade benefit skilled workers.

40|$|Cross-country income {{differences}} {{for the most}} part reflect differences in total factor produc-tivity (TFP) across countries. Furthermore, in less developed economies, TFP is particularly low in sectors producing tradable goods. In this paper, we provide a quantitatively-oriented model to explain such cross-country patterns in aggregate and sectoral TFP. We start by documenting that an important difference between tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> is their average estab-lishment size: Tradable establishments operate at much larger scales. In our model, financial frictions disproportionately affect TFP of the large-scale sector, which has more financing needs. Our quantitative exercises show that financial frictions explain a substantial part of the observed cross-country patterns in TFP both at the aggregate and the sectoral levels. Our model also has novel implications for the impact of financial frictions on the relative scale between tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors,</b> which are consistent with data...|$|R

40|$|Episodes {{of large}} capital inflows in small open economies are often {{associated}} with a shift of resources from the tradable to the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> and sometimes lead to balance-of-payments crises. This article builds a two-sector dynamic model to study {{the evolution of the}} sectoral structure and its impact on financial fragility. The model embeds a static mechanism of balance-of-payments crisis which produces multiple equilibria within a single time period when the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> is large enough compared to the tradable sector. The article studies the dynamics induced by an increase in financial openness. It shows that the relative size of the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> overshoots, which makes the economy more likely to be financially fragile during the transitory dynamics. Using an extended version of the model, the article conducts a quantitative analysis and shows that this mechanism accounts well for several episodes of large capital inflows that led to financial crises.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple two-country {{model in which}} each economy consists of two sectors: a competitive <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> and an oligopolistic tradable sector. We investigate two related issues that arise in response to trade liberalization. First, we examine the linkage between trade liberalization {{and the nature of}} merger incentives in the oligopolistic tradable sector. We find that trade liberalization changes the industry structure leading to cross border mergers. Next, we explore the impact of this change on the labour market of the competitive <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector.</b> It is found that the employment and wage impacts of the fall in the price of tradable goods depend on the price elasticity of demand for tradable goods and non-tradable goods, and the share of the tradable intermediate goods in the total cost of production of non-tradables. As a result, the positive employment impact is certain only if the demand for tradable goods is inelastic, while labour and tradable intermediate goods are complements.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} an environmental tax reform in {{a model of a}} small open economy with decentralised wage bargaining and monopolistically competitive firms. The economy includes a tradable sector as well as a <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> and features unemployment in general equilibrium. Firms in both sectors use labour and an imported polluting factor of production ("energy"). A tax on energy, recycled to reduce the payroll tax, will in general affect equilibrium unemployment in this economy. The effect works through a reallocation of employment from the tradable to the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector.</b> Total employment increases if workers in the tradable sector receive a wage premium relative to workers in the <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector.</b> The sectoral relative wage is determined by the relative bargaining power of the unions and by parameters of preferences and technology.

While most studies in this field have so far concentrated on aggregate variables, we pursue a sectoral approach distinguishing between the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors.</b> First, we present {{a survey of the}} relevant theoretical and empirical literature. This demonstrates that evaluations of exchange rate regimes and their impact on the real economy are largely dependent on specific assumptions concerning, in particular, the parameters of a utility function, the nature of the price adjustment process and the characteristics of the shocks analysed. Second, we conduct an empirical analysis of the behaviour of the tradable and <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> under different exchange rate regimes in seven Central and Eastern European countries.

First, this article shows that employers in <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> confronted with strong trade unions support the regulation of wage standards in order to prevent foreign competitors from using lower wages as a competitive advantage. Second, the strategies of national employer associations (as protagonists, consenters or antagonists) are explained by sectoral power relationships within employer associations, trade union power resources and the risk of unilateral public intervention. A comparative case study analysis of regulation processes in Austria, Switzerland and Ireland shows that employer associations dominated by firms in <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sectors</b> are protagonists of wage regulation, while employer associations dominated by firms in tradable sectors consent to negotiate with trade unions about wage regulation in order to ensure labour acquiescence, or contain unilateral public intervention...|$|R

The {{research on the}} relationship between imperfections and output dynamics at the macro level are ample, but the lack of wide coverage micro data sets for developing countries limit the study of aggregate implications of the micro level capital market imperfections. This paper presents micro evidence on the credit market imperfections in Turkey and connects these imperfections to macro movements. First part of the paper documents the aggregate boom-bust cycles in Turkey and shows that <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> is more volatile over the business cycle than tradable sector. Additionally, this sector based asymmetry is found to be strongly correlated with aggregate credit movements. To establish the connection between the sector based asymmetries and the credit markets further, second part of the paper constructs two micro data sets. Using structural estimation, we find that <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> is financially more constrained than tradable sector. With <b>non-tradable</b> <b>sector</b> being more constrained, credit movements become an important determinant of boom-bust cycles. Therefore, we can establish that the asymmetry in the financial constraints of the different sectors at the micro level can generate the observed asymmetrical aggregate response of sectors over the business cycle.

We then use the longitudinal information on individual workers to decompose the average wage changes into changes in the skill composition of the workforce and changes in plant-year effects, which we interpret as measures of wage premia.
