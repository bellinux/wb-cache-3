5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry <b>Nomex</b> undergarment; this was followed by several layers of <b>Nomex</b> clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with <b>nomex</b> honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E

25|$|After the war, DuPont {{continued}} {{its emphasis on}} new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, <b>Nomex,</b> Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were {{critical to the success}} of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, DuPont {{developed}} many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, <b>Nomex,</b> Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, {{and later}} more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.|$|E
25|$|Kevlar is the {{registered}} trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as <b>Nomex</b> and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, this high-strength material was first commercially {{used in the}} early 1970s {{as a replacement for}} steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{shoelaces}} {{were made}} of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other materials used {{in the manufacture of}} rope. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant <b>nomex</b> are applied in safety boots for firefighters.|$|E
25|$|Pilots, Naval Flight Officers, and Naval Aircrewmen are {{authorized}} to wear green or desert flight suits (made of <b>nomex</b> for fire protection), with rank insignia for officers stitched on the shoulders, and a name tag/warfare insignia {{on the left}} breast pocket. Either a Command/Navy ballcap or a Khaki Garrison Cap (for Commissioned Officers and CPOs) are worn with this uniform. Green flight suits are the standard wear; however, wing commanders may authorize desert flight suits for personnel located in hot climates. As of 2012, flight suits may now be worn off base {{in the same manner}} as the Navy Working Uniform.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of MDP officers are employed on firearms duties and wear black polo-type shirts and trousers with black jackets. Headdress depends on role, and {{is either a}} police baseball cap, or the standard UK police checkered flat cap (for men) or bowler hat (for women). Officers are still issued with custodian helmets and those engaged in general police duties, such as Defence Community Police Officers, may wear them while on patrol. Ballistic body armour is issued to all officers, and a black Kevlar helmet can also be worn by officers engaged on firearms duties, when required. Specialist MDP officers of the Tactical Support Group and Special Escort Group often wear dark blue <b>Nomex</b> coveralls operationally.|$|E
25|$|The SOCATA TBM is a single-engined turboprop-powered low-wing monoplane, {{capable of}} seating {{a maximum of}} seven people. It is {{composed}} mainly of aluminium and steel construction, but with the tail surfaces built of <b>Nomex</b> honeycomb. The wing features a very effective Fowler flap, comprising 80 per cent of the trailing edge's span, {{for the purpose of}} lowering the aircraft's stall speed. The TBM 700 is outfitted with a retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement, newer models feature stronger main landing gear wheels and tougher tyres. The TBM 900 model features automatic torque limiting for “set and forget” power management, which is of particularly use during takeoffs; according to Aviation Week, while this function does reduce the high workload associated with managing the PT6A engine, it is not as capable as a full FADEC arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The Solar Challenger was {{designed}} to be sturdier, more powerful, and more maneuverable than the Gossamer Penguin so as to be able to withstand sustained high-altitude flight and normal turbulence. It was over three times as heavy (without pilot) as the Gossamer Penguin and had a shorter wingspan, but was proportionately more powerful, with electricity supplied by 16,128 solar cells powering two three-horsepower motors. The solar panels were directly affixed to the wing and large horizontal stabilizer, both of which had to be flat on top to accommodate them. The two motors, each 3inches wide and 17inches long and incorporating samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, operated in tandem on a common shaft to drive a single, controllable-pitch propeller. The design incorporated advanced synthetic materials with very high strength to weight ratios, including Kevlar, <b>Nomex,</b> Delrin, Teflon, and Mylar, all supplied by the aircraft's sponsor, Dupont.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} Enterprise {{was not the}} same as that planned for , the first flight model; the aft {{fuselage}} was constructed differently, and it did not have the interfaces to mount OMS pods. A large number of subsystems—ranging from main engines to radar equipment—were not installed on Enterprise, but the capacity to add them in the future was retained, as NASA originally intended to refit the orbiter for spaceflight at the conclusion of its testing. Instead of a thermal protection system, its surface was primarily covered with simulated tiles made from polyurethane foam. Fiberglass was used for the leading edge panels in place of the reinforced carbon–carbon ones of spaceflight-worthy orbiters. Only a few sample thermal tiles and some <b>Nomex</b> blankets were real. Enterprise used fuel cells to generate its electrical power, but these were not sufficient to power the orbiter for spaceflight.|$|E
2500|$|To {{create a}} rugged, {{lightweight}} shell, Porsche adopted an aluminium and Aramid (Kevlar) composite for body use {{along with a}} <b>Nomex</b> floor, instead of the steel normally used on their production cars. The vehicle's weight of [...] helped to achieve its high performance level.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{conventional}} twin-engine installations, the centerline thrust arrangement reduces drag and maximizes the controllability {{of the aircraft}} should one engine malfunction or fail. [...] This engine configuration {{was used by the}} similar Cessna Skymaster. The A500 airframe is largely built of carbon fiber epoxy composite materials with a <b>Nomex</b> honeycomb core. Other features include cabin pressurization.|$|E
2500|$|For equipment, UNGERIN {{basically}} uses commercial scuba diver equipment. All operatives also {{equipped with}} lightweight PRO-TEC helmets, fire-resistant <b>Nomex</b> coveralls, or BDUs (battle dress uniform), Plate Carrier for carrying ammunition and specialist equipment, tactical gloves, balaclava or protective face covering, protective eye goggles, Gas mask, flashlight (usually a Surefire or Heckler & Koch brand), combat steel reinforced boots, flexi-cuffs, and thigh ammo. Ballistic vests including rigid plate inserts, are standard issue. These vests are labelled with [...] "POLICE", RMP insignia, or not labelled, {{to allow for}} easy identification. They often use drop leg holsters, while some officers prefer hip holsters.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{was also}} Brabham's first fully {{composite}} monocoque. Although {{the team had}} been the first in Formula One to make use of carbon fibre composite panels {{in the structure of the}} car in 1978, Murray had been reluctant to design a fully composite car until he understood how it would perform in a crash: he eventually persuaded Ecclestone to finance a fully instrumented crash test of a BT49 chassis. He was not happy to employ a two piece composite chassis, preferring to develop a technique which produced a seamless monocoque of carbon fibre/kevlar [...] composite over a <b>nomex</b> honeycomb. This structure was reinforced, like his earlier designs, by machined aluminium bulkheads.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, the GTX {{class of}} the IMSA GT Championship became obsolete, and was {{replaced}} by the IMSA GTP category. As a result, Ford needed a new car, as their Ford Mustang GTX was no longer eligible for competition. Bob Riley was selected to design the car, which, somewhat unusually, was front engined; it used a 2.1-litre turbocharged variant of the Ford Cosworth BDA straight-four engine, capable of producing around [...] Roush Performance and Protofab built the chassis and bodywork, which consisted of carbon fibre panels bonded to a carbon fibre and <b>Nomex</b> composite monocoque chassis, which was reinforced with Kevlar in key areas. The car's aerodynamics were configured to maximize the downforce generated by ground effects, although the suspension was fairly conventional; double wishbones with KONI coil-over springs, and adjustable sway bars {{at both ends of the}} car. Ford's chairman, Philip Caldwell, was positive about the car's development, stating that he felt it was [...] "a clear edge of technological development." [...] The car used a fairly conventional Hewland five-speed manual transmission to transmit the power, and it weighed approximately [...] Three cars were built as part of the program.|$|E
2500|$|Externally, Columbia was {{the first}} orbiter in the fleet whose surface was mostly covered with High & Low Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI/LRSI) tiles as its main thermal {{protection}} system (TPS), with white silicone rubber-painted <b>Nomex</b> – known as Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI) blankets – in some areas on the wings, fuselage and payload bay doors. FRSI once covered almost 25% of the orbiter; the first upgrade resulted in its removal from many areas, and in later flights it was only used on the upper section of the payload bay doors and inboard sections of the upper wing surfaces. The upgrade also involved replacing many of the white LRSI tiles on the upper surfaces with Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) blankets (also known as Fibrous Insulation Blankets, or FIBs) {{that had been used}} on Discovery and Atlantis. Originally, Columbia had 32,000 tiles – the upgrade reduced this to 24,300. The AFRSI blankets consisted of layers of pure silica felt sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric on the outside and S-Glass fabric on the inside, stitched together using pure silica thread in a 1-inch grid, then coated with a high-purity silica coating. The blankets were semi-rigid and could be made as large as 30" [...] by 30". Each blanket replaced as many as 25 tiles and was bonded directly to the orbiter. The direct application of the blankets to the orbiter resulted in weight reduction, improved durability, reduced fabrication and installation cost, and reduced installation schedule time. All of this work was performed during Columbia's first retrofitting and the post-Challenger stand-down.|$|E
50|$|Wildland firefighters wear <b>Nomex</b> {{shirts and}} {{trousers}} {{as part of}} their personal protective equipment during wildfire suppression activities. Race car drivers wear driving suits constructed of <b>Nomex</b> and or other fire retardant materials, along with <b>Nomex</b> gloves, long underwear, balaclavas, socks, helmet lining and shoes to protect them {{in the event of a}} fire.|$|E
50|$|In January 2007, the Army began {{shipping}} 160,000 flame-resistant <b>Nomex</b> uniforms {{for soldiers}} assigned to at-risk convoy operations. However, the <b>Nomex</b> uniforms restricted air movement {{more than the}} traditional Cotton/Nylon ACU and were hotter for soldiers to wear. Army equipment officials developed the ACS to provide soldiers with a lightweight, breathable alternative to the <b>Nomex</b> ACU.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nomex</b> {{and related}} aramid {{polymers}} {{are related to}} nylon, but have aromatic backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable. <b>Nomex</b> is the premier example of a meta variant of the aramids (Kevlar is a para aramid). Unlike Kevlar, <b>Nomex</b> cannot align during filament formation and has poorer strength. However, it has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance for a polymer material.|$|E
50|$|It {{is sold in}} both {{fiber and}} sheet forms and {{is used as a}} fabric {{wherever}} resistance from heat and flame is required. <b>Nomex</b> sheet is actually a calendered paper and made in a similar fashion. <b>Nomex</b> Type 410 paper is the original and one of the larger grade types made, mostly for electrical insulation purposes. <b>Nomex</b> fiber is made in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nomex</b> {{has also}} been used for its {{acoustic}} qualities, the first time being used in Troy, NY, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC's) main concert hall. A ceiling canopy of <b>Nomex</b> reflects high and mid frequency sound, providing reverberation, while letting lower frequency sound partially pass through the canopy. According to RPI President Shirley Ann Jackson, EMPAC is the first venue {{in the world to}} use <b>Nomex</b> for acoustic reasons.|$|E
