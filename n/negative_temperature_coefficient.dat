25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiter, temperature sensors (<b>Negative</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Coefficient</b> or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically).|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} and frequency dependencies of electrical parameters for polypropylene film capacitors are very low. Polypropylene film capacitors have a linear, <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of capacitance of ±2,5 % within their temperature range. Therefore, polypropylene film capacitors {{are suitable for}} applications in Class 1 frequency-determining circuits, filters, oscillator circuits, audio circuits, and timers. They are also useful for compensation of inductive coils in precision filter applications, and for high-frequency applications.|$|E

In some designs, the fuel and the coolant are the same fluid, so a loss of coolant removes the reactor's fuel. Unlike steam, fluoride salts dissolve poorly in water, and do not form burnable hydrogen. Unlike steel and solid uranium oxide, molten salts are not damaged by the core's neutron bombardment.|$|E

Below the ordering temperatures a strong local anisotropy develops causing high coercive fields and lack of saturation.

They are operated at low-voltage, high-current, DC and {{started with a}} high voltage pulse of 20 to 50kV. As an example, a 450 W lamp operates normally at 18 V and 25 A once started. They are also inherently unstable, prone to phenomena such as plasma oscillation and thermal runaway. Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{concepts}} {{rely on a}} <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of reactivity and a large possible {{temperature rise}} to limit reactivity excursions. As an additional method for shutdown, a separate, passively cooled container below the reactor can be included. In case of problems and for regular maintenance the fuel is drained from the reactor. This stops the nuclear reaction and acts as another second cooling system. Neutron-producing accelerators have been proposed for some super-safe subcritical experimental designs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} devices whose {{resistance}} changes with various quantities. The resistance of NTC thermistors exhibit a strong <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient,</b> making them useful for measuring temperatures. Since their resistance can be large {{until they are}} allowed to heat up due to the passage of current, they are also commonly used to prevent excessive current surges when equipment is powered on. Similarly, the resistance of a humistor varies with humidity. One sort of photodetector, the photoresistor, has a resistance which varies with illumination.|$|E
30|$|PR is {{affected}} by many parameters other than spectrum; therefore, its variation would not be exactly similar to spectrum parameters. Module temperature is another important parameter which affects PR significantly. Wafer-based technologies have stronger temperature dependence compared to a-Si-based thin film technology. All the three technologies have <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> in decreasing order from mc-Si > HIT > a-Si. The module temperature effect {{can be seen in}} the PR plot during the summer season. It shows that wafer-based technology modules give a much more reduction in PR compared to a-Si in the summer season, where the temperature goes up to 45  °C, which improves a-Si PR better than other technologies.|$|R

The region of negative slope in the I‐V curves of the NTC ceramics is progressively made positive with ZnO phase content, wherein ZnO grains function as a built‐in resistor in series to {{the resistance of the}} NTC phase. High α depends on the optimum phase content of ZnO as much as its intrinsic conductivity.

The results for the bromo-derivatives are compared with those reported for the corresponding chloro-derivatives...|$|R
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient,</b> typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to normal breakdown {{ratings of the}} device, power BJTs are subject to a failure mode called secondary breakdown, in which excessive current and normal imperfections in the silicon die cause portions of the silicon inside the device to become disproportionately hotter than the others. The electrical resistivity of doped silicon, like other semiconductors, has a <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient,</b> meaning that it conducts more current at higher temperatures. Thus, the hottest {{part of the die}} conducts the most current, causing its conductivity to increase, which then causes it to become progressively hotter again, until the device fails internally. The thermal runaway process associated with secondary breakdown, once triggered, occurs almost instantly and may catastrophically damage the transistor package.|$|E
25|$|In PWRs reactor {{power can}} be viewed as {{following}} steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. (See: <b>Negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient.)</b> Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the primary reactor coolant water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.|$|E

30|$|An AlGaN/GaN lateral reverse {{blocking}} current regulating diode (RB-CRD) with trench Schottky anode and hybrid trench cathode {{has been}} proposed and experimentally demonstrated on silicon substrate. The Schottky barrier diode (SBD) integrated in the anode exhibits a turn-on voltage of 0.7 [*]V and a reverse breakdown voltage of 260 [*]V. The hybrid trench cathode acts as a CRD, which is in series connection with the anode SBD. A knee voltage of 1.3 [*]V and a forward operation voltage beyond 200 [*]V can be achieved for the RB-CRD. The RB-CRD is capable of outputting an excellent steady current in a wide temperature range from 25 to 300 [*]°C.

25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or {{at a weld}} point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.|$|E
25|$|Inherent safety. LFTR designs use {{a strong}} <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of {{reactivity}} to achieve passive inherent safety against excursions of reactivity. The temperature dependence comes from 3 sources. The {{first is that}} thorium absorbs more neutrons if it overheats, the so-called Doppler effect. This leaves fewer neutrons to continue the chain reaction, reducing power. The second part is heating the graphite moderator, that usually causes a positive contribution to the temperature coefficient. The third effect {{has to do with}} thermal expansion of the fuel. If the fuel overheats, it expands considerably, which, due to the liquid nature of the fuel, will push fuel out of the active core region. In a small (e.g. the MSRE test reactor) or well moderated core this reduces the reactivity. However, in a large, under-moderated core (e.g. the ORNL MSBR design), less fuel salt means better moderation and thus more reactivity and an undesirable positive temperature coefficient.|$|E
500|$|One {{advantage}} that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters {{is that they}} can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5parts per billion (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range (...) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4ppb per day. This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the Young's modulus, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. [...] Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young's modulus. [...] In general, Young's modulus has a <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{successful}} light bulb filaments {{were made of}} carbon (from carbonized paper or bamboo). Early carbon filaments had a <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of resistance — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the [...] "flashing" [...] process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments {{as well as their}} efficiency. A metallized or [...] "graphitized" [...] filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the solvolysis of organic halides is associated with Arrhenius activation energies which have <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients.</b> It is considered that this is most probably due to the increased solvation of the transition state of the reaction relative to the initial state of the reactants. Bensley and Kohnstam have suggested that the heat capacity of activation (ΔCP * = dE/dT - R) is a measure of this increase in solvation and also that in S(_N) 1 reactions,the entropy of activation, Δ S *, {{is a measure of the}} same phenomenon; whereas in S(_N) 2 reactions an additional negative contribution to Δ S * due to the covalent binding of the nucleophilic reagent must be considered. The solvolysis of R-Hal i n a given solvent and at a given temperature should, therefore, have a constant value for the ΔCp */ΔS * ratio for SNl reactions, independent of the nature of the group R and the ratio should have a lower value for S(_N) 2 reactions (since ΔCp* and ΔS*are both negative in the type of reaction being considered]] At the commencement of this study these tentative suggestions required experimental verification. A parallel study has shown the constancy of ΔCp*/ΔS* for S(_N) l reactions and this thesis describes the determination of this ratio, for the solvolysis of some n-alkyl bromides in 50 % aq. acetone when the extreme form of the S(_N) 2 mechanism is operative. These compounds all showed <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> of activation energy and the ΔCp*/ΔS* ratio was always lower than for S(_N) l reactions, in agreement with the earlier predictions. It can be concluded that the determination of this ratio provides an additional test of solvolytic mechanism which seems likely to be applicable to border-line reactions in which there is a transition from mechanism S(_N) 2 to mechanism S(_N) 1. Here, the 'classical' mechanistic tests do not always yield unambiguous results...|$|R
2500|$|Pressurized water reactors, {{like all}} thermal reactor designs, require the fast fission {{neutrons}} to be slowed down (a process called moderation or thermal) {{in order to}} interact with the nuclear fuel and sustain the chain reaction. In PWRs the coolant water is used as a moderator by letting the neutrons undergo multiple collisions with light hydrogen atoms in the water, losing speed in the process. This [...] "moderating" [...] of neutrons will happen more often when the water is more dense (more collisions will occur). The use of water as a moderator is an important safety feature of PWRs, as an increase in temperature may cause the water to expand, giving greater 'gaps' between the water molecules and reducing the probability of thermalisation—thereby reducing the extent to which neutrons are slowed down and hence reducing the reactivity in the reactor. Therefore, if reactivity increases beyond normal, the reduced moderation of neutrons will cause the chain reaction to slow down, producing less heat. This property, known as the <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of reactivity, makes PWR reactors very stable. This process is referred to as 'Self-Regulating', i.e. the hotter the coolant becomes, the less reactive the plant becomes, shutting itself down slightly to compensate and vice versa. Thus the plant controls itself around a given temperature set by the position of the control rods.|$|E

It is qualitatively clear that the change of sign of the <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> of resistivity, occurring in a system where the electronic mean free path is of the order of the atomic distance, is indeed related to some localization process, helped by electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions. In other words, the deviation of the resistivity from the Boltzmann nearly free electron behaviour is due to some interference effect between impurity scattering and electron-phonon and/or electron-electron scattering. While the theory of defect induced tunnelling in strongly disordered metals developed by Belitz and Schirmacher seems to be the most appropriate for the explanation of the heavy ion irradiation results, although it includes electron-phonon interactions only, electron irradiation results reveal the necessity of including the interplay with Coulomb interactions as in the model of Alt'shuler and Aronov...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{is brought}} forward {{to show that}} at {{concentrations}} of urea high enough to split the egg albumin molecule the solubility changes produced by urea are profoundly modified. The degree of precipitation after dialysis is the net result of two changes produced by the urea: the first, normally spoken of as denaturation, which makes the protein insoluble in dilute solution and the second, a splitting of the molecule which makes it soluble. These two reactions may proceed independently and simultaneously or the second reaction may follow the first, {{taking place in the}} denatured molecule only. In view of the decrease in the opalescence with time, the latter process is more probable. Both of these reactions have positive <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients,</b> but as the concentration of urea increases the second reaction is more affected by increase in temperature than the first, and consequently the resulting opalescence decreases rather than increases with temperature. This accounts for and explains reports of <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficients</b> of denaturation, when denaturation is measured by the amount of insoluble material found on dilution. The occurrence of these two reactions, one leading to an increase and the other to a decrease in the amount of insoluble protein, should be taken into account when denaturation changes in egg albumin with urea are studied...|$|R
