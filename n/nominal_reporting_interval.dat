40|$|The <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> of {{infectious}} diseases is often determined as a time unit in the calendar regardless of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. No guidelines have been proposed to choose the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> {{of infectious}} diseases. The present study aims at translating coarsely reported epidemic data into the reproduction number and clarifying the ideal <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> to offer detailed insights into {{the time course of}} an epidemic. We briefly revisit the dispersibility ratio, i. e. ratio of cases in successive <b>reporting</b> <b>intervals,</b> proposed by Clare Oswald Stallybrass, detecting technical flaws in the historical studies. We derive a corrected expression for this quantity and propose simple algorithms to estimate the effective reproduction number as a function of time, adjusting the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> to the generation time of a disease and demonstrating a clear relationship among the generation-time distribution, <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> and growth rate of an epidemic. Our exercise suggests that an ideal <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> is the mean generation time, so that the ratio of cases in successive intervals can yield the reproduction number. When it is impractical to report observations every mean generation time, we also present an alternative method that enables us to obtain straightforward estimates of the reproduction number for any <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> that suits the practical purpose of infection control. © 2009 The Royal Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|Part b of Fig.  14 {{shows the}} {{expected}} battery lifetime for different <b>report</b> <b>intervals</b> {{and for a}} different number of days in Secure Transport Mode (STP). The STP-mode is most energy-consuming because the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> will be highest and also the door sensor needs to be monitored. We can conclude that in case a battery lifetime of 1 – 3 years is desired, either the <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> {{or the number of}} days in STP must be limited. Since the number of days in STP is dependent on the usage of the container, the only possibility is to let the <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> vary based on the value of the cargo and the days already spent in STP. Considering the same example as above, the number of days in STP could almost double when two tracking devices share their UMTS/GPRS/GPS.|$|R

40|$|Background: Measurement {{uncertainty}} (MU) estimates {{can be used}} by clinicians in result interpretation for {{diagnosis and}} monitoring and by laboratories in assessing assay fitness for use and analytical troubleshooting. However, MU is not routinely used to assess the appropriateness of the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> We describe the relationship between MU and the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> Methods and results: The <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> R is the smallest unit of measurement chosen for clinical reporting. When choosing the appropriate value for R, it is necessary that the reference change values and expanded MU values can be meaningfully calculated. Expanded MU provides the tighter criterion for defining an upper limit for R. This limit can be determined as R 4 k SDa/ 1. 9, where SDa is the analytical standard deviation and k is the coverage factor (usually 2). Conclusion: Using MU estimates to determine the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> for quantitative laboratory results ensures that reporting practices match local analytical performance and recognizes the inherent error of the measurement process...|$|R

We present a model for the estimation of the maximum number of specimens for reference interval studies based on setting the 90 % confidence interval of the reference limits to be equal to the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> Methods: Equations describing the bounds on the upper and lower 90 % confidence intervals for logarithmically transformed and untransformed data were derived and applied to determine the maximum number of specimens required to calculate a reference interval for 12 common chemistry and hematology analytes.

The first of three studies (validation study) tested a decision tree classification system {{and its ability to}} describe behaviors of lying, standing, and walking. Classification accuracies for lying, standing, and walking behaviors were 99. 2 %, 98. 0 %, and 67. 8 % respectively, with walking behavior having significantly lower accuracy (P< 0. 01).

The findings were applied to data on CDs with analytical precision values from our laboratory.

40|$|A {{real-time}} smart {{metering system}} has strict requirements, since {{every piece of}} data gathered from various meters every hour is of importance, and each component consisting of metering infrastructure should be sustainable. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} efficiently manage the meter data set in smart metering networks as well as in a server. Therefore, we propose a dedicated file system, a LIght-weight Metering File System (LIMFS), which is capable of not only efficiently storing and searching meter data but also performing distributed fault-tolerant meter data management for real-time smart meter devices. The proposed LIMFS exploits accumulated data sliding storage (ADSS) for lost data recovery and latest-first error-ignorant data management (LEDM) to reduce memory wastage, coping with dynamic <b>report</b> <b>interval.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that LIMFS has as a small enough overhead to be considered negligible, and provides flexible memory capacity according to dynamic <b>report</b> <b>interval,</b> in spite of lost data recovery functionality...|$|R

30|$|There is a {{tradeoff}} regarding {{the period of}} sensing interval (or the sensing result transmission). If it is too long, interference time to the PU increases due to the transmission time increases for the SUs; conversely, if it is too short, transmission performance of the SUs decreases. In this regard, this paper proposes an algorithm that dynamically determines the sensing time and <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> of sensing result by using Q-learning based on reinforcement learning for interference control in target-level and enhancement of SU’s transmission opportunities. Meanwhile, the interference ratio and the transmission opportunity loss ratio are defined as the criteria for selecting the sensing time and the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> according {{to the performance of}} the system. From the busy and idle time that are statistical characteristics of the PU, interference ratio and the transmission opportunity loss ratio can be estimated precisely from only the sensing results without any knowledge of operating characteristics about PU. First, in order to minimize the interference to the PU, the sensing is basically set to satisfy the required detection probability preferentially so that the interference to the PU can be ensured in the sensing step. In the reward design of Q-learning, the target interference ratio value is used so that the interference resides in desired range. Also, the target transmission opportunity loss ratio value is used to secure the transmission opportunity of the SU. Based on the designed reward, Q-learning dynamically selects the sensing time and <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> time to operate the system in the selected interference ratio and loss ratio range.|$|R

50|$|The {{first step}} is to compile the data from the {{different}} meters. Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired <b>reporting</b> <b>interval,</b> but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} for selecting time slot (i.e., NTS) {{in the network}} entry phase consists of four steps. First, a vehicle calculates a nominal increment (NI) by dividing an average <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> with the unit slot length. Here, the <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> refers to an period that each message must be transmitted and the interval is equal to beacon interval (BI) in vehicular safety applications. Second, a vehicle randomly chooses nominal start slot (NSS) from current slot up to NI. Third, a vehicle sets selection interval (SI) around NSS and randomly picks its NTS within SI. Finally, a vehicle checks an availability of NTS. More specifically, if the chosen NTS is already occupied by someone else based on the previous measurements, a vehicle selects the closest unoccupied slot within SI. However, if all slots within SI are occupied, the vehicle selects the slot of which owner is furthest away from itself. This is because an amount of interference tends to be smaller as {{the distance from the}} interferer is getting longer.|$|R

40|$|To {{measure the}} {{vertical}} profiles of temperature and water vapor {{that are essential}} for modeling atmospheric processes, the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program of the U. S. Department of Energy launches approximately 2600 radiosondes each year from its Southern Great Plains (SGP) facilities in Oklahoma and Kansas, USA. The annual cost of this effort exceeds $ 500, 000 in materials and labor. Despite the expense, these soundings have a coarse temporal resolution and <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> compared with model time steps. In contrast, the radiation measurements used for model evaluations have temporal resolutions and <b>reporting</b> <b>intervals</b> of a few minutes at most. Conversely, radiosondes have a much higher vertical spatial resolution than most models can use. Modelers generally reduce the vertical resolution of the soundings by averaging over the vertical layers of the model. Recently, Radiometries Corporation (Boulder, Colorado, USA) developed a 12 -channel, ground-based microwave radiometer capable of providing continuous, real-time vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, and limited-resolution cloud liquid water from the surface to 10 km in nearly all weather conditions. The microwave radiometer profiler (MWRP) offers a much finer temporal resolution and <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> (about 10 minutes) than the radiosonde but a coarser vertical resolution {{that may be more}} appropriate for models. Profiles of temperature, water vapor, and cloud liquid water are obtained at 47 levels: from 0 to 1 km above ground level at 100 -m intervals and from 1 to 10 km at 250 -m intervals. The profiles are derived from the measured brightness temperatures with neural network retrieval. In Figure 1, profiles of temperature, water vapor, and cloud liquid water for 10 May 2000 are presented as time-height plots. MWRP profiles coincident with the 11 : 31 UTC (05 : 31 local) and 23 : 47 UTC (17 : 47 local) soundings for 10 May are presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
