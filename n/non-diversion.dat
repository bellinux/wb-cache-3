[...] They wrote that there was [...] "no independent assessment that Iran is engaged in weapons work" [...] {{and that this was}} [...] "hardly {{the first time that the}} agency has discussed potential evidence of Tehran's nuclear weapons research". Iran's envoy to the UN atomic watchdog criticized Western powers for interpreting the IAEA report in an [...] "exaggerated, selective and inaccurate" [...] manner.

5000|$|In {{his final}} November 2009 {{statement}} to the IAEA Board of Governors, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei said the Agency continued to verify the <b>non-diversion</b> of declared nuclear material in Iran, but that other issues of concern had reached a [...] "dead end" [...] unless Iran were to fully cooperate with the agency. ElBaradei stated {{it would be helpful}} if [...] "we were able to share with Iran more of the material that is at the centre of these concerns", and also said it would be helpful if Iran fully implemented the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement and fully implemented the Additional Protocol. ElBaradei said Iran's failure to report the existence of a new fuel enrichment facility until September 2009 was inconsistent with its obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement. ElBaradei closed by saying international negotiations represented a [...] "unique opportunity to address a humanitarian need and create space for negotiations".|$|E
5000|$|Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is {{not known}} to {{currently}} possess {{weapons of mass destruction}} (WMD) and has signed treaties repudiating the possession {{of weapons of mass destruction}} including the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran has first-hand knowledge of WMD effects—over 100,000 Iranian troops and civilians were victims of chemical weapons during the 1980s Iran-Iraq War. On ideological grounds, a public and categorical religious decree (fatwa) against the development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons has been issued by the Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei along with other clerics, though it is approved by some relatively minor clerics. [...] Later versions of this fatwa forbid only the [...] "use" [...] of nuclear weapons, but said nothing about their production. Iran has stated its uranium enrichment program is exclusively for peaceful purposes. The IAEA has confirmed the <b>non-diversion</b> of declared nuclear material in Iran but has also said it [...] "needs to have confidence in the absence of possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear program.|$|E
5000|$|Iran's Khodadad Seifi {{responded to}} {{allegations}} against the Iranian nuclear programme saying that Iran has an inalienable right to peaceful nuclear energy and is fully committed to its non-proliferation agreements, {{that it has}} always been for peaceful purposes and that Iran continues to fully cooperate with the IAEA. All activities are carried out under the agency’s cameras and resident inspectors regularly visit the sites and measure and seal uranium containers. Some cooperation, it said, is even beyond the legal obligations so as to build more trust and confidence; <b>non-diversion</b> has always been confirmed by the agency. He added that the [...] "agency continues to verify the material at the nuclear facilities by Iran in accordance with the agreement." [...] He further noted that all countries have right to nuclear energy and none to nuclear weapons: “nuclear energy for all and nuclear weapons for no one.” Iran addresses genuine proliferation but rejects conflating peaceful nuclear energy with developing nuclear weapons. In addition to obligations, he said, Islamic teaching is against pursuing nuclear weapons program. Nuclear weapons do not bring security but are the greatest threat to nuclear-haves and have-nots. As {{there is no reason to}} accept nuclear weapons but many reasons to abolish them all, nuclear weapons have no place in the defence doctrine of Iran. Yet some countries express concerns over Iranian nuclear weapons and there is a deep mistrust by Iran over the policies and intentions of these countries. Therefore there is a need to build mutual trust that is possible only by resorting to the force of logic not the logic of force. The golden rule is to resort to diplomacy alone. Sustainable solutions are attainable only by peaceful and respectful negotiations. For its part, Iran expresses full readiness to stick to meaningful time-bound negotiations. Iran stands ready to ensure its nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful and remove concerns of other parties and acknowledge the inherent right of Iran to peaceful nuclear energy including a full national fuel cycle. As such sanctions, whether unilateral or multilateral, should be lifted. Mutual respect and equal treatment is essential for a win-win situation. Other parties need to adopt the same approach. Moreover Iran underlines the important contribution other countries can make to the process. Iran takes this opportunity to thank all countries that support sovereign rights to peaceful science and tech and those who have supported, in the past several days, the Iranian programme. However, he cited the as yet extremely inflammatory statement by the “last speaker” with allegations against the peaceful nuclear activities of Iran and it would not dignify such unfound accusations with answers other than categorically rejecting them all. He said that Netanyahu tried to “mislead this august body” about the nuclear programme, but that unlike last year his comments tried to be more royal than a king by setting a standard for Iranian nuclear activities and level of enrichment. As such, he must know that no one can dictate to Iran what to do and not to do. “As a party to the NPT, Iran is fully aware of its rights and is fully committed to its obligations. Indeed the one who is badly in need to be educated about these issues is Israel, the only non-party to the NPT in the Middle East. And to that end Israel no choice but to accede to the NPT without delay and place all its nuclear possessions under IAEA safeguards. Netanyahu talked of WMDs in the Middle East without mention that Israel is the only one in the region that possesses all types of WMDss but is still not party to any treaty banning them.“ Netanyahu also did not mention the proposed 2012 conference on the establishment of a WMD free zone in the Middle East which was not convened only due to Israeli objections. Similarly to last year, he continued sabre rattling to Iran by abusing the General Debate by threatening a founding member of the body that was intended to prevent breaches of the peace according to the UN charter. Despite this Israel enjoys full freedom and is “proud of all atrocities and over 10 wars waged in 65 years by the Israel regime against all neighbours and others as well. It may wish to apply for an international award certifying the ability of Israeli forces in never ending savage attacks against people under occupation, in particular women and innocent children.” Iran warned that Israel should seriously avoid miscalculation about Iran and that Iran’s century’s old policy of non-aggression should not be seen as an inability to defend itself not because of its ability but its principled policy of rejecting the use of force. Iran is proud of being the best in exercising the inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN charter. Thus Netanyahu better not think of attacking Iran let alone planning for that. In conclusion, to point allegedly made by Iran’s foreign minister at the General Debate: “we have been accused of having a smile attack, a smile attack is better than a military attack” he then concluded that “indeed a smile policy is better than lying.” ...|$|E

40|$|IAEA-SM- 367 / 13 / 02 With {{the coming}} into force of the Additional Protocol (INFCIRC/ 540) States ’ are facing {{problems}} of collecting and organising {{the large amount of}} requested information on nuclear related activities in a structured and coherent way. On the other hand, IAEA has to analyse submitted declarations using inhouse and open source information in order to draw conclusions about both the <b>non-diversion</b> of nuclear material and the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in a State. The use of advanced information technology, in particular Geographical Information Systems, Satellite monitoring, and Global Positioning System can support both declaration and verification activities. SIT (Site Investigation Tool), is a software package aiming to support declaration and verification activities. This paper will describe the main system functionality of SIT and its present status of development, as well as the advantages deriving from its use by both the States and the Agency 1...|$|E
40|$|Quality Control (QC) {{is a set}} of procedures, {{including}} technical activities, {{to ensure}} that a final product or a performed service adheres to a defined set of quality criteria and meets the customer requirements. Quality assurance (QA) is defined as a systematic process to check whether a service/product under development is meeting specific requirements before the product or service is completed. The non-proliferation treaty (NPT) comprises a verification mechanism: nuclear safeguards. Safeguards aims at the verification of the <b>non-diversion</b> of fissile material from its intended and declared (peaceful) use. Therefore a reliable nuclear material accountancy system has to be established by the plant operator. This accountancy is subject to independent verification by the safeguards authorities. Measurement of samples (for their content in U or Pu and the respective isotopic composition) taken by inspectors remains the backbone of any verification system. Environmental sampling is a supplementary safeguards tool aiming at verifying the correctness and completeness of a state¿s declarations. The system of measurements applied in nuclear safeguards is expected to conform to the latest standards. This technical sheet lists the different aspects of QA and QC in analytical measurements, explains the fundamental role of reference materials, quality control samples, uncertainty of measurement results and interlaboratory comparisons in view of measurements of the nuclear fuel cycle materials. The systematic concept for analytical quality control in the Euratom on-site laboratories is given as an example. JRC. D. 4 -Isotope measurement...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{national}} and international standards for accounting for nuclear materials, including those designated for military use, are insufficient to meet current and future nuclear security, nonproliferation, and weapons reduction demands. Improved accounting practices are needed to provide reliable assurance that nuclear materials designated for peaceful use have not been diverted to state-level nuclear weapons programs or stolen by non-state actors, {{as well as to}} deter or detect diversion or the, were it to occur. Implementing an effective and efficient comprehensive, global nuclear accounting system is also a critical element of creating the conditions for future nuclear security if global nuclear energy use increases as part of the effort to mitigate climate change and countries make deep cuts to, or potentially eliminate, their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and nuclear materials designated for military use. Policy makers from around the globe have recognized the importance of ensuring that all countries with nuclear materials or weapons practice high standards of material control and accounting (MC&A), but the emphasis of current initiatives to improve MC&A has been on national laws and regulations—and primarily in states without nuclear weapons. States have yet to develop comprehensive requirements that address the full scope of nuclear risks and that are meant to be adopted by all states—including nuclear weapons states. This study examines a range of current material accounting practices and requirements and argues that in order for MC&A to fully perform the functions necessary to reduce global nuclear risks to an acceptably low level, its emphasis needs to transition from ensuring the <b>non-diversion</b> of nuclear materials to military uses to providing positive inventory control of nuclear materials, whereby {{national and}} international authorities can actively account for the location and form of all designated nuclear materials on a continuous and detailed basis.
