40|$|Education is {{considered}} {{as the most}} powerful weapon of life to get victory and success. The teachers plays great role towards education and shape up both present and future of a student. Teachers serve a great job in making the good society by educating and guiding number of student in their whole life. Satisfaction is the favorableness or unfavourableness with which employees view their work. Job involvement and Life satisfaction of primary school teachers are found to be influenced by several factors like gender, religion, type of the school, nature of the school, education qualification, <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment,</b> location of the school, marital status, monthly income, years of experience etc. It seems that many prefer the teaching profession out of parents or somebody’s compulsion and not out of their own genuine interest. For this a sample of 294 was collected from primary school teachers of various schools and t-test and Anova were used as statistical tools to anlayse the data. The conclusion {{is that there is a}} significant relationship between gender, educational qualification and job involvement and life satisfaction among primary school teachers. While taking decision on and job involvement and life satisfaction among primary school teachers their gender and educational qualification has to be taken for decision making process...|$|E

50|$|Jaruwan was {{appointed}} auditor-general on December 31, 2001 for {{a term of}} 5 years. She was responsible for carrying out all audit for government agencies. The questionable <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> her <b>appointment</b> would make her term a controversial one.|$|R
40|$|We study whether CEO {{involvement}} {{in the selection of}} new directors influences the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointments</b> to the board. When the CEO serves on the nominating committee or no nominating committee exists, firms appoint fewer independent outside directors and more gray outsiders with conflicts of interest. Stock price reactions to independent director appointments are significantly lower when the CEO is involved in director selection. Our evidence may illuminate a mechanism used by CEOs to reduce pressure from active monitoring, and we find a recent trend of companies removing CEOs from {{involvement in}} director selection.

60|$|The girl {{descended the}} stile before {{she looked at}} him, {{and then there was}} a {{suggestion}} of stiffness in her attitude, for the speech, which seemed to imply something <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> an <b>appointment,</b> was not a tactful one.|$|R
60|$|The {{very fact}} that the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> that <b>appointment</b> {{concerned}} things which from the first he had {{made up his mind}} must be kept entirely secret, stiffened his tone. Her manner changed instantly. She had drawn herself a little away. She considered for a moment.|$|R
50|$|About 1234 the Emperor Frederick II granted an {{imperial}} vicariate to Ottone, although the exact <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> this <b>appointment</b> is unknown.

5000|$|According to the New York Times, Meissner's {{appointment}} was viewed favorably {{because of her}} knowledge of the domain acquired through years of experience under both Democratic and Republican administrations, {{as well as the}} non-political <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment.</b> A later New York Times article reviewing her first few years in office described her mandate as [...] "keeping open America's front door while slamming shut the back." ...|$|R
2500|$|In retrospect, {{it is easy}} to see {{the monumental}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Foster's <b>appointment</b> in lieu <b>of</b> the {{profound}} effects Rivers's work would have on Cambridge and indeed in the scientific world in general. However, at the time the Cambridge University Senate were wary <b>of</b> his <b>appointment.</b> As Bartlett writes: [...] "how many times have I heard Rivers, spectacles waving in the air, his face lit by his transforming smile, tell how, in Senatorial discussion, an ancient orator described him as a 'Ridiculous Superfluity'!" ...|$|R
50|$|Further {{establishing}} the apostolic <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Lazarus' <b>appointment</b> {{was the story}} that the bishop's omophorion was presented to Lazarus by the Virgin Mary, who had woven it herself. Such apostolic connections were central to the claims to autocephaly made by the bishops of Kition - subject to the patriarch of Jerusalem - during the period 325-431. The church of Kition was declared self-governing in 431 AD at the Third Ecumenical Council.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{somewhat}} confused <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Chad's <b>appointment</b> {{and the continued}} references to 'chads'– small pieces of ballot papers punched out by voters using voting machines– in the 2000 US Presidential Election, it has been jocularly suggested that Chad is {{the patron saint of}} botched elections. In fact there is no official patron saint of elections, although the Church has designated a later English official, Thomas More, the patron of politicians.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Ball's Bluff was a {{small but}} {{consequential}} defeat for the Union early in the American Civil War, occurring just months after the Union Army's rout after the First Battle of Bull Run and another embarrassing loss at Battle of Wilson's Creek in the Western Theater. The Union defeat at Ball's Bluff revealed something to {{the public about the}} political <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Union <b>appointments</b> <b>of</b> officers and their occasional incompetence, and led directly {{to the creation of the}} Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War.|$|R
50|$|In early November 1914 Captain William Hall, son of {{the first}} head of Naval Intelligence, was {{appointed}} as the new DID to replace Oliver, who had first been transferred to Naval Secretary to the First Lord and then Chief of the Admiralty War Staff. Hall had formerly been captain of the battlecruiser Queen Mary but {{had been forced to}} give up sea duties due to ill health. Hall was to prove an extremely successful DID, despite the accidental <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The titles [...] "magistrate" [...] and [...] "justice of the peace" [...] {{mean the}} same, {{although}} today {{the former is}} commonly used in the popular media, and the latter in more formal contexts. The term [...] "lay" [...] referred to the voluntary, unsalaried <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> and was used to distinguish them from professional magistrates, known as stipendiaries. However, since stipendiaries became district judges, the term has fallen into disuse. There are approximately 23,500 magistrates in England and Wales.|$|R
50|$|Arbazacius {{is usually}} {{described}} as being born in Armenia from an Isaurian family, {{but it has also}} been argued that he was born in Isauria and was of Armenian descent. Around 404 AD, with Isaurian raiders beginning their raids into southern and eastern Asia Minor, Arbazacius was placed in command of the Roman forces with instructions to clear Isaurian brigands from Pamphylia. Although the exact <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> remains unknown, it has been speculated that he held the rank of comes rei militaris.|$|R
5000|$|To {{highlight}} the controversial <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> this <b>appointment,</b> Rabbi Avi Shafran, Director of Public Affairs and Spokesman for Agudath Israel of America, spoke out strongly against {{the concept of}} a female clergy member. [...] "The maharat title is universally and correctly understood as a ruse," [...] said Shafran, referring to the official title Thomas-Newborn and others receive at ordination from Yeshivat Maharat. [...] Others have called her promotion from intern and appointment to morateinu as [...] "the latest development in the continued adulteration of Orthodoxy." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1909, Sutton {{returned}} to Kansas City, Kansas where {{his family had}} relocated and his father and brother were in law practice. Sutton was appointed assistant professor of surgery at the four-year-old University of Kansas Medical School. The tenuous <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> at the young school led him to also maintain a private practice and serve {{on the staff of}} St. Margaret’s Hospital as well as the University’s Bell Memorial Hospital. For six years, Sutton performed a wide range of surgeries carefully documenting the procedures. He published several articles related to these cases going back to his internship at Roosevelt.|$|R
40|$|The {{makeup of}} the new European Commission was {{announced}} by Jean-Claude Juncker on 10 September. Following the announcement, Andrew Glencross writes on the constitutional implications of the so-called Spitzenkandidaten process for the new Commission’s role. He argues that the process could {{be understood as a}} parallel to the use of direct democracy in Switzerland or a directly elected President in the United States to grant citizens a more direct connection with fundamental constitutional change. However this form of ‘presidentialisation’ in the Commission’s case is unlikely to bring about ‘bottom up’ constitutional agency overnight, particularly given the indirect <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Juncker’s <b>appointment...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Football Association of Ireland's (FAI) {{search for}} a {{successor}} took them past Peter Reid, Bryan Robson and Philippe Troussier and eventually led them to Kerr who was officially unveiled as Republic of Ireland manager on 26 January 2003. Despite the somewhat haphazard <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> (several leaks meant that most media outlets had been alerted as to the FAI's decision days {{in advance of the}} official announcement and Troussier was only notified of his failure to land the post after a member of the public phoned him to commiserate), Kerr was a popular choice for the position.|$|R
50|$|On 26 March 2009 Walsh {{was named}} {{as the new}} manager of the Cork senior hurling team. He was {{installed}} as a full-time replacement for Gerald McCarthy who vacated the position after a prolonged strike by the entire hurling panel due to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> for a second two-year term. The task ahead was enormous as Cork had missed out on early-season training and the opening two rounds of the National League. Walsh's first two games in charge saw Cork being trounced by Kilkenny before putting up a spirited display against Waterford but eventually recording a defeat.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{appointed}} as special advisor to Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the Middle East and Afghanistan on August 8, 2006. In response to criticisms about providing {{support for his}} Conservative political opponents, Khan emphasized the non-partisan <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment,</b> noting that he sought and received the approval of Liberal leader Bill Graham prior to taking on the responsibility. [...] Khan {{was sent to the}} Middle East on a 16-day trip to prepare a report on conditions there; before departing, he promised that the report would be made public upon his return, a promise which later became a point of contention.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the term}} is more loosely {{used to refer to}} {{high-profile}} appointments who devote their skills to one particular area. The term was widely used in the British media to refer to the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> Alan Sugar to the newly created post of Enterprise Champion, which was dubbed [...] "Enterprise Tsar" [...] by many news agencies.The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment,</b> and the usage of the term [...] "tsar" [...] did receive criticism however, with columnist Tracy Corrigan in The Daily Telegraph suggesting it set as a precedent for the English model Jordan to be made the [...] "women’s issues tsarina",with Conservative life peer Lord Hunt suggesting he could already be a [...] "fallen tsar".|$|R
5000|$|Beyond {{the courts}} of general jurisdiction, the {{specialized}} state courts also saw a rise in female judgeships. Many considered specialized courts more appropriate to the tasks of female judges; in these positions their positive womanly characteristics {{could be used to}} resolve issues such as juvenile crimes and domestic relations. Also, the [...] "token" [...] aspect of female judges was seen in the temporary <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> women to positions of prominence, such as the three female judges temporarily elevated to the Texas Supreme Court in 1925 after three male judges recused themselves in a matter involving a fraternal society to which they belonged. While these enterprising women achieved judgeships in the 1920s and 1930s, the tokenistic and decidedly sexist <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> their <b>appointments</b> would not change for another fifty years.|$|R
500|$|In February 1914 [...] Joyce, {{still in}} Australia, was {{contacted}} by Shackleton. who outlined plans for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.

[...] Joyce would later claim without justification that Shackleton had offered him {{a place on the}} main transcontinental party. In his subsequent book, The South Polar Trail published in 1929, Joyce also misrepresented the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> to the Ross Sea party, omitting Shackleton's order that placed him under an officer [...] and claiming that he had been given sole authority over dogs and sledging.|$|R
50|$|Director primacy is {{a theory}} of the firm that was {{introduced}} by Bainbridge {{in an article in}} Northwestern University Law Review in 2003 (Vol 97 No 2). He argues that traditional firm theory is based on a false premise that the board's authority derives from the owners. He argues that while the board is appointed by the owners, the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> is one in which the power to be exercised is not {{under the control of the}} appointing members. Once appointed then, directors are almost unfettered in their exercise of their powers. However, they are subject to overarching fiduciary responsibility which aligns their required actions with a shareholder wealth maximization principle.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the incentives}} for cronyism in business, {{the public sector}} and politics within an agency problem model with moral hazard. The analysis {{is focused on the}} institutional differences between private, public and political organizations. In business, when facing a residual claimant contract, a chief manager ends up with a relatively moderate first-best level of cronyism within a firm. The institutional framework of the public sector does not allow explicit contracting, which leads to a more severe cronyism problem within public organizations. Finally, it is shown that the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> political <b>appointments</b> (such that the subordinate's reappointment is conditioned on the chief's re-election) together with implicit contracting makes political cronyism the most extreme case. ...|$|R
50|$|This {{came during}} a period when the French {{government}} was formed as a cohabitation between left and right parties. Cousseran, linked to the Socialist Party, was therefore obliged to appoint Jean-Pierre Pochon of the Gaullist RPR {{as head of the}} Intelligence Directorate. Being conscious <b>of</b> the political <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment,</b> and wanting to steer around Pochon, Cousseron placed one of his friends in a top job under Pochon. Alain Chouet, a specialist in terrorism, especially Algerian and Iranian networks, took over as chief of the Security Intelligence Service. He had been on post in Damascus at a time when Cousseran was France's ambassador to Syria. Chouet began writing reports to Cousseran that by-passed his immediate superior, Pochon.|$|R

But, during Prime Minister Gordon Brown's cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009, the BBC reported that Sugar would become Lord Sugar and had been offered a job as the government's [...] "Enterprise Champion". On 7 June 2009 Sugar sought to clarify the non-political <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment.</b> He stated {{that he would not be}} joining the government, that the appointment was politically neutral, and that all he wanted to do was help businesses and entrepreneurs.

50|$|Just {{months after}} his playing retirement, Bourke was {{controversially}} pitched into the coaching position at Punt Road. The Tigers had decided to sack Tony Jewell, a premiership teammate of Bourke, just twelve months after he coached Richmond to the 1980 premiership. Although few doubted that Bourke was coaching material, the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> and his lack of coaching experience at any level were significant hurdles to overcome. However, in 1982 Bourke took the Tigers to only their third minor premiership since the war and impressed critics with a brilliant tactical display in the semi final against Carlton. Bourke {{made a series of}} positional changes {{at the beginning of the}} game and ordered his men to slow down the Carlton play-on game, giving away fifteen-metre penalties as necessary. The Tigers won easily, and Bourke became one of only a handful of coaches to make the Grand Final in his first season.|$|R
2500|$|Wilson {{survived for}} even {{less time than}} was {{intended}} by the stop-gap <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> because <b>of</b> {{his opposition to the}} establishment of a Naval Staff. In the opinion of the naval historian Hew Strachan: [...] "the combination of frequent change and weak appointees (Wilson, Bridgeman and Battenberg) ensured that the professional leadership of the Royal Navy lost its direction in the four years preceding the war". Wilson left the Admiralty in December 1911 and received the Order of Merit on 8 March 1912. He was recalled by Winston Churchill in 1914 at the start of World War I to provide advice on strategy. He advocated offensive schemes in the North Sea including the capture of Heligoland and was an early proponent of the development and use of submarines in the Royal Navy. He ceased his role as an advisor in November 1918 and inherited a baronetcy from his brother in October 1919.|$|R
2500|$|Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, 3rd Baronet [...] (4 March 1842 – 25 May 1921) was a Royal Navy officer.

He went on to command a {{battleship}}, the torpedo school [...] and then another battleship before taking charge of the Experimental Torpedo Squadron. He later commanded the Channel Fleet. He briefly served as First Sea Lord but in that role he [...] "was abrasive, inarticulate, and autocratic" [...] and was really only selected as Admiral Fisher's successor {{because he was a}} supporter of Fisher's reforms.

2500|$|After Eriksson {{announced}} in January 2006 {{that he would}} leave as England manager after the 2006 World Cup finals, McClaren was placed on The FA's shortlist to succeed him, alongside Sam Allardyce, Alan Curbishley, Martin O'Neill and Luiz Felipe Scolari. The FA first offered the position to Scolari, but he rejected the offer, claiming that the role would mean excessive media intrusion in his life. McClaren, however, was subsequently announced as Eriksson's successor on 4 May 2006 after signing a four-year contract. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his <b>appointment</b> earned him the nickname [...] "Second Choice Steve". The appointment was praised {{by the likes of}} Alan Hansen, Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Trevor Brooking. Many England fans, however, expressed dissatisfaction with The FA's choice. McClaren assumed control of the national team on 1 August 2006. McClaren chose popular former England coach Terry Venables as his assistant, a move seen by some as an attempt to counter the lack of enthusiasm for McClaren. He also hired public relations guru Max Clifford to manage his relationship with the media.|$|R
