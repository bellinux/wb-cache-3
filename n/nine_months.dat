40|$|In {{separate}} experiments, nine (n= 20) {{and fifteen}} (n= 12) month old rats {{were treated with}} either 6 % ethanol or 12 % sucrose (to balance caloric intake) in the drinking water to {{examine the effect of}} chronic ethanol consumption on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of aged rats. Rats were maintained on these treatment regimens for thirty days and were killed by decapitation. Blood was collected and plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone were determined by radioimmunoassay. Adrenal glands were cleaned, quartered and used to test in vitro responsiveness to ACTH. Anterior pituitary glands from all 15 month old rats and one half of the <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old rats were collected, frozen and extracted for measurement of tissue ACTH concentration. The remaining anterior pituitary glands from the <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old rats were challenged with corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) to test in vitro responsiveness. In <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old rats, chronic ethanol consumption decreased plasma ACTH and corticosterone (P In vitro responsiveness of the adrenal gland to ACTH in <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old rats consuming ethanol was unchanged (P > 0. 05).

40|$|Cardiopulmonary arrest is {{a leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} in the United States that usually occurs in the aged population. Cardiac arrest (CA) induces global ischemia, disrupting global cerebral circulation that results in ischemic brain injury and leads to cognitive impairments in survivors. Ischemia-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus following CA can result in the impairment of cognitive function including spatial memory. In the present study, we used a model of asphyxial CA (ACA) in <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old male Fischer 344 rats to investigate cognitive and synaptic deficits following mild global cerebral ischemia. These experiments were performed with the goals of 1) establishing a model of CA in <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old middle-aged rats; and 2) to test the hypothesis that learning and memory deficits develop following mild global cerebral ischemia in middle-aged rats. To test this hypothesis, spatial memory assays (Barnes circular platform maze and contextual fear conditioning) and field recordings (long-term potentiation and paired-pulse facilitation) were performed. We show that following ACA in <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old middle-aged rats, there is significant impairment in spatial memory formation, paired-pulse facilitation n dysfunction, and a {{reduction in the number of}} non-compromised hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 and subiculum neurons. In conclusion, <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> old animals undergoing cardiac arrest have impaired survival, deficits in spatial memory formation, and synaptic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> program plan is to {{document}} all the activities that are scheduled for January-September, 1986 at FMPC. The intent of preparing the <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> program plan was to prepare a description of authorized work, budget the work on a month-to-month basis and schedule the completion of work. The milestones in the WMCO Transition Plan that included the gathering of FY 86 work scope and budget information in addition to issuing the 9 -month Program Plan assumed {{the existence of an}} existing budget program that priced and budgeted work monthly. In the absence of a budget computer program, an IBM P. C, with extended memory was leased to handle the volume of budget data. The planning concept in the <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> program was based on defining manageable work, scheduling small increments of work, and estimating the resources in labor, material and services required to accomplish the work. Then, as the work plan is implemented, the accomplishments and actual costs are reported against the plan and significant variances are identified for management action, if required. The two work tasks which were scheduled in the Transition Plan for preparing the <b>Nine</b> <b>Month</b> Program Plan were: (1) collect FY 86 - 88 financial data, production levels and capital construction schedules for FMPC, and (2) coordinate the preparation of the program plan consistent with C/SCSC where practical...|$|R
