500|$|During {{the course}} of the trial, Lanfranc is said to have stated that the court was [...] "trying you <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> {{capacity}} as bishop, but in regard to your fief; and in this way we judged the bishop of Bayeux in regard to his fief before the present king's father, and that king did not summon him to that plea as bishop but as brother and earl." [...] Unlike the later case of Thomas Becket, St-Calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops. Most of the bishops and barons that judged the case seem to have felt that the appeal to Rome was made to avoid having to answer an accusation that St-Calais knew was true. The final judgement was only reached after the king lost his temper and exclaimed: [...] "Believe me, bishop, you're not going back to Durham, and your men aren't going to stay at Durham, and you're not going to go free, until you release the castle." ...|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{noticed the}} {{combination}} of musical genres. Christina Kelly from Rolling Stone magazine criticised the group's image, and added that their songs, including [...] "Wannabe," [...] were [...] "a watered-down mix of hip-hop and cheesy pop balladry, brought together by a manager with a marketing concept." [...] Matt Diehl of Entertainment Weekly {{said that it was}} [...] "more a compendium of music styles (from ABBA-style choruses to unconvincing hip hop) than an actual song," [...] and Sara Scribner of the Los Angeles Times described it as [...] "a bubblegum hip-hop confection of rapping lifted off Neneh Cherry and Monie Love albums." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin magazine called it [...] "a quickie, mid-'80s teen paperback come to life [...] so gooey it melts in your hands, <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mouth." [...] The song ranked at fifteenth on Village Voice's 1997 [...] "Pazz & Jop" [...] critics' poll, conducted by music journalist Robert Christgau.|$|E

According to Feldmann, it was a song Hoppus {{did not want to}} write. [...] "There's clearly a lot of feelings involved with having a best friend who is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> band anymore," [...] Feldmann said. For him, the song [...] "acts as a bittersweet homage, a goodbye to this city... while acknowledging the interpersonal relationships within the band." [...] Stump also collaborated in the writing process for [...] "San Diego". [...] "The Only Thing That Matters" [...] originally began as a cowpunk-infused number until Hoppus re-wrote it. [...] "California" [...] is about [...] "giving credit to how lucky we are to have lived here and grown up" [...] in California. [...] "Brohemian Rhapsody"—its title a pun on Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody"—is another joke song with the sole lyric [...] "There's something about you I can't quite put my finger in." [...] Hoppus and Feldmann wrote and recorded the song in nine minutes.|$|E

[...] The extant De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, or Of the Unjust Persecution of the Bishop William I, details the trial of St-Calais before the king. This work is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial; some have doubted its authenticity, however, claiming St-Calais would not have been as knowledgeable in canon law as the work portrays him. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of the canon law, the False Decretals, which still survives.|$|E
