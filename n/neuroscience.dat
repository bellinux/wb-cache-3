5|$|The {{brain is}} not fully understood, and {{research}} is ongoing. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the human brain works. The boundaries between the specialties of <b>neuroscience,</b> neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in <b>neuroscience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development {{of the nervous system}}, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938. <b>Neuroscience</b> during the twentieth century began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the <b>Neuroscience</b> Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word <b>neuroscience</b> itself arises from this program.|$|E

5|$|The Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and <b>Neuroscience</b> (IoPPN) is {{a faculty}} and a {{research}} institution dedicated to discovering what causes {{mental illness and}} diseases of the brain, and to help identify new treatments of the diseases. The institute is the largest centre for research and postgraduate education in psychiatry, psychology and <b>neuroscience</b> in Europe. Originally established in 1924 as the Maudsley Hospital Medical School, the institute {{changed its name to}} the Institute of Psychiatry in 1948, merged with King’s College London in 1997, and was renamed IoPPN in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} <b>neuroscience</b> {{encompasses}} all approaches {{that seek to}} understand the brain {{and the rest of}} the nervous system. Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify <b>neuroscience</b> and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E

5|$|If {{one is a}} materialist and {{believes}} that all aspects of our common-sense psychology will find reduction to a mature cognitive <b>neuroscience,</b> and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism.|$|E
5|$|In <b>neuroscience,</b> {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E

40|$|Objective : This study {{analyses}} {{the research}} output in India in <b>neurosciences</b> {{during the period}} 1999 - 2008 and the analyses included research growth, rank, global publications&#x 2032; share, citation impact, share of international collaborative papers and major collaborative partner countries and patterns of research communication in most productive journals. It also analyses the characteristics of most productive institutions, authors and high-cited papers. The publication output and impact of India is also compared with China, Brazil and South Korea. Materials and Method s: Scopus Citation database was used for retrieving the publications&#x 2032; output of India and other countries in <b>neurosciences</b> during 1999 - 2008. Results : India&#x 2032;s global publications&#x 2032; share in <b>neurosciences</b> {{during the study period}} was 0. 99 &#x 0025; (with 4503 papers) and it ranked 21 st among the top 26 countries in <b>neurosciences.</b> The average annual publication growth rate was 11. 37 &#x 0025;, shared 17. 34 &#x 0025; of international collaborative papers and the average citation per paper was 4. 21. India was far behind China, Brazil and South Korea in terms of publication output, citation quality and share of international collaborative papers in <b>neurosciences.</b> Conclusion : India is far behind in terms of publication output, citation quality and share of international collaborative papers in <b>neurosciences</b> when compared to other countries with an emerging economy. There is an urgent need to substantially increase the research activities in the field of <b>neurosciences</b> in India...|$|R

5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in <b>neuroscience</b> and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E
