40|$|Certain gas sensors, {{particularly}} those based on optical spectroscopy, have enabled {{the detection of}} individual gas species such as methane with low cross-sensitivity to other gases. For gas-specific instruments used to measure <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> leaks, this paper considers whether {{it is necessary to}} consider the other components of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in addition to methane. We have quantified the effect of gas compositional variation on methane–based measurements on the ppm, %LEL and %volume scales. %LEL measurements, important for safety applications, are the most challenging for methane–specific detection. Acceptable levels of error have been drawn from <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> standards and by comparison with established <b>gas</b> <b>detectors.</b> The fundamental error expected from a methane-specific detector, as a result of variations in gas composition, would be larger than this benchmark on the %LEL scale. However for gas-specific detection, measurement of an additional component such as ethane is shown to reduce the error to below the benchmark level. This has been demonstrated experimentally using an instrument based on tunable diode laser spectroscopy. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{work performed}} by Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) {{to advance the}} state-of-the-art of surveying for leaks of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> from transmission and distribution pipelines. The principal project goal was to develop means of deploying on an automotive platform an improved version of the handheld laser-based standoff <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> leak <b>detector</b> previously developed by PSI and known as the Remote Methane Leak Detector or RMLD. A laser beam which interrogates the air for methane is projected from a spinning turret mounted upon a van. As the van travels forward, the laser beam scans an arc {{to the front and}} sides of the van so as to survey across streets and to building walls from a moving vehicle. When excess methane is detected within the arc, an alarm is activated. In this project, we built and tested a prototype Mobile RMLD (MRMLD) intended to provide lateral coverage of 10 m and one lateral scan for every meter of forward motion at forward speeds up to 10 m/s. Using advanced detection algorithms developed as part of this project, the early prototype MRMLD, installed {{on the back of a}} truck, readily detected simulated gas leaks of 50 liters per hour. As a supplement to the originally planned project, PSI also participated in a DoE demonstration of several gas leak detection systems at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) during September 2004. Using a handheld RMLD upgraded with the advanced detection algorithms developed in this project, from within a moving vehicle we readily detected leaks created along the 7. 4 mile route of a virtual gas transmission pipeline...|$|R
40|$|This paper brings {{together}} considerations of gas leak behaviour and leak detector design and use, {{with a view}} to improving the detection of low-pressure <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> leaks. An atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel has been used to study ground–based releases of methane at full scale over distances of up to 3 m, under controlled conditions. These scales are relevant to the detection of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> leaks from mains and services using hand-portable <b>gas</b> <b>detectors.</b> The mean spatial distribution of the leaking gas plume was determined and used to test and fit a Gaussian dispersion model. This was used for subsequent analysis with respect to the ability of <b>gas</b> leak <b>detectors</b> to confirm and locate a leak. For ground-based leaks, gas concentrations drop rapidly with height such that instruments should ideally sample the air from within 10 cm of ground level. The rapid dilution of gas with distance from the source means that instruments with lower limits of detection, ideally of a few parts per million, have much improved ability to detect a leak from greater distances downwind. Finally, observations showed the variable temporal nature of the gas and the potential for confusion when sampling gas at a single point in time and space.

The narrow-band filtering characteristic of optical fiber Bragg grating is used by this system to produce the narrow spectrum light signal which is wanted in difference absorption measuring. The system has full optical fiber structure, which is mainly composed by super luminescent emitting diode (SLED), optical fiber of 10 km, optical fiber <b>gas</b> <b>detector,</b> optical fiber isolator, optical fiber coupler network, optical fiber detecting grating, photoelectric detector and data processing unit.
