This report describes the testing of these three materials to determine which material is the best option for a long use catheter. Tests included tensile, simulated clinical life, and other tests. Some testing was performed using nitrogen and an industrial coolant. Testing revealed significant <b>non-circularities</b> for some catheters. With increasing pressure, the circularity of these catheters increased. The tensile tests were performed on samples with varying doses of radiation. Tensile testing showed significant decreases in ultimate tensile strength with increasing radiation dose for both polyurethanes.

Simulated clinical life tests were performed on a test fixture and with software to run the radiation source automatically for several hours at a time.

The material with the higher ductility was chosen as the better catheter material despite some disadvantages when compared to the stiffer polymer.

The <b>non-circularity</b> of the experimental beam has become progressively important as CMB experiments strive to attain higher angular resolution and sensitivity. The effect of non-circular beam on the power spectrum is important at multipoles larger than the beam-width. For recent experiments with high angular resolution, optimal methods of power spectrum estimation are computationally prohibitive and sub-optimal approaches, such as the Pseudo-Cl method, are used. We provide an analytic framework for correcting the power spectrum for the effect of beam <b>non-circularity</b> and non-uniform sky coverage (including incomplete/masked sky maps). The approach is perturbative in the distortion of the beam from <b>non-circularity</b> allowing for rapid computations when the beam is mildly non-circular.

However, addressing the systematic effects in the increasingly sensitive, high resolution, `full' sky measurements from different CMB experiments pose a stiff challenge. The analysis techniques must not only be computationally fast {{to contend with the}} huge size of the data, but, the higher sensitivity also limits the simplifying assumptions which can then be invoked to achieve the desired speed without compromising the final precision goals. While maximum likelihood is desirable, the enormous computational cost makes the suboptimal method of power spectrum estimation using Pseudo-C_l unavoidable for high resolution data. We provide a (semi) analytic framework to estimate bias in the power spectrum due to the effect of beam <b>non-circularity</b> and non-uniform sky coverage including incomplete/masked sky maps and scan strategy.

It is of great importance to {{understand the difference between}} various available sensors and polarization modes and to consider how to homogenize the data sets for a following combined analysis. In this study, a uniform and consistent analysis across different SAR missions is carried out. Three pairs of overlapping hybrid- and full-polarimetric C-band SAR scenes from the Radar Imaging Satellite- 1 (RISAT- 1) and Radarsat- 2 satellites are used. The overlapping Radarsat- 2 and RISAT- 1 scenes are taken close in time, with a relatively similar incidence angle covering sea ice in the Fram Strait and Northeast Greenland in September 2015. The main objective {{of this study is to}} identify the similarities and dissimilarities between a simulated and a real hybrid-polarity (HP) SAR system. The similarities and dissimilarities between the two sensors are evaluated using 13 HP features. The results indicate a similar separability between the sea ice types identified within the real HP system in RISAT- 1 and the simulated HP system from Radarsat- 2.

30|$|Equilibrium {{parameters}} of tokamak such as plasma internal inductance (l_i), poloidal beta (β _p) or combination expression β _p+l_i 2, known as Shafranov parameter, play very crucial roles in characterization of tokamak activities. It {{is also possible}} to extract many other plasma parameter such as displacement of plasma column, prediction of vertical displacement event (VDE) and energy confinement time of tokamak using equilibrium parameters [4, 5, 6, 7]. In tokamaks with circular cross section, {{it is possible to}} find evolution of the Shafranov parameter using model which is based on expansion (with respect to the inverse aspect ratio parameter of the tokamak) of polidal flux function ψ and the first order solution of the well known Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) in toroidal coordinate system [8, 9, 10]. This approach (the first order solution of the poloidal flux function and finding the first order poloidal and radial components of the magnetic field), however, is an approximate method which provide reliable information about Shafranov parameter and horizontal displacement of the plasma column (Shafranov shift) in tokamaks with circular cross section or when the <b>non-circularity</b> of the plasma surface is considered as a correction factor. Therefore, this model becomes inaccurate when the plasma <b>non-circularity</b> increases and does not provide valid assessment about Shafranov parameter in elongated tokamaks. In non-circular, highly elongated tokamaks, the plasma internal inductance and poloidal beta can be determined separately while for circular ones, only combination of l_i and β _p, (β _p+l_i 2), can be obtained and separation of l_i and β _p can be made using diamagnetic flux measurement, in addition to magnetic diagnostics. This approach, however, makes significant fluctuations and noise in small size tokamaks and there are some difficulties in compensation of the flux differences using diamagnetic flux measurement technique in circular and non-circular tokamaks. Therefore, it is highly desirable to use an effective, independent method to determine β _p and l_i separately from the external poloidal magnetic measurements alone (independent of the diamagnetic flux measurement).|$|E
