40|$|This paper {{examines}} the financial consequences of {{one section of}} Bill 47, which allowed Manitoba's parents to have "freedom of choice " when placing their children in school. The article traces the passage of Bill 47, the Public School Amendment Act, which the government of Manitoba rushed through the Legislative Assembly in 1996. Accompanying the freedom of choice was the mandatory transfer of funds when a student moved from one school district to another. The text explains how increased competition among schools, combined with parental choice, accelerated mobility rates among school divisions. A review of the 47 school divisions and 9 school districts that make up all the public schools in Manitoba revealed that 1 {{percent of the total}} public school budget had been changing hands among school divisions/districts as a result of student mobility in 1997. In terms of winners and losers, it was found that 51 percent of the total jurisdictions suffered financial loss when outgoing students outnumbered incoming students. Thirty-four percent of school divisions/districts benefitted from transfers and 14 percent experienced a <b>neutral</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact.</b> Although the overall effect on budgets remained modest for 1997 - 98, it is uncertain whether more profound fiscal consequences will be evident in coming years.

40|$|Land use {{has become}} a {{critical}} issue for Minnesota communities, and for many {{of those on the}} suburban fringe, the central land-use policy {{question is whether or not}} to approve new residential development. New residences may bring increased property tax revenues, but the new residents will demand additional services from the county, city, utilities, and school district. On net, the impact on finances at all levels of government, especially into the future, is not always clear. In this paper, we describe some of the possible roles for the Extension Service in helping Minnesota communities to predict the <b>fiscal</b> <b>impacts</b> of residential development.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of EconomicsTracy M. TurnerThe report {{examines}} the <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> of undocumented persons at the federal, state, {{and local levels}} in order to explain the likely effects of an amnesty program. The report first provides background on the population of undocumented persons in the United States and {{an overview of the}} laws which govern their status. Details of past and current amnesty legislation are given. The channels through which undocumented immigrants have a <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> on the three levels of government in the United States are explained. The paper discusses the economic theory relating to immigration and its effect on economic growth. Published works on the <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> of the undocumented on state and local budgets and on federal programs such as social security are reviewed. The research reviewed includes an analysis of the long-term <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> of immigrants. Undocumented immigrants impose a net cost {{at the state and local}} levels in most cases. However, many undocumented immigrants make income and payroll tax payments and the population of undocumented immigrants imposes a net benefit at the federal level. These sources of information are then used to explain how an amnesty program might change the <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> of the undocumented at the three levels of government. The recent executive order signed by President Obama, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), is an amnesty program that has a strong potential to help the U. S. economy retain young and highly educated workers, who have a positive <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> on government finances.

40|$|Abstract. With {{changing}} {{revenue and}} service responsibilities between federal, {{state and local}} governments, the need for local decisionmakers to accurately assess <b>fiscal</b> <b>impacts</b> of new economic developments or federal government programs has become increasingly important. In this paper we explore the use of cross-sectional data and procedures to derive a <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> model that crosses state boundaries. This study uses BEA Economic Areas to select counties {{to be included in}} the Great Basin <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> model. Fixed effects are specified to incorporate institutional differences between states and metropolitan counties. Results of this analysis indicate that model derivation is not statistically impacted by use of place of work employment rather than place of residence employment. An example analysis for a rural Nevada county shows how the Great Basin fiscal model can be applied to measure changes in county fiscal ba lances...|$|R
40|$|Granting {{exemptions}} {{from the}} property tax has been criticized because it eliminates a source of municipal revenue. Exempt properties appear to be concentrated in urban areas, so this effect is especially problematic for cities because {{of the existence of}} urban fiscal stress. Recent writers have indicated that exempt institutions may provide valuable services to their communities, but the cost of municipal services to their properties represents a significant <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> on local governments. This paper investigates the <b>fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> of a single exempt institution, Brown University, on the City of Providence, R. I. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>impact</b> analyses were used to measure the cost of municipal services provided to the university. The results of this investigation are that the costs of services to exempt educational institutions are minimal, and are not significant in view of the total municipal budget...|$|R
