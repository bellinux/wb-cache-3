A <b>new</b> <b>forming</b> {{method of}} {{honeycomb}} semi-cell structures was proposed {{by analyzing the}} defects of finished products processed by traditional roll forming method.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, {{we showed that}} the traditional form of the charged C-metric can be transformed, by a change of coordinates, into one with an explicitly factorizable structure function. This <b>new</b> <b>form</b> of the C-metric has the advantage that its properties become much simpler to analyze. In this paper, we propose an analogous <b>new</b> <b>form</b> for the rotating charged C-metric, with structure function G(ξ) = (1 − ξ 2) (1 + r+Aξ) (1 + r−Aξ), where r ± are the usual locations of the horizons in the Kerr–Newman black hole. Unlike the non-rotating case, this <b>new</b> <b>form</b> {{is not related to}} the traditional one by a coordinate transformation. We show that the physical distinction between these two forms of the rotating C-metric lies {{in the nature of the}} conical singularities causing the black holes to accelerate apart: the <b>new</b> <b>form</b> is free of torsion singularities and therefore does not contain any closed timelike curves. We claim that this <b>new</b> <b>form</b> should be considered the natural generalization of the C-metric with rotatio...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas.

In his view, the rules and strictures of gekiken were perverting kenjutsu into <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> that were no longer {{relevant}} to battlefield combat. He disdained the point-scoring swordsmanship of other kendoka of his era, ignoring light touches by his opponents in order to deliver his own powerful strikes. Nonetheless, the gekiken kogyo practices which he began created an interest in fencing which led ultimately to the development of modern kendo.|$|E

5|$|Great Oasis sites {{appeared}} in the Missouri River drainage, and have attributes of both Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric cultures. Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota. Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures, Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces, increased reliance on agriculture combined with hunting and gathering, substantial pit earth lodges, and a transition from Late Woodland to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms. Overall, Great Oasis {{appears to have been}} a regional adaptation of <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of farming and settlement patterns, including seasonal occupation of different ecological zones, that includes aspects of Late Woodland and the subsequent Middle Missouri Tradition.|$|E

5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign of the Kingdom of Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540–1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530–1540).|$|E
5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E
