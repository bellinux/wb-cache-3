5|$|In December 1999, it {{was found}} that <b>Netscape</b> Communicator used ROT13 as part of an {{insecure}} scheme to store email passwords. In 2001, Russian programmer Dimitry Sklyarov demonstrated that an eBook vendor, New Paradigm Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 to encrypt their documents; it has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit—for a serious encryption scheme. Windows XP uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys. ROT13 is also used in the Unix fortune program to conceal potentially offensive dicta.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{wanted to}} {{participate}} in the online-based entrepreneurial ventures which were increasingly popular and successful during the mid-1990s. His experience (from gaming in his youth) impressed on him the importance of networking. Wales was interested in computer science, experimenting with source code on the Internet and improving his skill at computer programming. In his spare time after work at Chicago Options Associates, Wales constructed his own web browser. While at the firm, he noted the successful 1995 initial public offering of <b>Netscape</b> Communications.|$|E
5000|$|Initially code-named [...] "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math {{formulas}} entirely, reconciled overlap {{among various}} proprietary extensions and adopted most of <b>Netscape's</b> visual markup tags. <b>Netscape's</b> blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted {{due to a}} mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas {{similar to that in}} HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.|$|R

5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival <b>Netscape,</b> and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
25|$|<b>Netscape</b> {{integrated}} {{a number}} of products initially developed by InSoft, including the first streaming media system called <b>Netscape</b> Media Server, the first Internet telephony technology called <b>Netscape</b> Conference, and the first media developers' platform called <b>Netscape</b> LiveMedia, as well as <b>Netscape</b> CoolTalk which was built on {{an early version of}} InSoft's shared whiteboard application.|$|E
25|$|<b>Netscape</b> Navigator {{was later}} {{developed}} by <b>Netscape,</b> which employed {{many of the}} original Mosaic authors; however, it intentionally shared no code with Mosaic. <b>Netscape</b> Navigator's code descendant is Mozilla Firefox. Starting in 1995 Mosaic lost market share to <b>Netscape</b> Navigator, and by 1997 only had {{a tiny fraction of}} users left, by which time the project was discontinued. Microsoft licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft {{was accused}} of {{releasing}} Internet Explorer at no charge to destroy <b>Netscape's</b> market (see United States v. Microsoft).|$|R

5000|$|Between June 2006 and September 2007, AOL {{operated}} <b>Netscape's</b> website {{as social}} news website similar to Digg. The format {{did not do}} well as traffic dropped 55.1 percent between November 2006 and August 2007. In September 2007, AOL reverted <b>Netscape's</b> website to a traditional news portal, and rebranded the social news portal as [...] "Propeller", moving the site to the domain [...] "propeller.com." [...] AOL shut down the Propeller website on October 1, 2010.|$|R
25|$|SeaMonkey is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} Internet suite. It is {{the continuation of the}} former Mozilla Application Suite, based on the same source code, which itself grew out of <b>Netscape</b> Communicator and formed the base of <b>Netscape</b> 6 and <b>Netscape</b> 7.|$|E
25|$|In December 1995, {{soon after}} {{releasing}} JavaScript for browsers, <b>Netscape</b> introduced an {{implementation of the}} language for server-side scripting with <b>Netscape</b> Enterprise Server.|$|E
25|$|Internet Explorer peaked during 2002 and 2003, {{with about}} 95% share. Its first notable {{competitor}} after beating <b>Netscape</b> was Firefox from Mozilla, which itself was an offshoot from <b>Netscape.</b>|$|E

25|$|Eric Hahn (Class of 1980) is the {{co-founder of}} Collabra Software (sold to <b>Netscape)</b> and Lookout Software (sold to Microsoft). In 1997, {{he became the}} CTO of <b>Netscape.</b>|$|E
25|$|A JavaScript engine (also {{known as}} JavaScript {{interpreter}} or JavaScript implementation) is an interpreter that interprets JavaScript source code and executes the script accordingly. The first JavaScript engine {{was created by}} Brendan Eich at <b>Netscape,</b> for the <b>Netscape</b> Navigator Web browser. The engine, code-named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C. It has since been updated (in JavaScript 1.5) to conform to ECMAScript 3. The Rhino engine, created primarily by Norris Boyd (formerly at <b>Netscape,</b> now at Google) is a JavaScript implementation in Java. Rhino, like SpiderMonkey, is ECMAScript 3 compliant.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{developed}} under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of <b>Netscape</b> Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the <b>Netscape</b> Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December. The final choice of name caused confusion, giving {{the impression that the}} language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by <b>Netscape</b> to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new Web programming language.|$|E
5000|$|Development was {{rapid and}} new {{features}} were routinely added, including <b>Netscape's</b> JavaScript (subsequently replicated by Microsoft as JScript) and proprietary HTML tags such as [...] and [...]|$|R

50|$|In December GT Interactive Software debuted on the NASDAQ stock {{exchange}} under the stock symbol GTIS. Raising $140 million with its initial public offering, {{it was one}} of the biggest IPOs of the year, second only to <b>Netscape's.</b>|$|R
25|$|Marc Andreessen, {{the leader}} of the team that {{developed}} Mosaic, left NCSA and, with James H. Clark, {{one of the founders of}} Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), and four other former students and staff of the University of Illinois, started Mosaic Communications Corporation. Mosaic Communications eventually became <b>Netscape</b> Communications Corporation, producing <b>Netscape</b> Navigator.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the merger}} of Insoft, Harple served as Senior Vice President at <b>Netscape.</b> Harple's team used the {{collaborative}} computing and streaming media technologies created at InSoft {{as the basis for}} new <b>Netscape</b> products such as LiveAudio and LiveVideo. These efforts {{led to the creation of}} a number of internet standards, including Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).|$|E
25|$|In September 1995 <b>Netscape</b> Navigator 2.0 {{added the}} ability for {{animated}} GIFs to loop.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{received}} several awards, including <b>Netscape's</b> [...] "Cool Site of the Month" [...] and [...] "Cool Site of the Day", a 'Top Site' recognition by Yahoo! Magazine [...] {{as well as}} a recommended site of FHM Magazine.|$|R
50|$|To {{address the}} {{scalability}} shortcomings of CGI, Open Market developed FastCGI and first introduced {{it in their}} webserver product in the mid-1990s. Open Market originally developed FastCGI in part as a competitive response to <b>Netscape's</b> proprietary, in-process API (NSAPI) for developing Web applications.|$|R
50|$|Because neither Winer nor the RSS-DEV Working Group had <b>Netscape's</b> involvement, {{they could}} not make an {{official}} claim on the RSS name or format. This has fueled ongoing controversy in the syndication development community as to which entity was the proper publisher of RSS.|$|R
25|$|PNG support first {{appeared}} in Internet Explorer 4.0b1 (32-bit only for NT) and in <b>Netscape</b> 4.04.|$|E
25|$|By default, however, an {{animation}} {{displays the}} sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. Since GIF is designed to allow users to define new blocks, <b>Netscape</b> in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to the GIF file) to implement the <b>Netscape</b> Application Block (NAB). This block, placed immediately before all the animation frames, specifies {{the number of times}} {{the sequence of}} frames should be played. (The value 0 signifies continuous display.) Support for these repeating animations first appeared in <b>Netscape</b> Navigator version 2.0, and then spread to other browsers. Most browsers now recognize and support NAB, though it is not strictly part of the GIF89a specification.|$|E
25|$|In November 1996, <b>Netscape</b> {{submitted}} JavaScript to Ecma International {{to carve}} out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at <b>Netscape.</b> This led to the official release of the language specification ECMAScript published in the first edition of the ECMA-262 standard in June 1997, with JavaScript being the most well known of the implementations. ActionScript and JScript are other well-known implementations of ECMAScript.|$|E
50|$|<b>Netscape's</b> IPO in 1995 {{propelled}} Andreessen {{into the}} imagination of the public. Featured on the cover of Time and other publications, Andreessen became the poster-boy wunderkind of the Internet bubble generation: young, twenty-something, high-tech, ambitious, and worth millions (or billions) of dollars practically overnight.|$|R
5|$|<b>Netscape's</b> browser was dominant, {{in terms}} of market share, but it had lost most of its share to Internet Explorer during the first browser war. By the end of 2007, the usage share of <b>Netscape's</b> browsers had fallen from over 90% in the 1990s, to less than 1%. Its second-largest {{acquisition}} is the purchase of MapQuest, a web mapping company. From 19992009, MapQuest had the greatest market share among mapping websites; it has since dropped to second place, behind Google Maps. The majority of the companies acquired by AOL are based in the United States. As of April 2008, AOL has acquired 41companies. Most of the acquired companies {{are related to the}} internet, including several internet service providers and web browsers.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of their}} {{distributions}} partners included Excite, WebCrawler, <b>Netscape's</b> Netcenter, Prodigy, Geocities, CNET, Snap.com, Road Runner, Go, @Home Network, AltaVista, Sony Station, XOOM, and iVillage. Pogo.com's games and community were {{considered by some}} to be very engaging, and Pogo.com became the stickiest site among the top-100 websites.|$|R
