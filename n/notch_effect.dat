2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E

This old concept has been recently modeled using sound mechanical principles to properly quantify the influence of the stress gradient around the notch tip on the fatigue behavior of mechanically short cracks.

40|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{patterned}} mask from contamination during lithography process, pellicle has become a critical component for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology. According to EUV pellicle requirements, the pellicle should have high EUV transmittance and robust mechanical property. In this study, silicon nitride, which is well-known for its remarkable mechanical property, was used as a pellicle membrane material to achieve high EUV transmittance. Since long silicon wet etching process time aggravates <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> causing stress concentration on the edge or corner of etched structure, the remaining membrane is prone to fracture at the end of etch process. To overcome this <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> and attain high transmittance, we began preparing a rather thick (200 nm) SiNx membrane which can be stably manufactured and was thinned into 43 nm thickness with HF wet etching process. The measured EUV transmittance shows similar values to the simulated result. Therefore, the result shows possibilities of HF thinning processes for SiNx EUV pellicle fabrication. ? ??? ?? ??

40|$|While a long stable crack {{propagation}} phase was observed during experiments of complex welded components, very conservative {{assessments of the}} fatigue life were achieved in the past. The difference was explained by the stress gradient occurring over the plate thickness.

The variants differ related to global geometry, boundary conditions and weld shape. The analyses aim to investigate how the crack propagation is altered if the structural configuration gets more complex. In conclusion, the stress gradient over the plate thickness, the apparent plate thickness and the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> slows down the crack propagation rate if the same stress value being effective for fatigue appears at the weld toe.

40|$|Austenitic steels {{are among}} the {{stainless}} steels the most common used type of material to produce sheet metal parts which can be manufactured by laser beam cutting in a useful manner. However, {{the use of this}} technique to manufacture structural thick parts is restricted due to the creation of macroscopic defects and the lack of reliable fatigue strength data. In this context, the fatigue behavior of sheet-like samples made of metastable austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 cut by laser beam is discussed in this paper. The analyses showed that laser beam cutting creates three kinds of macroscopic defects, which are a pronounced relief-like structure along the cut surface, burr in the underside of the cut edge and pores in the interface between the recast layer and base material or inside the recast layer. As a consequence, the fatigue strength of parts cut by laser beam is 40 % lower in comparison to specimens in a macroscopically quasi defect-free state. An evaluation of the fatigue results based on comprehensive fractographic analyses allows to explain the reasons for distinct differences between the aforementioned influence factors. The most significant reduction of fatigue life is attributed to the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> of the burr, followed by the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> created by pores, while the influence of the surface relief is of minor significance...|$|E
