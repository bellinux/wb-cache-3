50|$|<b>NAFTA</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to eliminate tariff barriers and liberalize investment opportunities and trade in services. NAFTA includes Canada, Mexico, and the United States, where {{went into effect}} in 1994. The United States and Canada historically have had various forms of mutual economic cooperation. They signed the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement effective January 1, 1989, which eliminated all tariffs on bilateral trade by January 1, 1998. In February 1991, Mexico approached the United States to establish a free trade agreement. The formal negotiations that began in June 1991 included Canada.

50|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> <b>is</b> a {{considered}} a regional governing entity that encompasses {{the principles of}} new constitutionalism.  President Ronald Regan referred to the North American Free Trade Agreement as a “new economic constitution.”  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore public services in free trade.|$|E

The new district most closely resembled the one recently vacated by U.S. Representative Jim Traficant, who had been convicted on corruption charges and sent to federal prison.

40|$|Since it {{was enacted}} in 1994 the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> has <b>been</b> an {{economic}} success, but {{a disaster for}} the average worker. The safety net promised by President Clinton disappeared. Many workers who were suddenly out of the job received no benefits from the United States. They applied for Transitional Adjustment Assistance (TAA), a program that gave laid off workers extended unemployment and job retraining, from the government but were denied. In the {{year and a half after}} <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> enacted 3, 457 laid-off California workers applied for TAAs, but only 914 were certified by the U. S. Department of Labor to receive benefits. Another area of the safety net that fell through was the public submissions process within the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC). The public submission process was supposed to serve as a check on any of the signatory countries to insure they do not violate labor laws. Since <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> enacted there have been 29 cases submitted for review, and not one of them has resulted in anything more than setting up a meeting to discuss recourse. In addition, not one of those submissions was done so by a signatory. To improve worker 2 ̆ 7 s rights throughout North America, <b>NAFTA</b> has to <b>be</b> restructured to insure that governments are accountable for their own actions, and that they follow through with the promises they made 14 years ago when <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> signed and ratified into law...|$|R

50|$|The {{force of}} {{globalization}} {{has affected the}} U.S.-Mexican border where communities like colonias exist. Globalization {{is the process of}} an increased involvement of the global economy that is becoming a standard from a fusion of factors such as technology, free trade, and mass migrations. Within this globalization came an increased informality of housing in the U.S. Colonias surfaced because of the border’s strategic location and trade liberalizations. People shifted from the traditional agricultural labor to work in transportation, construction, and manufacturing, which made room for colonias to grow at the borders. When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1994, it began a processing of border transactions. Globalization has brought areas together such as the U.S.-Mexico border, where cultural proximity has benefited trade relations. The <b>NAFTA</b> <b>is</b> now promising to bring more economic activity to the U.S.-Mexican border to further develop the area and attract more residents.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{calibrated}} growth model, {{the dynamic}} effects of NAFTA on Mexican development are studied. Two scenarios are analyzed. In the first, <b>NAFTA</b> <b>is</b> assumed to stimulate inflows of physical capital into Mexico.

The skilled wage rises more sharply, however, increasing the skill premium and rapidly accelerating the accumulation of human capital. In the second scenario, <b>NAFTA</b> <b>is</b> assumed to {{have the effect of}} fully integrating Mexico with the U. S. and Canada. Integration also reduces the interest rate and raises both wage rates in Mexico, but in this case the skill premium falls and human capital accumulation speeds up only a little.

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{is part of}} Public Citizen's "NAFTA at Ten Series" and {{documents}} {{the results of the}} failed NAFTA model. Before NAFTA, trade agreements dealt with traditional matters such as cutting tariffs and lifting quotas that had set the terms of trade in goods between countries. NAFTA shattered the boundaries of trade agreements; its central focus and most powerful rules concerned investment, and it contained 900 pages of one-size-fits-all "non-trade" rules with significant implications for food safety, drug patents and access to medicines, not to mention jobs, wages and economic security. It also constrained the ability of local government to zone against sprawl or toxic industries. <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> a radical experiment [...] never before had a merger of three nations with such different levels of development <b>been</b> attempted. When <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> being debated, proponents and opponents alike predicted its consequences. Now the data are in.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} trade liberalisation and migration {{in the case of}} Mexico. The increasing bilateral trade between Mexico and the United States after signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> <b>was</b> supposed to stem the illegal Mexican migration flow by contributing to economic growth and job creation in both countries. Twelve years after the treaty has come into effect questions emerge to what extent <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> able to reduce the migration pressure: are trade and migration substitutes like the policy-makers had assumed or are they complements? Using monthly data from 1966 until 2004 we estimate a distributed lag model with the number of apprehensions at the US-Mexican border as a proxy for illegal migration. The results indicate that increasing trade flows cause larger illegal migration from Mexico to the United States. Migration; International Trade; Distributed Lag Model; Mexico; NAFTA...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The North American Free Trade Agreement (<b>NAFTA)</b> has <b>been</b> {{in effect}} since January 1, 1994. <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> signed by President George H. W.

S. trade policy under the Administration of President Donald J. Trump. During his election campaign, President Trump stated his desire to renegotiate NAFTA and that he would examine the ramifications of withdrawing from the agreement once he entered into office.

50|$|The {{economic}} growth of Mexico has remained steady between 1.2 and 2.5 {{percent since the}} passage of NAFTA, far from the large-scale growth <b>NAFTA</b> <b>was</b> supposed to lead to.
