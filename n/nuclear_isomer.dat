However, radioactivity of this <b>nuclear</b> <b>isomer</b> has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring <b>nuclear</b> <b>isomer</b> (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).

In bulk water, rapid proton exchange and hindered molecular rotation obscure the direct observation of two spin isomers. The supramolecular endofullerene H 2 O@C 60 provides freely rotating, isolated water molecules even at cryogenic temperatures.

The attribution of the effect to ortho–para conversion is validated by comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance and quantum theory.

40|$|The Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) at the ISOLDE on-line isotope {{separator}} {{is based}} on the selective excitation of atomic transitions by tunable laser radiation. Ion beams of isotopes of 20 elements have been produced using the RILIS setup. Together with the mass separator and a particle detection system it represents a tool for high-sensitive laser spectroscopy of short-lived isotopes. By applying narrow-bandwidth lasers for the RILIS one can study isotope shifts (IS) and hyperfine structure (HFS) of atomic optical transitions. Such measurements are capable of providing data on nuclear charge radii, spins and magnetic moments of exotic nuclides far from stability. Although the Doppler broadening of the optical absorption lines limits the resolution of the technique, the accuracy of the HFS measurements examined in experiments with stable Tl isotopes approaches a value of 100 MHz. Due to the hyperfine splitting of atomic lines the RILIS gives an opportunity to separate <b>nuclear</b> isomers. <b>Isomer</b> selectivity of the RILIS has been used in studies of short-lived Ag, Cu and Pb isotopes...|$|R

Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2million years (technetium-98), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{improved}} {{procedure for}} accurate determination of empirical lower state rotational quantum numbers from molecular absorption spectra is demonstrated for methane. We combine the high resolution absorption spectra in the 7070 – 7300 cm− 1 frequency range obtained in liquid nitrogen cooled cryogenic cell (T = 81 K) and in supersonic planar jet expansion (TR = 25 K). Empirical lower state energies of 59 transitions are determined from {{the ratio of}} the absolute absorption line strengths at 25 and 81 K. The procedure relies on the realistic description of rotational state populations in the supersonic jet expansion where non-equilibrium <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomer</b> distributions are generated due to the rapid cooling. The accuracy of the experimental determination of the lower state energies with J ≤ 3 is found to considerably improve the results of the same approach applied to spectra at 296 and 81 K.

The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as 265Mt, 272Mt, 273Mt, and 279Mt, are predicted to have half-lives longer than the known isotopes.

Experimental realizations of two core {{building blocks of}} a quantum repeater are described: a multiplexed quantum memory and a telecom interface for long-lived quantum memories. A color change of single-photon level light fields by several hundred nanometers in an optically thick cold gas is demonstrated, while preserving quantum entanglement with a remotely stored matter excitation. These are essential elements for long-distance quantum telecommunication, fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, and applications in secure communication and computation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the wave packet {{dynamics}} of nuclear spin isomers of polyatomic molecules after interaction with static and time-dependent magnetic fields and moderate intense non-resonant laser pulses is investigated. In particular, {{the process of}} inducing (internal) molecular rotation as well as alignment of molecules by manipulating their rotational or rotational-torsional degrees of freedom is studied. In {{the first part of}} the thesis all theoretical concepts for identifying nuclear spin isomers and for describing their quantum dynamics will be discussed. Especially the symmetrization postulate and the molecular symmetry group will be introduced and illustrated for some examples of molecules. These concepts will be extended to the case of identifying nuclear spin isomers in the presence of an external field. In the second part it is shown for nitromethane that magnetic fields are able to induce unidirectional rotations in opposite directions for different nuclear spin isomers of molecules containing methyl groups if the dipolar interaction is included. Additionally, it is demonstrated that different nuclear spin isomers of a chemical compound may show different alignment after the interaction with a moderate intense laser pulse. As shown for the rigid symmetric top propadien and the rigid asymmetric tops ethene and analogues, distinct pairs of nuclear spin isomers show at certain points in time a complementary behavior: while one isomer is showing alignment the partner isomer is showing anti-alignment. Moreover, it is illustrated that not every <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomer</b> can be aligned equally efficient. The alignment of non-rigid molecules is considered as well. As an example for a molecule with feasible torsion in the electronic ground state, the alignment of diboron tetrafluoride is investigated. It becomes apparent that not only rotational but also the torsional dynamics of the molecules is nuclear spin selective; different nuclear spin isomers have at distinct points in time a complementary molecular structure. As an application of nuclear spin selective quantum dynamics, the possibility is explored how two laser pulses can be used for exciting directed motions differently for different nuclear spin isomers. Likewise, the separation of isotopomers is discussed. The thesis closes with a discussion of the models used here and an outlook on how the obtained results may be used to separate nuclear spin isomers...|$|R

In 1998, a group led by Carl Collins of the University of Texas at Dallas reportedHf Induced by X-Ray Irradiation|author=Collins, C.B., Davanloo, F., Iosif, M.|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.695|bibcode=1999PhRvL..82..695C|display-authors=etal}}Hf induced by x-ray irradiation|author=Collins, C.B., Davanloo, F., Rusu, A.C.|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.61.054305|bibcode = 2000PhRvC..61e4305C |display-authors=etal}} having successfully initiated such a trigger. Signal-to-noise ratios were small in those first experiments, and to date no other group {{has been able to}} duplicate these results. Peter Zimmerman described claims of weaponization potential as having been based on [...] "very bad science".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1937, {{the rapid}} successes Bothe and Gentner had with the {{building}} and research uses of a Van de Graaff generator had led them to consider building a cyclotron. By November, a report had already {{been sent to the}} President of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society; today, the Max Planck Society), and Bothe began securing funds from the [...] Helmholtz-Gesellschaft (Helmholtz Society; today, the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres), the Badischen Kultusministerium (Baden Ministry of Culture), I.G. Farben, the KWG, and various other research oriented agencies. Initial promises led to ordering a magnet from Siemens in September 1938, however, further financing then became problematic. In these times, Gentner continued his research on the nuclear photoeffect, with the aid of the Van de Graaff generator, which had been upgraded to produce energies just under 1 MeV. When his line of research was completed with the 7Li (p, gamma) and the 11B (p, gamma) reactions, and on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>isomer</b> 80Br, Gentner devoted his full effort to the building of the planned cyclotron.|$|E
