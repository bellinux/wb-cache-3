50|$|The Employment of Children Act 1903, while {{primarily}} {{providing for}} industries outside {{the scope of}} the Factory Act, incidentally secured that children employed as half Acts of timers should not also be employed in other occupations. The <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accidents</b> Act 1906 amended the whole system <b>of</b> notification <b>of</b> <b>accidents,</b> simultaneously in mines, quarries, factories and workshops, and will be set out in following paragraphs. The Factory and Workshop Act 1907 amended the law in respect of laundries by generally applying the provisions of 1901 to trade laundries while granting them choice of new exceptional periods, and by extending the provisions of the act (with certain powers to the Home Office by Orders laid before parliament to allow variations) to institution laundries carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes. The Employment of Women Act 1907 repealed an exemption in the act of 1901 (and earlier acts) relating to employment of women in flax scutch mills, thus bringing this employment under the ordinary provisions as to period of employment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{provisions}} of the Metalliferous Mines Acts 1872 and 1875, applied to quarries, are those relating to payment of wages in public-houses, <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> to the inspector, appointment and powers of inspectors, arbitration, coroners' inquests, special rules, penalties, certain of the definitions, and {{the powers of the}} secretary of state finally to decide disputed questions whether places come within the application of the acts. For other matters, and in particular fencing of machinery and employment of women and young persons, the Factory Acts apply, with a proviso that nothing shall prevent the employment of young persons (boys) in three shifts for not more than eight hours each. In 1899 it was reported by the inspectors of mines that special rules for safety had been established in over 2000 quarries. In the reports for 1905 it was reported that the accounts <b>of</b> blasting <b>accidents</b> indicated that there was [...] " [...] still much laxity in observance of the Special rules, and that many irregular and dangerous practices are in vogue." [...] The absence or deficiency of external fencing to a quarry dangerous to the public has been since 1887 (50 & 51 Vict. c. 19) deemed a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily in the manner provided by the Public Health Act 1875.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the act of}} 1887, {{there have}} {{followed}} five minor acts, based {{on the recommendation of}} the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act 1894 rendered it illegal for an employer (" [...] owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager [...] ") to make the removal of a particular checkweigher a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment of a checkweigher. The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher. In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of safety lamps and non-inflammable substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a manager's certificate a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties. In 1906, the <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accidents</b> Act provided for improved annual returns <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and for immediate reporting to the district inspector <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> under newly defined conditions as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines.|$|R

40|$|Health {{and safety}} issues are major {{concerns}} in the United Kingdom (UK) construction industry. Evidence suggests that research studies on construction health and safety management issues have yet {{to lead to a}} signifi cant reduction in the number <b>of</b> <b>accidents.</b> To tackle the causes of days lost through accidents and to improve health and safety performance in the construction industry, the industry needs to understand the cost benefi t analysis (CBA) <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> prevention. The paper reviewed the rate <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> in the UK construction industry and presents a model predicting CBA <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> prevention on construction projects. A quantitative method approach was used to collect data from health and safety managers in the UK construction industry for the survey. A total of 79 contractors (small, medium and large) partici-pated in the questionnaire survey. A simple linear regression model was adopted to identify the effect of total costs <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> prevention on benefi ts <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> prevention. The result revealed that costs <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> prevention are signifi cantly associated with benefi ts <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> prevention.

The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements.

The three classes <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> identified in this study were fatal, serious, and minor. The cost of each class <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> was developed in terms of the probability <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> occurrence class i (Pai), human severity cost <b>of</b> the <b>accident</b> (Hi), degree <b>of</b> severity (fi), service life of the aircraft (L), interest rate (t), usage life of aircraft (T), acquisition cost of damaged aircraft (N), period of idleness of aircraft due to accident (ฮธi), flight rate (FR), economic implication cost (Ec), and value of damaged goods (Qi). Historical data was collected from the Federal Aviation Authority {{with the aid of a}} questionnaire and personal interviews on the occurrence and consequences <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> between the periods of 1983 to 2007.

The need {{for the analysis of}} the spatial distribution <b>of</b> traffic <b>accidents,</b> as an aid to select the most appropriate type <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> reduction programme (e. g. site, route and area plans) and assessing the effectiveness of such plans after implementation, is very important. The current practice (e. g. visual examination) for assessing the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> is reviewed. In this thesis, various methods for the statistical analysis of spatial distributions <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> (including quadrat and nearest - neighbour methods) are reviewed and further improvements are described. Accidents are random events subject to both temporal and spatial variation. The basic variables for accident analysis are; distance and direction <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> locations in terms of North and East co-ordinates, azimuth, and the year <b>of</b> the <b>accident.</b> A new method for analysing the spatial pattern is proposed, whereby detection of a particular pattern will indicate which type <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> reduction programme is most appropriate. The method distinguishes the spatial distribution (point cluster, line cluster, area cluster or a completely spatially random distribution) <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> in different types of road networks (regular or irregular and dense or sparse).
