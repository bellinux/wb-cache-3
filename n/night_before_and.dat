5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received. Southern Miss wanted him to play defensive back, but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position {{in the second half of}} the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{remained}} fit {{and active}} into his seventies, playing golf and tennis regularly. On Wednesday, September 17, 1996, he {{was due to}} play tennis with a friend, but collapsed at his summer home in Ocean City the <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> {{was taken to the}} hospital where he died the next day. The cause of death was acute leukemia, previously undiagnosed. The funeral, at Timonium, Maryland, was mainly confined to family; Buchanan and some of Agnew's former Secret Service guards also attended to pay their final respects. In recognition of his service as vice president, an honor guard of the combined military services fired a 21-gun salute at the graveside. Agnew's wife Judith survived him by 16 years, dying at Rancho Mirage on June 20, 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became {{increasingly}} concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest—it was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00am that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> so reported the death to the coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the game, Derek Jeter and Albert Pujols were named winners of the Hank Aaron Award for their {{offensive}} performances in 2009. This was the first game to test manager Joe Girardi's decision to use a three-man starting rotation, as CC Sabathia started the game on three days rest, a shorter period than he normally got during the regular season. Jeter led the game off with a single and advanced to third base on a double by Johnny Damon. Jeter scored via a Mark Teixeira ground out and Alex Rodriguez was hit by a pitch. Rodriguez was hit twice the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> the umpires issued warnings to both benches. Jorge Posada then added to the Yankees lead that inning with a sacrifice fly. The Phillies answered quickly, scoring a run on successive doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley in the bottom of the first. Sabathia intentionally walked Jayson Werth, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Although the run counted, instant replay of Howard's slide later showed that he did not touch home plate.|$|E
5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division {{had been}} ordered to cut the road linking Jaffa to Jerusalem by {{capturing}} Ramleh and Ludd. This was the only main road from the coast through Ramleh up the Vale of Ajalon to Jerusalem. During the morning Meldrum's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade crossed the river close to the sand dunes with 1st Light Horse Brigade on its right. By 09:00 El Kubeibeh had been occupied by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade before pushing on towards the Wadi Hunayn. Here Ottoman rearguards were encountered in the orange groves and on the hills between El Kubeibeh and the sand dunes. About noon the 1st Light Horse Brigade drove an Ottoman rearguard from a ridge facing Yibna where the Anzac Mounted Division had bivouaced the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> occupied the village of Rehovot also called Deiran. At {{the same time the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade fought off a strongly entrenched rearguard at Ayun Kara. After conceding considerable ground the Ottoman soldiers made a vigorous counterattack but were finally defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Genesis was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting {{the team of}} Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Ray & Brother Devon) against the team of Jeff Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris & James Storm; AMW). This match was {{promoted}} for Genesis by TNA on their official website, and later announced on the October29 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. The storyline behind this match began the October1 episode of Impact!, when Team 3D made their TNA debut. On the October8 episode of Impact!, AMW and Jarrett assaulted Team 3D to the point they were left covered in blood. Afterwards, Team 3D were not seen due to a scripted injury, with Jarrett, AMW, and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, Eric Young, Petey Williams, and Coach Scott D'Amore) hosting a segment where they buried Team 3D's careers on the October15 episode of Impact!. Meanwhile, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jarrett {{was involved in a}} feud with Kevin Nash which was to lead to a title defense at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event on October23. However, Nash {{was rushed to the hospital}} the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> was not cleared to wrestle. Rhino took Nash's place in the match, where he defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The same night Team 3D made their return from their scripted injury, coming to the aid of Rhino after the main event. Later, Jarrett reclaimed the title on the November3 episode of Impact!.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at Turning Point {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended against the {{challenger}} Rhino. The storyline behind this match began at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event on October23, 2005, where Jarrett was to defend the title against Kevin Nash. However, Nash {{was rushed to the}} hospital the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> was not cleared to wrestle. Rhino took Nash's place in the match, where he defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Later, Jarrett reclaimed the title on the November3, 2005 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. This led to a Six-Man Tag Team match pitting the team of Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) against the team of Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November13, 2005. Rhino and Team 3D were the victors of the encounter. A rematch between Rhino and Jarrett for the title was announced on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact! for Turning Point. TNA aired a series of video packages focusing on Rhino and his title match heading into the show.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E

Upon its mustering out, several members planned to ambush Custer, but he was warned the <b>night</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> the attempt thwarted.|$|E
