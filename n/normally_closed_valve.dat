40|$|Microvalves {{containing}} silicone-rubber seals actuated by {{heating and}} cooling of paraffin have been proposed for development as integral components of microfluidic systems. In comparison with other microvalves actuated by various means (electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, pneumatic, and others), the proposed valves (1) would contain simpler structures that could be fabricated at lower cost and (2) could be actuated by simpler (and thus less expensive) control systems. Each valve according to the proposal would include a flow channel bounded on one side by a flat surface {{and on the other}} side by a curved surface defined by an arched-cross-section, elastic seal made of silicone rubber [polydimethylsilane (PDMS) ]. The seal would be sized and shaped so that the elasticity of the PDMS would hold the channel open except when the seal was pressed down onto the flat surface to close the channel. The principle of actuation would exploit the fact that upon melting or freezing, the volume of a typical paraffin increases or decreases, respectively, by about 15 percent. In a valve according to the proposal, the seal face opposite that of the channel would be in contact with a piston-like plug of paraffin. In the case of a valve designed to be normally open at ambient temperature, one would use a paraffin having a melting temperature above ambient. The seal would be pushed against the flat surface to close the channel by heating the paraffin above its melting temperature. In the case of a valve designed to be normally closed at ambient temperature, one would use a paraffin having a melting temperature below ambient. The seal would be allowed to spring away from the flat surface to open the channel by cooling the paraffin below its melting temperature. The availability of paraffins that have melting temperatures from 70 to + 80 C should make it possible to develop a variety of normally closed and normally open valves. The figure depicts examples of prototype normally open and normally closed valves according to the proposal. In each valve, an arch cross section defining a channel having dimensions of the order of tens of micrometers would be formed in a silicone-rubber sheet about 40 m thick. The silicone rubber sheet would be hermetically sealed to a lower glass plate that would define the sealing surface and to an upper glass plate containing a well. The well would be filled with paraffin and capped with a rigid restraining layer of epoxy. In the normally open valve, the paraffin would have a melting temperature above ambient (e. g., 40 C) and the wall of the well would be coated with a layer of titanium that would serve as an electric heater. In the <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> <b>valve,</b> the paraffin would have a melting temperature below ambient (e. g. - 5 C). Instead of a heater in the well, the <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> <b>valve</b> would include a thermoelectric cooler on top of the epoxy cap...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe gravity damper is {{safety device}} {{used for the}} air {{treatment}} that prevent overpressure inside the unit through the opening. It is a <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> <b>valve</b> under {{the effect of the}} gravity force, which, under the action of the incident air flow, allows to manage any excess mass. Clearly, although the device is rather simple and therefore reliable, the operating conditions may prove burdensome, especially if the gravity dampers are applied to installations of energy transformation, such as the gas turbines; this is mainly due to the need to develop large masses of air at speeds rather incurred. This article describes an experiment carried out on a gravity damper designed to be installed in a gas turbine. The characterization has been performed in numerical (CFD-FEM), considering both the mode shapes and the natural frequencies of the device in working condition as well as any phenomenon of detachment of the fluid that can trigger vortex shedding and subsequently validated in the wind tunnel facilities of the University of Perugia. In particular, what is wanted to be highlighted is the fact that, after a preliminary analysis, it has been clearly evident that, under the operating conditions, the structure would be affected by phenomena of vortex shedding. The shedding frequency is next to some natural frequencies of the structure, with obvious repercussions on the integrity of the structure. An experimental vibration analysis performed in the wind tunnel at flow regime has in fact allowed to identify the phenomenon of lock-in...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Microfluidic systems require {{numerous}} {{control valves}} {{in order to}} function properly. These valves form the basic unit of fluid handling within the microfluidic system. Many different valves have been designed and manufactured, both active and passive. The current paper investigates a novel passive valve that works {{on the principle of}} hydrostatic pressure. This <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> <b>valve</b> can also be used in a toggle valve combination, where only one external actuation source is required to yield two valves that open and close sequentially. The first valve is an active valve, operated pneumatically. The second valve operates purely on the pressure applied by the fluid in the microfluidic channel at the valve entrance. One valve is thus always closed, while the other is open. By changing the valve entrance properties, the valve can be designed to operate at different actuation pressures. The valve mechanism, which consists of four layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was designed and manufactured using the SU- 8 lithography and replication molding processes. It was successfully implemented, and initial results show the relationship between the applied pressure and flow rate. In addition to being used as a toggle valve, this design also allows for the passive valve {{to be used as a}} stand-alone pressure valve and as a one way valve, which would restrict fluid flow to a single direction. This may give rise to the possibility of designing entirely passive microfluidic devices, which would be advantageous from a circuit complexity and energy usage perspective.

40|$|The use of {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) in microfluidic devices is extensive {{in academic}} research. One {{of the most}} fundamental treatments is to expose PDMS to plasma oxidation in order to render its surface temporarily hydrophilic and capable of permanent bonding.

In the mean time, integrated micro fluidic devices and systems are expected to extract biomedical information in ways similar to how IC-chips process electrical current. Therefore, functional integration and fabrication process integration are the keys and challenges to MEMS development.

30|$|Semi-active {{stiffness}} {{control devices}} are utilized {{to modify the}} stiffness and thus the natural vibration characteristics of the structure {{to which they are}} attached. The system primarily controls the stiffness of a building to establish a non-resonant condition during earthquakes. The semi-active stiffness devices are engaged or released so as to include or not include, respectively, the stiffness of the bracing system of the structure. Normally, the device is composed of a hydraulic cylinder with a <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> solenoid control <b>valve</b> inserted in the tube connecting the two cylinder chambers. The solenoid valve can either be on or off, thus opening or closing, respectively, the fluid flow path through the tube. When the <b>valve</b> is <b>closed,</b> the fluid cannot flow and effectively locks the beam to the braces below. In contrast, when the valve is open, the fluid flows freely and disengages the stiffness control devices. The system may be regarded as fail-safe {{in the sense that the}} interruption of power causes the semi-active stiffness devices to automatically engage, thus increasing the stiffness of the structure (Kamagata and Kobori 1994; Kobori et al. 1993; Yang et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|Most {{fluid power}} systems involve {{conversion}} of mechanical work to fluid work through a pump. Similarly, many fluid power systems also convert the fluid work to mechanical work through a hydraulic motor. Thus, the overall efficiency of hydraulic pumps and motors {{is critical to}} the efficiency of fluid power systems. Current state-of-the-art axial piston units can operate at high efficiency over a limited range of speed, pressure, and displacement. The emerging field of digital hydraulics is providing opportunities to widen the operating conditions where a pump/motor can operate at high efficiency by incorporating high-speed on/off valves to decouple the unit shaft position from the commutation of the displacement chambers to the unit working ports. This freedom permits operating strategies unique to digital pump/motors, but the main advantage is that leakage and friction losses can scale more closely with pump flow. ^ This work defines novel operating strategies of a digital pump/motor in the context of both pumping and motoring. Unit displacement can be continuously varied by switching valves during the piston stroke. Alternatively, digital operation can be implemented by enabling or disabling individual displacement chambers over a sequence of pumping or motoring events. These continuous and sequential methods can be implemented simultaneously. In pumping, the flow-diverting operating strategy controls effective displacement by delivering demanded fluid to the high pressure port. Remaining fluid is returned to the low pressure port. In the flow-limited operating strategy, effective displacement is controlled by the volume of fluid allowed to enter the displacement chamber. Operation in the flow-limited operating strategy leads to a unique condition called displacement chamber voiding where the geometric volume of the displacement chamber has grown beyond the volume of the fluid admitted into the chamber. Displacement chamber voiding was visually observed {{through the use of a}} clear hydraulic cylinder and high-speed camera. A single-piston and a three-piston digital pump/motor were fabricated to experimentally evaluate the operating characteristics of the digital pump/motor and to investigate tradeoffs in operating strategies and in the overall configuration. Algorithms were established for continuous and sequenced variation of displacement in flow-diverting and flow-limited operating strategies for both pumping and motoring. These algorithms were implemented through a model operating on a real-time controller with execution through a field programmable gate array. ^ Over the tested range of displacements, digitally sequenced implementation of the flow-limited operating strategy yielded the highest efficiency. Digitally sequenced operation in either operating strategy and in both pumping and motoring exhibited significantly less torque ripple. Furthermore, operation of the unit in pure digital sequenced displacement control is less challenging because valve transitions occur when piston velocity is lowest, resulting in lower error in actual displacement. With two <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> <b>valves</b> installed at each displacement chamber, electrical energy consumption to operate the on/off valves scales more closely with displacement in sequenced flow-limited operation because the frequency of valve transitions and valve on duration both decrease with displacement. ^ This research forms the basis for the development of a true four-quadrant digital pump/motor that is capable of self starting and is capable of maintaining high efficiency over a wide range in operating displacement, speed, and differential pressure, especially when compared to state-of-the-art units. Furthermore, this work is the first to present a set of data for a digital pump/motor operating in flow-diverting and flow-limited operating strategies as a pump and as a motor. ...|$|R
