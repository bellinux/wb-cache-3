6000|$|... "Not maliciously, or injuriously, or offensively. I {{will be very}} patient, {{and take}} little rebuffs without complaining. This is the worst stile of all. When Grace and I are here {{together}} we can never manage it without tearing ourselves all to pieces. It is much <b>nicer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> help me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{has been}} so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> here," [...] she said, [...] "but if you only knew how {{difficult}} it was to arrange, it, you'd understand why I hesitate to ask you to come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, this is SO <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> here. We'll {{have some}} good parties--dances and everything. You'll have to join the Jolly Seventeen. We play bridge {{and we have a}} supper once a month. You play, of course?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{think that}} Mr. Ralph Newton,--this Mr. Ralph Newton, {{is very good}} for you. Nothing could be so good. In the first place {{would it not be}} very <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> {{mistress}} of Newton Priory? Only that shouldn't come properly first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Annie, [...] "if {{you really}} think you can walk so far, it will be very <b>nice</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> go, but you ought to feel very sure that it will not hurt you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, if I DID {{take all}} your notions seriously, {{it would be}} pretty discouraging.

5000|$|The next year, in 1995, Smallie was {{followed}} by drummer Yonrico Scott, who initially filled the role of percussionist, as well as drummer, completing the band's first cohesive rhythm section. Scott began learning to play the drums when still a very young child. Originating in Michigan, with a Motown influence, {{he graduated from the}} University of Kentucky with a B.A. Degree in percussion performance. His songwriting collaborations with other band members appear from their first eponymous debut album in 1997, followed with Out of the Madness in 1999, and <b>have</b> continued <b>to</b> date. Scott <b>has</b> been playing with Trucks for over 17 years as of 2009. According to Trucks: [...] "We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> somebody that <b>you</b> don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look at...he's just right there with you." ...|$|R

5000|$|At several points, Sondheim has {{multiple}} performers each sing a different song simultaneously. This use of counterpoint maintains coherence {{even as it}} extends {{the notion of a}} round, familiar in songs such as the traditional [...] "Fr√®re Jacques", into something more complex. Sondheim said: [...] "As for the three songs... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the quodlibet method...wouldn't it be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> three songs <b>you</b> don't think are going to go together, and they do go together... The trick was the little vamp on [...] "Soon" [...] which has five-and six-note chords." [...] Steve Swayne comments that the [...] "contrapuntal episodes in the extended ensembles... stand as testament to his interest in Counterpoint." ...|$|R
6000|$|SUNDAY. - So. I {{have still}} rather bad eyes, and a nasty sore throat. I play Orsino every day, {{in all the}} pomp of Solomon, splendid Francis the First clothes, heavy with gold and stage jewellery. I play it ill enough, I believe; but me and the clothes, and the wedding {{wherewith}} the clothes and me are reconciled, produce every night a thrill of admiration. Our cook told my mother (there is a servants' night, you know) that she and the housemaid were 'just prood {{to be able to}} say it was oor young gentleman.' To sup afterwards with these clothes on, and a wonderful lot of gaiety and Shakespearean jokes about the table, is something to live for. It is so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been dead three hundred years, and the sound of your laughter is faint and far off in the centuries. - Ever your faithful ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the barrier}} a woman trying {{in vain to}} be let on to the station. But what a Roman matron can't do, an elegant young Englishman can. So our two heroes wangle their way in, and fall {{into the arms of}} the q-b by the Naples train. Well, now, tell us all about it! So we rush into a four-branched {{candlestick}} of conversation. In my ear murmurs he of the monocle about the Sahara--he is back from the Sahara a week ago: the winter sun in the Sahara! He with the smears of paint on his elegant trousers is giving the q-b a sketchy outline of his now grande passion. Click goes the exchange, and him of the monocle is detailing to the q-b his trip to Japan, on which he will start in six weeks' time, while him of the paint-smears is expatiating on the thrills of the etching needle, and concocting a plan for a month in Sardinia in May, with me doing the scribbles and he the pictures. What sort of pictures? Out flies the name of Goya.--And well now, a general rush into oneness, and won't they come down to Sicily to us for the almond blossom: in about ten days' time. Yes they will--wire when the almond blossom is just stepping on the stage and making its grand bow, and they will come next day. Somebody has smitten the wheel of a coach two ringing smacks with a hammer. This is a sign to get in. The q-b is terrified the train will slip through her fingers. [...] "I'm frightened, I must get in."--"Very well then! You're sure <b>you</b> <b>have</b> everything <b>you</b> want? Everything? A fiasco of vino? Oh two! All the better! Well then--ten days' time. All right--quite sure--how <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen <b>you,</b> if only a glimpse.--Yes, yes, poor q-b! Yes, you're quite safe. Good-bye! Good-bye!" ...|$|R

Oh!' with a start, 'there's the first bell, and here have I been dawdling here instead of minding my business! But it is so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you!</b> I day, Jenny, we will have one of our good old games at threadpaper verses {{and all the rest}} tonight.

6000|$|At {{the time}} fixed the Marchesa's {{carriage}} came, and Ayala with her boxes {{was taken away}} to Brook Street. Uncle Reginald had offered {{to do something for}} her in the way of buying a frock, but this she refused, declaring that she would not allow herself to become an expense merely because her friends in Rome had been kind to her. So she had packed up the best of what she had and started, with her heart in her mouth, fearing the grandeur of the Marchesa's house. On her arrival she was received by Nina, who at once threw herself into all her old intimacy. [...] "Oh, Ayala," [...] she said, [...] "this is so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> again. I have been looking forward to this ever since we left Rome." ...|$|E
6000|$|The letter {{seemed to}} Emily {{herself to be}} very cold, and had not her husband rejoiced over it so warmly she would have {{considered}} it to be unsatisfactory. No doubt the ¬£3000 would be given; but that, {{as far as she}} could understand her father's words, was to be the whole of her fortune. She had never known anything of her father's affairs or of his intentions, but she had certainly supposed that her fortune would be very much more than this. She had learned in some indirect way that a large sum of money would have gone with her hand to Arthur Fletcher, could she have brought herself to marry that suitor favoured by her family. And now, having learned, as she had learned, that money was of vital importance to her husband, she was dismayed at what seemed to her to be parental parsimony. But he was overjoyed,--so much so that for a while he lost that restraint over himself which was habitual to him. He ate his breakfast in a state of exultation, and talked,--not alluding specially to this ¬£3000,--as though he had the command of almost unlimited means. He ordered a carriage and drove her out, and bought presents for her,--things as to which they had both before decided that they should not be bought because of the expense. [...] "Pray don't spend your money for me," [...] she said to him. [...] "It is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> giving me things, but it would be nicer to me even than that to think that I could save you expense." ...|$|E
