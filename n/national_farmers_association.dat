2500|$|In 1964, Lemass {{appointed}} Haughey as Minister for Agriculture. Criticism was voiced {{from the}} <b>National</b> <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> (NFA) of {{the appointment of}} a non-rural person to the position, and there was increased antagonism from farmers towards the government. Haughey became embroiled in a series of controversies with the NFA and with another organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA). Twenty-seven ICMSA picketers outside Leinster House (the parliament building) were arrested on 27 April 1966 under the Offences Against the State Act, an act originally intended for use against the IRA. 78 were arrested the following day, and 80 a day later as the dispute escalated. The general public was supportive of the farmers, who were {{not in a position to}} hold a strike to air their grievances, and who were clearly only posing a problem to the minister, rather than the state. The farmers then began a national solidarity campaign, and even farmers who supported Fianna Fáil turned against the government. Haughey, who did not rely on rural voters, was under intense pressure from fearful members of his own party to negotiate a deal and reduce the tension. Eventually Haughey backed down from the confrontation, for electoral reasons connected to the imminent presidential election. It was Haughey's first alienation of a significant voting block, and probably damaged him electorally in later years as many farmers remembered the events, known in folk memory as the [...] "Farmers' Strike".|$|E

40|$|The purpose ofthis {{thesis is}} to examine the ways in which women's {{voluntary}} organisations enabled Irish women to engage in various forms of social, political and religious-based activism during the middle-decades of the twentieth-century. This thesis contends that, like the earlier generation of activists who fought for suffrage in Ireland, middle-class, often urban, women continued to carve out a niche for themselves in the public sphere through their membership in 'non-political' voluntary associations which aimed to improve their own lives as well as the lives of others, mainly women and children. Voluntary associations drew women together by encouraging them to engage {{in a wide range of}} social activism: they brought them into contact with international organisations; encouraged a sense of collective identity; provided relief to the poor and supported the missions of their churches. Membership in voluntary organisations also allowed women to build social capital, engage in interest group politics and effect change in Ireland. ', The identification ofwomen with interest group politics is not often associated with the middle-decades of the twentieth century. In a series of articles and other publications on the origins of interest group politics in Ireland, Gary Murphy asserts that the birth of interest group politics in Ireland began in the mid- 1950 s with the rise of the <b>National</b> <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> and the subsequent move toward EEC membership in the early 1960 s. This thesis demonstrates that through participation in voluntary organisations-such as the Catholic Women's Federation of Secondary School Unions, the Irish Housewives Association, the Legion of Mary and the Women's Missionary Association of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland- women increasingly adopted the role of political and social actors, engaging in, albeit not always successfully, interest group politics.

40|$|Cue: Like anyone {{working in}} the {{competitive}} world of business, farmers need up-to-date information in order to maximise their productivity and their profits. If growing cash crops, {{they need to know}} which type of crops they can expect to earn a good price for, and where the best markets are. They also need to be kept up-to-date with changes in agricultural policy which may open new opportunities to them, or introduce new regulations and restrictions. But whose job is it to get that information to the farmer? In Malawi, the task has been enthusiastically taken on by NASFAM, the <b>National</b> Smallholder <b>Farmers?</b> <b>Association</b> of Malawi. The organisation has two component parts, a marketing wing that helps farmers to sell their produce, and a development wing, that handles, among other things, communication.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between food security and commercialisation using data from a household survey in <b>National</b> Smallholder <b>Farmer</b> <b>Association</b> of Malawi (NASFAM) operated areas. NASFAM promotes commercialisation of agriculture by introducing the principle of farming as a business among its members who are largely smallholder subsistence farmers. The study finds that households with plenty of family labour are therefore likely to participate in NASFAM commercialisation initiatives. We also find {{a positive relationship between}} participation and value of durable assets, suggesting that wealth is an important determinant in the decision to participate in commercialisation. Household food security also increases the probability of participation, suggesting that when food markets are unstable, farmers that are not food secure may be constrained in their attempt to commercialize their farming systems. Furthermore, we find that the degree of commercialisation is negatively associated with age and household size but positively associated with food security, access to fertilizers, NASFAM business orientation and market access benefits.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of individual farmers participation in the <b>National</b> Smallholder <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> of Malawi (NASFAM). Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM {{is a form of}} producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access. © 2013 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Fair {{trade is}} a means of {{governing}} South-North supply chains to increase the benefits of international trade integration for poor southern producers of agricultural and handicraft goods. Although the approach itself is arguably innovative in comparison with commercially orientated supply chains, many consider that its formalisation within third-party, Fairtrade International certification, has facilitated a process of conventionalisation. Furthermore, Fairtrade certification is considered to dominate producer and consumer attention; and therefore marginalise other more innovative and radical fair trade approaches, making differentiation increasingly difficult. The chapter investigates one aspect of this narrative by elucidating the effects of the Fairtrade Towns scheme: a promotional program viewed to be precipitating ‘Fairtrade absolutism’ within the wider movement. Focusing on the devolved region of Scotland, evidence for this process is uncovered and the implications for Southern producers highlighted through a parallel case study of the <b>National</b> Smallholder <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> in Malawi. Here it is found that the costs of certification and their geographic restriction are actively isolating some producers; which combined with ‘Fairtrade absolutism’ in consumer countries undermines the principle of fairer access to northern export markets. The final section however, connects the producer and consumer cases, by reporting on an innovative fairly traded supply chain constructed between Malawian rice farmers and Scottish schools. Overall, the chapter highlights the continued potential for innovation within the fair trade movement, and suggests that such opportunities will emerge where supply chain actors are more proactively embedded in wider understandings of development and trade justice...|$|R
