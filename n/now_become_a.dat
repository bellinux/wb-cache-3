5|$|MalcolmX had by <b>now</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> media favorite, {{and some}} Nation members {{believed}} he {{was a threat to}} Muhammad's leadership.

He also reproduced five of his speeches, but featured only one of Muhammad'sall of which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.|$|E

5|$|A {{junior and}} infant {{department}} opened in September 1997 after {{the closure of}} St Audrey's Convent school.

The junior and infant school has <b>now</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> preparatory school for the senior school. It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005, {{a reference to a}} 17th-century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School pupils to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge.

5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have <b>now</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
