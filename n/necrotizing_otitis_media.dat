40|$|Introduction. <b>Necrotizing</b> <b>otitis</b> externa {{is a rare}} but conditionally fatal {{infection}} of external auditory canal with extension to deep soft tissue and bones, resulting in necrosis and osteomyelitis {{of the temporal bone}} and scull base. This condition is also known as malignant otitis due to an aggressive behavior and poor treatment response. Early diagnosis of malignant otitis is a difficult challenge. We present an illustrative case of <b>necrotizing</b> <b>otitis</b> externa and suggest some strategies to avoid diagnostic and treatment pitfalls. Case Outline. A 70 -year-old patient presented with signs of malignant otitis externa, complicated by peripheral facial palsy. Adequate diagnostic and treatment procedures were performed with clinical signs of resolution. The recurrence of malignant infection had presented three months after previous infection with multiple cranial nerve neuropathies and signs of jugular vein and lateral sinus thrombosis. An aggressive antibiotic treatment and surgery were carried out, followed by substantial recovery of the patient and complete restoration of cranial nerves’ functions. Conclusion. <b>Necrotizing</b> <b>otitis</b> externa is a serious condition with uncertain prognosis. The suspicion of malignant external otitis should be raised in cases of resistance to topical treatment, especially in patient with predisposing factors. Evidence-based guideline for <b>necrotizing</b> <b>otitis</b> externa still doesn’t exist and treatment protocol should be adjusted to individual presentation of each patient...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reported trends {{regarding}} {{the incidence of}} <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and antibiotic prescription rates are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess changes in incidence of consultation rates, antibiotic prescription, and referral rates for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in children over the years 1995 - 2003. METHODS: A cohort study including all children aged 0 to 13 years within the research database of the Netherlands University Medical Center Utrecht Primary Care Network covering the period 1995 - 2003. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> diagnoses were recorded according to the International Classification of Primary Care codes and antibiotic prescription according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> incidence rates were calculated as episodes per 1000 person-years. Antibiotic prescription and referral rates were calculated per 100 <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> episodes. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2003, the overall general practitioner consultation rates for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion declined by 9 % and 34 %, respectively. In children aged 2 to 6 years and those aged 6 to 13 years, the incidence rates of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion declined by 15 % and 41 % and 40 % and 48 %, respectively. In children < 2 years of age, the incidence rates of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 46 % and 66 %, respectively. Antibiotic prescription rates for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 45 % and 25 %, respectively. The referral rate for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> did not change, whereas the referral rate for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 45 %.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> is {{a complex}} and multifactorial {{condition}} with four defined stages: myringitis, acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> secretory (serous) <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants, mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. The rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation {{has been associated with}} the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> In acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> the major organisms, present are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> these organisms, plus Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. The microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> is almost identical with that in acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Empirical therapy can be given in most instances of acute and serous <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> However, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromized and in instances of chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. The growing resistance of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> By adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. Management of chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. where present...|$|R

A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions: Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes.

Objective: The present study aimed to identify the risk factors responsible for the onset and progression of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and its subtypes {{as well as its}} associated co-morbidities in the South Indian population. Subjects and methods: The study constituted 2602 subjects including children and adults affected with OM and the diagnosis was confirmed by ENT specialists using all the required otorhinolaryngological tests. The study was carried out by the institutional ethical clearance. The data were coded and evaluations were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, PASW STATISTICS 18. 0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results: squamous-chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> was highly prevalent (47. 3 %) followed by mucosal-chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (18. 5 %), acute suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (17. 6 %), and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion (16. 6 %). The multinomial logistic regression analysis showed significant association of tinnitus with squamous-chronic suppurative otitis media; bilaterality, tinnitus and vertigo with mucosal-chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> while bilaterality, adenoids, tinnitus and snoring with <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion. Significant differences were observed in different forms of hearing loss at higher frequency within the subtypes of <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Conclusions: The study has revealed that <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> predominantly affects all age groups and has a serious health concern in cases affected with hearing loss and its associated co-morbidities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> is endemic in many remote Indigenous Australian {{communities}}. Children {{in remote}} communities develop <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{in the first}} weeks of life and are at high-risk of progression to chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (CSOM). Current therapeutic and preventive interventions are of limited benefit. This thesis presents a culture-independent analysis of the bacteriology associated with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in Indigenous children from the Northern Territory. The objective {{of the study was}} to use culture-independent methods to better understand the bacteriology underlying acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in this population. Principle findings from the study are as follows: 1. Nasopharyngeal total or pathogenic bacterial loads are unsuitable as prognostic indicators of clinical antibiotic treatment outcomes in Indigenous children with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> 2. Alloiococcus otitidis is present in ear discharge from Indigenous children with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> potentially as a secondary middle ear pathogen. Further studies to test for A. otitidis in CSOM are warranted. 3. T-RFLP can provide broad characterisation of bacterial communities in upper respiratory specimens; however, it is limited by methodological biases which result in underestimation of bacterial richness. 4. Despite the methodological limitations, T-RFLP analysis demonstrated significant differences between nasopharyngeal and ear discharge bacterial communities in Indigenous children with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with perforation, suggesting divergence of the middle ear microbiome following secondary infection by canal flora. 5. 16 S rRNA gene microarray (PhyloChipTM) analysis of ear discharge from Indigenous children with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with perforation indicates a high-level of bacterial richness which is hypothesised to contribute to progression to CSOM. Prospective longitudinal studies are now required to better understand the canal flora before perforation, the microbiology of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> immediately following perforation, and microbiomic changes associated with prolonged perforation. Such studies will aid understanding of the pathogenesis of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with perforation and progression to CSOM, and potentially reveal new therapeutic targets or prevention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (AOM) is {{a common}} {{complication}} of upper respiratory tract infection whose pathogenesis involves both viruses and bacteria. We examined risks of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> associated with specific combinations of respiratory viruses and acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> bacterial pathogens. Data were from a prospective study of children ages 6 to 36 months and included viral and bacterial culture and quantitative PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus. Repeated-measure logistic regression {{was used to assess}} the relationship between specific viruses, bacteria, and the risk of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> complicating upper respiratory tract infection. In unadjusted analyses of data from 194 children, adenovirus, bocavirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were significantly associated with AOM (P < 0. 05 by χ 2 test). Children with high respiratory syncytial virus loads (≥ 3. 16 × 107 copies/ml) experienced increased acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> risk. Higher viral loads of bocavirus and metapneumovirus were not significantly associated with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> In adjusted models controlling for the presence of key viruses, bacteria, and acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> risk factors, acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> risk was independently associated with high RSV viral load with Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio [OR], 4. 40; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 90 and 10. 19) and Haemophilus influenzae (OR, 2. 04; 95 % CI, 1. 38 and 3. 02). The risk was higher for the presence of bocavirus and H. influenzae together (OR, 3. 61; 95 % CI, 1. 90 and 6. 86). Acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> risk differs by the specific viruses and bacteria involved. Acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> prevention efforts should consider methods for reducing infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus, bocavirus, and adenovirus in addition to acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> bacterial pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Following a study {{reporting}} a fourfold {{increase in the}} occurrence of chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, this prospective study examines this association with respect to severity, duration of disease, and acute phase in ankylosing spondylitis. Forty two consecutive patients with classical ankylosing spondylitis seen at the rheumatology clinic of a teaching hospital where the features of ankylosing spondylitis were recorded had an otological examination by an otolaryngologist. The occurrence of chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (all categories) was 12 / 42 (29 %). The acute phase serum markers (C reactive protein and IgG) were increased in patients with active or inactive chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Extra-articular manifestations were significantly {{more common in the}} chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> group than in those with no history of chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> The {{results of this study suggest}} that chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> may be another extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis. Alternative explanations, however, include similar aetiological factors for the two conditions or a previously unrecognised increased occurrence of HLA-B 27 in patients with chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether recurrent purulent <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> results in permanent hearing loss, we studied 2 subgroups {{of children from}} a cohort, earlier prospectively followed from birth {{to the age of}} 3 years. One subgroup had recurrent acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (n = 12). and the other had no acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> at all ("healthy" children; n = 21). At follow-up of these subgroups at the age of 10. no child had acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> or secretory <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> There was no difference between the groups in hearing level thresholds at the frequencies 125 Hz to 8 kHz. However, in the children with recurrent acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> as compared with the controls, the hearing levels at high frequencies (8 to 16 kHz) and the acoustic middle ear reflex thresholds were elevated, the middle ear compliance was higher, and click-evoked otoacoustic emission response levels and middle ear pressures were lower. The results suggest that the middle car mechanics of children with recurrent acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> are affected, and also that their cochlear function might be disturbed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAcute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} diagnosis in children visiting physicians' offices. Risk factors for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> have been widely studied. Yet, the correlation between bacterial carriage {{and the development of}} <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> is not entirely clear. Our aim was to study in a population-based prospective cohort the risk factors for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in the second year of life with special emphasis on the role of colonization with, and. The study was embedded in the Generation R Study. Data on risk factors and doctor-diagnosed <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> were obtained by midwives, hospital registries and postal questionnaires in the whole cohort ( =  7, 295). Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained at the age of 1. 5, 6 and 14  months in the focus cohort ( =  1, 079). Of these children, 2, 515 (47. 2 %) suffered at least one period of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in their second year of life. The occurrence of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> during the follow-up period in the first 6  months of life and between 6 and 12  months of age was associated with the risk of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in the second year of life (aOR, 1. 83 95 % CI 1. 24 - 2. 71 and aOR 2. 72, 95 % CI 2. 18 - 3. 38, respectively). Having siblings was associated with an increased risk for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in the second year of life (aOR 1. 42, 95 % CI 1. 13 - 1. 79). No associations were found between bacterial carriage {{in the first year of}} life and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in the second year of life. In our study, <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in the first year of life is an independent risk factor for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in the second year of life. Surprisingly, bacterial carriage in the first year of life did not add to this risk. Moreover, no association was observed between bacterial carriage in the first year of life and otitis in the second year of life...|$|R
