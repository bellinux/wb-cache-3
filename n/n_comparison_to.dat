40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks, {{the identity}} of a particular sensor node and a complete reconstruction of sensed data at a designated sink node may be not needed. Indeed, the objective is often to compute a certain function of the sensed data. Such desired functions can be for example the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, polynomials and other functions that adequately match the mathematical characteristic of the underlying multiple-access channel. In this paper, we propose a simple practical approach to compute desired functions of sensor network data, exploiting explicitly the mathematical characteristic of the wireless sensor multiple-access channel (WSMAC). In contrast to traditional schemes that are designed to combat interference caused by other connections, we exploit this interference with the goal of computing the desired functions, which is in a sense a paradigm shift.

40|$|Results {{obtained}} from measurements and spectroscopic analysis of current transients induced in almost ideal silicon n(+) - p junctions by infra-red stimulation n illuminating a reverse biased junction {{by means of}} an infra-red emitting diode for a few seconds, a current transient is generated which, at 0 degrees C, lasts several hours. This can be decomposed, by means of a proper spectroscopic method, into a sum of four exponential contributions with time constants ranging from tens up to thousands of seconds. Similar dark current transients were already obtained for the same junctions when they were stimulated by a change of the reverse bias voltage, without any optical excitation. The spectroscopy of both optical and voltage induced current transients gives four exponential components with the same time constants. Both the dark current and the photocurrent transients are ascribed to the same SiyOx clusters containing hundreds of Si atoms and four types of single energy level defect centers with different localization. While the voltage induced current transients implicate the activation of such defect centers in the p-region near the n(+) - p interface only, those due to the photostimulation produce their activation throughout the whole n(+) region as well.

The Slovenian branch of this study included 1, 962 patients visiting family practices. Patients were classified into two groups regarding the registered status of their family physician. They completed the questionnaires immediately after visiting their family physicians. Data used in the analyses included 76 variables: 18 socio- economic and 58 variables linked to the patient's experience.   Results: The analyses showed few differences between concessionaires and state-employed family physicians. I <b>n</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> patients of state-employed family physicians, patients of concessionaires were less likely to make an appointment for a visit (19. 8 % vs. 29. 2 %), were generally more frequent visitors (43. 7 % vs. 50. 7 %), and more often felt that opening hours are too restricted (25. 7 % vs. 31. 9 %). Patients of concessionaires believed more often that in general, doctors can be trusted (40. 1 % vs. 47. 1 %). A smaller percentage of patients of concessionaires felt that their physician had the capacity to deal with personal problems as well as provide medical care (61. 9 % vs. 54. 7 %).   Conclusions: There are few differences in patients’ experiences of state -employed family physicians and concessionaires.

Using analyses {{of rocks and}} minerals in conjunction with N-Ar geochemistry demonstrates that the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) contains ∼ 7 ± 4 times present atmospheric N (4 × 10 ^ 18 kg N, PAN), with 27 ± 16 × 10 ^ 18 kg <b>N.</b> <b>Comparison</b> <b>to</b> chondritic composition, after subtracting N sequestered into the core, yields a consistent result, with BSE N between 17 ± 13 × 10 ^ 18 kg to 31 ± 24 × 10 ^ 18 kg N. In the chondritic comparison we calculate a N mass in Earth's core (180 ± 110 to 300 ± 180 × 10 ^ 18 kg) and discuss the Moon {{as a proxy for}} the early mantle. Significantly, we find the majority of the planetary budget of N is in the solid Earth. The N estimate herein precludes the need for a "missing N" reservoir. Nitrogen-Ar systematics in mantle rocks and basalts identify two mantle reservoirs: MORB-source like (MSL) and high-N. High-N mantle is composed of young, N-rich material subducted from the surface and is identified in OIB and some xenoliths. In contrast, MSL appears to be made of old material, though a component of subducted material is evident in this reservoir as well. Using our new budget, we calculate a δ 15 N value for BSE plus atmosphere of ∼ 2. This value should be used when discussing bulk Earth N isotope evolution. Additionally, our work indicates that all surface N could pass through the mantle over Earth history, and the mantle may act as a long-term sink for N. Since N acts as a tracer of exchange between the atmosphere, oceans, and mantle over time, clarifying its distribution in the Earth is critical for evolutionary models concerned with Earth system evolution. We suggest that N be viewed in the same vein as carbon: it has a fast, biologically mediated cycle which connects it to a slow, tectonically-controlled geologic cycle.

Donald Knuth, a world famous computer scientist and author of the book “The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3 : Sorting and Searching ” ([6]), wrote: “I believe that virtually every important aspect of programming arises somewhere in the context of searching or sorting”. Quicksort is a comparison sorting algorithm that, on average, makes O(n log <b>n)</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>to</b> sort <b>n</b> items.

Quicksort is often faster in practice than other O(n log n) sorting algorithms and it has another advantage- it sorts in place, that is, the items are rearranged within the array, so it does not require a lot of additional space ([1]). Quicksort was invented by a British computer scientist, C. A. R. Hoare, in 1960. Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare describes how he invented Quicksort in his interview published in [10]. After graduating from the University of Oxford in 1956, Hoare did his national service in the Royal Navy studying Russian.

40|$|A new motion {{estimation}} scheme, Discrete-Cosine/Sine-Transform Based Motion Estimation (DXT-ME) utilizing {{the principle of}} orthogonality of cosine and sine functions to estimate, in the transform domain, displacements from the motion information contained in the pseudo-phases of the images of moving objects, is proposed. The computational complexity of this method is only O(N 2) + Odct for an image of size N x <b>N</b> in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> O(N 4), the complexity of full search block matching approach, where Odct is the complexity of DCT/DST coding. Furthermore, incorporation of DXT-ME with DCT-based video standards achieves further savings of computations and makes symmetric codecs feasible. Unlike pel-recursive algorithm, this scheme is not susceptible to noise. For complicated scenery or large moving objects, simple preprocessing is performed on images to extract the features of moving objects before applying DXT-ME. Simulation on some video sequences is presented to compare this scheme with the block matching method. 1...|$|R
30|$|Internal leaf {{colonization}} by diazotrophs, as {{estimated by}} the most-probable number (MPN) technique, was significantly superior in plants from treatments 6, 7, 10, and 11, when compared to plants from the non-inoculated controls (T 1 and T 2) (Table  4). Higher internal leaf populations of diazotrophic bacteria were observed in plants from treatments in which one dose of inoculant was applied by leaf spraying at the V 2.5 stage (T 11 and T 12), but also with 2.5 doses of inoculation in-furrow with 100  % of N (T 10). Significantly increased internal root colonization by diazotrophic bacteria was observed in plants from T 9, where 2.5 doses of inoculant were applied in-furrow with 75  % of <b>N,</b> in <b>comparison</b> <b>to</b> plants from the non-inoculated controls (T 1 and T 2). When rhizospheric soil was analyzed, the largest bacterial populations were observed in association with T 8, which received a single dose of inoculant in-furrow and 100  % N (Table  4).|$|R
