40|$|The maximal superintegrability of the {{intrinsic}} harmonic oscillator potential on <b>N-dimensional</b> <b>spaces</b> with constant curvature is revisited {{from the point}} of view of sl(2) -Poisson coalgebra symmetry. It is shown how this algebraic approach leads to a straightforward definition of a new large family of quasi-maximally superintegrable perturbations of {{the intrinsic}} oscilla-tor on such spaces. Moreover, the generalization of this construction to those <b>N-dimensional</b> <b>spaces</b> with non-constant curvature that are endowed with sl(2) -coalgebra symmetry is pre-sented. As the first examples of the latter class of systems, both the oscillator potential on an <b>N-dimensional</b> Darboux <b>space</b> as well as several families of its quasi-maximally superinte-grable anharmonic perturbations are explicitly constructed. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{three-dimensional}} space, a {{first degree}} equation in the variables x, y, and z defines a plane, so two such equations, provided the planes they {{give rise to}} are not parallel, define a line which is {{the intersection of the}} planes.

The space Z2n – 1 is therefore isomorphic to the projectivized cotangent bundle of the n-sphere.
