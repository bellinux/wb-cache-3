Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand {{that we could do}} better with what we had.|$|E
5|$|In the Railway Plan of 1923, Parliament {{decided to}} extend the Nordland Line from Fauske to Vadsø with a branch to Kirkenes. During the Second World War, the Wehrmacht revitalized the {{plans to build a}} railway to Kirkenes. <b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> {{unfinished}} Polar Line was built and there was never any railways built north of Narvik and the Ofoten Line. However, detailed plans were made for the line, including surveying geological conditions and choice of the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} workhouse labour was never clear {{according}} to historian M. A. Crowther. In {{the early days}} of workhouses it was either a punishment or a source of income for the parish, but during the 19thcentury the idea of work as punishment became increasingly unfashionable. The idea took hold that work should rehabilitate the workhouse inmates for their eventual independence, and that it should therefore be rewarded with <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> workers' maintenance, otherwise there would be no incentive for them to seek work elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need}} to prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{started the}} 1964–65 season on wages of £40 a week, {{and the club}} only agreed to pay £60 a week in December. These miserly wages made it {{difficult}} for the club to spend the £80,000 it received from the sale of Frank McLintock – he had put in a transfer request over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> base rate that rival clubs paid to average players. Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the sixth round. In the League Cup, City struggled to get past Peterborough United (in a replay), Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace (in a replay), before they recorded an 8–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road. After easing past Plymouth Argyle in the semi-finals, Banks found himself playing in another League Cup final. However Chelsea won the final after successfully defending their 3–2 win at Stamford Bridge with a goalless draw at Filbert Street.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Federal Election Commission {{ruled that}} Jackson could hire {{his wife on}} his {{campaign}} payroll {{as long as she}} was paid <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> fair market value for her services. In 2002, Jackson was challenged in the Democratic primary by three candidates. Jackson claimed that state Sen. William Shaw and his brother, Cook County Board of Review Commissioner Robert Shaw, had planted a bogus candidate in the primary race. The claim was that they selected 68-year-old retired Robbins truck driver, Jesse L. Jackson, as an opponent in order to confuse voters and derail the congressman's re-election campaign. Jackson asked a Cook County court to question the Shaws and others under oath, but his effort was rejected and no criminal wrongdoing was found. As Jackson prepared to take further legal action, Jesse L. Jackson withdrew his candidacy after the unexpected deaths of his wife and grandson.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, {{as part of}} {{the larger}} Civil Rights Movement, {{interest}} emerged in giving DC full representation. As a compromise, the Twenty-third Amendment was adopted in 1961, granting the District a number of votes in the Electoral College in measure to their population, but <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> smallest state. This right has been exercised by DC residents since the presidential election of 1964.|$|E

For seven years, William Annand and Joseph Howe led the ultimately unsuccessful fight to convince British imperial authorities to release Nova Scotia from Confederation. The government was vocally against Confederation, contending that it was <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> annexation of the province to the pre-existing province of Canada.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, the Circe {{episode was}} to be re-evaluated in two poetic sequels to the Odyssey. In the first of these, Giovanni Pascoli's L'Ultimo Viaggio (The Last Voyage, 1906), the aging hero sets out to rediscover the {{emotions}} of his youth by retracing his journey from Troy, {{only to discover that}} the island of Eea is deserted. What in his dream of love he had taken for the roaring of lions and Circe’s song was now <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> sound of the sea-wind in autumnal oaks (Cantos 16-17).|$|E
25|$|In 1996–1997, {{he served}} on the California Senate's Task Force on Electronic Access to Public Records, that {{produced}} recommendations regarding how to make computerized state and local public government records {{available to the public}} in electronic form. Warren was one of the minority who advocated online access without agency fees, and charging <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> direct incremental cost of copying, when copies were requested in physical form. The majority of Task Force members were from city and county agencies, almost entirely advocating making the records available in electronic form, but only for fees far in excess of direct copying costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of the mind is {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.|$|E
