40|$|Installation of {{molybdenum}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) -to-higher {{oxides of nitrogen}} (<b>NOx)</b> <b>converter</b> in chemiluminescent gas analyzer and use of air purge allow accurate measurements of NOx in exhaust gases containing as much as thirty percent carbon monoxide (CO). Measurements using conventional analyzer are highly inaccurate for NOx if as little as five percent CO is present. In modified analyzer, molybdenum has high tolerance to CO, and air purge substantially quenches NOx destruction. In test, modified chemiluminescent analyzer accurately measured NO and NOx concentrations for over 4 months with no denegration in performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- We {{know that}} {{catalytic}} converter is converting harmful gases to harmless gases. Due {{to the engine}} combus-tion process the catalyst encourages two chemical to reach {{with each other and}} for example, Hydrocarbon (HC) and Carbon monoxide (CO) and Carbon di-Oxide (CO) and the catalyst in the <b>NOx</b> <b>converter</b> splits the Nitrogen from the Oxygen. OBD-II, systems were designed to maintain low emissions of in use vehicles, including light and medium duty vehicles. In 1989, the California code of Regulations (CCR) known as OBD – II was adopted by the California Air Resource Board (CARB) and the objective to reduce hydrocarbon (HC) emission caused by malfunction of the vehicles emission control sys-tems. As per Environment Protection Agency, (EPA) USA, and CARB standards the failure criteria for the catalyst monitor diagnos-tic are the following...|$|E
40|$|Two {{factors that}} may affect the {{quantification}} of NO and NO 2 concentrations when using chemiluminescent analysis are investigated. The first is the dependence of the chemiluminescent intensity on competing third body quenching reactions. Relative quenching efficiencies are determined {{as a function of}} third body concentration for six different species that are common products of combustion. A mathematical expression is derived that allows calculation of the actual concentration of NO, given the indicated concentration of NO and the concentrations of the important third bodies. An example calculation is presented. The second factor investigated involves the conversion to NO of low molecular weight nitrogen-containing species, other than NO 2, in commercial <b>NOx</b> <b>converters.</b> Conversion efficiencies for six species are determined using a commercial stainless steel catalyst at 920 K...|$|R
40|$|An {{instrument}} modification for chemiluminescent NO - NOx analyzers {{was developed}} which minimizes the NOx destruction in the <b>NOx</b> to NO <b>converters</b> of NO analyzers {{due to high}} concentrations of CO. This mechanism causes the NO analyzers to indicate incorrect NOx concentrations when the analyzers are operated in the NOx analysis mode. The modification is applicable to analyzers in which the detection chamber is evacuated...|$|R

The well-known positive interferences in the NO 2 channel of the molybdenum <b>converter</b> <b>NOx</b> instruments by reactive nitrogen species (NOy) was recently demonstrated to play {{only a minor}} role at kerbside stations caused by the proximity to the major NOx source by vehicle emissions[21].|$|R
40|$|Current {{society has}} become more {{concerned}} about being environmentally friendly. Catalytic gas after treatment {{is one of the}} solutions adopted to reduce pollutant emissions from a combustion engine. A Three Way <b>NOx</b> Storage Catalytic <b>Converter</b> (TWNSC) is a new development of Daimler AG together with Umicore AG [1]. It consists of a Catalyst with some of the main properties of a Three Way Catalyst (TWC) together with NOx storage capacity (lean-NOx trap). This catalyst is used in Otto direct-injection engines with lean/rich operation mode. This technology can reduce fuel consumption in a range of 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} {{catalytic reduction}} (SCR) of The {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) of NO by oxygenated hydrocarbons over Ag/Al 2 O 3 is a promising candidate for NOx by oxygenated hydrocarbons over Ag/Al 2 O 3 is a promising candidate for NOx removal from diesel engine exhausts. Ag/Al 2 O 3 -ethanol as a catalyst-reductant system with high performance for NOx reduction was set up based on the characterization of basic properties of Ag/Al 2 O 3, optimization of reductants, improvement of low-temperature activity, and tuning of SO 2 tolerance. Furthermore, a mechanism of NOx reduction was proposed, which can explain the high efficiency of the Ag/Al 2 O 3 -ethanol system for NOx reduction. The Ag/Al 2 O 3 washcoated honeycomb catalyst and catalytic converter were designed and prepared. Diesel engine bench tests showed that the Ag/Al 2 O 3 -ethanol <b>NOx</b> catalytic <b>converter</b> can satisfy the NOx emission requirements of the China IV standard for heavy duty diesel when combined with the adjustment of diesel engines...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} of high-temperature off-gas of steelmaking converter with periodical {{change of}} temperature and CO concentration always leads to CO and NOx over-standard emissions. In the paper, high-temperature off-gas combustion is simulated by adopting counterflow diffusion flame model, and some influencing factors of CO and NOx emissions are investigated by adopting a detailed chemistry GRI 3. 0 mechanism. The emission index of NOx (EINOx) decreases 1. 7 - 4. 6 % when air stoichiometric ratio (SR) increase from 0. 6 to 1. 4, and it dramatically increases with off-gas temperature {{at a given}} SR when the off-gas temperature is above 1500 Â K. High-concentration CO in off-gas can result in high NOx emissions, and NOx levels increase dramatically with CO concentration when off-gas temperature is above 1700 Â K. Both SR and off-gas temperature are important for the increase of CO burnout index (BICO) when SR is less than 1. 0, but BICO increase about 1 % when off-gas temperature increases from 1100 Â K to 1900 Â K at SRÂ >Â  1. 0. BICO increases with CO concentration in off-gas, {{and the influence of}} off-gas temperature on BICO is marginal. BICO increases with the relative humidity (RH) in air supplied, but it increases about 0. 5 % when RH is larger than 30 %.
