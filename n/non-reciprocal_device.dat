The resonant poles of each SE circulator are modulated in time with 120 deg phase-shifted periodic signals, resulting in synthetic angular-momentum biasing achieved through spatio-temporal modulation (STM). We tailor the two SE circulators to exhibit a constant 180 deg phase difference between their STM biases. Unlike conventional differential time-variant circuits, for which only the even or odd spurs are rejected, we show that the proposed configuration cancels out all intermodulation (IM) products, thus making them operate alike linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits for an external observer. In turn, this property enhances all metrics of the resulting circulator, overcoming the limitations of SE architectures, and improving insertion loss, impedance matching, bandwidth and noise figure. We show that this differential architecture also significantly relaxes the required modulation parameters, both in frequency and amplitude.

Next, greater detail will be provided on the need for monolithically integrated isolators.

Optomechanical systems have emerged as a potential platform for optical non-reciprocity, due to ability of a pump laser to break time and parity symmetry in the system. Here we consider how the non-reciprocal behavior of light can also impact the transport of sound in optomechanical devices. We focus {{on the case of}} a quasi one dimensional optical ring resonator with many mechanical modes coupled to light via the acousto-optic effect. The addition of disorder leads to finite diffusion for phonon transport in the material, largely due to elastic backscattering between clockwise and counter-clockwise phonons. We show that a laser pump field, along with the assumption of high quality-factor, sideband-resolved optical resonances, suppresses the effects of disorder and leads to the emergence of chiral diffusion, with direction-dependent diffusion emerging in a bandwidth similar to the phase-matching bandwidth for Brillouin scattering. A simple diagrammatic theory connects the observation of reduced mechanical linewidths directly to the associated phonon diffusion properties, and helps explain recent experimental results.

The non-reciprocity of the device is controlled in-situ by varying the amplitude and phase difference of two independent microwave pump tones feeding the system. At the desired working point and for a signal frequency of 8. 453 GHz, the device achieves a forward power gain of 15 dB within a dynamical bandwidth of 9 MHz, a reverse gain of - 6 dB and suppression of the reflected signal by 8 dB.

They are particularly important in the field of superconducting quantum information, where the devices also need to have minimal photon losses to preserve the quantum coherence of signals. Conventional commercial implementations of each device suffer from losses and are built from very different physical principles, which has led to separate strategies for the construction of their quantum-limited versions. However, as recently proposed theoretically, by establishing simultaneous pairwise conversion and/or gain processes between three modes of a Josephson-junction based superconducting microwave circuit, it is possible to endow the circuit with the functions of either a phase-preserving directional amplifier or a circulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate these two modes of operation of the same circuit. Furthermore, in the directional amplifier mode, we show that the noise performance is comparable to standard non-directional superconducting amplifiers, while in the circulator mode, we show that the sense of circulation is fully reversible.

40|$|Isolation of {{a system}} from its {{environment}} is often desirable, from precision measurements to control of individual quantum systems; however, dissipation {{can also be a}} useful resource. Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the preparation of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits as well as their stabilization. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a dissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the field of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical oscillators utilizes the inherently cold, dissipative nature of the electromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent theoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of the mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold, dissipative reservoir to an electromagnetic mode. Here we realize this reversed dissipation regime in a microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous, cold reservoir for microwave light. Coupling to this reservoir enables to manipulate the susceptibility of the microwave cavity, corresponding to dynamical backaction control of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe the onset of parametric instability, i. e. the stimulated emission of microwaves (masing). Equally important, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum resource. We evidence this by employing the engineered cold reservoir to implement a large gain (above 40 dB) phase preserving microwave amplifier that operates 0. 87 quanta above the limit of added noise imposed by quantum mechanics. Such a dissipative cold reservoir forms the basis of microwave entanglement schemes, the study of dissipative quantum phase transitions, amplifiers with unlimited gain-bandwidth product and <b>non-reciprocal</b> <b>devices,</b> thereby extending the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave manipulation techniques.

However, the incorporation of optical isolators and related <b>non-reciprocal</b> <b>devices</b> within standard optoelectronic wafer platforms is exceptionally challenging. Preferred magneto-optic materials cannot be exploited as waveguide core layers on semiconductor wafers due to a lower refractive index. Another difficulty is the phase velocity mismatch {{as a consequence of}} the inherent structural birefringence associated with waveguide geometries. Our approach to the integration of an optical isolator with a III-V semiconductor laser involves combining a nonreciprocal mode converter with a reciprocal mode converter, based on an asymmetric profiled rib waveguide, fabricated by Reactive Ion Etching. We demonstrate that suitably tapered waveguides can be employed to connect the mode converter to other sections thereby avoiding problems caused by mode-matching and reflections from the section interfaces. The nonreciprocal mode converter is formed from a continuation of the III-V semiconductor waveguide core with a magneto-optic upper cladding so that Faraday rotation occurs through the interaction of the evanescent tail. The phase velocity mismatch due to the waveguide birefringence is overcome using a quasi-phase-matching approach. Lithography is used to pattern the top cladding so that the film immediately on top of the waveguide core alternates between magnetooptic and a non-magneto-optic dielectric of a similar refractive index. Our first demonstrations used a dielectric (silica or silicon nitride) patterned by etching, or lift-off, on top of a GaAs rib waveguide, over which was deposited a magneto-optic film.

Multi-moding allows us, by means of input phasing, to direct power to different locations through the same waveguide. Planar symmetry allows the height to be increased to improve power handling capacity. Features that invite breakdown, such as coupling slots, irises and H-plane septa, are avoided. This class includes hybrids, directional couplers, an eight-port superhybrid/dual-mode launcher, a mode-selective extractor, mode–preserving bends, a rectangular mode converter, and mode-mixers. We are able to utilize such rectangular waveguide components in systems incorporating low-loss, circular waveguide delay lines by means of specially designed tapers that efficiently transform multiple rectangular waveguide modes into their corresponding circular waveguide modes, specifically TE 10 and TE 20 into circular TE 11 and TE 01. These extremely compact tapers can replace well-known mode converters such as the Marié type. Another component, a reflective TE 01 -TE 02 mode converter in circular waveguide, allows us to double the delay in reflective or resonant delay lines.

40|$|A gyrator is a <b>non-reciprocal</b> two port <b>device</b> with 180 (omicron) {{phase shift}} in the {{transmissions}} between two ports. Though electromagnetic realizations of gyrators have been well studied, devices based on other forms of interaction are relatively unexplored. Here we demonstrate a device in which signal is transmitted via magneto-elastic coupling, can function as a gyrator. The device is built on a piezoelectric substrate: one port of this device has interdigital transducers (IDTs) and the other port has a periodic array of nickel/gold lines. When the magnetizations of Ni lines are excited into precession by magnetic field generated by passing oscillating current through the gold lines, they emit phonons {{in the form of}} surface acoustic waves (SAW) due to the magneto-elastic coupling between Ni and substrate. The emitted SAW can be detected at the other end by the IDTs. Conversely, when SAW is incident on Ni lines from IDTs, the magnetization undergoes precession and can be inductively detected by Au lines. The broken time reversal symmetry of the system due to the presence of ferromagnet gives rise to the non-reciprocal transmission between the two ports. These devices could function as novel building blocks for phonon based information processing...|$|R

The term magnetoplasmon, or magnetoplasma surface wave, {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the early 70 â€™s, motivated by a renovated interest in surface plasmons in metals and degenerate semiconductors. Nowadays, the phenomenology associated to systems where plasmonic and magneto-optical (MO) properties coexist has become an active area of investigation. These magnetoplasmonic systems have opened new routes {{for the development of}} e. g. high performance gas and biosensing platforms as well as the exploitation of <b>non-reciprocal</b> effects in <b>devices</b> with potential applications in the telecom area. In magnetoplasmonic structures, MO and plasmonic properties are intertwined, allowing for plasmonic properties to become tunable upon application of a magnetic field (active plasmonics), or the MO effects to be largely increased by plasmon resonance excitation, {{as a consequence of the}} enhancement of the electromagnetic (EM) field in the MO active component of the structure. In this last case, the study of the enhanced MO activity in structures with subwavelength dimensions is especially interesting since the properties of these systems upon plasmon resonance excitation bring as a consequence an enhanced EM field in its interior, and more interestingly in the region where the MO active component is present. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to experimentally determine the intensity of the EM field inside a nanostructure. Here we show how the EM profile related to the localized surface plasmon resonance can be probed locally inside the nanostructure by measuring the MO activity of the system as a function of the position a MO active probe (a Co nanolayer). At this stage, optimizing the EM field distribution within the structure by maximizing it in the MO components region while simultaneously minimizing it in all the other, non MO active, lossy components, will allow for the development of novel systems with high MO activity and reduced losses, becoming an alternative to state of the art dielectric MO materials, like garnets. We will show how the insertion of a dielectric layer in Au/Co/Au magnetoplasmonic nanodisks induces an EM field redistribution in such a way to concentrate it in the regions of interest of the nanostructure. The metallo-dielectric system exhibits large MO activity and low optical extinction in a specific wavelength range (around 780 nm). It will be demonstrated this is due to a EM field redistribution at this wavelength, controlled by the insertion of the dielectric layer. If time permits we will also show some examples in which the MO effect is used to control the plasmon properties, such as magnetoplasmon interferometry.
