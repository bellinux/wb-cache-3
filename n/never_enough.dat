5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E
5|$|Prison life at Fremantle was {{extremely}} regulated. Meals were {{an important part}} of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with flogging and time in irons eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution, between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included Moondyne Joe, as well as John Boyle O'Reilly and six other Fenians in the 19th century, and Brenden Abbott in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.|$|E
5000|$|The Scherzo No. 2 in B-flat minor, Op. 31 is a scherzo by Frédéric Chopin. The {{work was}} {{composed}} {{and published in}} 1837, and was dedicated to Countess Adèle Fürstenstein. Robert Schumann compared this scherzo to a Byronic poem, [...] "so overflowing with tenderness, boldness, love and contempt." [...] According to Wilhelm von Lenz, a pupil of Chopin, the composer said that the renowned sotto voce opening was a question and the second phrase the answer: [...] "For Chopin it was <b>never</b> questioning <b>enough,</b> <b>never</b> soft <b>enough,</b> <b>never</b> vaulted (tombe) <b>enough.</b> It must be a charnel-house."

5|$|Rum-runners {{used the}} Everglades as a hiding spot during Prohibition; {{it was so}} vast there were <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> law {{enforcement}} officers to patrol it. The arrival of the railroad, and the discovery that adding trace elements like copper was the remedy for crops sprouting and dying quickly, soon created a population boom. New towns such as Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade sprouted like the crops. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , {{most of it in}} real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of South Florida slash pine were cleared. Some of the pine was for lumber, but most of the pine forests in Dade County were cleared for development.|$|E

25|$|Glamorgan Dragons {{were out}} of luck at Bristol, as their top order {{collapsed}} to the bowling of Carl Greenidge. Only a last-wicket partnership between Robert Croft and Dean Cosker ensured that Glamorgan batted out 20 overs, as they were 70 for 8 at one point but finished on 128 for 9. However, it was <b>never</b> <b>enough.</b> Croft took two wickets with his off-spin, but Craig Spearman's 39 built the platform as Gloucestershire Steelbacks eased to victory with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
25|$|A toothless bowling {{effort from}} Glamorgan Dragons became their {{downfall}} as Hampshire Hawks recorded a relatively comfortable seven-wicket win at The Rose Bowl. Batting first, Glamorgan {{were in a}} good position at 117 for 1, but Shaun Udal and Shane Warne chipped away at the Glamorgan middle-order. Robert Croft, the former England spinner, top-scored with a healthy 88, and an eighth-wicket partnership of 23 rescued Glamorgan to 211 for 7. It was <b>never</b> <b>enough,</b> however, as all Hampshire batsmen – excluding Derek Kenway, who was out for 4 – fired and took runs at will off the bowling. With 45 deliveries and seven wickets remaining, Hampshire eased to victory to increase the gap to the relegation zone.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan Dragons {{only took}} three wickets, {{which was not}} enough to defend a total of 211 against Hampshire Hawks at the Rose Bowl. Batting first, Glamorgan made it to 117 for 1 before spinners Shaun Udal and Shane Warne chipped away at the Glamorgan middle-order with five wickets together. Robert Croft, the former England spinner, top-scored with 88 from the opening position, while an eighth-wicket {{partnership}} of 23 between Mark Wallace and David Harrison took Glamorgan to a total of 211 for 7. It was <b>never</b> <b>enough,</b> however, as all Hampshire batsmen - excluding Derek Kenway, who was out for 4 - fired to score more than 30 runs. With 45 deliveries and seven wickets remaining, Hampshire passed the victory target to increase the gap to the relegation zone.|$|E

25|$|Staff {{training}} was uneven and neglected. Systematic training of formation leaders was not begun until after 1943. It created {{a lack of}} trained and experienced flight leaders in 1943–1945. This was far too late {{to help in the}} Defence of the Reich campaign. The trained and experienced leaders that did exist were replaced in 1940 by younger and less experienced leaders too quickly (owing to Göring's frustration with them during the Battle of Britain). Later, Göring did the same thing with Fighter Division, the Jafu Jagdfliegerführer and Jagddivision commanders. The high turnover in the division made gaining experience impossible. Making matters worse, there were no fighter command organisations {{at the start of the}} war and there were <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> good officers to staff those that were set up. The Luftwaffe had very few General Staff Officers.|$|E
25|$|Mal Loye and Brad Hodge helped Lancashire Lightning {{to recover}} after Stuart Law was stumped {{in the second}} over off Durham Dynamos medium-pacer Neil Killeen. Loye and Hodge paired up for 169 for the second wicket, as Loye became the second Lancastrian to score a Twenty20 century this season before he was {{eventually}} caught off Nathan Astle's bowling for 100. Lancashire closed on 208 for 4, and only Killeen conceded less than 30 runs of Durham's six bowlers. Astle got the best bowling figures, with two for 37, but his batting helped little - 55 for 37 was <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> {{to keep up with}} the asking rate of 10.5. When Durham realised that, they tried to lash out, and a result, wickets tumbled to Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork and Durham finished their 20 overs with the score on 171 for 7.|$|E
25|$|When {{the colony}} of New South Wales {{was founded in}} 1788, it ran into the problem {{of a lack of}} coinage. Foreign coins – {{including}} British, Dutch, Indian and Portuguese – were common in its early years, but much of this coin left the colony by way of trade with visiting merchant ships. Barter was a necessity amongst the colonists, with the most popular, rum becoming an unofficial currency. One of the first attempts to restrict the practice was by Governor King, who on 19 November 1800 set an arbitrary price for foreign coinage, but there was <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> of it. To try and resolve the shortage, he requested the supply of sixpences to be used as shillings, but failed to get a hearing. The practice of using rum as a currency was prohibited by Governor Bligh in 1806, eventually culminating in the overthrow of the government in the Rum Rebellion.|$|E

25|$|In 1925 Ryti {{was also}} {{nominated}} {{as a presidential}} candidate at the age of 36. In the second round of voting, he received the most support. However, in the third round the Swedish People's Party, which held the balance, moved their votes to Lauri Kristian Relander, and Ryti lost to Relander by 109 votes to 172. Ryti's support increased over the years but was <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> in elections. During the 1930s he withdrew from daily politics, but influenced economic policies. Ryti was an orthodox supporter of classical liberal economics. He made his goal to tie the value of Finnish markka to the gold standard. Unlike many other European countries, Finland did not choose deflationary solutions under his leadership; and in 1926 the country shifted to the gold markka. However, after the Great Depression in 1929, Finland was forced to abandon the gold standard following the example of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Reverses {{in the air}} and on {{the ground}} soon followed. Japanese forces had naval superiority, and they used it to make {{outflanking}} amphibious landings as they advanced down the Malayan peninsula towards Singapore. Japanese assaults from the ground and air soon made the forward landing grounds that much of the RAF's only real hope of defending Singapore from the air rested upon untenable. The RAF took a toll of Japanese forces, but there were <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> aircraft to do anything more than delay the Japanese offensive. Indian, British, and Australian army forces in Malaya were larger in numbers than the other services. But they were equally ill-prepared and ill-led. They were committed in numbers both too small and too poorly positioned to counter the Japanese tactic of outflanking strongpoints through the jungle. Over a period of several weeks, the Allied ground forces steadily gave ground.|$|E
25|$|Polanco-Rodriguez {{recruited}} widely among {{gang members}} around northern Manhattan, the Bronx and Flatbush, Brooklyn. He adopted the organizational schemes of the Colombian cartels: some employees cooked and packaged the drug, others transported and stored it, and others sold {{it on the}} streets. Others were organized into a hit squad to overpower and take drug spots from smaller but stronger gangs throughout the Bronx and Brooklyn. The DEA claimed that Polanco-Rodriguez's hit squad was responsible {{for at least five}} slayings, although there was <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> evidence to indict. His enterprise also included several family members. His half-brother, Chiqui, ran the operation when Polanco-Rodriguez was in the Dominican Republic. A second brother, Elvis, delivered stashes to street locations, and a third, Santiaguito, was a cash courier. His sister, Dulce Elizabeth, and mother, Luisa Ordalina, counted the cash and maintained apartments where the crack was kept and produced. All are now fugitives in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no matter how many hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and <b>never</b> <b>enough</b> shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E
