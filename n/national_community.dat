25|$|Over {{the next}} seven years, the annual <b>National</b> <b>Community</b> Christmas Tree {{lighting}} ceremony did not change in major ways. The lighting ceremony was pushed back to 6:00 P.M. in 1925 to better accommodate children's bedtimes. In 1926, a flare was fired into the air as the tree was illuminated, a tradition which occurred for several years. In 1927, a bronze marker was placed {{at the base of}} the tree, declaring it the <b>National</b> <b>Community</b> Christmas Tree. The tree was decorated with improved lighting strings (which only required 500 multi-colored bulbs) as well as with 2,000 light-scattering jewels. Colored floodlights {{at the base of the}} tree also helped provide color. President Coolidge briefly addressed the crowd, beginning a tradition of a brief presidential speech during the ceremony. NBC broadcast a selection of Christmas carols from speakers placed around the tree from 9:00 P.M. until midnight. In 1928, the time of the lighting ceremony was again moved to 8:00 P.M. That year, the Christmas lights were replaced completely by colored floodlights.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in its history, the <b>National</b> <b>Community</b> Christmas Tree was not lit in 1942 due to the need to {{conserve}} power and observe security restrictions on outdoor lighting. For security reasons, it was not lit again until after the war concluded in 1945. Nonetheless, President Roosevelt continued to give a national radio address on what would have been the date of the tree lighting ceremony during these three years. Ornaments for the 1942 tree were donated by local D.C. schoolchildren, and limited to the colors red, white, and blue. With the president and his family spending Christmas of 1943 at the family home of Springwood in Hyde Park, New York, and with concern that the tree ceremony might worsen the transportation overcrowding situation in the city, the decision was made to cancel the <b>National</b> <b>Community</b> Christmas Tree decoration altogether. But Eleanor Roosevelt requested that the ceremony proceed, and it did. Once more, local children contributed the tree's ornaments (which were again permitted to be multi-colored). Each ornament had a small white tag attached to it, commemorating an American soldier, sailor, or flier who had been wounded, killed, or gone missing in combat. Roosevelt was in Hyde Park again in 1944 (although Eleanor Roosevelt remained at the White House for the annual tree ceremony), and once more local schoolchildren contributed the ornaments.|$|E
25|$|The Bahá'í Faith in Finland {{began with}} contact between {{traveling}} Scandinavians with early Persian believers of the Bahá'í Faith in the mid-to-late 19th century Following {{a period of}} more Bahá'í pioneers coming to the country, Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies spread across Finland while the <b>national</b> <b>community</b> eventually formed a Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in 1962. Some estimates in 2004 of the Bahá'ís in Finland number about 500 Bahá'ís including a winner of human rights award and a television personality. In 2005 there was an estimate of over 1,700 according to the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia).|$|E

25|$|The Bahá'í Faith in Costa Rica {{begins when}} `Abdu'l-Bahá {{mentions}} {{it as one}} of the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to in 1919. However the first pioneers began to settle in Coast Rica in 1940 followed quickly by the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly being elected in San José in April 1941. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1961. As of 2009 Bahá'ís sources indicate the <b>national</b> <b>community</b> includes various peoples and tribes and over 4,000 members organized groups in over 30 locations throughout the country. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 13000 Bahá'ís in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{a number of}} laws {{enabling}} emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries. The old laws restricting them to ghettos, {{as well as the}} many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by racial antisemitism, encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau and particularly his Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race of 1853–5. Nationalist agendas based on ethnicity, known as ethnonationalism, usually excluded the Jews from the <b>national</b> <b>community</b> as an alien race. Allied to this were theories of Social Darwinism, which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white Aryans to Semitic Jews.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In Papua New Guinea this has taken a variety of forms. The <b>national</b> <b>community</b> supports a number of projects both locally and nationally organized.|$|E
