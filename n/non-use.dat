Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals not wearing seat belts. The fine in Montana for not wearing a seat belt in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads.

We {{enforced}} {{a minimum}} buffer distance (i.e., 56  m) that was {{equal to the}} median distance between successive locations (i.e., D) observed across all individuals to acknowledge there was a minimum area available even if an individual did not move during that time period on a given day. We matched each used location {{with a set of}} five <b>non-used</b> locations drawn from within the circular buffer and considered each used location with its associated five <b>non-used</b> locations as a single stratum. This discrete-choice design (Cooper and Millspaugh 1999; Compton et al. 2002; McDonald et al. 2006) quantifies a choice made by an individual female sage-grouse (i.e., used location) relative to five alternative choices that also were available temporally and spatially but were not chosen (i.e., <b>non-used</b> locations). One benefit of discrete-choice models is that inference is conditional on individual strata (e.g., a single used location and the paired <b>non-used</b> locations), thus accounting for potential spatiotemporal or within-individual autocorrelation among used locations (Pendergast et al. 1996; Johnson et al. 2004; Baasch et al. 2010; Cushman and Lewis 2010). We estimated resource selection models across all individuals and years to make population-level inference using conditional logistic regression for encamped and traveling behavioral modes separately, and then combined all behavior-specific data back into a non-behaviorally adjusted model for comparison. For the non-behaviorally adjusted model, we included a weight statement to adjust for the greater number of locations assigned to the encamped state. Locations assigned to the encamped mode were given a weight of 0.5138 whereas the traveling locations were given a weight of 1.0. AIC adjusted for small sample size difference (∆AICc) and Akaike weights (w) were used to assess and select the most parsimonious models (Burnham and Anderson 2004) of occurrence during encamped and traveling modes and for the non-behaviorally adjusted model.|$|R
40|$|Background It {{has been}} argued that {{recovery}} from substance dependence relies on a change in identity, with past research focused on ‘personal identity’. This study assessed support for a social identity model of recovery in emerging adults through examining associations between social identity, social networks, recovery capital, and quality of life. Methods Twenty participants aged 18 – 21 in residential treatment for substance misuse were recruited from four specialist youth drug treatment services - three detoxification facilities and one psychosocial rehabilitation facility in Victoria, Australia. Participants completed a detailed social network interview exploring the substance use of groups in their social networks and measures of quality of life, recovery capital, and social identity. Results Lower group substance use was associated with higher recovery capital, stronger identification with <b>non-using</b> groups, and greater importance of <b>non-using</b> groups in the social network. Additionally, greater identification with and importance of <b>non-using</b> groups were associated with better environmental quality of life, whereas greater importance conferred on using groups was associated with reduced environmental quality of life. Conclusions Support was found for the role of social identity processes in reported recovery capital and quality of life. Future research in larger, longitudinal samples is required to improve understanding of social identity processes during treatment and early recovery and its relationship to recovery stability.

A form of western Greek native to Euboea, which among other things had Χ for /ks/, was transplanted to Italy by early Greek colonists, and became the ancestor of the Old Italic alphabets and ultimately, through Etruscan, of the Latin alphabet. Athens used a local form of the alphabet until the 5th century BC; it lacked the letters Ξ and Ψ {{as well as the}} vowel symbols Η and Ω. The classical 24-letter alphabet that became the norm later was originally the local alphabet of Ionia; this was adopted by Athens in 403 BC under archon Eucleides and in most other parts of the Greek-speaking world during the 4th century BC.|$|E

The use or <b>non-use</b> of covers {{significantly}} affects the way the ball comes off the pitch, making the matter potentially controversial. Law 11 of the Laws of Cricket provides that during the match the pitch shall not be completely covered unless provided otherwise by regulations or by agreement before the toss. When possible, the bowlers' run ups are covered in inclement weather to keep them dry. If the pitch is covered overnight, the covers are removed in the morning at the earliest possible moment on each day that play is expected to take place. If covers are used during the day as protection from inclement weather or if inclement weather delays the removal of overnight covers, they are removed as soon as conditions allow. Excess water can be removed from a pitch or the outfield using a machine called a water hog.|$|E
25|$|NHTSA has {{produced}} models and guidance {{on the economic}} burden of traffic crashes on employers. Because public and private employers in the U.S. generally subsidize at least a portion of health insurance premium costs for employees and their dependents, employers bear some {{of the costs of}} crashes involving employees and families away from work in addition to at-work crashes. Employers are also liable for damages awarded in the courts for crashes for which employees are found to be at fault. In 1998-2000, motor vehicle crash injuries occurring on and off the job were estimated to cost employers nearly US $60 billion annually. On average, a fatality occurring on the job cost a business over $500,000 USD in direct and liability costs, and each nonfatal injury cost nearly $74,000 USDs. For on- and off-the-job crashes combined, the study estimated the cost of <b>non-use</b> of safety belts at more than $6 billion each year, and the cost of alcohol-related crashes at more than $9 billion each year.|$|E
25|$|Many local {{variants}} of the Greek alphabet {{were employed in}} ancient Greece during the archaic and early classical periods, until they were replaced by the classical 24-letter alphabet that is the standard today, around 400 BC. All forms of the Greek alphabet were originally based on the shared inventory of the 22 symbols of the Phoenician alphabet, {{with the exception of}} the letter Samekh, whose Greek counterpart Xi (Ξ) was used only in a sub-group of Greek alphabets, and with the common addition of Upsilon (Υ) for the vowel /u, ū/. The local, so-called epichoric, alphabets differed in many ways: in the use of the consonant symbols Χ, Φ and Ψ; in the use of the innovative long vowel letters (Ω and Η), in the absence or presence of Η in its original consonant function (/h/); in the use or <b>non-use</b> of certain archaic letters (Ϝ = /w/, Ϙ = /k/, Ϻ = /s/); and in many details of the individual shapes of each letter. The system now familiar as the standard 24-letter Greek alphabet was originally the regional variant of the Ionian cities in Asia Minor. It was officially adopted in Athens in 403 BC and in most of the rest of the Greek world by the middle of the 4th century BC.|$|E

By comparing the discursive accounts of self-defined recovered, recovering and currently addicted users, the report highlighted how ways of speaking about substances and their use may be implicated in the maintenance and cessation of addiction. The transcripts of four focus groups, consisting of a total number of 15 informants, were qualitatively analysed using a thematic method that focused on the informants’ strategic use of discourse. The analysis revealed important differences between using and <b>non-using</b> informants in terms of the self employed discursive practices that they used in constructing their experience of addiction. Differences included variations in the attribution of agency to either the opiate or the informant {{and the degree to which}} opiate use was presented as cause for concern or not.
