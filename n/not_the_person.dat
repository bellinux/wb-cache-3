5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> has dehydration {{is an important part}} of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July, Heydrich {{announced}} that all Jews {{were to be}} regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. On 17 July Heydrich ordered that the Einsatzgruppen were to kill all Jewish Red Army prisoners of war, plus all Red Army prisoners of war from Georgia and Central Asia, as they too might be Jews. Unlike in Germany, where the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined as Jewish anyone with at least three Jewish grandparents, the Einsatzgruppen defined as Jewish anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent; in either case, whether or <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> practised the religion was irrelevant. The unit was also assigned to exterminate Romani people and the mentally ill. It was common practice for the Einsatzgruppen to shoot hostages.|$|E
25|$|January - An {{edition of}} the church's New Era {{magazine}} for teens addressed a question on whether having friends with homosexual feelings was okay. It advised members to choose friends carefully who have similar values since homosexual behavior violates God’s commandments, and that the church condemns the immoral behavior but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{province}} {{was divided}} into five districts, with American officers serving as district governors and deputy governors. These districts included: Cotabato, Davao, Lanao, Sulu, and Zamboanga. The districts were sub-divided into tribal wards, with major datus serving as ward chiefs and minor datus serving as deputies, judges, and sheriffs. This system {{took advantage of the}} existing structure of Moro political society, which was based on personal ties, while paving the way for a more individualistic society, where the office, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> holding it, would be given respect.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{claimed that}} Bembenek {{was the only}} person with the motive, means and opportunity to carry out the crime. The strongest evidence was two human hairs found at the crime scene, which matched ones taken from the hairbrush of the defendant. The gun used to kill Christine Schultz turned out to be Bembenek's husband's off-duty revolver. The prosecution claimed that Bembenek {{was the only person}} besides Fred Schultz who had access to this weapon. Blood was found on the gun. Bembenek supposedly also had access to a key to Christine Schultz's home. There were no signs of a break-in and no valuables taken. Schultz's eldest son, however, stated that Bembenek was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who had held up their house and shot his mother.|$|E
25|$|At the inquest, {{the medical}} {{examiner}} explains that chloral hydrate {{was given to the}} victim before he was murdered. After the inquest, Edna Brent, one of the secretaries, expresses confusion at something said in evidence. She tries but fails to convey this to Hardcastle. She is soon found dead in a telephone box on Wilbraham Crescent, strangled with her own scarf. The dead man's identity is yet unknown. Mrs Merlina Rival (original name Flossie Gapp) identifies the dead man as her one-time husband, Harry Castleton. Colin leaves Britain on his own case, travelling behind the Iron Curtain to Romania. He returns with the information he needed, but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> he hoped to find. Following Poirot's advice, Colin talks with the neighbours. He finds a ten-year-old girl, Geraldine Brown, in the apartment block across the street.

25|$|On April 30, the Rev. George Burroughs, Lydia Dustin, Susannah Martin, Dorcas Hoar, Sarah Morey and Philip English (Mary's husband) were arrested. Nehemiah Abbott Jr. was {{released}} because the accusers agreed he was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> whose specter had afflicted them. Mary Eastey {{was released}} {{for a few}} days after her initial arrest because the accusers failed to confirm that it was she who had afflicted them; she had been arrested again when the accusers reconsidered. In May, accusations continued to pour in, but some of those suspects began to evade apprehension. Multiple warrants were issued before John Willard and Elizabeth Colson were apprehended; George Jacobs Jr. and Daniel Andrews were not caught. Until this point, all the proceedings were investigative, but on May 27, 1692, William Phips ordered the establishment of a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer for Suffolk, Essex and Middlesex counties to prosecute the cases of those in jail. Warrants were issued for more people. Sarah Osborne, one of the first three persons accused, died in jail on May 10, 1692.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{pieces of}} {{legislation}} passed in 1996 {{had a significant effect}} on illegal immigration and deportations in the United States; the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). These were introduced following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, both of which were terrorist attacks that claimed American lives. These two acts changed the way criminal cases of lawful permanent residents were handled, resulting in increased deportations from the United States. Before the 1996 deportation laws, there were two steps that lawful permanent noncitizen residents who were convicted of crimes went through. The first step determined whether or <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> was deportable. The second step determined if that person should or shouldn't be deported. Before the 1996 deportation laws, the second step prevented many permanent residents from being deported by allowing for their cases to be reviewed in full before issuing deportations. External factors were taken into consideration such as the effect deportation would have on a person's family members and a person's connections with their country of origin. Under this system permanent residents were able to be relieved of deportation if their situation deemed it unnecessary. The 1996 laws however issued many deportations under the first step, without going through the second step, resulting in a great increase in deportations.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Norway during winter, Gudrid is {{amazed that}} {{the trees are}} huge {{compared}} to {{the ones on the}} islands. When the group goes ashore to make camp, they are suddenly attacked by a bear that is awake despite winter. The bear almost kills Thorfinn and Einar, but is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel. A female hunter emerges from the wood and intrudes herself as Hild, daughter of Hrafnkell. Hild skins the bear and lets the group have the meat. While enjoying a bear meat stew, Hild and the group get along quite well, chatting friendly with each other. However, Hild suddenly reveals that she recognizes Thorfinn as the one who killed her father when her home was attacked by Askeladd's warband 8 years before. Thorfinn remembers the attack and admits that he is guilty. Hild almost shoots Thornfinn with her crossbow but hesitates because Karli is strapped to his back. Hild tell the group that she poisoned the soup and will throw the antidote away unless Thorfinn follow her into the woods alone to face her. Thorfinn agrees, swearing to his comrades that he will not die, nor will he hurt Hild. Thorfinn initially keeps himself at bay while evading Hild's quarrels, but he finally figures out her position and charges her. However, he is taken completely by surprise by Hild's specially crafted crossbow's ability to reload rapidly, taking multiple quarrels to his legs. Thorfinn's comrades arrive despite Hild's threat and try to convince Hild that Thorfinn is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> he once was, and Thonfinn himself begs for time to atone for his sins. Hild remains unconvinced and is about to finish Thorfinn off, but she sees a vision of her father and her old hunting master which causes her to miss. Although she cannot forgive Thorfinn, she agrees to give him time to try and complete his mission. Hild decides to travel with the group {{to keep an eye on}} Thorfinn and swears that if he shows any signs of abandoning his mission to create a land of peace, she will kill him at last.|$|E

500|$|Adele, who {{had just}} {{released}} her second album 21, admitted that initially she was a [...] "little hesitant" [...] about agreeing to write a Bond theme song.

Mendes simply replied [...] "just write a personal song", telling her to use Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] from The Spy Who Loved Me as an inspiration. Adele left the meeting with the script of Skyfall and, upon reading it, decided that it was a [...] "" [...] as she [...] "fell in love" [...] with the film's plot.

Adele stated that she enjoyed working to a brief and set of guidelines, even though it was something she had never done before.|$|E
500|$|On 11 December 1980 Hodgson {{asked to}} see a priest, Father Frank Moran, to whom he confessed {{that he was having}} nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed [...] "kept coming back to him". He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ...

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E
