5|$|Hermética's last {{concert was}} held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had {{contracted}} hepatitis B {{turned out to be}} false. The other members sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Hermética, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the Clarín newspaper and the other members to the music magazine Madhouse. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> each other. He said he had lied about having hepatitis B, expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the other members, who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in Madhouse magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received most of the money, and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing the problems in the band.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Hadlee helped New Zealand to a 1–0 series win in England, {{their first}} over that country in England. Hadlee's {{outstanding}} personal {{performance in the}} second test at Nottingham (his county 'home') where he took 10 wickets and scored 68 in New Zealand's first innings powered his team to victory. In this test Hadlee, often a controversial character, added to this side of his reputation when he felled (and hospitalised) England wicketkeeper and Nottinghampshire teammate Bruce French with a nasty bouncer. During the New Zealand v West Indies test at Christchurch in March 1987, Hadlee and captain Jeremy Coney had a disagreement {{in the dressing room}} prior to the game. It progressed to <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> each other on the field, communicating through John Wright at mid-on.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

According to Alfred Henry Spink, founder of The Sporting News, {{he received the}} nickname because he [...] "was a great stickler for his rights and talked to himself when <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the Umpire." [...] Another player of the era, future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Orator Jim O'Rourke, shared the same nickname.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} section of Fenwick's book, she recounts the est {{training}} process and the methods used during the course. Fenwick details the rules or [...] "agreements" [...] laid out by the trainers to the attendees, which include <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> others or leaving the session {{to go to the bathroom}} unless during an announced break period. The second section is analytic: Fenwick analyzes the methods used by the est trainers, evaluates the course's potential effects, and discusses Erhard's background. Fenwick concludes that the program's long-term effects are unknown, the est training may not be appropriate for certain groups of people, and that the large proportion of participants experience positive effects.|$|E

500|$|Manal al-Sharif ( [...] ; born 25 April 1979) is a Saudi Arabian women's {{rights activist}} who helped start a women's right to drive {{campaign}} in 2011. A women's rights activist {{who had previously}} filmed herself driving, Wajeha al-Huwaider, filmed al-Sharif driving a car {{as part of the}} campaign. The video was posted on YouTube and Facebook. Al-Sharif was detained and released on 21 May and rearrested the following day. On 30 May, al-Sharif was released on bail, on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested, not driving and <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the media. The New York Times and Associated Press associated the women's driving campaign with the wider pattern of the Arab Spring and the long duration of al-Sharif's detention due to Saudi authorities' fear of protests.|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. <b>Not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} al-Sharif's arrest, another woman was {{detained}} for driving a car. She drove with two women passengers in Ar Rass and was detained by traffic {{police in the}} presence of the CPVPV. She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again. In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days. On 26 May, authorities said that al-Sharif would remain in detention until 5 June 2011, according to Waleed Abu Al-Khair. Al-Sharif was conditionally freed on 30 May. Her lawyer Adnan al-Saleh said that she had been charged with [...] "inciting women to drive" [...] and [...] "rallying public opinion". The conditions of Al-Sharif's release include bail, returning for questioning if requested, not driving and <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the media. As possible reasons for al-Sharif's early release, The National cited al-Sharif having written a letter to King Abdullah, 4,500 Saudis signing an online petition to the King, and [...] "an outpouring of indignation and disbelief by both Saudis and critics abroad that Ms al-Sharif was jailed for something that is not a moral or criminal offence." ...|$|E

500|$|Setting {{the finale}} in several {{different}} time periods was criticized by some critics. Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "we endure a swirl of confusing, unnecessary sequences, from Grace's dream to current reality to two years later to their kids' first day of college to their kids' impending wedding. By the end, instead of being sad to bid adieu, we're just relieved not to have yet another disbelief-suspending flash-forward thrust upon us." [...] Jim Schembri of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote: [...] "The time-jumping device is overused and a tad awkward but, by and large, it’s a noble finale {{to one of the}} better standard three-wall sitcoms from America." [...] Amy Amatangelo of Zap2it commented that Will & Grace [...] "is a show that spent eight seasons predicated on the lasting friendship of Will and Grace, and we're supposed to believe that they spent over 20 years <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> each other just because their lives went in different directions? That there is no way their friendship could have been sustained once they both found the love of their life?" [...] Amatangelo enjoyed Jack and Karen's performance of [...] "Unforgettable", {{but the rest of the}} finale she [...] "could have done without." ...|$|E

Amy Macdonald, in her song [...] "Let's Start a Band" [...] referenced Glastonbury: [...] "Give me a festival and I'll be your Glastonbury star." [...] Robbie Williams, in his song [...] "The 90s", refers to his surprise appearance on stage with Oasis in 1995, which ultimately led to him leaving Take That: [...] "Everybody's worried 'what the fuck's wrong with Robbie? He's not answering his phone, he's <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> me, I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury'." [...] Joe Strummer wrote the song [...] "Coma Girl" [...] about his experiences at Glastonbury, — in a BBC interview Bruce Springsteen cited the song as inspiring him to play the 2009 festival. U2 wrote a song titled [...] "Glastonbury" [...] {{that was supposed to}} premier with their appearance at the festival, but an injury to Bono forced them to cancel. They instead premiered it in a concert in Turin on their 360° Tour. Marcus Brigstocke's comic creation Giles Wemmbley Hogg had a special mock-documentary made about him going to Glastonbury as part of the Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off series. Deborah Crombie's novel A Finer End takes place in Glastonbury with references to a fictional account of an original 1914 Glastonbury Fayre as well as the contemporary festival. Glastonbury is also a setting in John Osborne's 2014 Radio 4 show The New Blur Album. Roxy Music did a song and album called Avalon, which is the ancient name for Glastonbury (Isle of Avalon).|$|E
