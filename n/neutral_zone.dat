At approximately 7p.m., missiles began to be thrown between the two sets of fans; because the stadium was crumbling, fans could pick stones up and throw them across the divide.|$|E
5|$|Once aboard, the Vendorian renders Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) unconscious, {{takes his}} form and orders the helmsman, Lt.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} the ionization {{structure in the}} enhanced wind from the hot star in symbiotic binaries during active phases. Rotation of the hot star leads to the compression of the outflowing material towards its equatorial plane. As a result a <b>neutral</b> disk-like <b>zone</b> around the active hot star near the orbital plane is created. We modelled the compression of the wind using the wind compression model. Further, we calculated the <b>neutral</b> disk-like <b>zone</b> in the enhanced wind from the hot star using the equation of the photoionization equilibrium. The presence of such <b>neutral</b> disk-like <b>zones</b> was also suggested {{on the basis of}} the modelling the spectral energy distribution of symbiotic binaries. We confront the calculated ionization structures in the enhanced wind from the hot star with the observations. We found that the calculated column density of the neutral hydrogen atoms in the <b>neutral</b> disk-like <b>zone</b> and the emission measure of the ionized part of the wind from the hot star are in a good agreement with quantities derived from observations during active phases. The presence of such <b>neutral</b> disk-like <b>zones</b> is transient, being connected with the active phases of symbiotic binaries. During quiescent phases, such <b>neutral</b> disk-like <b>zones</b> cannot be created, because of insufficient mass loss rate of the hot star.

5|$|Fighting {{has been}} a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in {{popularity}} in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the <b>neutral</b> <b>zone.</b> Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.|$|E
30|$|Since {{it is very}} {{cumbersome}} to keep {{a mobile}} device in its neutral position with zero pitch/roll angles, especially when walking, we define a <b>neutral</b> position <b>zone</b> - an angle-based offset wherein the device {{is assumed to be}} motionless. Basically, tilting within the <b>neutral</b> position <b>zone</b> will never invoke any particular action, hence involuntary movements will be filtered out. When the device leaves the <b>neutral</b> position <b>zone,</b> it means that the user is starting to execute the tilt sequence intentionally. To make a valid discrete tilt, the pitch/roll threshold angle should be exceeded by tilting in the wanted direction. The threshold angle is introduced in order to augment the disambiguation between spontaneous and deliberate movements, as well as to provide required wrist strokes in line with natural interaction. It is reasonable to define separate threshold angles for Pitch and Roll because constraints of different wrist movements (flexion, pronation, supination, ulnar and radial deviation) are not equal [12]. Once the threshold angle has been surpassed, the device is assumed to be positioned in the valid tilt zone. Finally, an immediate backward movement from the valid tilt <b>zone</b> to the <b>neutral</b> position <b>zone</b> results with the input primitive invocation.|$|R

An away team beams over and finds three Klingons: Korris (Vaughn Armstrong); Konmel (Charles Hyman); and Kunivas (Robert Bauer), who is wounded. The away team returns {{with them to the}} Enterprise before the freighter explodes. Kunivas is taken to sickbay and Korris meets with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The Klingon explains that they were passengers when the freighter was attacked by a Ferengi ship; the Klingons took over the freighter to fend off and destroy the Ferengi ship, but the damage sustained left the freighter adrift and faltering. As Korris and Konmel are shown to quarters, they are surprised to hear about a fellow Klingon, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), who is serving within Starfleet.|$|E

Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the <b>neutral</b> <b>zone</b> until the ball is snapped.

5|$|The tournaments {{follow the}} rules used by the IIHF. At the 1969 IIHF Congress, {{officials}} voted to allow body-checking in all three zones in a rink similar to the NHL. Before that, body-checking was only allowed in the defending zone in international hockey. Several other rule changes were implemented in the early 1970s: players were required to wear helmets starting in 1970, and goaltender masks became mandatory in 1972. In 1992, the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would be decided in a shootout. In 1998, the IIHF passed a rule that allowed two-line passes. Before then, the <b>neutral</b> <b>zone</b> trap had slowed the game down and reduced scoring.|$|E
50|$|To combat low scoring, a major rule {{change was}} implemented.

The rule was changed again mid-season in December 1929, and players were no longer allowed to enter the offensive zone before the puck. Hence the birth of the modern-day offside rule. The Canadiens doubled their scoring output compared to the previous season.|$|R

5|$|At {{the midway}} point the {{following}} season, Daniel {{was named to}} his second consecutive NHL All-Star Game in January 2012. He {{was one of four}} players representing the Canucks, including Henrik, Alexander Edler and Cody Hodgson. Chosen to Team Alfredsson in the All-Star Fantasy Draft, he recorded a goal and an assist in a 12–9 loss to Team Chara. Later in the season, Daniel sustained a concussion after receiving a hit from Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith during a game on 21 March 2012. With Daniel in the <b>neutral</b> <b>zone</b> and without possession of the puck, Keith hit him in the head with his elbow. After being helped off the ice by a trainer, Daniel remained in the game for a shift before leaving the contest entirely. Two days later, Keith was suspended five games for his hit by the League. Sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} regular season, Daniel finished 2011–12 with 30 goals and 67 points over 72 games, a drop off from his League-leading total from the previous season.|$|E
5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the <b>neutral</b> <b>zone</b> trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E
