40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> is a <b>nitrogenous</b> {{fertilizer}} used predominantly {{for over}} a century in field and glasshouse vegetable and salad production. This review draws {{together for the first time}} knowledge concerning the biological properties of the compound that benefit crop production by encouraging sustainable soil health and quality. This is achieved through the increase of microorganisms antagonistic to plant pathogens. The review also reports on the natural occurence and degradation of cyanamide. The literature survey provides a perspective of research from the early 1900 s to current studies. This identifies that nitrogen is released steadily into the rhizosphere from this fertiliser. Calcium is also readily available for plant roots and promotes the alkaline soil conditions beneficial to benign microorganisms. Consequently, soil suppressiveness towards organisms such as Plasmodiophora brassicae, the cause of clubroot disease in brassicas develops. The effects of calcium and accompanying changes in soil pH values are discussed in relation to the life cycle stages of P. brassicae and the development of clubroot disease.

40|$|The {{weed killer}} <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> {{was also a}} slowly acting N fertilizer. It {{released}} N as urea, which was subsequently converted to ammonium carbonate and nitrate. The first phase was mainly physico-chemical involving hydrolysis to <b>calcium</b> hydroxide and <b>cyanamide,</b> which was then hydrolysed to urea. It was promoted by free H + in the soil and exceeded any possible microbiological action, as application initially caused {{a decrease in the}} soil microflora. The second phase was microbiological; first urea was released. The herbicidal effect was due to the formation of dicyanodiamide and its decomposition products, which were toxic also to most micro-organisms. It formed at high pH (8 - 10) if the topdressing became moist. Nitrification was depressed in concentrations higher than 10 % of total N. But the initial effect perhaps limited the proliferation of pathogens. Apart from killing weeds, it might injure both crop and microflora, if not incorporated into the soil.

Pretransplanting application of 120 kg ha− 1 of N as <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> (120 CC) was compared with a traditional split application of 120 kg ha− 1 of soluble N (120 SN) consisting of 50 % ammonium sulfate applied before transplanting and 50 % as ammonium nitrate applied after transplanting. An unfertilized control (0 -N) was included to calculate NUE indices. At harvest leaf area index, dry weight, fresh yield, dry matter concentration, and NUE indices were not affected by the N source. Leaf nitrate (NO 3 –) content was on average 55 and 41 % higher in Aruba than in Manavert in the first (Exp- 1) and second (Exp- 2) season, respectively. Plants fertilized with 120 CC had lower leaf NO 3 – content (41 and 18 % in Aruba and 70 and 21 % in Manavert in Exp- 1 and Exp- 2, respectively) compared with those fertilized with 120 SN.
