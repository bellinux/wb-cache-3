500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder," [...] a protest widely interpreted as in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests have generated mixed reactions, and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.|$|E

And if necessary we will fill the jail full and we don't care whose toes we step on. I am saying now to these meddlers {{from out of}} our city {{the best thing for}} them to do is stay out if they don't want to get slapped in jail. Our people of Birmingham are a peaceful people and we never have any trouble here unless some people come into our city looking for trouble. And I've never seen anyone yet look for trouble who wasn't able to find it".|$|E
2500|$|Ramsay's {{reputation}} is built upon {{his goal of}} culinary perfection. Since the airing of Boiling Point which followed Ramsay's quest of earning three Michelin stars, the chef has also become infamous for his fiery temper and use of expletives. Ramsay once famously ejected food critic A. A. Gill along with his dining companion, Joan Collins, from his restaurant, leading Gill to state that [...] "Ramsay is a wonderful chef, just a really second-rate human being." [...] Ramsay admitted in his autobiography {{that he did not}} mind if Gill insulted his food, but a personal insult he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for. Ramsay has also had confrontations with his kitchen staff, including one incident that resulted in the pastry chef calling the police. A 2005 interview reported Ramsay had retained 85% of his staff since 1993. Ramsay attributes his management style to the influence of previous mentors, notably chefs Marco Pierre White and Guy Savoy, father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and Jock Wallace, his manager while a footballer at Rangers.|$|E

'YOU'RE <b>not</b> a <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> that!' cried Mr Codlin, {{glancing at}} the clock again and pulling his hair with both hands {{in a kind of}} frenzy, but whether occasioned by his companion's {{observation}} or the tardy pace of Time, it was difficult to determine. 'Here's a world to live in!' ...|$|R

2500|$|In August 2008, Empire of the Sun issued {{their debut}} single, [...] "Walking on a Dream", which peaked at No.10 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, [...] "We Are the People", {{followed}} in September with the parent album released in October. The album reached No.6 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In February 2009, Littlemore told Linda McGee of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) that Empire of the Sun planned to tour in August {{but not as}} a group [...] "this is not a band project. We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up there with guitar, bass, drums and a keyboard player and just play our songs out in a merry Indie kind of way". He described a more theatrical presentation, [...] "I've just finished {{the first draft of}} the script and it's going {{to be more of a}} play, for want of a better term. So at the moment we've got people working in China building inflatable sets and all kinds of things and we're working with some theatre directors in London". However, from April to September that year, Steele could not contact Littlemore. From September Empire of the Sun, without Littlemore, performed live tours of Australia.|$|E

5000|$|Released as Sun 267, {{the record}} reached No. 3 on the Billboard pop chart and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart. The single also hit No. 1 {{on the country}} charts an No. 8 in the UK. Lewis became an instant {{sensation}} and as writer Robert Gordon noted: [...] "Jerry Lee began to show that in this new emerging genre called rock 'n' roll, <b>not</b> everybody was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> there with a guitar." ...|$|R
50|$|Alexander {{wrote in}} his memoir {{that he did not}} shy away from voting with the Liberal {{government}} if an issue warranted his support. As an example, he threatened to break ranks with his own party to vote in favour of anti-hate legislation, saying “screw you” to his party's argument that it would curtail freedom of speech. “Are you saying that you can call my son or daughter a nigger and that is free speech?” he asked during debate on the bill. Heath MacQuarrie, then a Tory MP from Prince Edward Island, stood up and said, “I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let Linc <b>stand</b> alone on this.” Together they led 17 members of their caucus in support of the government’s legislation.|$|R

Only don't expect me to give you any money, don't expect me to help your struggling family, don't expect me to alter my arrangements because of you. Let's keep apart for a bit and you go your way and I'll go mine. And we'll see who's sick of it first, we'll see who wants to cry off." ...|$|R

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Amanda Sloane Murray from IGN gave the season a lukewarm review saying [...] "So maybe this season didn't have the funniest jokes or the freshest {{material}} to work with. On the whole, it's <b>not</b> one that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> {{out in our}} minds {{as one of the}} best seasons in the How I Met Your Mother canon; most of us are eager to forget Robin and Barney ever happened, Robin's co-anchor Don was switched up from funny guy to boring straight man and eventually discarded; nobody made significant strides in their career or their love life. Yet at the end of the day, a few loose ends suggest tantalizing possibilities for next season: Ted is now in possession of a house, while Marshall and Lily have decided to get pregnant. Our group is back together, unfettered by relationships inside or outside the inner circle, and we're happy to have it that way." ...|$|R
500|$|Juliet {{explains}} that Ethan kept {{a stash of}} the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing they are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> budge, she <b>stands</b> up <b>to</b> them and says she finds it interesting {{that they are the}} camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he {{will not be able to}} protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|R
