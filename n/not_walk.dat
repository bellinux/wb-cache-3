5|$|Cicadas, {{unlike other}} Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight. However, they do <b>not</b> <b>walk</b> or run well, and {{take to the}} wing to travel {{distances}} greater than a few centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E
5|$|Then, on September 7 he {{came within}} four outs of {{perfection}} when Milwaukee Brewers' Gabe Kapler hit a one-out {{home run in}} the eighth inning. He allowed two hits, did <b>not</b> <b>walk</b> a batter and struck out five, en route to 10–1 victory at Milwaukee's Miller Park. Young did not get his first perfect game or first no-hitter, but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts. Two starts later he hit his first home run as a major league batter.|$|E
5|$|Ball {{then took}} leave in England. His feats in France had {{received}} considerable publicity. He {{was the first}} British ace to become a household name, and found that his celebrity was such that he could <b>not</b> <b>walk</b> down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to {{the policy of the}} French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball's achievements {{had a profound impact on}} budding flyer Mick Mannock, who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Young lost {{a no-hitter}} {{with two outs}} {{in the ninth inning}} when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did <b>not</b> <b>walk</b> a batter, the Spiders {{committed}} four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will <b>not</b> <b>walk</b> in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2010, Weber {{was named}} the fifth captain in Nashville Predators history, {{replacing}} Jason Arnott, who {{was traded to the}} New Jersey Devils. He became the youngest captain in franchise history and the only Predators captain to have been drafted by the team. On January 11, 2011, Weber was among 42 players named to the 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game in Raleigh, North Carolina. For {{the first time in its}} history, the NHL used a fantasy draft format to select teams for the All-Star Game, and Weber was selected eighth overall by Team Lidstrom. At the game, Weber recorded four assists and was a +6, finishing the game tied with Loui Eriksson for most points and second to Nicklas Lidström for best plus/minus. Shortly after his All-Star Game appearance, Weber recorded his 200th career NHL pointan assistin a game versus the Detroit Red Wings on February 9, 2011. During his sixth season with the Predators Weber averaged 25:19 in ice time, and set career highs in games played (82), assists (32) and shots on goal (25). Weber also contributed three goals and five points in 12 playoff games as the Predators lost to the Vancouver Canucks after advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals for the first time in their history. At the conclusion of the regular season, Weber was named one of three finalistsalong with Zdeno Chára and Nicklas Lidströmfor the Norris Trophy, the first finalist nomination of his career. He finished second in Norris Trophy voting, losing with 727 voting points to Lidström's 736. Weber also finished 25th in Hart Memorial Trophy voting with two fifth-place votes. For the first time in his career, Weber was voted to the NHL First All-Star Team after receiving 445 voting points, second among defencemen to Lidström's 464. On July 1, 2011, Weber became a restricted free agent; despite this, Weber had stated he wanted to remain with the Predators. To prevent the possibility of other teams signing him to an offer sheet, the Predators filed for salary arbitration with Weber, giving the team and Weber until their hearing to negotiate a new contract. Failing to come to terms on a new contract by their hearing, Weber's case went to arbitration on August 2 – the first time in NHL history that a team-elected arbitration candidate had reached a hearing. The following day, he was awarded a one-year, $7.5 million contract, from which the Predators could <b>not</b> <b>walk</b> away, as they, and not Weber, had elected arbitration.|$|E
60|$|Mr and Mrs Lammle {{have walked}} {{for some time}} on the Shanklin sands, and one may see by their {{footprints}} that they have <b>not</b> <b>walked</b> arm in arm, {{and that they have}} <b>not</b> <b>walked</b> in a straight track, and that they have walked in a moody humour; for, the lady has prodded little spirting holes in the damp sand before her with her parasol, and the gentleman has trailed his stick after him.

25|$|Peek did <b>not</b> <b>walk</b> {{until he}} was four years old, {{and then in a}} sidelong manner.

25|$|Five days later, on 5 December 1645 {{a second}} {{earthquake}} occurred, {{said to be}} of the same magnitude as the first.
