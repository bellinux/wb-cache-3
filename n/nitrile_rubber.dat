A significantly different mechanism of degradation was found for {{the two types of}} radiation. The results obtained by ESR, FTIR and measurements of soluble fractions of irradiated samples, indicated that the acrylonitrile units of the <b>nitrile</b> <b>rubbers</b> are more sensitive units to gamma-radiation, with the effects of irradiation increasing with the acrylonitrile content. The reactions observed were consumption of double bonds, crosslinking, and cyclization with the formation of conjugated double bonds. No chain-scission reactions were detected. In contrast to gamma-irradiation, the effects of photolysis were centred at the butadiene units, and increases in the acrylonitrile content resulted in a proportional decrease in the sensitivity of the copolymers. Crosslinking and chain scission were identified as the main effects of photolysis of NBR rubbers. (C) 1999 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
25|$|Polymer {{oxidation}} {{has caused}} accidents involving medical devices. One {{of the oldest}} known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and <b>nitrile</b> <b>rubber.</b> They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E
25|$|Gloves {{protect and}} comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, {{abrasion}} or chemicals, and disease; or {{in turn to}} provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. Latex, <b>nitrile</b> <b>rubber</b> or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.|$|E
25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, <b>nitrile</b> <b>rubber,</b> and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E

The external surface of gloves was treated with concentrated insecticides for one minute and diluted and concentrated insecticides for 24, 36 and 48 hours and later examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|A highly {{selective}} photo-induced nitrile imine mediated tetrazole-ene coupling (NITEC) of chain-end-functionalized nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) is reported, providing <b>nitrile</b> <b>rubbers</b> with molar masses {{of up to}} 48 000 g·mol- 1. NBR was obtained via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) mediated copolymerization of acrylonitrile and 1, 3 -butadiene employing a novel photoreactive tetrazole-functionalized trithiocarbonate. The herein reported tetrazole-functionalized trithiocarbonate represents - {{to the best of}} our knowledge - the first ever reported photoreactive RAFT agent capable of undergoing light-induced ligations with enes. Molar masses of the tetrazole-functionalized NBRs were in the range of 1000 to 38 000 g·mol- 1 with dispersities between 1. 1 to 1. 6. By an appropriate choice of the tetrazole substituents, a reaction of the in situ formed enophile with the double bonds or the nitrile moieties of the incorporated monomer units within the polymer backbone - present in high excess relative to the dipolarophile linker molecule - was not observed. Underpinned by DFT calculations, the selectivity was identified to originate from a reduced LUMO energy level of the maleimide linker compared to the nonactivated backbone olefins when employing a nitrile-imine of moderate reactivity. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{compatibility}} of {{the properties}} of elastomer with conventional diesel fuel has made it favourable in many engineering applications. However, due to global energy insecurity issues, there is an urgent need to find alternative {{renewable sources of energy}} as replacements to conventional diesel. In this respect, biodiesel appears to be a promising candidate. Hence, research into the compatibility and fatigue characteristics of elastomers exposed to biodiesel becomes essential. The present paper introduces the first attempt to investigate the effect of different solvents on the fatigue of swollen elastomers. The filled <b>nitrile</b> <b>rubbers</b> are immersed in the palm biodiesel and conventional diesel to obtain the same degree of swelling prior to the application of uniaxial fatigue loading. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) analysis is carried out to observe the fracture surfaces. Stretch-N curves are plotted to illustrate the fatigue life duration. These curves showed that the fatigue lifetime of rubber is the longest for dry rubber and the least for rubber swollen in biodiesel. FESEM micrographs reveal that the loading conditions have no effect on the crack initiation and propagation patterns regardless of the swelling state. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) for the characterization of viscoelastic behaviour of rubbers. The relaxation behaviour of the rubbers following a dynamic loading event is characterised using the dynamic VFM in which full-field (two dimensional) strain and acceleration data, obtained from high-speed imaging, are analysed by the principle of virtual work without traction force data, instead using the acceleration fields in the specimen to provide stress information. Two (silicone and <b>nitrile)</b> <b>rubbers</b> were tested in tension using a drop-weight apparatus. It is assumed that the dynamic behaviour is described by the combination of hyperelastic and Prony series models. A VFM based procedure is designed and used to produce the identification of the modulus term of a hyperelastic model and the Prony series parameters within a time scale determined by two experimental factors: imaging speed and loading duration. Then, the time range of the data is extended using experiments at different temperatures combined with the time-temperature superposition principle. Prior to these experimental analyses, finite element simulations were performed to validate {{the application of the}} proposed VFM analysis. Therefore, for the first time, it has been possible to identify relaxation behaviour of a material following dynamic loading, using a technique that can be applied to both small and large deformations...|$|R
