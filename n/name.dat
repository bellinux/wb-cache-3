The analysis of proper <b>names</b> material was based on the meaning and formal <b>names</b> classification which allowed to separate the topographic <b>names</b> (Białobrzegi, Babi Dół), the cultural <b>names</b> (Baraki, Hubala housing estate), the possessive <b>names</b> (Cekanów), the ethnic <b>names</b> (Nagórzyce), the family <b>names</b> (Rawitów), the patronymic <b>names</b> (Starzyce), the relational <b>names</b> (Karpaty, Nowy Port) and the double meaning <b>names</b> (Gustek, Piekło). In each of the types one tried to separate the motivated <b>names</b> and unmoti vated <b>names,</b> and synthetic <b>names</b> and analytic <b>names,</b> if they occurred. The most popular types of urbanonyms which occurred in the discussed area are the relational, topographic and cultural <b>names.</b> The application of semantic classification allowed to emphasise the relation between toponyms and land configuration, material and spiritual culture of the society of this region. Just like in the example of other cities the oldest group of city <b>names</b> of Tomaszów Mazowiecki are the district <b>names</b> which at the beginning had been the <b>names</b> of the villages and hamlets.
