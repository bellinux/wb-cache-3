A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an <b>underground</b> <b>burst.</b> Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred.|$|R

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the characteristics of extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic pulse (EMW) phenomena from <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> and chemical explosions and from surface chemical explosions {{as they may be}} applied in an On-Site Inspection (OSI) context under a Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The principal application of these phenomena is for discrimination among underground chemical explosions, <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> explosions, and earthquakes. <b>Underground</b> chemical and <b>nuclear</b> explosions both generate low-frequency EMP signals (about 1 Hz) that are observable within several kilometers of ground zero. During this fiscal year we have been gathering data from explosions of opportunity to see if ELF EMP signals are observable from large ripple-fired blasts and from smaller dedicated explosions such as those occurring at the NTS. In addition, we are continuing to review data from the Henderson Mine deployment that took place during FY 94 and data from previous <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> tests including Hunter`s Trophy and past <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> tests have been analyzed and we here make estimates of the properties of the EMP ftom <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> ard chemical explosions, including detectability, dependence on yield, and dependence on distance from the source. Data from the Henderson Mine provide information about detection of EMP from typical moderate size underground chemical explosions in hard rock and problems related to detection of EMP in a mine environment located at high elevations. Data from the Carlin Mine site provide information about EMP from surface ripple-fired chemical explosions and detection in an open-pit mine environment. Data from the Kuchen experiment at NTS provide additional data about small underground chemical explosions in a setting similar to that for <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> tests at the NTS...|$|R

40|$|A {{database}} {{with information}} on about 500 cases of atmospheric radioactivity releases from <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> tests is analysed. The data are statistically evaluated and systematically aggregated in order to characterise prompt uncontrolled as well as delayed operational releases of radioactivity into the atmosphere. The focus is put on the latter. The reported data compare well with theoretically derived xenon activities for reasonable nuclear test scenarios. Conclusions are drawn on the main features of releases that can be expected from <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> tests {{as a function of}} release time. These findings are relevant for developing and validating methods to be applied in global monitoring of atmospheric radioactivity with respect to indications of an <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> explosion.
