Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having {{finished second in the}} league the previous season. Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper. The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.|$|E

According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, Valhalla [...] "is well known because it plays so large a part in images of warfare and death," [...] yet the significance of other halls in Norse mythology such as Ýdalir, where the god Ullr dwells, and Freyja's Fólkvangr have been lost.|$|E

As groundwater seeped into cracks in the marble, it eventually dissolved enough rock to expand some of the cracks {{to the size of}} tunnels. Generally, the age of a cave cannot be determined directly because the cave itself is an empty space, but scientists can sometimes determine the age of speleothems or sediments in a cave. An early 21st-century study of speleothem development in Oregon Caves focused on the past 380,000 years. Based on the available evidence, the cave is thought to be at least a million years old and [...] "probably <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> a few million" [...] years.|$|E

At that time Ouseley was Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University and had recently become vicar of St Michael's College {{on the outskirts of}} Tenbury Wells, a choir school with a church that he had founded and endowed and which was intended to {{serve as a model for}} Anglican church music. Although <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> they were, Stainer was in charge of the choir and choristers, and one of his duties was to give piano lessons to the boys for two hours a day. Ouseley was an antiquarian and had an extensive library. He was much interested in the history of music and acted as Stainer's mentor. Under his guidance, Stainer became the youngest ever successful candidate for the Bachelor of Music degree at Oxford. For this, Stainer wrote a cantata, [...] "Praise the Lord, O my soul", with text from Psalm 103. Its traditional style was designed to appeal to the examining board and sounds stilted when set against his later works. About this time he wrote several anthems, the most successful of which was [...] "I saw the Lord", a bolder and more original work in a more contemporary style.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the authorship}} of the Mahābhārata is {{attributed}} to Vyāsa. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. The oldest preserved parts of the text {{are thought to be}} <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> around 400BCE, though the origins of the epic probably fall between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE. The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c. 4th century CE). The title may be translated as [...] "the great tale of the Bhārata dynasty". According to the Mahābhārata itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply Bhārata.|$|E

The court did not seek evidence to assess the merit of the age-discrimination claim...The rule undoubtedly disadvantaged Murnaghan, but the court's response exalted her and another child above a national policy, suggesting either failure to recognize that preferential treatment for some recipients will adversely affect others (who may <b>not</b> be <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> 12) or that the court considered these 2 children's lives more valuable than others’.

I refer to the universal modern talk about young nations and new nations; about America being young, about New Zealand being new. The whole thing is a trick of words.

I could never deny, in looking back upon what followed, that I was eminently stockish; and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have so long a patience with me. The aunt indeed sat close at her embroidery, only looking now and again and smiling; but the misses, and especially the eldest, who was besides the most handsome, paid me a score of attentions which I was very ill able to repay. It was all in vain to tell myself I was a young fellow of some worth {{as well as a}} good estate, and had no call to feel abashed before these lasses, the eldest <b>not</b> so <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> myself, and no one of them by any probability half as learned.

The bad habits of Emerson Eames were to sit up all night and to be a student of Schopenhauer. Personally, he was a lean, lounging sort of man, with a blond pointed beard, <b>not</b> so very <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> his pupil Smith in the matter of mere years, but older by centuries in the two essential respects of having a European reputation and a bald head.|$|R
50|$|One {{problem is}} that hard disk drive {{capacities}} have increased substantially, but their error rates remain unchanged. The data corruption rate has always been roughly constant in time, meaning that modern disks are <b>not</b> <b>much</b> safer <b>than</b> <b>old</b> disks. In old disks the probability of data corruption was very small because they stored tiny amounts of data. In modern disks the probability is much larger because they store much more data, whilst not being safer. That way, silent data corruption {{has not been a}} serious concern while storage devices remained relatively small and slow. Hence, the users of small disks very rarely faced silent corruption, so the data corruption was not considered a problem that required a solution. But in modern times and with the advent of larger drives and very fast RAID setups, users are capable of transferring 1016 bits in a reasonably short time, thus easily reaching the data corruption thresholds.|$|R
500|$|In 1936 London Films {{released}} Things to Come, {{in which}} Richardson played the swaggering warlord [...] "The Boss". His performance parodied the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini so effectively {{that the film}} was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was Alexander Korda; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, [...] "Though <b>not</b> so very <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> I am, I regarded {{him in a way}} as a father, and to me he was as generous as a prince." [...] In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, Bees on the Boatdeck. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August of the same year he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in Barré Lyndon's comedy thriller, The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse, which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.|$|R

40|$|Cores {{were taken}} below 66 m {{of water from}} {{lacustrine}} deposits of the extinct basaltic maar named "Gour de Tazenat", Chaîne des Puys, Massif Central, France. Those cores allowed us to describe the environmental changes in the northern Chaîne des Puys (France) from the early Late Glacial to the present time. Geomorphological evolution of the catchment, along with the sedimentological investigations of lacustrine deposits are described. This shows that the only inlet of the lake has formed a delta; the volume of deltaic sediment is almost equal to {{the volume of the}} dell eroded by the post-eruptive backward erosion of the inlet. Since the delta is little developped, the lake (and the end of the eruption) should <b>not</b> be <b>much</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> Upper Weichselian in spite of TL-dates obtained on quartz grains from the adjacent tufiQ-ing and going back te about 120 ka. This paper deals also with sedimentological analyses of a 10 m long core that was taken in the muddy deposits of the flat bottom of the lake. That sequence corresponds to a period running from the early Late Glacial to the present time. The overall variations of clay-, water, organic matter contents and percentage of tree pollen throughout the core are correlated with each other. A thin tephra bed (volcanic ash-falls) was also found and linked with the Pavin volcano based upon trachytic composition of glass shards, along with the stratigraphical position within the Atlantic. That finding allowed us to enlarge the northern fan of the Pavin tephra over the entire Chaîne des Puys. New results of pollen analyses of the Atlantic to present time period shows the obvious development of Fagus (up to 50 % of pollen sum). Later on, two phases of human deforestation are clearly recorded and attributed respectively to Neolithic then Celtic and subsequent populations; those two phases are separeted by a period of natural reforestation. Five sandy layers are interbedded in the Subboreal to Subatlantic mud; they should have anthropogene origine. The pollen analysis of the Late glacial to Boreal sequence was published elsewhere (Juvigné and Bastin, 199 S). Nevertheless the main relevant results are summarized in this paper: Middle Dryas is particularly well recorded and the Late Dryas can be subdivided in three cold sub-oscillations. The same sequence contains two tephra beds: one is mugearitic within the Altered palynozone and dated at 10, 280 yr BP and; the other is trachytic within the Boreal and dated at about 8220 yr BP. Des carottes de sédiments lacustres ont été extraites du Gour de Tazenat. Un diagramme pollinique montre l'évolution naturelle de la végétation depuis l'Atlantique, ainsi que l'impact de deux phases de défrichements anthropiques. Dans l'ensemble, les variations des parts d'argile, d'eau et de matières organiques sont en corrélation positive depuis le Tardiglaciaire.
