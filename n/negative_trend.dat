5|$|The California punk {{scene was}} in full swing by early 1977. In Los Angeles, there were the Weirdos, the Zeros, Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the Germs, X, the Dickies, Bags, and the {{relocated}} Tupperwares, now dubbed the Screamers. San Francisco's second wave included the Avengers, <b>Negative</b> <b>Trend,</b> the Mutants, and the Sleepers. the Dils, from Carlsbad, moved between the two major cities. The Wipers formed in Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, there was the Lewd. Often sharing gigs with the Seattle punks were bands from across the Canada–US border. A major scene developed in Vancouver, spearheaded by the Furies and Victoria's all-female Dee Dee and the Dishrags. the Skulls spun off into D.O.A. and the Subhumans. The K-Tels (later known as the Young Canadians) and Pointed Sticks were among the area's other leading punk acts.|$|E

This trend has been observed in all sectors of the larger economies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. Mexico is a notable exception, having recorded a slight increase. Some of the decrease may be attributed to women transferring to agricultural sciences in these countries. Another <b>negative</b> <b>trend</b> is the drop in female doctoral students and in the labour force. Of those countries reporting data, the majority signal a significant drop of 10–20 percentage points in the transition from master’s to doctoral graduates.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Robin Olds was the {{commander}} of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and an experienced fighter pilot who had become a double ace in two tours over Europe during World War II. He was sent to Southeast Asia to revive the performance of the 8th TFW and he did so from the cockpit. Five days after he arrived at Ubon, the 8th TFW lost an F-4C to an air-to-air missile shot from a MiG-21, the first such loss in the war. This followed two other F-4 losses to MiGs in the two weeks prior to Olds taking command - equal to the number of F-4s lost in the previous 12 years. Olds was upset by the sudden <b>negative</b> <b>trend,</b> but was also convinced that his pilots could take on the MiG-21 and prevail if the MiGs could be drawn into the air on even terms. His idea for Operation Bolo was relatively simple: Make the agile Phantom II look like the cumbersome bomb-laden F-105 and lure the MiGs into a sustained dogfight that depleted the MiG-21s of their relatively small fuel load and flight time.|$|E

500|$|The {{removal of}} Khrushchev in 1964 signalled {{the end of}} his [...] "housing revolution". Housing {{construction}} declined between 1960 and 1964 to an average of 1.63 million square metres. Following this sudden decrease, housing construction increased sharply between 1965 and 1966, but dropped again, and then steadily grew (the average annual growth rate was 4.26 million square metres). This came largely at the expense of businesses. While the housing shortage was never fully resolved, and still remains a problem in present-day Russia, the reform overcame the <b>negative</b> <b>trend</b> and renewed the growth of housing construction.|$|E
500|$|As {{hardcore}} {{became the}} dominant punk rock style, many bands {{of the older}} California punk rock movement split up. Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between [...] "classic" [...] punk, post-punk, and hardcore, San Francisco's Flipper was founded in 1979 by former members of <b>Negative</b> <b>Trend</b> and the Sleepers. They became [...] "the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years".|$|E
500|$|Two {{professors at}} the Goizueta Business School at Emory University {{summarized}} their research in a New York Times editorial. They found that studies of college {{teams that have}} changed their names and mascots indicate that doing so has a long-term financial benefit. While vocal opponents of change often threatened withdrawal of support, this never materialized. There have been no name changes by professional teams, though a comparison of NFL teams shows the highest <b>negative</b> <b>trend</b> in brand equity affects the Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs, calling into question the business logic of retaining Native American names or logos that are offensive to even a minority. In a commentary for Forbes, Tom Van Riper states that research specifically considering the fan loyalty and traditions of the team indicates {{that the value of}} the name as a brand is significant, and unlikely to change for business reasons. An alternative opinion is that the team would benefit from a re-branding, but any new name would need to be carefully selected. In 2014 sales of Redskins merchandise declined 35% from the prior year. [...] "People are having a second thoughts about wearing a T-shirt with the logo or name that it has now been called racist," [...] said Matt Powell, senior analyst for SportsSourceOne. A team spokesman attributed the decline to dismal performance in the 2013 season, but other teams with bad records have not seen such a steep decline in sales. Corporate sponsors have either made no public response to media inquiries regarding the name or stated that they play no role in the decision, and defer to the team and the NFL. Despite the name controversy, the value of the team has risen $700 million to $2.4 billion (40%), making them the third most valuable franchise in the NFL, based upon the valuations published by Forbes magazine in 2014 and 2015.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{important}} effects on earth environment and human life. Therefor, investigation and study {{of climate change}} is very essential. This study investigated rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and wind variability by analyzing data for annual and monthly climatic factors collected at 13 synoptic stations (industrial cities of Iran) by using Mann-Kendall test. The results of monthly rainfall trends showed that most of synoptic stations have significant positive and <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> in winter and spring months. About 23 % and 1. 7 % of stations have significant <b>negative</b> and positive <b>trends,</b> respectively, in annual trend of this factor. The results of monthly number of rainy days showed the major number of significant trends occurs in spring. In autumn (September, October and November) like as summer most of the stations have no significant trends. Analyzing the annual number of rainy days trends also showed that 4 stations have significant positive trends and 2 stations <b>negative</b> <b>trends.</b> Trend of greatest daily precipitation is low throughout the year, so there is not any significant trend in winter. Annual investigations confirm the seasonal investigations. The major number of significant trends in monthly mean maximum temperature occurs in summer but there are not any significant trends in winter and March. The trend of mean minimum temperature is approximately high {{in all of the}} seasons and the major number of significant trends occurs in summer and autumn and then in spring and ultimately in winter. In annual investigation, most of the stations showed positive trends and only Oroomieh station has <b>negative</b> <b>trends.</b> Trend of mean temperature is high except for winter. Most of the stations showed positive trend, indicating increasing trends in this factor. Annual studies vertify the positive trends and about 63 % of stations have significant positive trends...|$|R
40|$|We use {{a series}} of {{chemical}} transport model and chemistry climate model simulations to investigate the observed <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> in MOPITT CO over several regions of the world, and to examine the consistency of timedependent emission inventories with observations. We find that simulations driven by the MACCity inventory, used for the Chemistry Climate Modeling Initiative (CCMI), reproduce the <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> in the CO column observed by MOPITT for 2000 - 2010 over the eastern United States and Europe. However, the simulations have positive trends over eastern China, {{in contrast to the}} <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> observed by MOPITT. The model bias in CO, after applying MOPITT averaging kernels, contributes to the model-observation discrepancy in the trend over eastern China. This demonstrates that biases in a model's average concentrations can influence the interpretation of the temporal trend compared to satellite observations. The total ozone column plays a role in determining the simulated tropospheric CO trends. A large positive anomaly in the simulated total ozone column in 2010 leads to a negative anomaly in OH and hence a positive anomaly in CO, contributing to the positive trend in simulated CO. These results demonstrate that accurately simulating variability in the ozone column is important for simulating and interpreting trends in CO...|$|R

40|$|Aiming {{to improve}} the {{knowledge}} of droughts in Europe, three indices related to dry spells, DS, regime have been analysed: the number of DS per year, N; the longest annual DS, L-max; and the mean DS length per year, L, for different daily rainfall thresholds (0. 1, 1. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mm/day) at annual and seasonal scales. The database consists of daily records from 267 rain gauges, along the years 1951 - 2000. First, the mean values at annual and seasonal scales of these three indices are represented for the four thresholds. For 0. 1 and 1. 0 mm/day, spatial patterns suggest a strong N-S gradient for latitudes south of 45 degrees N, especially at annual scale and in summer season. For 5. 0 and 10. 0 mm/day, the patterns are different, with a strong gradient in the Scandinavian Peninsula and the largest L-max and L at NE Europe, except for summer. Second, a principal component analysis, PCA, {{is applied to the}} 60 variables (three indices at five time scales and four thresholds) characterising the DS regime of every gauge. A clustering process leads to a classification of the 267 rain gauges into 20 spatial clusters, on the basis of five selected principal components replacing the original variables. Most of clusters are spatially coherent, with greater spatial variability on DS regimes towards the south and west than to the north and east of Europe. And third, time trends on the three indices are quantified by the Kendall-tau algorithm, and statistical significances at 95 % confidence level are assessed by the Mann-Kendall test. For all thresholds and seasons, there is a clear predominance of significant <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> for N. Specifically, the highest number of rain gauges with significant <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> corresponds to summer and winter, with average percentages from - 2. 7 to - 8. 1 % per decade. In summer, significant <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> are observed in Western Europe at 40 degrees- 60 degrees N and between 10 degrees W and 20 degrees E. In annual and winter periods, <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> are detected also at Western Europe for 0. 1 and 1. 0 mm/day and at latitudes south of 45 degrees N for the two highest thresholds. Spring, and especially autumn, are characterised by a low number of <b>negative</b> <b>trends,</b> particularly for 1. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mm/day. In summer, L-max depicts remarkable positive trends in Western Europe, at 40 degrees N- 60 degrees N and between 0 degrees E and 20 degrees E, with high average values close to + 10 % per decade. Positive trends on L are dominant at annual scale and winter for 0. 1 mm/day, and in summer for 0. 1 and 1. 0 mm/day, with average trends ranging from + 4. 8 to + 8. 1 % per decade. Spring and autumn are characterised by numerous <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> on L for all thresholds. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Monthly {{precipitation}} {{and temperature}} trends of 160 stations in China from 1951 - 2002 have been analysed and interpolated. The Mann-Kendall trend test {{was applied to}} examine the monthly precipitation data. Significant positive and <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> at the 90, 95 and 99 % confidence levels were detected for numerous stations. The number, distribution {{and direction of the}} trends varied from month to month. The detected trends were spatially interpolated by applying the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. The spatial illustration of the detected precipitation and temperature trends enables a better understanding of climatic changes or variations in China within the last 50 years. This counts especially for the spatial structure of the trends. An agglomeration of precipitation trends can be observed in certain months including distinct trend belts especially in east and north-east China. Nevertheless, positive as well as <b>negative</b> <b>trends</b> can be noted simultaneously in each month. <b>Negative</b> precipitation <b>trends</b> are often followed by positive trends for the same area during the next month.
