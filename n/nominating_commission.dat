5|$|Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution {{governs the}} term length of Supreme Court Justices. When {{there is a}} vacancy on the Court, a new justice is {{nominated}} using {{a variation of the}} Missouri Plan. First, the Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor. The governor then selects the new Justice from the list. If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days, the chief justice or the acting chief justice must do so. The Judicial Nomination Commission Chief Justice selects the chief justice from the sitting associate justices for a five-year term. The chief justice presides over the Court. When the position of chief justice becomes vacant, the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting chief justice until a new one is chosen by the Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission.</b> The chief justice also serves as chairman of the Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> is {{responsible}} for recruiting and interviewing applicants to fill vacancies on the Indiana Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court. It then sends three nominees for each vacancy to the governor. The Judicial Qualification Commission investigates complaints of judicial misconduct and files charges where appropriate. Both commissions have the same members and are chaired by the chief justice.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma's {{judicial}} branch {{consists of}} the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and 77 District Courts that each serve one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of Impeachment and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (this split system exists only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas). Judges of those two courts, {{as well as the}} Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission,</b> and are subject to a non-partisan retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed the Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the lower courts. Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court.|$|E
50|$|The powers, size, role, {{and makeup}} of {{judicial}} <b>nominating</b> <b>commissions</b> vary widely {{from state to}} state. Some commissions only make recommendations for appellate courts (the state supreme court and any intermediate appellate courts). Others make recommendations for trial court judge appointments as well.|$|R
50|$|Judicial <b>nominating</b> <b>commissions</b> {{are often}} {{established}} by the state constitution as part of merit selection plans. They {{are designed to be}} independent bodies. A common procedure is for the commission to receive applications for that position and forward three names to the governor, who has some number of days (often 60) to select one.|$|R
50|$|The Florida Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commissions</b> are 26 {{separately}} constituted {{bodies responsible}} for providing the governor of Florida {{with a list of}} possible appointments to the various state courts (the Florida Supreme Court, the five Florida District Courts of Appeal, and the twenty Florida Circuit Courts). These commissions are required under Article V of the Florida Constitution.|$|R

25|$|The {{governor}} {{plays an}} active role within the judicial branch of Oklahoma government. Oklahoma has a Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> consisting of thirteen members that review all potential justices and judges of Oklahoma's appellate courts, such as the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and review them {{to determine if they}} qualify to hold their respective positions. Of these thirteen members, the governor appoints six without the consent of the Oklahoma Legislature. The governor's appointments serve for a term of six years each; the terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the appointments become vacant every two years.|$|E

500|$|In 2008 the Court {{consisted}} of one chief justice and four associate justices, the constitutional minimum; however, the Indiana General Assembly {{may increase the}} number of associate justices to a maximum of eight for a total of nine court justices. A board of five commissioners assists the Court in its administrative duties. Commissioners are nominated by the Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> and appointed by the [...] governor. The Court offices and chambers are located on the third floor in the north wing of the Indiana Statehouse. The Court maintains a large legal library on the third floor that is open to the public.|$|E
500|$|Eligibility {{requirements}} {{to be nominated}} as a justice of the Supreme Court are established in Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution. The candidate must be {{a citizen of the}} United States and reside within the state of Indiana before being considered for the office. The candidate must also have been admitted to the practice of law in Indiana for at least ten years prior to their candidacy or must have served as a judge of a circuit, superior, or criminal court of Indiana for five years. The candidate cannot be under an indictment in any court in the United States with a crime punishable as a felony. The Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> must also ensure that they are the [...] "most highly qualified public candidates" [...] available.|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} was passed under popular governors that also increased their powers. The state courts were again made appointive, but selection of the candidates was granted to the court-dominated Indiana Judicial <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission.</b> However, the governor was given {{more control over the}} process in which he previously had none. Another amendment removed the ban on consecutive terms, allowing Indiana's first consecutive term governors in over one hundred years. A third amendment granted the power to prepare a budget to a State Budgetary Agency, which was run by officials appointed by the governor. The significant authority this gave the governor over the budget was the [...] "greatest transfer of power" [...] to the governor yet, according to historian and professor of political science Linda Gugin.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the checks}} and {{balances}} of the judicial branch with the legislative and executive branches, {{it is difficult to}} remove a Justice. Usually a Justice either dies, retires by choice, or retires after surpassing the state age limit of 75. A Justice may be removed by impeachment and conviction as specified in Article 3 of the [...] Justices can also be forced to retire upon certification to the governor after a hearing by the Supreme Court <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission</b> that the Justice is so incapacitated as to be unable to perform the duties of the office.|$|E
2500|$|Some in {{the mass}} media derided the {{convention}} as having gone out of control, but the primary public reaction was one of apathy. The primary controversy within the convention once it began its actual work, as opposed to its early difficulties, was over a judicial amendment that would have made the state attorney general an office elected by statewide popular vote rather than retaining selection by the Supreme Court, and it would have also eliminated the requirement for the Supreme Court to meet in Knoxville and Jackson, where a new and elaborate building for it had just been completed. Another important provision of the proposed amendment was to repeal the 1870 Constitution’s requirement that all judges [...] "shall be elected" [...] in favor of a provision stating that [...] "Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals shall be appointed by the Governor from three nominees recommended... by the Appellate Court <b>Nominating</b> <b>Commission....</b> The name of each justice and judge seeking retention shall be submitted to the qualified voters for retention or rejection... at the expiration of each six year term." ...|$|E
