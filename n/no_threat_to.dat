5|$|The 1939 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{ran through the}} summer and fall of 1939. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes was extremely unreliable. Most east Pacific storms were of <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> land. However, 1939 saw a large number of storms threaten California.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} in which the air strikes were conducted, a force of 25 Wildcat and Supermarine Seafire fighters from 801, 842 and 880 Naval Air Squadrons {{provided}} air defence for the Home Fleet. Nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers, which were also operated by 842 Naval Air Squadron, conducted anti-submarine patrols. <b>No</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the fleet developed, and Corsairs took over air defence duties {{at the conclusion of the}} two attacks.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the terns.|$|E

5|$|The 1953 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active season on record. The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit {{the time of year}} when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> land.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Angry at his {{treatment}} by the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means of}} pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated {{into a state of}} torpor, assisted by tranquilisers, and for a while presented <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Thorpe.|$|E

5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} sewer system and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State Board of Health {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The Whiskers' new {{neighbours}} {{were the}} Zappa and the Starsky. Although {{smaller than the}} Whiskers, the Zappa attacked frequently, and when they fled after one attack, the Whiskers – in a rare occurrence – adopted an abandoned Zappa pup. The Starsky group, on the other hand, was <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Whiskers. Formed by a trio of Flower's daughters permanently evicted from the Whiskers, the small group was ravaged by illness, predators, {{and a lack of}} new pups. The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode, with the death of the last survivor, Mozart, who was killed by a jackal. Former Whiskers female Maybelline broke away from the group {{at the end of the}} third series, forming a new group called the Aztecs which became the Whiskers' rivals in the fourth series.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. They {{are among the}} first insects {{to be found in}} burnt-off areas after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain presents <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> colonies {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap-sucking insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal, scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>no</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> {{this species}} are identified, Nymphargus armatus is {{classified}} as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] because it is known from only a single location.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{collected}} on low vegetation {{and in a}} small cave in montane tepui forest. It is nocturnal. <b>No</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> this species are known.|$|R
50|$|This {{species can}} attain locally high densities, but its known range is very restricted. <b>No</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> {{it have been}} identified. The species' range {{overlaps}} {{with the edge of}} Wandamen Nature Reserve.|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} warnings for Guadeloupe on August 2 and {{the rest}} of the Leeward Islands extending to the Virgin Islands. The uncertainty of the hurricanes forecast track forced residents and tourists in the Lesser Antilles to evacuate. In the British Virgin Islands, 80 American and Canadian tourists evacuated to hotels. In Puerto Rico, residents were advised to secure or stow away loose objects and stock up on emergency supplies. 1.1million residents in the city of San Juan went to supermarkets to get much needed supplies in anticipation that the storm might hit Puerto Rico. In Humacao, the National Guard evacuated 1,966 people living along a coastal highway. The islands of Martinique and Dominica were placed under a hurricane watch. The warning for Guadeloupe was discontinued at 2200 UTC when the hurricane posed <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the island. Simultaneously, the hurricane watches in effect for Martinique and Dominica were also discontinued. As Dean continued westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands. The watch was soon canceled as Dean made its northward turn towards Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall {{to parts of}} Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E

500|$|The 2009 IUCN Red List {{assessed}} the conservation status of Oryzomys dimidiatus as [...] "Least Concern", noting that its distribution may {{be larger than}} currently known. Its population is presumed to be large and <b>no</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> its habitat are known.|$|R
5000|$|This species {{occurs in}} jungles rich with fresh water and rivers. It {{also can be}} found in {{agriculture}} or farming zones, for example, cashew and coconut farms, brushy regions, and logged-over areas. [...] <b>No</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> this species are known.|$|R
25|$|Under the Berne Convention {{wolves in}} France {{are listed as}} an {{endangered}} species, and killing them is illegal, though official culls are permitted to protect farm animals {{as long as there}} is <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the species in its entirety.|$|E
25|$|Book {{clubs are}} almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche {{publishers}} pursue a mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets — their output is insignificant {{to the major}} booksellers, so lost revenue poses <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing, publishing, distribution, and retail.|$|E

25|$|I saw the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> us whatsoever! Now I {{just wanted to}} level out of my turning bank, since my colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. Once again, I saw the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Protestant missionaries contributed {{much to the}} {{development}} of Western education in Joseon Korea. The Queen Consort, unlike her father-in-law, who had oppressed Christians, invited different missionaries to enter Joseon. She knew and valued their knowledge of Western history, science, and mathematics, and was aware of the advantage of having them within the nation. Unlike the Isolationists, she saw <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Confucian morals of Korean society in the advent of Christianity. Religious tolerance was another one of her goals.|$|E
25|$|This {{decision}} {{sparked a}} major {{controversy in the}} Pacific fisheries and research community, which became divided along national lines. American William Thompson, head researcher for the IPSFC, was criticized by Canadian zoologist William Ricker who claimed that the IPSFC research was unreliable and that fishways were not a means to preserving Fraser salmon. Ricker believed that Hells Gate posed <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> migrating salmon, and that commercial over-fishing did. He held that stringent regulations {{should be placed on}} fishing for Fraser salmon.|$|E
