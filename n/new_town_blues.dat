50|$|A {{strike is}} {{imminent}} at the Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory, where the workers churn out pajamas at a backbreaking pace ("Racing with the Clock"). In {{the middle of}} this, a new superintendent, Sid Sorokin, has come {{from out of town}} to work in the factory ("A <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> Is a <b>Blue</b> Town"). The union, led by Prez, is seeking a wage raise of seven-and-a-half cents an hour. Sid and Babe are in opposite camps, yet romantic interest is sparked at their first encounter. Despite cajoling from her fellow garment workers, Babe appears to reject Sid ("I'm Not At All in Love"). Meanwhile, Hines, the popular efficiency expert, is in love with Gladys, the company president's secretary, but is pushing her away with his jealous behavior. After witnessing a fight between the couple, Sid's secretary, Mabel, tries to help Hines break from his jealous ways ("I'll Never Be Jealous Again"). Meanwhile, Sid, rejected again by Babe, is forced to confide his feelings to a dictaphone ("Hey There").|$|R

50|$|With {{the success}} of the first phase, Hong Kong {{government}} proposed to build <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> in other areas in the 70s. The development of Tai Po <b>New</b> <b>Town,</b> Yuen Long <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> and Fanling-Sheung Shui <b>New</b> <b>Town,</b> started in 1976, 1977 and 1978 respectively. The extension of the Tsuen Wan <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> to Tsing Yi Town also started in the mid-70s, and was regarded as part of the second phase of <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> development. The third phase of <b>new</b> <b>town</b> development was proposed in the 1980s, including Tseung Kwan O <b>New</b> <b>Town,</b> Tin Shui Wai <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> and Ma On Shan, which was officially considered as an extension of Sha Tin <b>New</b> <b>Town.</b> The fourth phase of the development, so far the last one, commenced in 1996 and developed North Lantau <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> (only Tung Chung was developed although area near Tai Ho Wan was originally part of the plan), as a supporting town of the then newly constructed airport in Chek Lap Kok. At present, there are in total nine <b>New</b> <b>Towns.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> Act 1946 (9 & 10 Geo.

50|$|In 1945 Lord Reith of Stonehaven was {{appointed}} {{as chair of}} the <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> Commission. The commission concluded that there was a need to construct <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> using the instrument of development corporations supported by central government. The <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> Act 1946 cemented this vision in 1946 and <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> were born.|$|R
50|$|Although Tsuen Wan <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> {{belongs to}} the New Territories, it is also {{considered}} a part of Hong Kong metro area, like Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. It is because the town was developed early and is not geographically separated from Kowloon by hills or mountains. Also, there are no New Territories taxis providing service in Tsuen Wan <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> except at Tsuen Wan Station and Tsing Yi Station, unlike other <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> in <b>New</b> Territories. In the latest official reports, Kwai Chung <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> and Tsing Yi <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> are separated from Tsuen Wan <b>New</b> <b>Town.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Hong Kong Government {{first put}} Yuen Long <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> {{on the list}} of <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> in 1972 and planned several {{large-scale}} housing estates.

In 1978, Yuen Long <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> was put {{on the list of}} second generation <b>new</b> <b>towns.</b> [...] It served as a secondary administrative centre.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the commuting characteristics and urban spatial structure focusing on self-containment and centrality {{of the first generation}} <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> in Korea using the longitudinal household travel survey data of 1996, 2002, 2006, and 2010. We developed nine measures to examine the multi-dimensional concept of self-containment and the interdependency between <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> and surrounding cities. The analysis results show that two <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> such as Ilsan and Jungdong have increased the level of self-containment over time. In contrast, the level of self-containment of Bundang <b>new</b> <b>town</b> is relatively low among five <b>new</b> <b>towns.</b> On the other hand, Bundang new town’s centrality of commuting network is relatively higher than other <b>new</b> <b>towns,</b> indicating that Bundang <b>new</b> <b>town</b> functions as the central place of employment beyond its administrative boundary. In addition, the relationship between the <b>new</b> <b>town</b> and original town in the same administrative boundary indicates that original town’s dependency to newtown has increased over time except Jungdong. Lastly, the dependency of five <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> to the city of Seoul has been decreased over time, indicating the spatial expansion of commuting networks into surrounding local cities from the <b>new</b> <b>towns...</b>|$|R
50|$|Most <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> {{were planned}} and {{developed}} around a Town Centre, {{which was the}} business, cultural and traffic hub of the Town. For example, one can find shopping malls, libraries, theatres, government organs, bus terminus in the town centre of Tuen Mun <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> and Sha Tin <b>New</b> <b>Town.</b> If there was a railway station, town centre was always planned in its nearby area. Tsuen Wan <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> was special {{in the sense that}} it had more than one town centre, situated around Tsuen Wan Station and Kwai Fong Station (and later Tsing Yi Station after Tsuen Wan <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> extended to Tsing Yi). The <b>town</b> centres of <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> became a vibrant business and cultural hub of the area. However, it should be noted that Tin Shui Wai <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> is an exception, as it is the only <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> which does not have a clear town centre.|$|R
50|$|Transportation is vitally {{important}} for the <b>New</b> <b>Towns,</b> and thus is planned with due care. Before the development of <b>New</b> <b>Towns,</b> most areas in the New Territories were badly connected. So new roads and highways were built in order to ease the traffic between the <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> and the urban area. For example, Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway were two principal highways built in the late 70s and early 80s to connect the <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> in West <b>New</b> Territories and East New Territories to Kowloon. Tunnels (e.g. Lion Rock Tunnel and Tate's Cairn Tunnel) and bridges (e.g. Tsing Yi Bridge) were also built to shorten the traffic time. Public transport was also developed. Most <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> were planned with newly built railway (e.g. MTR stations in Tsuen Wan <b>New</b> <b>Town,</b> Tseung Kwan O <b>New</b> <b>Town,</b> Tung Chung and the Ma On Shan Rail for Ma On Shan). Kowloon-Canton Railway was electrified in the mid-80s {{in order to provide}} convenient transportation to Fanling-Sheung Shui <b>New</b> <b>Town,</b> Tai Po <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> and Sha Tin <b>New</b> <b>Town.</b> <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> in west <b>New</b> Territories were interconnected by Light Rail Transit, although they remained the only <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> which lacked direct railway service to the urban areas back then. Because of the lack of railway transport, coupling with the fact that Tuen Mun Road and Castle Peak Road were the only connections between west New Territories and Kowloon, the traffic between these <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> and the urban areas was once very terrible, with serious traffic jam every day. They situation improved when Tai Lam Tunnel opened in 1998. These <b>New</b> <b>Towns</b> in west <b>New</b> Territories were finally connected to urban areas with direct railway service, when KCR West Rail (now West Rail Line) opened in 2003.|$|R
