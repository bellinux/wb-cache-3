40|$|EU data {{protection}} law has, to date, been monitored and enforced in a decentralised way by independent supervisory authorities in each Member State. While the independence of these supervisory authorities is {{an essential element of}} EU {{data protection}} law, this decentralised governance structure has led to competing claims from supervisory authorities regarding the <b>national</b> <b>law</b> <b>applicable</b> to a data processing operation and the national authority responsible for enforcing the data protection rules. These competing claims, evident in investigations conducted into the data protection compliance of Google and Facebook, jeopardise the objectives of the EU data protection regime. The new General Data Protection Regulation will revolutionise data protection governance by providing for a centralised decision-making body, the European Data Protection Board. While this agency will ensure the ‘Europeanisation’ of {{data protection law}}, given the nature and the extent of this Board’s powers it marks another significant shift in the EU’s agency-creating process and must therefore also be considered in its broader EU context...|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} C- 210 / 06 Cartesio the ECJ {{decided that the}} {{outbound}} transfer of the central place of administration from a Member State (hereafter, MS) adhering to the real seat doctrine does not fall {{under the freedom of}} establishment when the <b>national</b> <b>law</b> <b>applicable</b> to that company does not change. With this judgement the Court increased the scope for corporate mobility in two respects. First, in the situation where there is an outbound transfer of the central place of administration with a simultaneous change of the applicable national law one can rely on the treaty freedom. Second, in the same situation such a transfer may no longer result in companies being killed off at the border. Moreover, the effect of this judgement is not to outlaw the real seat doctrine but, similar to Überseering, to limit the potential effects of the application of the real seat doctrine. Interestingly the application of this judgement to the situation in which a company transfers its central place of administration from a MS adhering to the incorporation doctrine results in a potentially discriminatory effect...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the role and}} function of the rules {{on the use of}} force for military operations in terms of the interaction between international and <b>national</b> <b>law</b> <b>applicable</b> to such operations and the actual conduct of the operations in question. In doing so, this study focused on examining whether the rules on the use of force could be considered a linchpin between the law, including the academic study of the law, and the actual conduct of military operations in practice. Following an introduction to general concepts related to the rules on the use of force and the planning of military operations, the study {{analyzes the}} role of the rules on the use of force (ROE) in regards to the application of (the law of) self-defense, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international and national criminal law in the context of military operations. Based on the constituent chapters, the conclusion of this study re-examines the classical conceptual model of ROE and establishes that the actual interaction between the constituent elements and the conduct of operations requires a refinement of that model. In the new conceptual model presented in this study, the influences of the operational, political and legal element on ROE and the conduct of operations are shown in their proper perspective. The study shows that while the law affects the conduct of military operations directly, the ROE serve as a linchpin between the international law of military operations, including academic developments, and the conduct of military operations...|$|E

40|$|This study, {{the first}} of its kind, essays a {{detailed}} survey of the Irish law on food labelling and its related literature. The preponderance of Irish law on food labelling may be ascribed to Ireland’s membership of the European Union. The thesis commences by describing, analysing and evaluating the legislative methods employed by the European Union. The thesis finds that the European Union proceeds in diverse ways to achieve what is assumed to be a single end instead of adopting any one method whereby each Member State simultaneously changes its own law to achieve harmony. The thesis shows, by taking specific examples such as honey, chocolate and genetically modified foodstuffs, that throughout the European Union, identical food products are marketed in different ways and with different labelling requirements, and the same product, such as yoghurt, may require to be differently labelled, depending on the <b>national</b> <b>law</b> <b>applicable.</b> The thesis then compares and contrasts the evolution and implementation of food labelling laws in Australia and New Zealand on the one hand, and in the United States of America on the other. The comparison between the legislative methods in these different federations and jurisdictions highlights the shortcomings inherent in the legislative machinery contemplated by the Treaty of Rome. The thesis concludes by offering several specific recommendations. In particular it demonstrates how, by altering the legislative medium from directives to regulations, many of the difficulties in European Union regulation of food labelling could be avoided. The thesis concludes by raising two wider or more general questions concerning how and to what extent diverse economic, and above all cultural interests are necessarily well served by the implementation of clear, simple and simultaneously effective laws, and how in general harmonisation of food labelling law should be best achieved...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide a {{different}} perspective {{to the study of}} the scope and functioning of the principle of equal treatment on grounds of nationality and movement laid down in Article 18 TFEU and in the Treaty free movement provisions. It examines the scope and functioning of the principle of equal treatment in the context of the determination of the <b>law</b> <b>applicable</b> to a cross-border (or inter-State) relationship. In particular, the question this thesis addresses is whether and, if yes, how the principle of equal treatment affects the choice of the law governing cross-border contractual, non-contractual or other civil law relationships in the European Union. In this respect, it is demonstrated that the principle of equal treatment functions as an additional check on the operation of, on the one hand, the <b>national</b> substantive <b>law</b> <b>applicable</b> pursuant to a national or Union choice-of-law rule or chosen by private parties to a contract and, on the other hand, national and Union choice-of-law rules themselves. The <b>national</b> substantive <b>law</b> governing a cross-border relationship falls within the scope of the principle of equal treatment and is required to comply with it, irrespective of the fact that it is applicable in accordance with a choice-of-law rule or a choice-of-law clause agreed by private parties. Similarly, regardless of their specific nature and objective, national and Union choice-of-law rules also come within the scope of the principle of equal treatment. However, it is emphasised that the functioning of the principle of equal treatment is not comparable to that of a choice-of-law rule. The requirement that only non-discriminatory rules can be applied in the Union under it does not, even indirectly, determine the <b>applicable</b> <b>law</b> in the sense understood from a choice-of-law perspective. This is because, unlike a choice-of-law rule, the principle of equal treatment does not contain even an implicit reference to a particular <b>national</b> <b>law</b> that always applies in light of it. ...|$|R

40|$|Regulation 1896 / 2006 {{does not}} provide for {{effective}} debtor protection in cases when a European Order for Payment was not properly served on the debtor. As {{a result of the}} unilateral nature of the procedure for issuing the order, the order will be declared enforceable if the defendant does not challenge it within a period of 30 days. However, the service of the payment order shall safeguard the right to a defense. When the defendant has never been informed about the ongoing procedure, {{he should be able to}} easily contest the Order for Payment even after it has been declared enforceable. Yet, the text of the Regulation {{does not provide}} for a remedy in this situation. In a reference for a preliminary ruling, the Local Court Berlin-Wedding asked the European Court of Justice which remedy should apply.

40|$|Formation of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) policy {{within the}} {{international}} climate regime has raised {{a number of}} discussions about ‘justice’. REDD+ aims to provide an incentive for developing countries to preserve or {{increase the amount of}} carbon stored in their forested areas. Governance of REDD+ is multi-layered: at the international level, a guiding framework must be determined; at the national level, strong legal frameworks are a pre-requisite to ensure both public and private investor confidence and at the sub-national level, forest-dependent peoples need to agree to participate as stewards of forest carbon project areas. At the international level the overall objective of REDD+ is yet to be determined, with competing mitigation, biological and justice agendas. Existing international law pertaining to the environment (international environmental principles and law, IEL) and human rights (international human rights law, IHRL) should inform the development of international and national REDD+ policy especially in relation to ensuring the environmental integrity of projects and participation and benefit-sharing rights for forest dependent communities. <b>National</b> <b>laws</b> <b>applicable</b> to REDD+ must accommodate the needs of all stakeholders and articulate boundaries which define their interactions, paying particular attention to ensuring that vulnerable groups are protected. This paper i) examines justice theories and IEL and IHRL to inform our understanding of what ‘justice’ means in the context of REDD+, and ii) applies international law to create a reference tool for policy-makers dealing with the complex sub-debates within this emerging climate policy. We achieve this by: 1) 	Briefly outlining theories of justice (for example – perspectives offered by anthropogenic and ecocentric approaches, and views from ‘green economics’). 2) 	Commenting on what ‘climate justice’ means in the context of REDD+. 3) 	Outlining a selection of IEL and IHRL principles and laws to inform our understanding of ‘justice’ in this policy realm (for example – common but differentiated responsibilities, the precautionary principle, sovereignty and prevention drawn from the principles of IEL, the UNFCCC and CBD as relevant conventions of international environmental law; and UNDRIP and the Declaration on the Right to Development as applicable international human rights instruments) 4) 	Noting how this informs what ‘justice’ is for different REDD+ stakeholders 5) 	Considering how current law-making (at both the international and national levels) reflects these principles and rules drawn from international law 6) 	Presenting how international law can inform policy-making by providing a reference tool of <b>applicable</b> international <b>law</b> and how it could be applied to different issues linked to REDD+. As such, this paper will help scholars and policy-makers to understand how international law can assist us to both conceptualise and embody ‘justice’ within frameworks for REDD+ at both the international and national levels. ...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{integration}} at EU {{level has}} inevitably {{led to an}} increase of transnational families and therefore of international family litigation. Sovereign states are no longer best placed to efficiently cope with these new challenges. The EU has therefore taken over and has aimed, {{in the past two}} decades, at harmonising family law through private international law instruments, thus enabling the legislator to cope with legal diversity while still making allowance for national cultures and traditions. In that context, party autonomy is a feature entailing that parties can influence the process by choosing the court with jurisdiction to hear their case and the <b>law</b> <b>applicable</b> to their situation. The first topic regulated at EU level has been divorce, through the Brussels II Convention, in 1998. The instrument has replaced <b>national</b> <b>law</b> of Member States, regarding jurisdiction matters but also recognition and enforcement of judgments, in cross-border cases. Despite being the cornerstone of European family law and being recast twice, this instrument {{is the only one that}} is not following the trend towards party autonomy. However, by its drafting, the instrument has the peculiarity of allowing indirect choice since the grounds for jurisdiction are not classified hierarchically and therefore allow parties to seize one court rather than another. Concerning <b>applicable</b> <b>law,</b> the Regulations is more recent (December 2010) and therefore not only includes party autonomy but also gives it the main role to establish the <b>law</b> <b>applicable</b> to a divorce or legal separation case.
