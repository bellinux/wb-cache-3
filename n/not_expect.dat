5|$|Recipients {{consider}} the Golden Film {{to be an}} award given to films that are a success. Director Martin Koolhoven said, when Schnitzel Paradise (2005) received the award, that he did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> his film {{to be such a}} success. Schnitzel Paradise was his first commercially successful film. Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, but she did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> it to receive a Golden Film.|$|E
5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. I did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 24 January the Archduke's army took {{positions}} east of {{the small town of}} Byczyna on the royal road leading into Poland. They felt secure in their camp, on the Habsburg side of the border, and did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the Poles to cross. Zamoyski marshaled his forces into three lines and was able to position them at an angle to the opponent's line.|$|E

5|$|Targowica confederates, who did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> another partition, and the king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, {{who joined}} them near the end, both lost much {{prestige}} and support. The reformers, {{on the other}} hand, were attracting increasing support. In March 1794 the Kościuszko Uprising began. The defeat of the Uprising in November that year resulted in the final Third Partition of Poland, ending {{the existence of the}} Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{premiere of}} Hard Boiled was in September 1992 at the Toronto International Film Festival. At the premiere the {{audience}} response was very positive with people stomping {{their feet and}} yelling at the screen. This reception surprised producer Terence Chang who did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> such a positive reaction. Hard Boiled received wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{reveals that}} Gray {{felt that the}} poem was unimportant, {{and that he did}} <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> it to become as popular or {{influential}} as it did. Gray dismisses its positives as merely being {{that he was able to}} complete the poem, which was probably influenced by his experience of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, where he attended the Sunday service and was able to visit the grave of Antrobus.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99typhoon bulletins, warning {{residents}} about Mireille. There were 236warnings {{related to}} storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents {{were aware of}} the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> significant effects. In general, residents were unprepared for the storm, partly {{due to the lack of}} recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|As {{she does}} <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to see it, Izzi asks Tom {{to finish the}} outcome of the story for her. As they look out to the star of a nebula, she imagines, as the Mayans did, that their souls will meet there after life and when the star goes supernova. In the 26th century, future space {{traveler}} Tommy travels there for the event, in a spaceship made of an enclosed biosphere containing the Tree of Life he seeded above her grave.|$|E

5|$|At Star Treks creation, Norway Productions, Roddenberry's {{production}} company, {{shared ownership}} with Desilu Productions and, after Gulf+Western acquired Desilu in 1967, with Paramount Pictures, the conglomerate's film studio. Paramount {{did not want}} to own the unsuccessful show; net profit was to be shared between Norway, Desilu/Paramount, Shatner, and NBC but Star Trek lost money, and the studio did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to syndicate it. In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry, but he could not afford the $150,000 ($ in 2007) price.|$|E
5|$|Dodge's {{screenplay}} for Bad Words was {{featured on the}} 2011 Black List and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman. In the original script, the story was set at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> Scripps to allow {{the use of their}} name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided to take on the role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki {{was assassinated}} in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but {{inclusive}} of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to {{do most of the}} fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|In early August Sudirman {{approached}} Sukarno {{and asked}} him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11August 1949.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 660s, two {{important}} marriages took place. Ecgfrith of Northumbria, the fifteen-year-old son of Oswiu, married Æthelthryth of Ely, {{the daughter of}} Anna of East Anglia, (who was about fourteen years older than him), and moved {{to live with him}} at his Northumbrian court. She had remained a virgin for Christ during her first marriage: she continued in this resolve as Ecgfrityh's bride, with the result that he could <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to father an heir. Æthelthryth retained Ely as her own possession during this marriage.|$|E
5|$|In the {{operation}} the 6th Airborne Division {{together with the}} 7th Armoured Division, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, formed the I Corps, attached to the First Canadian Army. When issuing his orders, Lieutenant General John Crocker, the Corps commander, aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> them to advance quickly. To reach the River Seine the division would have to cross three main rivers, along only two main lines of advance. One route was in the north, running along the French coast, while the other route was further inland between Troarn and Pont Audemer.|$|E

5|$|In town, Creger {{watched as}} a forward element of the German {{infantry}} advanced, with weapons slung, into Lanzerath. They obviously did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to encounter any Americans. Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As {{he returned to the}} American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, where he {{received}} marginal care. He had lost , was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned as white as snow. McCain {{was sent to a}} different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> him to live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.|$|E
5|$|No {{operations}} {{are reported in}} Sicily {{for the first two}} years after the fall of Palermo. The Muslims were probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were too weak to react, and could <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until his sudden death in August 833.|$|E
