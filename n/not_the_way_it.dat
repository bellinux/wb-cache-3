500|$|While She Sleeps are {{generally}} recognized by professional reviewers as a metallic hardcore band and {{are known for}} their high energy and edgy sound. The recording features technical guitar picking, big riffs, heavy bass lines, crashing drums and screaming vocals. When questioned about their sound, Welsh described the band as having a [...] "raw UK vibe," [...] adding that they like to keep their music simple and have [...] "more a party vibe." [...] Vocalist Taylor added that their sound is [...] "less pure solo and just more energy." [...] Dom Wyatt of Dead Press! suggested that the band stick to the mould of a metalcore band with the adage [...] "don’t fix what isn’t broken." [...] In an interview in 2011, vocalist Taylor stated that the title– The North Stands for Nothing– has two meanings and that it is open to interpretation. Explaining that being from the North of England; the people that the band know [...] "won't take crap" [...] while also stating that the title means that it doesn't matter where you're from (geographically) you can still [...] "get involved" [...] with the band's music. Guitarist Welsh added that the title reflects the UK underground scene and how people will go to see a local band who are their friends and leave before seeing other bands– saying that [...] "that's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> should be." [...] In an interview in 2011, Welsh explained that the lyrics on [...] "My Conscience, Your Freedom" [...] are about the government– specifically noting on the line [...] "our coins can pay for the crime." [...] When questioned about the single [...] "Be(lie)ve", Welsh said that it was about the government and religion. Taylor explained further; [...] "we wrote about how people follow shit and don't really think about what they're following".|$|E

The {{circumstances}} I was in made the offer of a good husband the most necessary thing in the world to me, but I found soon that to be made cheap and easy was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> soon began to be found that the widow had no fortune, and to say this was to say all that was ill of me, for I began to be dropped in all the discourses of matrimony. Being well-bred, handsome, witty, modest, and agreeable; all which I had allowed to my character--whether justly or no is not the purpose--I say, all these would not do without the dross, which way now become more valuable than virtue itself. In short, the widow, they said, had no money.|$|E
60|$|He had fancied, when {{he talked}} with Gascoyne in the Eyry that time, {{that he was to}} become a man all at once; he felt just then that he had forever done with boyish things. But that is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> happens in men's lives. Changes do not come so {{suddenly}} and swiftly as that, but by little and little. For three or four days, maybe, he went his new way of life big with the great change that had come upon him, and then, now in this and now in that, he drifted back very much into his old ways of boyish doings. As was said, one's young days do not end all at once, even when they be so suddenly and sharply shaken, and Myles was not different from others. He had been stirred to the core by that first wonderful sight of the great and glorious life of manhood opening before him, but he had yet many a sport to enjoy, many a game to play, many a boisterous romp to riot in the dormitory, many an expedition to make to copse and spinney and river on days when he was off duty, and when permission had been granted.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Oakshott sat in an arm-chair {{beside a}} large {{fire in a}} wainscotted room, with a folding-screen {{shutting}} off the window. Her spinning-wheel was near, {{but it was only}} too plain that 'feeble was the hand, and silly the thread.' She bent her head in its wadded black velvet hood, but excused herself from rising, as she was crippled by rheumatic pains. She had evidently once been a pretty little person, innocent and inane, and her face had become like that of a withered baby, piteous in its expression of pain and weariness, but otherwise somewhat vacant. At first, indeed, there was a look of alarm. Perhaps she expected every visitor to come with a complaint of her unlucky Peregrine, but when Mrs. Woodford spoke cheerfully of being her neighbour in the country, she was evidently relieved and even gratified, prattling in a soft plaintive tone about her sufferings and the various remedies, ranging from woodlice rolled into natural pills, and grease off the church bells, to diamond dust and Goa stones, since, as she said, there was no cost to which Major Oakshott would not go for her benefit. He had even procured for her a pound of the Queen's new Chinese herb, and it certainly was as nauseous as could be wished, when boiled in milk, but she was told that was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was taken at my Lady Charnock's. She was quite animated when Mrs. Woodford offered to show her how to prepare it.|$|E
