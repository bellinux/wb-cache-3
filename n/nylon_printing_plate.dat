40|$|With the {{implementation}} of platesetters in the offset <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> making process, imaging of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> became more stable and ensured increase of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> quality. But as the chemical processing of the <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> still highly influences the plate making process and the graphic reproduction workflow, development of <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> {{that do not require}} chemical processing for offset printing technique {{has been one of the}} top interests in graphic technology in the last few years. The main reason for that came from the user experience, where majority of the problems with plate making process could be connected with the chemical processing of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> Furthermore, increased environmental standards lead to reducing of the chemicals used in the industrial processes. Considering these facts, different types of offset <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> have been introduced to the market today. This paper presents some of the processless <b>printing</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Paper based <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> {{is one of}} <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> used in octave or {{specifically}} {{offset printing}} machine. In the printing process, the <b>printed</b> <b>plate</b> wants to keep its shape by the pressure, the friction and tension. It needs to have good dimensional stability and good ink-water balance of coating. This paper discusses the influence of different coating formulations and coating process on the mechanical properties of paper-based <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> In this paper, the wet strength of paper-based <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> of different formulations and different coating amount were tested. The study provided the theoretical basis for ink-water balance coating formulations of paper-based <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> and the plate production...|$|R

40|$|Flexography is a {{printing}} technique {{widely used in}} the packaging production. The main feature of flexography {{is the use of}} a <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> elastically deformed during the reproduction process. The <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> is made of an elastic material, rubber or nowadays of mainly different types of photopolymer. The elasticity of the <b>plate</b> enables the <b>printing</b> {{on a wide range of}} printing substrates, which is one of its advantages compared to other printing techniques. On the other hand, deformations of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> in the <b>printing</b> process caused by the pressure between the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> and the substrate present a major limitation of flexography. Apart from the functional properties of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> in the <b>printing</b> process, the <b>plate</b> making process, including photo polymerization, considerably influences the value of halftones on the <b>printing</b> <b>plate,</b> and consequently on the final product. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of screen ruling on the formation of printing elements and the adjustment of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> making process in order to achieve optimal quality of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> and, therefore, the final product. The results have shown that the use of different screen rulings is of great significance in the processes of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> curve adjustment. It was proven that the use of different screen ruling has a considerable influence upon relief depth and a cross-section of the printing elements (3 D analysis), which again have a significant impact on the quality of the final product, but cannot be detected in 2 D analysis...|$|R
50|$|The {{image is}} {{reproduced}} {{line by line}} on a fixed flat <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> by a laser beam that is deflected by a rotating polygon mirror and then onto the <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> Because of the setup the laser beam becomes less accurate {{at the edges of}} the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> and is therefore mainly smaller formats or production with lower quality expectations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Printing</b> <b>plate</b> is {{carrier of}} an image which will be print out and {{multiply}} in the reproduction process. It consists of surfaces which will, by using a printing ink, transfer the digitally made image onto the printing substrate. Quality of the image and final imprint depend {{on a number of}} parameters which have to be monitored and adjusted during the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> making and reproduction processes. Quality control of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> can be conducted by observing the printing areas, made of photosensitive layer; or by observing the non-printing areas,made of aluminium-oxide. Quality of the image on the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> surface is usually controlled by using different devices for measuring the quality level of plates. These devices work on the principle of determining several parameters for monitoring the quality of <b>printing</b> <b>plates,</b> where, the most significant is, the surface coverage of the printing elements. Beside those devices, market today offers a range of alternative methods which allow the determination and characterization of tones by using a software support for image analysis. Those methods are using the microscopic images of the surface and can define the surface coverage of printing elements and other necessary information {{about the quality of the}} <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> The aim of this work is the defining of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> quality level through introduction of different image analysis applications. The results of this research may indicate that it is also possible to use alternative applications for monitoring the quality of the <b>printing</b> <b>plates.</b> Furthermore, this paper would provide a general overview of quality control possibilities for <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> and could be useful to the systems where such controls are regularly conducted...|$|R

50|$|A {{process camera}} is a {{specialised}} form of camera used for mass reproduction of graphic materials. The original document was photographed and the negatives (or positive films)produced {{were used to}} produce <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> or other graphic media - usually via some kind of process where the negative was put in intimate contact with a <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> in a vacuum frame(the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> having a U.V light-sensitive coating) and exposed to U.V. light. See offset lithography, silk screen printing, Photozincography and Heliozincography {{for more information on}} this process.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> onto the <b>printing</b> substrate. The pad printing is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> Beside area of the printing elements, on the pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences the printing ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of the printed product. The photopolymer pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in the printing elements. The duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of the printing elements. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of the printing elements, consequently on the reproduction of the pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> elements. For this purpose four pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration.

40|$|In this paper, the {{swelling}} properties of photopolymer flexographic <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> {{related to the}} variations of UVC post-treatment have been analysed. The {{aim of the research}} was to interconnect the changes in the crosslinking degree of the photopolymer material occurring due to the modified UVC radiation of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> and the changes of its surface free energy crucial in the graphic reproduction process. Changes in the crosslinking degree in the photopolymer materials have been analysed by {{the swelling}} experiments. Results have proven that the partial dissolution of the photopolymer material caused by the immersion of the <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> in various solvents is in the direct relation with the changes of the dispersive surface free energy. UVC post-treatment, used for the crosslinking termination and the definition of the surface properties of <b>printing</b> <b>plates,</b> is therefore directly affecting the resistivity of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> in the solvent environment. By calculating the correlation coefficients for the weight loss of the photopolymer material in solvents and the dispersive surface free energy, the relation between the crosslinking degree and the UVC post-treatment has been established...|$|R

40|$|Recently printed {{electronic}} field is significantly growth. Printed electronic {{is to develop}} electrical devices by printing method. Conventional printing method that has been studied {{for this kind of}} printed electronic such as flexographic, micro contact printing, screen printing, gravure and ink jet. In flexographic and microcontact <b>printing,</b> a <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> is used to transfer the designed and desired pattern to substrate through conformed contact. Therefore <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> is play a big role in this area. <b>Printing</b> <b>plate</b> making by photopolymer which used in flexographic have limitation in achieving a micro-scale of pattern size. However, <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> of microcontact <b>printing</b> have an advantages in producing micro, even nano-scale size by PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane). Hence, rapid prototyping 3 D printer was used for developing a PDMS micro-scale <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> which will be used in reel to reel (R 2 R) flexographic due to high speed, low cost, mass production of this type of printing process. The flexibility of 3 D printer in producing any shape of pattern easily, contributed the success of this study. A nickel plating and glass etching master pattern was used in this study too as master pattern mould since 3 D printer has been reached the micro size limitation. The finest multiple solid line array with 1 mm width and 2 mm gap pattern of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> was successfully fabricated by 3 D printer master mould due to size limitation of the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3 D printer nozzle itself. However, the micro-scale multiple solid line array of 100 micron and 25 micron successfully made by nikel platting and glass etching master mould respectively. Those types of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> producing method is valueable since it is easy, fast and low cost, used for micro-flexographic in printed {{electronic field}} or biomedical application...|$|R
