5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The {{results showed that the}} tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the <b>nyala</b> (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. On the other hand, the nuclear data shows that lesser kudu and <b>nyala</b> form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Mammals of {{paramount}} importance in BMNP include the endangered Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), the Mountain <b>nyala</b> (Tragelaphus buxtoni), the Big-headed mole-rat, and the Bale Mountains vervet−Bale monkey (Chlorocebus djamdjamensis). The Afro-alpine area is home to {{over half of the}} global population of the Ethiopian wolf, the rarest canid in the world with only 400 animals surviving. The northern juniper-hagenia woodlands harbor the largest population of the endemic and similarly endangered Mountain <b>nyala,</b> estimated to be approximately two-thirds of the global population. Furthermore, the entire population the big-headed molerat and most of the Bale monkey population are contained within the park.|$|E

25|$|The {{impetus for}} the present {{national}} park began with two visits to the area in 1963 and 1965 by the British naturalist, Dr. Leslie Brown {{who was in the}} area explicitly to assess the status of mountain <b>Nyala.</b> The major recommendation of his visits was that a national park should be established in the Bale Mountains to protect their habitat. John Blower, advisor to the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organization (now Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA)) and a Peace Corps volunteer, followed through with Dr. Brown’s recommendation by surveying the area and proposed boundaries of the park. In 1969 the Bale Mountains National Park was established.|$|E

25|$|Fossils from Africa {{have been}} {{recovered}} {{in places such as}} Olduvai Gorge but they are sometimes consist of fragmented pieces of leg bone and horn. The oldest known of these species is Tragelaphus moroitu which has been found in the late Miocene to early Pliocene deposits of the Asa Koma and Kuseralee and the Middle Awash deposits. Similar in appearance to the <b>nyala,</b> Tragelaphus moroitu was a small antelope and has primitive characteristics in the horn core, making it the most primitive known species of spiral-horn antelope in Africa. The evolution of spiral-horned antelopes based on the abundance of fossils shows they were among the most common species of antelope in Africa, and as climatic changes have occurred throughout their evolution, they have undergone faunal turnovers and adapting to new environments.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August Sudan's army {{reported}} that 3 Russian helicopter crew members had been abducted by gunmen in <b>Nyala,</b> capital of South Darfur, {{just hours after}} Samaritan's Purse aid worker Flavia Wagner who had been kidnapped 18 May was set free. She {{was taken from the}} South Darfurian village of Abu Ajura, along with two Sudanese colleagues who were also freed after a week. The governor of South Darfur, Abdel Hamid Kasha, Sudan foreign ministry spokesman Moawiya Osman and Samaritan's Purse’s leader Franklin Graham, and the Russian ambassador to Chad welcomed Flavia’s release, but condemned the kidnap of the three Russians and that of two Jordanian UNAMID police advisers in Darfur, on the 14th. Another Russian helicopter pilot was taken prisoner for four days after landing in South Darfur to take rebels' spokesmen to Chad for alleged peace talks.|$|E
25|$|However recent {{molecular}} {{studies have}} shown a different arrangement. According to the molecular work on the nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA, the lesser kudu and the <b>nyala</b> are the basal most living species. Then around 10 million years ago {{there has been a}} split between forest-dwelling, gracile species and larger, open-plains species. This renders Tragelaphus paraphyletic in respect to Taurotragus, which either means to make the latter genus into a junior synonym of the former genus or split Tragelaphus into several genera to maintain Taurotragus. In a 2011 large scale taxonomic study on ungulates by Groves and Grubb, they have found support of cryptic species and should be split into several distinct species. This was based on intensive morphological comparisons between the species (in particular the dimensions of the skull elements and skin colorarion) and defined species based on phylogenetic species concept. Groves and Grubb (2011) furthermore support in the establishment of several new genera in light of Tragelaphus being paraphyletic. Their taxonomy is concurrent with the molecular work, though they have a slight different arrangement among the species in Tragelaphus sensu stricto. Other scientists have mix reactions to this proposal, with some preferring the traditional number of species to be seven and others preferring the new taxonomy from Groves and Grubb (2011).|$|E

The road at the Felda Tun Ghaffar Bukit Senggeh has been straightened and widened, and will open many opportunities in the agricultural, farming and tourism sector. State Government is providing the infrastructure need to attract investors. Unlike the district of Selandar where major industries are prohibited due to its provision as the water catchment area, <b>Nyalas</b> is free from this restriction. Felda Tun Ghaffar Bukit Senggeh, <b>Nyalas</b> and further north area such as Air Kuning can benefit from this new road connection.|$|R

25|$|The spiral-horned antelopes are {{medium to}} large antelopes and {{generally}} are tall and long-legged. Horns {{are present in}} the males of all species, while females lack them with the exception of bongos and elands. The horns primarily role is used for defensive horn-wrestling which are common during territorial disputes, as well has for horn soiling and sexual display. Other examples of extreme sexual dimorphism can be seen among spiral-horned antelopes. Males are much larger in size than the females, and both sexes have very contrasting pelage coloration. The coloration in females is generally tan to red-brown. Males area a darker hue of the female coloration, which they darken as the animal gets older. Regardless of the coloration of the sexes, most species of spiral-horned antelopes have disruptive coloration that is a distinctive white vertical barring (striped pattern). A spotting pattern can occur as well. Both patterns are individually and geographically variable. These patterns help them to conceal themselves in the dense vegetation from predators. Most species have a white chevron between the eyes, spotted cheeks, the throat having a white patch and the upper-forelegs with dark garters. All except the <b>nyala</b> and the greater kudu have a chest crescent. In addition there are also physical attributes that serve a purpose in social communication such as dorsal crests, white scuts and white tips on the horns. These features help express the animal’s emotions as well as alerting members of the herd from predators. Underneath the hair fringe in the hind feet are special glands that encircles the false hooves.|$|E
500|$|The cheetah is a {{carnivore}} that prefers medium-sized prey with a {{body mass}} ranging from [...] Blesbok, duiker, Grant's gazelle, impala, reedbuck, springbok, and Thomson's gazelle {{are some of the}} common targets of the cheetah. Other prey animals include the bat-eared fox, bushbuck, kudu, hartebeest, <b>nyala,</b> oribi, roan antelope, steenbok, sable antelope, and waterbuck; they prey less frequently on African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, ostrich, warthog, wildebeest, and zebra. A study showed that a major proportion of the diet of Asiatic cheetahs consists of livestock; local species such as chinkara, desert hare, goitered gazelle, ibex, rodents, and wild sheep are also hunted. Generally, only groups of cheetahs will attempt to kill large animals such as hartebeest, although mothers with young cubs will attempt to secure a large prey all by themselves. There are no records of cheetah killing human beings. The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle, somewhat smaller than the cheetah. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal the preferred prey is the significantly larger <b>nyala,</b> males of which can weigh up to [...] They do, however, opt for young and adolescent targets, which make up about 50% of the cheetah diet despite constituting {{only a small portion of}} the prey population.|$|E
500|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. After the First Sudanese Civil War ended in 1972, there were plans to revive sugar production at Mongalla, and although Mongalla Sugar Processing Factory operated on a low-scale in the 1970s, it ceased production when civil war broke out again in 1983.A clothing mill also operated in the 1970s but was deactivated due to the unrest in the early 1980s. A paper mill was also planned at Mongalla, to be fed by eucalyptus species planted in a 70,000 feddan area.Equipment was supplied from Denmark between 1975 and 1976 for use in an agro-industrial complex at Mongalla. This would include a power station and pump station to support an abbatoir, poultry project, fish-receiving plant [...] and wood-working factory. The equipment arrived but was not installed, and eventually rusted away. A project funded by Khartoum also established six textile-manufacturing units in Sudan, one at Mongalla, and the other five factories located in the north at Ed Duiem, Kadugli, Kosti, <b>Nyala,</b> and Shendi. An agreement was made with a Belgian firm, SOBERI, to supply the weaving factory of 256 looms {{and at one point}} it was estimated to produce around 9 million meters of grey fabric per annum, but it failed to get past the trial phase due to lack of raw materials, capital, and transportation facilities.|$|E
