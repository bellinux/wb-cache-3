40|$|The {{end of the}} 20 th {{century has}} brought Romania the long-awaited “balance of <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> {{deliveries}} ” in the national transport system, through the inauguration of the “Commercial measuring and regulating station for <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> ” in the North-West of the country (Medieşu Aurit). Considered {{as one of the}} largest and most modern such stations in Europe, it made the connection between the national gas transportation system and the Ukrainian one, thus linking Romania to Europe’s <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> network.

40|$|Thirty-nine {{samples of}} <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> {{representing}} varied chemical compositions and geological occurrences were analyzed for their helium, radiogenic argon, and atmospheric argon contents. The total {{range in the}} (He/A) _(rad) ratio {{was found to be}} 1. 6 to 130 with most samples having values between 6 and 25. This range of values is essentially equal to the production ratio from the uranium, thorium, and potassium in average igneous rocks and a wide variety of sediments. This indicates that all of these <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> have obtained their radiogenic gases from rather average rock types. This is true {{in spite of the fact}} that the gases range in helium content from 37 to 62, 000 ppm. A theoretical discussion of the origin of helium and argon in <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> is given. It can be shown from the ratio of nitrogen to atmospheric argon that most of the nitrogen in these gases cannot come from the entrapment of air. From a consideration of the concentration of atmospheric argon in <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> it is possible to estimate the proportion of gaseous and aqueous phases assuming diffusive equilibrium.

40|$|Estimation of viscosities of {{naturally}} occurring petroleum gases provides the {{information needed to}} accurately work out reservoir-engineering problems.

This project proposes to develop a viscosity prediction model for <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> at high pressures and high temperatures.

For the samples from Akita and Niigata, pentane and hexane isomer ratios such as neopentane/isopentane and 2, 2 -dimethylbutane/ 2, 3 -dimethylbutane show positive correlations with δ 13 C (ethane), suggesting that the ratios {{are affected by the}} generation temperature. Relation between kerogen type and isobutane/n-butane ratio is also discussed. By the comparison between Akita and Niigata gases that originated from type II kerogen and Hokkaido gases that originated from type III kerogen, the gases from type III kerogen show a higher isobutane/n-butane ratio compared with those originated from type II kerogen. Although carbon isotopic ratios of ethane and propane are good parameters for the gas generation temperature, this study indicates that combinations among pentane isomer ratios and hexane isomer ratios also provide good parameters for the gas generation temperature...|$|R
