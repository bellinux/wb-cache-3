40|$|Challenges in the culture-independent {{analysis}} of oral and respiratory samples from intubated patients <b>LAZAREVIC,</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> et al. The spread of microorganisms in hospitals {{is an important}} public health threat, and yet few studies have assessed how human microbial communities (microbiota) evolve in the hospital setting. Studies conducted so far have mainly focused on {{a limited number of}} bacterial species, mostly pathogenic ones and primarily during outbreaks. We explored the bacterial community diversity of the microbiota from oral and respiratory samples of intubated patients hospitalized {{in the intensive care unit}} and we discuss the technical challenges that may arise while using culture-independent approaches to study these types of samples. <b>LAZAREVIC,</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> et al.

40|$|Effects of {{amoxicillin}} {{treatment on}} the salivary microbiota {{in children with}} acute otitis media <b>LAZAREVIC,</b> <b>Vladimir,</b> et al. Amoxicillin is a first-line antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media in children {{and one of the}} most commonly used antibiotics for human bacterial infections. We investigated changes in salivary bacterial communities among children treated with amoxicillin for acute otitis media (n = 18), using a culture-independent approach based on pyrosequencing of the V 3 region of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene. The control group consisted of children with acute otitis media who were not given antibiotics (n = 15). One species-level phylotype assigned to the genus Streptococcus was identified across all (n = 99) saliva samples. Two additional species-level phylotypes from the genera Gemella and Granulicatella were shared by all (n = 45) samples of control subjects. Amoxicillin treatment resulted in reduced species richness and diversity, and a significant shift in the relative abundance of 35 taxa at different ranks from phylum to species-level phylotype. At the phylum level, prevalence of TM 7 and Actinobacteria decreased at the end of treatment, whereas Proteobacteria had a higher relative abundance post-treatment.

40|$|Being {{conceived}} {{in the name}} of Christianity, the Church quickly mastered all of Western Europe, including medicine, which was developed in monasteries at first and at universities later on. The first hospitals were built within monasteries, and were used to treat monks and the general population in later times. With the founding of the first universities, medicine claimed its place in the world next to law, philosophy, and theology. In its early days, it was studied only as a theoretical science, but soon practical classes on cadavers were added. Universities were completely ruled by the Church, which meant that the curriculum had to be pre-approved by the Church, even the diplomas were presented by a bishop in a religious ceremony. Development of Serbian medieval medicine was under the influence of Byzantine and Italian (mainly Salernian) medicine. The greatest role in transfer of medical knowledge from the Byzantine Empire belonged to Serbian and Byzantine monks, while Italian doctors working in Serbia were responsible for the transfer of the Western medical knowledge. Serbian monarchs quickly started founding hospitals, {{both in and out of}} their domains, with the most famous ones being within monasteries such as Hilandar, Studenica, Pantokrator, Visoki Dečani, Sveti Arhangel, etc. In addition to those, there were two more hospitals not related to monasteries in Kotor and Belgrade, <b>named</b> after Stefan <b>Lazarević.</b> This contribution of Christianity to European medicine created a basis for a sudden development of medical science in the Renaissance...|$|R
