On February 17, 1941, he {{returned}} home early from his law office due to a bout of dizziness. It was {{reported that he had}} suffered a stroke, and after a mild improvement, his condition worsened again and he died on March 1, 1941, at 2:50am.

The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled.|$|E
5|$|As of August 1, 2012, Fox was {{pursuing}} a sequel with Scott, Rapace, and Fassbender involved, and {{was talking to}} new writers in case Lindelof did not return. The film would be scheduled for a release no earlier than 2014. In December 2012, Lindelof had decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a sequel, citing other commitments. In June 2013, Jack Paglen was in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, {{it was announced that}} production for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles, and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott stated that production on the film will begin in February 2016. In September 2015, Scott said that the title of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, Scott said that the title change did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection to the character of Ellen Ripley.|$|E

Laws against child labour were passed; children younger than 12 were <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in factories, children younger than 16 were <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at night, and women younger than 21 years old were <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> underground.

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{resuming}} his naval duties, Scott {{revealed to}} the Royal Geographical Society his intention to return to Antarctica, but the information was not at that stage made public. Scott was forestalled by Shackleton, who early in 1907 announced his plans to lead an expedition with the twin objectives of reaching the geographic and magnetic South Poles. Under duress, Shackleton agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, {{unable to find a}} safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. His expedition was highly successful, its southern march ending at 88°23′, less than 100 geographical miles from the South Pole, while its northern party reached the location of the South Magnetic Pole. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as a liar and a rogue.|$|E

5|$|The Right against Exploitation, {{contained}} in Articles 23–24, lays down certain provisions to prevent {{exploitation of the}} weaker sections of the society by individuals or the State. Article 23 prohibits human trafficking, making it an offence punishable by law, and also prohibits forced labour or any act of compelling a person to work without wages where he was legally entitled <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or to receive remuneration for it. However, it permits the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, including conscription and community service. The Bonded Labour system (Abolition) Act, 1976, has been enacted by Parliament {{to give effect to}} this Article. Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories, mines and other hazardous jobs. Parliament has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, providing regulations for the abolition of, and penalties for employing, child labour, as well as provisions for rehabilitation of former child labourers.|$|E

In return, they {{advanced}} money to the malangis against future salt production, resulting in the malangis becoming debtors to the British, virtually becoming economic slaves.

On 12 April, the FIA announced a settlement with Briatore and Symonds, and that the legal action had been ended.
