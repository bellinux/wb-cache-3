5|$|Resolution was {{provided}} by the same 1989 study that confirmed the link between Xenopsaris and Pachyramphus. In it, Xenopsaris and six other genera previously held in the three families were found to actually form a fourth family, later named Tityridae. This new family is where the genus is now placed by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society. A 2007 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the white-naped xenopsaris' place in the Tityridae, and its close relationship to Pachyramphus, as well as the genus Tityra. These three genera were found to be more distantly related to a fourth genus Iodopleura (the purpletufts), although further studies are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the complete relationship between these four genera.|$|E

When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how her {{character}} is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{ascertain}} the issues all general practice educators <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> when educating GP registrars {{to learn about}} research. Study Design A review of MEDLINE [1996 – 2007], six websites and key informants produced 302 publications, which reduced to 35 articles, 7 books, and 9 policy documents. Results Key themes that emerged from a thematic analysis of the literature that GP educators <b>need</b> <b>to</b> consider when teaching registrars about research were [i] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that learning research is influenced by attitudes; [ii] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> address organisational constraints on learning research; [iii] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> identify the educational barriers on learning research; [iv] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> there are gaps in GP research content – especially from GP registrars; And [v] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the value {{of research on the}} GP registrar's educational cycle of learning, which develops in a culture that allows research to flourish. Conclusion Australian GP registrars will observe a research culture only if they encounter clinician-researchers paid to practice and conduct research in their general practice. </p...|$|R

Since Gavin missed the basic education which was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the lessons, he rose at 4:30 every morning and read his books in the bathroom, the only place with enough light to read. After four years of hard work, he graduated in June 1929. In the 1929 edition of the West Point yearbook, Howitzer, he was mentioned as a boxer and as the cadet who had already been a soldier. After his graduation and his commissioning as a second lieutenant, he married Irma Baulsir on September 5, 1929.|$|E
25|$|As a Trotskyist tendency, the SRG/IS {{was faced}} with {{developing}} an explanation as to why and how {{a number of countries}} in the former colonial world had succeeded in overthrowing the rule of various imperial powers and forming states characterised by the SRG/IS as being bureaucratic state capitalist. In part, such an explanation was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why these colonial revolutions had not developed into uninterrupted or Permanent Revolutions, as predicted by Leon Trotsky in his theory of the same name. Taking Trotsky's theory as his starting point, Tony Cliff developed his own theory of 'deflected permanent revolution'. He argued that where a revolutionary working class did not exist, the intelligentsia could, in certain limited circumstances, take the leadership of the nation and lead a successful revolution {{in the direction of a}} state capitalist solution. The outcome of such a revolution would be deflected from the goal of a social revolution as envisaged in Trotsky's original work.|$|E

25|$|A {{diet that}} {{is rich in}} fruit and {{vegetables}} significantly {{reduces the risk of}} several diseases. Retinoids and vitamins A, C, and E are probably the most well-known and studied natural radioprotectors, but hormones (e.g., melatonin), glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and phytochemicals from plant extracts (including green tea and cruciferous vegetables), as well as metals (especially selenium, zinc, and copper salts) are also under study as dietary supplements for individuals, including astronauts, who have been overexposed to radiation. Antioxidants should provide reduced or no protection against the initial damage from densely ionizing radiation such as HZE nuclei, because the direct effect {{is more important than the}} free-radical-mediated indirect radiation damage at high LET. However, there is an expectation that some benefits should occur for persistent oxidative damage that is related to inflammation and immune responses. Some recent experiments suggest that, at least for acute high-dose irradiation, an efficient radioprotection by dietary supplements can be achieved, even in the case of exposure to high-LET radiation. Although there is evidence that dietary antioxidants (especially strawberries) can protect the CNS from the deleterious effects of high doses of HZE particles, because the mechanisms of biological effects are different at low dose-rates compared to those of acute irradiation, new studies for protracted exposures will be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the potential benefits of biological countermeasures.|$|E
