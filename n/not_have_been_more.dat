25|$|The timing {{for these}} performances, {{not just for}} Berlioz' career but also for French Romanticism in general, could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> apt. Berlioz {{was on the verge}} of {{producing}} his most Romantic works—as were the writers Vigny, Dumas, Gautier and several others in attendance that night. Shakespeare served as a model for French Romanticism, with Hugo extolling Shakespeare as a challenge to French classicism and the model for the new Romantic theater.|$|E
25|$|Besides Plato himself, Ariston and Perictione {{had three}} other children; these were two sons, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and a daughter, Potone, {{the mother of}} Speusippus (the nephew and {{successor}} of Plato as head of his philosophical Academy). According to the Republic, Adeimantus and Glaucon were older than Plato; the two brothers distinguished themselves in the Battle of Megara, when Plato could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 5 years old. Nevertheless, in his Memorabilia, Xenophon presents Glaucon as younger than Plato.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} {{was also}} reported by a Bengali sea captain, who {{wrote of the}} event later, but who had not recorded {{it at the time}} in the ship's log. Neither Vogel nor Hesse mention Krakatoa in any real detail in their other passages, and no other travelers at the time mention an eruption or evidence of one. (In November 1681, a pepper crop was being offered for sale by inhabitants.)

25|$|Still, the {{recalcitrant}} Burmese king {{tried to}} hold on to all his gains. To reinforce the Chinese front, he recalled from Siam a major portion of the army, which arrived back to Ava with the Siamese captives in July 1767. As it turned out, the remaining Burmese forces in Siam, which could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 at most, were too scattered among many garrisons, and too small to hold the conquered kingdom together. Indeed, the Burmese had little control outside their garrisons, and no control over the Siamese countryside where gangs of bandits roamed.|$|E
25|$|The {{size and}} {{dimensions}} of the treasures are heavily debated. According to British scientist, historian and sinologist Joseph Needham, the purported {{dimensions of the}} largest of these ships were 137m (450ft) by 55m (180ft), which would make them {{at least twice as}} long as the largest European ships {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century. These dimensions have been challenged on engineering grounds and on the reliability of their sources; some have claimed they could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 61–76 m (200–250 feet) or that they could only have been used on special occasions in the relative safety of the lower Yangtze River. However, in 1962 a large rudder was unearthed in the Treasure Ship Yard in Nanjing with dimensions corresponding with a 600-ft long ship.|$|E
25|$|Miss Anderson's {{debut as}} Gilda, {{although}} belated, could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America {{a decade ago}} to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and pinpoint precision {{that she is a}} master of the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and squarely on the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.|$|E

25|$|United's next {{match was}} on the road, against Montreal Impact, and the game could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> {{different}} than the nearly record-setting 6-4 shootout in United's prior game at home against RSL. The surprising, quick return from injury by goalie Bill Hamid and the sprained knee injury suffered by Fabian Espindola during training {{the day before the}} match virtually guaranteed that United would play a cautious, defensive-minded game. Statistics from the game bore that out, as United was outshot 25–1 by the home team, and possession was more than 2–1 in the Impact's favor. Amazingly though, United emerged with a 1–0 victory, thanks to strong goalkeeping and a first-half goal by Rolfe that finished off a play assisted by Arrieta's high pressure. Arrieta forced a turnover by the Montreal defense and directed the ball to Rolfe who scored what proved to be the game-winner on United's only shot of the game. United became the first team ever to win an MLS match having recorded only one shot all game.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's keenness {{to record}} his new {{material}} for Freewheelin paralleled a dramatic power {{struggle in the}} studio: Albert Grossman's determination to have John Hammond replaced as Dylan's producer at CBS. According to Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, [...] "The two men could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> different.

500|$|Having won {{the league}} {{championship}} and the FA Cup respectively in 1973–74, Revie and Shankly both left their clubs. On 4 July 1974, Revie was appointed {{as manager of}} the England national team in succession to Sir Alf Ramsey. Only eight days later, on 12 July, Shankly announced his retirement from football management {{in a press conference}} at Anfield. There was much speculation about how two such high-profile jobs would be filled. In one case, at Liverpool, there was a straightforward solution which resulted in their young team taking, in the words of Leeds United's own website, [...] "a vice like grip on the English game". At Leeds, however, the succession to Revie could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> controversial, especially when, as the Leeds website itself says of the club's ageing team, [...] "Leeds were on the wane".|$|E

Debatin had previously been a stripper on Friends, a stripper on That '70s Show, a stripper on Two and a Half Men, a madam on Veronica Mars, and a call girl on Boston Legal. In an interview, Debatin said playing Elizabeth was [...] "probably the best experience I have had in TV work", because {{the cast and crew}} were [...] "down to earth, fun, grateful to be there". Although actor Andrew Daly, who played Gordon the Ben Franklin impersonator, had already known John Krasinski, Angela Kinsey, B. J.

500|$|The Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) {{are among}} the first groups of work {{completed}} after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, {{a strong sense of}} personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found [...] "a world of motifs that could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> Japanese". Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and [...] "one big [...] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2003, Coleman told a Capitol Hill {{reporter}} {{that he was}} a [...] "99% improvement" [...] over Wellstone because he had a better working relationship with the White House. Many Wellstone supporters found this offensive and insulting, and at least one member of Congress urged Coleman to apologize. Coleman issued an apology, explaining that he was referring specifically to the reporter's question about the differences between his and Wellstone's relationship with the White House, and saying in part [...] "I would never want to diminish the legacy or memory of Senator Paul Wellstone, and I will accept full responsibility for <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> accurate in my comments."

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] was {{originally}} meant {{to serve as}} the second season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from a guest appearance by Robin Williams. Williams portrayed Robert Ellison, the husband of a slain woman tourist. Several news sources indicated Williams took on the role as a favor to Homicide executive producer Barry Levinson, who directed Williams in the films Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Toys (1992). But Fontana said Williams agreed to take the part based on the actor's positive impression of both the show in general and the [...] "Bop Gun" [...] script in particular. Fontana said of Williams, [...] "He read the script, responded instantly and said, 'When do you want me there?'. He could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> prepared or more of a gentleman to everyone, and he worked his tail off. That whole experience was a joy." [...] Williams himself said of the show, [...] "Visually, it was just so different from anything else on television." [...] Although Williams was primarily known for his comedic work, the Homicide producers and Williams himself consciously decided to remain true to the original script, rejecting the idea of adding humor or jokes to the episode. Williams' scenes were filmed over three days, and the actors found the part emotionally draining. Fontana said, [...] " [...] worked like a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us. It's very intense." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, the party {{struggled}} to ascend the inland ice over a treacherous surface with many hidden crevasses. The weather was generally bad; on one occasion all progress was halted for three days by violent storms and continuous rain. On 26 August Nansen {{concluded that there was}} now no chance of reaching Christianhaab by mid-September, when the last ship was due to leave. He therefore ordered a change of course, almost due west towards Godthaab (now Nuuk), a shorter journey by at least [...] The rest of the party, according to Nansen, [...] "hailed the change of plan with acclamation". They continued climbing, until on 11 September they had reached a height of [...] above sea level, the summit of the icecap with temperatures dropping to [...] at night. From then on the downward slope made travelling easier, although the terrain was difficult and the weather remained hostile. Progress was slow because of fresh snowfalls which made dragging the sledges as hard as pulling them through sand. By 26 September they had battled their way down {{to the edge of a}} fjord that ran westward towards Godthaab. From their tent, some local willows and parts of the sledges Sverdrup constructed a makeshift boat, and on 29 September Nansen and Sverdrup began the last stage of the journey, rowing down the fjord. [...] Four days later, on 3 October 1888, they reached Godthaab, where they were greeted by the town's Danish representative. His first words were to inform Nansen that he had been awarded his doctorate, a matter that [...] "could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> remote from my thoughts at that moment". The crossing had been accomplished in 49 days, making 78 days in total since they had left the Jason; throughout the journey the team had maintained careful meteorological, geographical and other records relating to the previously unexplored interior. The rest of the team arrived in Godthaab on 12 October.|$|E
