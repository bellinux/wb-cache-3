Using on-road {{data collected from}} 14 vehicles {{it was possible to}} establish trends of fuel use and emissions according with the power demand, using the Vehicle Specific Power methodology, which were further applied to estimate modal fuel consumption and NOx emission rates on Diesel vehicles. Comparing with real-world operation, fuel consumption estimates presented average absolute deviations lower than 10 %. Regarding NOx estimates, average absolute deviation is around 22 %. With this method it is possible to evaluate an individual vehicle using public data without have to measure it on-road and establishing links between certification and real-world vehicle operation...|$|E
40|$|Diesel Engine has got an {{increasingly}} wide utilization in engineering applications {{due to its}} thermal efficiency. Since there are some flaws on design of original engine, the emission performance of diesel engine is poor. In order to improve {{the performance of the}} diesel engine, the fuel injection advance angle of original engine is optimized, and a new advance angle of fuel injection is proposed in this paper. By numerical calculation with simulation of software FIRE, the effect of different combustion chamber structures on the cylinder pressure, temperature, accumulated heat release and the parameters such as <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> fraction was analyzed. From the simulation results, the optimized fuel injection advance angle had greatly improved the diesel combustion and emission performance. Finally, via experimental verification, the engine with optimized fuel injection advance angle gets better dynamic performance, as well as less emission than original machine. ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of intake charge {{dilution}} with carbon dioxide on the combustion and emission characteristics of a 4 -cylinder direct-injection diesel engine fueled with biodiesel, ethanol-biodiesel and methanol-biodiesel were investigated. With increase of intake CO 2 concentration, CO, HC, particulate mass concentration, particle number concentration and geometric diameter (GMD) of all fuels increased while NOx decreased obviously. After addition of methanol and ethanol in biodiesel, the <b>NOx,</b> particulate <b>mass</b> concentration and particle number concentration decreased at each intake CO 2 concentration, compared with biodiesel. Moreover, as the intake CO 2 concentration increased from 2 % to 5. 6 %, particulate mass concentration of the alcohol-biodiesel blends remained almost unchanged. It means {{that the combination of}} alcohol-biodiesel blends with intake charge dilution could reduce the NOx emission and maintains particulate mass concentration at a relatively low level.

40|$|Parameterization of {{lightning}} NO(x) in global chemical transport models requires {{a method to}} specify the temporal and geographic distribution of flash rates, an estimate of NO production per flash, and a method to specify the effective vertical distribution of NO production. Flash rate parameterizations using the upward convective cloud mass flux have been developed and tested for several GCM and assimilated meteorological data sets. This parameterization and others involving the cloud-top height and convective precipitation provide a generally acceptable climatological distribution of flashes after normalization with satellite data. However, considerable improvement in terms of geographic and temporal variability may be achieved in the future using cloud microphysics data available from next-generation GCMs. Cloud-resolving case-study simulations of convective transport and lightning NO production have yielded results which are directly applicable to the NO production per flash and the vertical NO distribution portions of the global model lightning parameterizations. In this work we have used cloud-resolving models (the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble Model (GCE) and MM 5) to drive an off-line cloud-scale chemical transport model (CSCTM). The CSCTM, in conjunction with aircraft measurements of NO(x) in thunderstorms and ground-based lightning observations, {{has been used to}} constrain the amount of NO produced per flash. Observed lightning flash rates have been incorporated into the CSCTM, and several scenarios of NO production per intracloud (IC) and per cloud-to-ground (CG) flash have been tested in each of several case study storms. The resulting NO(x) mixing ratios are compared with aircraft measurements taken within the storm (typically the anvil region) to determine the most likely NO production scenario. The range of values of NO production per flash (or per meter {{of lightning}} channel length) that have been deduced from the model will be shown and compared with values of production in the literature that have been deduced from observed NO spikes and from anvil flux calculations. Results show that on a per flash basis, IC flashes are nearly as productive of NO as CG flashes. Estimates of mean NO production per flash vary by a factor of three from one simulated storm to another. Vertical profiles of lightning <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> {{at the end of the}} 3 -D storm simulations have been summarized to yield suggested profiles for use in global models. These profiles show a larger percentage of the total lightning <b>NO(x)</b> <b>mass</b> in the free troposphere than those suggested by Pickering et al. (1998) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{equivalence}} between {{linear interpolation}} and B-spline functions of degree 1 is described. The equivalence {{is used to}} express interpolation based diesel engine NOX and soot emission models as B-spline functions, and to apply data fitting methods for B-spline functions to perform calibration of the models. This strategy leads to that the model calibration can be calculated directly by means of analytically solving a minimization problem. The B-spline representation also {{makes it possible to}} control the smoothness and extrapolation behavior of the interpolation maps in the models in a controlled manner. The models have been calibrated using measured steady-state data from a 5 -cylinder Volvo passenger car diesel engine with a displacement volume of 2. 4 liters, equipped with a turbocharger, an exhaust gas recirculation system, and a common rail injection system. The calibrated model for NOX emissions predicts the <b>NOX</b> <b>mass</b> ow with a root mean square error of 1. 6 mg/s, and the calibrated model for soot emissions predicts the soot mass ow with a root mean square error of 0. 65 mg/s.

METHODS: We evaluated total and traffic-specific particulate matter < 10 and < 2. 5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10, PM 2. 5), nitrogren dioxide, and nitrogen oxide concentrations predicted by Gaussian {{dispersion model}}s against fixed-site measurements at different locations, including traffic-impacted, urban-background, and alpine settings between and across cities. The model predictions were then used to estimate individual subjects ’ historical and cumulative exposures with a temporal trend model. RESULTS: Modeled PM 10 and NO 2 predicted at least 55 % and 72 % of the variability of the measured PM 10 and NO 2, respectively. Traffic-specific pollution estimates correlated with the NOx measurements (R 2 ≥ 0. 77) for background sites but not for traffic sites. Regional background PM 10 accounted for most PM 10 mass in all cities. Whereas traffic PM 10 accounted for < 20 % of the total PM 10, it varied significantly within cities. The modeling error for PM 10 was similar within and between cities.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the combined application of fumigation methanol and a diesel oxidation catalyst for reducing emissions of an in-use diesel engine. Experiments were performed on a 4 -cylinder naturally-aspirated direct-injection diesel engine operating at a constant speed of 1800  rev/min for five engine loads. The experimental results show that at low engine loads, the brake thermal efficiency decreases with increase in fumigation methanol; but at high loads, it slightly increases with increase in fumigation methanol. The fumigation method results in {{a significant increase in}} hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) emissions, but decrease in nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke opacity and the particulate mass concentration. For the submicron particles, the total number of particles decreases. In all cases, there is little change in geometrical mean diameter of the particles. After catalytic conversion, the HC, CO, NO 2, particulate mass and particulate number concentrations were significantly reduced at medium to high engine loads; while the geometrical mean diameter of the particles becomes larger. Thus, the combined use of fumigation methanol and diesel oxidation catalyst leads to a reduction of HC, CO, <b>NOx,</b> particulate <b>mass</b> and particulate number concentrations at medium to high engine loads.

40|$|The NOx {{emissions}} {{during the}} crank-start and cold fast-idle phases of a GDI engine are analyzed in detail. The NOx emissions {{of the first}} 3 firing cycles are studied under a wide set of parameters including the mass of fuel injected, start of injection, and ignition timing. The results show a strong dependence of the NOx emissions with injection timing; they are significantly reduced as the mixture is stratified. The impact of different valve timings on crank-start NOx emissions was analyzed. Late intake and early exhaust timings show similar potential for NOx reduction; 26 - 30 % lower than the baseline. The combined strategy, resulting in a large symmetric negative valve overlap, shows the greatest reduction; 59 % lower than the baseline. The cold fast-idle NOx emissions were studied under different equivalence ratios, injection strategies, combustion phasing, and valve timings. Slightly lean air-fuel mixtures result in a significant reduction of NOx. The engine-out emissions are highly sensitivity to combustion phasing. Initial retard results in lower mass NOx emissions up to CA 50 around 40 °CA aTDC-compression. After this point the increase in fuel consumption and the reduction on residual fraction reverse the trend leading {{to an increase in}} <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> emissions for later combustion phasing.

40|$|A 3 -D cloud scale {{chemical}} transport model {{that includes a}} parameterized source of lightning NO(x), based on observed flash rates {{has been used to}} simulate six midlatitude and subtropical thunderstorms observed during four field projects. Production per intracloud (P(sub IC) and cloud-to-ground (P(sub CG)) flash is estimated by assuming various values of P(sub IC) and P(sub CG) for each storm and determining which production scenario yields NO(x) mixing ratios that compare most favorably with in-cloud aircraft observations. We obtain a mean P(sub CG) value of 500 moles NO (7 kg N) per flash. The results of this analysis also suggest that on average, P(sub IC) may be nearly equal to P(sub CG), which is contrary to the common assumption that intracloud flashes are significantly less productive of NO than are cloud-to-ground flashes. This study also presents vertical profiles of the mass of lightning NO(x), after convection based on 3 -D cloud-scale model simulations. The results suggest that following convection, a large percentage of lightning NO(x), remains in the middle and upper troposphere where it originated, while only a small percentage is found near the surface.

In this study, a diesel/methanol compound combustion (DMCC) scheme was proposed and a 4 -cylinder naturally-aspirated direct-injection diesel engine modified to operate on the proposed combustion scheme. The effect of DMCC and diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) on the regulated emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC), carbon monoxide (CO), NOx and PM was investigated based on the Japanese 13 Mode test cycle. Certain unregulated emissions, including methane, ethyne, ethene, 1, 3 -butadiene, BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene), unburned methanol and formaldehyde were also evaluated {{based on the same}} test cycle. In addition, the soluble organic fraction (SOF) in the particulate and the particulate number concentration and size distribution were investigated at certain selected modes of operation. The results show that the DMCC scheme can effectively reduce <b>NOx,</b> particulate <b>mass</b> and number concentrations, ethyne, ethene and 1, 3 -butadiene emissions but significantly increase the emissions of THC, CO, NO 2, BTX, unburned methanol, formaldehyde, and the proportion of SOF in the particles.

Because the most significant portion of those costs are related to emissions monitoring and reporting, we are summarizing a preliminary estimate of costs in this memo. 1 To gather relevant information on monitoring costs and the possible impacts associated with using Part 75 for purposes of the model trading rule, relevant data were collected from existing reports, consultants directly involved in CEMs cost analysis, equipment vendors and affected sources under other programs that use the monitoring methodologies of interest. The costs associated with monitoring under the model trading rule are dependent upon both the existing programs that a unit is subject to and on the type of unit (e. g coal, base-load gas, peaking gas).

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{some specific}} data-driven model structures suitable for prediction of NOx and soot emissions from a diesel engine. The model structures {{can be described}} as local linear regression models where the regression parameters are defined by two-dimensional lookup tables. It is highlighted that this structure can be interpreted as a B-spline function. Using the model structure, models are derived from measured engine data. The smoothness of the derived models is controlled by using an additional regularization term, and the globally optimal model parameters can be found by solving a linear least squares problem. Experimental data from a five-cylinder Volvo passenger car diesel engine is used to derive NOx and soot models, using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to determine the optimal degree of regularization. The model for NOx emissions predicts the <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> flow with an average relative error of 5. 1 % and the model for soot emissions predicts the soot mass flow with an average relative error of 29 % for the mea- surement data used in this study. The behavior of the models for different engine management system settings regarding boost pressure, amount of exhaust gas recirculation, and injection timing has been studied. The models react to the dif- ferent engine management system settings in an expected way, making them suitable for optimization of engine manage- ment system settings.

40|$|Prediction of {{emissions}} from combustion systems {{is a complex}} problem involving the coupling between the flow field and chemistry. CFD analysis is the most commonly employed approach. However, it has the drawback that a very high computational cost prevents the use of detailed chemistry models. This master thesis, which focuses on NOx emissions, uses a more unconventional method {{of emissions}} prediction: Chemical Reactor Network (CRN). The advantage of this method is that, as it does not use fine discretisation, closure models nor fluid dynamics equations, it allows the implementation of detailed chemistry mechanisms. A CRN is developed first for a single-element Lean Direct Injection (LDI) combustor and then the CRN is adapted for a Multi-Point LDI (MPLDI) combustor. CFD and experimental results are used {{to set up the}} CRN. In the base case scenario, in which kerosene is the fuel choice, the NOx emissions predicted are very close to experimental measurements. This is particularly meaningful given the high uncertainties of modelling this highly complex turbulent combustion process. The developed CRN is also used to predict NOx emissions for the same combustor when the fuel choice is varied. Namely, the alternative fuels considered are kerosene enriched with hydrogen, methane and methane enriched with hydrogen. In comparison to kerosene, higher Lower Heating Values (LHVs) of these fuels lead to lower combustor temperatures for the same power input. Consequently, the thermal NOx pathway is weakened and the <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> flow generated is reduced. Nevertheless, these fuels with a higher LHV come with an increased operational risk that must be overcome before their implementation in aviation becomes possible.

Quantitative summaries {{of the effects of}} air pollution on lung function, however, are lacking due to large differences among studies. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the association between residential exposure to air pollution and lung function in five European birth cohorts with a standardized exposure assessment following a common protocol. METHODS: As part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) we analyzed data from birth cohort studies situated in Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom that measured lung function at 6 - 8 years of age (n = 5, 921). Annual average exposure to air pollution [nitrogen oxides (NO 2, <b>NOx),</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations of particulate matter with diameters < 2. 5, < 10, and 2. 5 - 10 mu m (PM 2. 5, PM 10, and PMcoarse), and PM 2. 5 absorbance] at the birth address and current address was estimated by land-use regression models. Associations of lung function with estimated air pollution levels and traffic indicators were estimated for each cohort using linear regression analysis, and then combined by random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Estimated levels of NO 2, NOx, PM 2. 5 absorbance, and PM 2. 5 at the current address, but not at the birth address, were associated with small decreases in lung function.

In the present work we go beyond aggregate sectors and now attribute exposure and early deaths to sectors, emissions species, time of emission, and location of emission. This enables determination of the emissions reductions that would have the greatest benefit by sectors, species, time and location. We apply a long-term adjoint sensitivity analysis with population exposure to PM 2. 5 in the contiguous US as the objective function, and calculate the four dimensional sensitivities (time and space) of PM 2. 5 exposure with respect to each emissions species. Epidemiological evidence is used to relate increased population exposure to premature mortalities. This is the first regional application of the adjoint sensitivity analysis method to characterize long-term air pollution exposure. (A global scale application has been undertaken related to intercontinental pollution.) We find that for the electric power generation sector 75 % of the attributable PM 2. 5 exposure is due to SO 2 emissions, and 80 % of the annual impacts are attributed to emissions from April to September. This suggests that burning of low sulfur coal has greatest benefit in the summer. In the road transportation sector, 29 % of PM 2. 5 exposure is due to NO, emissions and 33 % from ammonia (NH 3), which is a result of emissions after-treatment technologies. We estimate that the benefit of reducing NH 3 emissions from road transportation is ~ 20 times that of <b>NOx</b> per unit <b>mass.</b> 75 % of the road transportation ammonia impacts occur during the months October to March. We rank the states based on their contribution to the overall combustion emissions-attributable PM 2. 5 exposure in the US, and calculate that California contributes 12 %, Pennsylvania 7 % and Ohio 5. 8 %. We publicly release the sensitivity matrices computed, noting their potential use as a rapid air quality policy assessment tool. by Irene Constantina Dedoussi. Thesis: S.

40|$|In this work, a {{heavy-duty}} diesel engine was studied by employing CFD simulations on a closed volume engine segment. These simulations {{were used to}} evaluate both the effects from certain parameters on the wall heat transfer, and to examine how reduction of heat transfer would effect the engine performance and emission levels. In the first study, an initial investigation concerning the in- cylinder heat transfer was performed. This included a simple parameter study, performed to estimate the contribution of each parameter on the in-cylinder engine heat transfer. The parameter study revealed {{that most of the}} parameters selected do in-fact significantly affect the in-cylinder heat transfer. However, the effects on the indicated mean effective pressure, or indicated power output are different. Changing the amount of EGR and the swirl number did not show any dramatic effects on the indicated power output, while the injection duration showed much more dynamic effects on the indicated power output. In the second study, an investigation was made on the same heavy duty diesel engine, using both conventional diesel combustion mode and a partially premixed combustion (PPC) mode. Both combustion modes were validated using experimental data, before various heat flux boundary conditions were applied. These conditions were used to evaluate the engine response in terms of engine performance and emission levels for the different levels of heat rejection. The engine performance was measured in terms of specific fuel consumption and estimated power output, while the calculated net soot and accumulated <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> fractions were used for comparing the emission levels. The results showed improved efficiency for both combustion types, but only the PPC combustion mode managed that without increasing the production of NOx emissions severely. It was also noticed that the emission levels, for the baseline cases, were much lower for the PPC combustion mode than for the diesel combustion mode...|$|E
40|$|The {{world has}} {{witnessed}} a drastic techno-economic {{development in the}} last century due to which transport, trade and logistics have improved the lifestyle of the public. The Aviation industry has transformed the way of travelling across globe. Now it is more economic, comfortable and accessible to travel. Unfortunately, this revolution in aviation has brought various environmental issues; gaseous emissions and noise nuisance. These gaseous emissions disrupt the eco-system normal operating process. These gases have serious implications on the global environment and pose a great risk for human health. The NOx (NO and NO 2) is a major concern; especially around the airports locality, where it can create ozone gas which is harmful to the wellbeing. In spite of much advancement in fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel in recent years has contributed to an increase in total emissions. According to the ICAO, the contribution of civil aircraft to global greenhouse emissions has been estimated at around 2 %. The Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), which assists ICAO in the formulation of new policies on aircraft noise and emissions, has presented a number of policies in the last decade in order to curb down the aviation emissions. Due to these emission regulations, the aviation industry is looking into the ways to cut down its global emission imprints. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the suitability of the stirred reactor modelling approach to predict NOx emissions of a Rich-Burn Quick-Quench Lean-Burn (RQL) combustor concept. This paper further illustrates the axial variation in the main parameters such as equivalence ratio, <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> fractions and temperature for a NASA test rig experiment combustor geometry from the RQL combustor model based on the stirred reactor method. The paper also comments on the NOx emission regulations development by ICAO for different operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} for {{adverse effects of}} outdoor air pollution on lung function of children. Quantitative summaries {{of the effects of}} air pollution on lung function, however, are lacking due to large differences among studies. We aimed to study the association between residential exposure to air pollution and lung function in five European birth cohorts with a standardized exposure assessment following a common protocol. As part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) we analyzed data from birth cohort studies situated in Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom that measured lung function at 6 - 8 years of age (n = 5, 921). Annual average exposure to air pollution [nitrogen oxides (NO 2, <b>NOx),</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations of particulate matter with diameters < 2. 5, < 10, and 2. 5 - 10 μm (PM 2. 5, PM 10, and PMcoarse), and PM 2. 5 absorbance] at the birth address and current address was estimated by land-use regression models. Associations of lung function with estimated air pollution levels and traffic indicators were estimated for each cohort using linear regression analysis, and then combined by random effects meta-analysis. Estimated levels of NO 2, NOx, PM 2. 5 absorbance, and PM 2. 5 at the current address, but not at the birth address, were associated with small decreases in lung function. For example, changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) ranged from - 0. 86 % (95 % CI: - 1. 48, - 0. 24 %) for a 20 -μg/m 3 increase in NOx to - 1. 77 % (95 % CI: - 3. 34, - 0. 18 %) for a 5 -μg/m 3 increase in PM 2. 5. Exposure to air pollution may result in reduced lung function in schoolchildren...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{developed}} and validated a numerical procedure for {{the calculation of}} turbulent combustive flows in converging and diverging ducts. Through simulation of the heat transfer processes, the amounts of production and spread of NOx pollutants were measured. Also, this paper reported the results of a numerical investigation {{of the effects of the}} fuel Molecular Weight on NOx emissions in converging and diverging ducts. The fuels which were examined were methane, naphtha, and kerosene. The differential equations in the Von-Misses coordinate system were transformed to a cross-stream coordinate system in order to concentrate more grid lines near wall boundaries. A marching integration solution procedure employing the TDMA (Tri diagonal Matrix Algorithm) was used to solve the discretized equations. In this system, by using a general variable, mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species conservation equations were written in a general form. The nature of the governing differential equation was parabolic. The flow behavior in the vicinity of the walls was determined utilizing the wall function method. The turbulence model was the Prandtl Mixing Length model. Modeling of the combustion process, was done with Arrhenius and Eddy Dissipation method. Thermal mechanism was used for modeling the formation of the nitrogen oxides. Finite difference method and Genmix numerical code were used for numerical solution of equations. Our results indicated the important influence of the limiting diverging angle of diffuser on the coefficient of pressure recovery. Also, the converging and diverging effects of duct on its output behavior were indicated. Moreover, due to its intense dependence on the maximum temperature in the domain, the NOx pollutant amount attained also maximum level. Heavier fuel molecules, increased temperature and resulted in the increase of <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> fraction...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{chemistry}} simulations {{are performed}} for a Hector storm observed on 16 November 2005 during the SCOUT-O 3 /ACTIVE campaigns based in Darwin, Australia, {{with the primary}} objective of estimating the average production of NO per lightning flash during the storm which occurred in a tropical environment. The 3 -D WRF-AqChem model (Barth et al., 2007 a) containing the WRF nonhydrostatic cloud-resolving model, online gas- and aqueous-phase chemistry, and a lightning-NOx production algorithm is used for these calculations. An idealized early morning sounding of temperature, water vapor, and winds is used to initialize the model. Surface heating of the Tiwi Islands is simulated in the model to induce convection. Aircraft observations from air undisturbed by the storm are used to construct composite initial condition chemical profiles. The idealized model storm has many characteristics similar to the observed storm. Convective transport in the idealized simulated storm is evaluated using tracer species, such as CO and O 3 . The convective transport of CO from the boundary layer to the anvil region was well represented in the model, with a small overestimate of the increase of CO at anvil altitudes. Lightning flashes observed by the LIghtning detection NETwork (LINET) are input to the model and a lightning placement scheme is used to inject the resulting NO into the simulated cloud. We find that a lightning NO production scenario of 500 moles per flash for both CG and IC flashes yields anvil NOx mixing ratios that match aircraft observations well for this storm. These values of NO production nearly match the mean values for CG and IC flashes obtained from similar modeling analyses conducted for several midlatitude and subtropical convective events and are larger than most other estimates for tropical thunderstorms. Approximately 85 % of the lightning <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> was located at altitudes greater than 7 km in the later stages of the storm, which is an amount greater than found for subtropical and midlatitude storms. Upper tropospheric NO 2 partial columns computed from the model output are also considerably greater than observed by satellite for most tropical marine convective events, as tropical island convection, such as Hector, is more vigorous and more productive of lightning NOx...|$|E
40|$|Cloud-resolving case-study {{simulations}} of convective transport and lightning NO production have yielded results which are directly {{applicable to the}} design of lightning parameterizations for global chemical transport models. In this work we have used cloud-resolving models (the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble Model (GCE) and MMS) to drive an off-line cloud-scale chemical transport model (CSCTM). The CSCTM, in conjunction with aircraft measurements of NO x in thunderstorms and ground-l;>ased lightning observations, has been used to constrain the amount of NO produced per flash. Cloud and chemistry simulations for several case studies of storms in different environments will be presented. Observed lightning flash rates have been incorporated into the CSCTM, and several scenarios of NO production per intracloud (IC) and per cloud-to-ground (CG) flash have been tested for each storm. The resulting NOx mixing ratios are compared with aircraft measurements taken within the storm (typically the anvil region) to determine the most likely NO production scenario. The range of values of NO production per flash (or per meter of lightning channel length) that have been deduced from the model will be shown and compared with values of production in the literature that have been deduced from observed NO spikes and from anvil flux calculations. Results show that on a per flash basis, IC flashes are nearly as productive of NO as CG flashes. This result simplifies the lightning parameterization for global models (ie., an algorithm for estimating the IC/CG ratio is not necessary). Vertical profiles of lightning <b>NOx</b> <b>mass</b> {{at the end of the}} 3 -D storm simulations have been summarized to yield suggested profiles for use in global models. Estimates of mean NO production per flash vary by a factor of three from one simulated storm to another. When combined with the global flash rate of 44 flashes per second from NASA's Optical Transient Detector (OTD) measurements, these estimates and the results from other techniques yield global NO production rates of 2 - 9 TgN/year. Simulations of the photochemistry over the 24 hours following a storm has been performed to determine the additional ozone production which can be attributed to lightning NO. Convective transport of HOx precursors leads to the generation of a HOx plume which substantially aids the downstream ozone production...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and implementation of a new structure for data-driven models for NOX and soot emissions is described. The model structure is a linear regression model, where physically relevant input signals are used as regressors, and all the regression parameters are defined as grid-maps in the engine speed/injected fuel domain. The method of using grid-maps in the engine speed/injected fuel domain for all the regression parameters enables the models to be valid for changes in physical parameters that affect the emissions, without having to include these parameters as input signals to the models. This is possible for parameters that are dependent only on the engine speed and the amount of injected fuel. This means that models can handle changes for different parameters in the complete working range of the engine, without having to include all signals that actually effect the emissions into the models. The approach possibly also enables for the model to handle the main differences between steady-state engine operation and transient engine operation, thus possibly being able to use steady-state engine measurement data to calibrate the model, but still achieve acceptable performance for transient engine operation. This, however, is not evaluated in this study. The model structure has been used to create models for NOX and soot emissions. These models have been calibrated using measured steady-data from a 5 cylinder Volvo passenger car diesel engine with a displacement volume of 2. 4 liters, equipped with a turbocharger, an exhaust gas recirculation system, and a common rail injection system. The models estimate <b>NOX</b> <b>mass</b> flow with a root mean square error of 0. 0021 g/s and soot mass flow with a root mean square error of 0. 59 mg/s for the steady-state engine data used in this study. The models are capable of reacting to different calibratable engine parameters, and they are also fast to execute. This makes them suitable for development of engine management system optimization. The models could also be implemented directly into an engine management system. For comparison, three other fast models of different types for NOX and soot emissions have been implemented and evaluated...|$|E
