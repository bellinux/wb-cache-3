5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> a small population is not necessarily <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> the event of another war in Europe as {{part of what he}} termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} tensions escalated in {{the years}} leading to World War II, the Belgian government again announced its intention to remain <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> the event of war in Europe. The military was reorganised into a defensive force and the country left several international military treaties it had joined {{in the aftermath of}} World War I. Construction began of defences in the east of the country. When France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Belgium remained strictly neutral while mobilising its reserves.|$|E

On September 19, the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington to forestall a peace conference scheduled there on September 21 and to arrest the state's junior Senator, John C. Breckinridge. A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made, and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|During the Genêt episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} his Cabinet, issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793.

Washington eventually recognized that supporting either Great Britain or France was a false dichotomy. He would do neither, thereby shielding the fledgling U.S. from, in his view, unnecessary harm.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the occupied territories to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were <b>neutral.</b> <b>In</b> order to stop this, the Germans began work on a barbed wire and electric fence across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Greece, like Bulgaria, {{initially}} maintained neutrality {{during the}} conflict.

The king admired Prussian militarism and was anticipating a quick German victory. The king wanted Greece to remain <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> the conflict, a strategy favorable to Germany and the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Stewart and Ross {{argued with}} Nogueira and the Portuguese chargé d'affaires in London, José Manuel de Villas-Boas de Vasconcellos Faria. On 8 September, Nogueira said the Portuguese were {{accepting}} Reedman as a Rhodesian representative, {{but were not}} defining his status as they wished to remain <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> what they regarded as an exclusively Anglo-Rhodesian problem. So {{far as he could}} see, Nogueira said, Portugal had done no harm to British interests. Stewart firmly told Nogueira that Britain expected Portugal to make a statement within 24 hours saying that it would not deal with Reedman while he remained off the British Embassy staff. Nogueira replied that his government was not going to accord official diplomatic recognition to Reedman, and that Dupont understood this. Ross now threatened to involve NATO if Portugal did not thoroughly explain its conduct. Unmoved, Nogueira said this surprised him; if the British were so keen to have Reedman on the staff at their embassy, he answered, that was down to them. Portugal was totally <b>neutral</b> <b>in</b> the affair, he insisted.|$|E
