5|$|The {{important}} {{mathematical constant}} , sometimes called Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the <b>natural</b> <b>logarithm.</b> Although exponentiation of e could, in principle, be treated the same as exponentiation of any other real number, such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E

25|$|Consider the <b>natural</b> <b>logarithm</b> {{function}} mapping the real numbers to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real {{is not a}} real number, so the <b>natural</b> <b>logarithm</b> function doesn't associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the <b>natural</b> <b>logarithm</b> function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, {{but it is a}} partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the positive reals (that is, if the <b>natural</b> <b>logarithm</b> function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the <b>natural</b> <b>logarithm</b> is a total function.|$|E

25|$|Before 1748 and the {{publication}} of Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite, the <b>natural</b> <b>logarithm</b> was known {{in terms of the}} area of a hyperbolic sector.
