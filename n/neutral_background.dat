5|$|The upper {{creature}} {{may be a}} dog or a cat. Blood {{pours out}} of its mouth onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable {{in the details of}} its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground of the canvas, and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, <b>neutral</b> <b>background</b> typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the tightness of the flat, nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.|$|E
25|$|In the two {{monochrome}} seasons, Reeves was occasionally {{filmed in}} front of aerial footage on back-projection screen, or against a <b>neutral</b> <b>background</b> which would provide a matte which would be optically combined with a swish-pan or aerial shot. That footage was matted onto various backgrounds depending {{on the needs of}} the episode: clouds, buildings, the ocean, mountain forests, etc., which he would appear to fly by. For the color episodes, the simpler and cheaper technique of a neutral cyclorama backing was used, usually sky-blue, or black for night shots. Techniques for landings involved Reeves jumping off a ladder or holding an off-camera horizontal bar and swinging down into frame.|$|E

[...] Golf Ball is a depiction of a golf ball using a Mondrianesque set {{of black and white}} arcs to depict the three-dimensionality of the subject. However, the <b>neutral</b> <b>background</b> manipulates the image and diminishes the volumetric characteristics by stripping the viewer of his perspective. It is described as a [...] "pure graphic mark on a gray ground" [...] as well as a [...] "totality of abstract marks." [...] Lichtenstein described Golf Ball as [...] "the antithesis of what was thought of as having 'art meaning'" [...] because of its lack of perspective.|$|E

40|$|The {{present report}} {{concerns}} an experimental comparison between subjective and objective measures of standard colour test samples chosen to represent hard copy images. Three attributes of colour, hue, chroma and lightness were examined. The study investigates {{the correlation between}} the subjective and colorimetric evaluation, in CIELAB uniform colour space. Subjective and objective tests are reported for tests using Pantone colour swatches, corresponding to the basic hues of an IT- 8 chart, and additional swatches chosen to cover a wide gamut. Psychophysical investigations, using white, grey and black backgrounds, were carried out with a panel of 11 observers and are compared with the results of colorimetric evaluation. Experimental results show linear relations, with very good correlation between objective and subjective results, for hue determination, but less good correlation for lightness and chroma. The effects of the luminance of <b>neutral</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> on subjective judgements, are also shown. The evaluation of results is extended to a consideration of CIECAM 2002 colour appearance variables, expected to relate to observers' assessments of the test colours seen against <b>neutral</b> <b>backgrounds</b> differing in luminance...|$|R

2500|$|The ontbijtje, or [...] "little breakfast", {{is a type}} {{of still}} life that was popular in both the {{northern}} and southern Netherlands showing a variety of eating and drinking vessels and foods such as cheese and bread against a <b>neutral</b> <b>background.</b> Osias Beert, Clara Peeters, Cornelis Mahu and Jacob Foppens van Es (c. 1596–1666) were all artists who made these types of painting. More elaborate are the pronk, or [...] "sumptuous", still life. This style developed in the Dutch Republic, and was brought to Antwerp by Jan Davidsz de Heem. They show, on a larger scale than earlier works, complex compositions of expensive items, rare foods, and fleshy, peeling fruit. These paintings are related to vanitas and transience motifs.|$|E

40|$|Detection of angry, {{happy and}} sad faces among <b>neutral</b> <b>backgrounds</b> was {{investigated}} in three single emotion tasks and an emotion comparison task using schematic (Experiment 1) and photographic faces (Experiment 2).

Evidence for preferential detection of negative emotion in general was found only with schematic faces. The present {{results are consistent with}} the notion that the detection of displays of anger, and to some extent sadness, does not reflect on a pre-attentive mechanism, but {{is the result of a}} more efficient visual search than is the detection of positive emotion...|$|R

50|$|In the laboratory, {{photography}} is typically {{used as a}} cataloging tool or a means of illustrating objects on a small to microscopic scale, such as individual fossils, grains, or microstructures. Equipment is often similar, perhaps {{with the addition of}} a macro lens and/or a tripod or otherwise stabilized camera mounting system. Small studio-like areas with <b>neutral</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and artificial lighting are often used to emphasize minute structures and details. Material coatings, such as water, alcohol, or ammonium chloride, are also often selectively applied to bring out certain aspects or features of the object being photographed. At even smaller scales, a range of analytical techniques, including microscopy, scanning electron miscroscopy (SEM), and X-ray, UV, and IR photography can be used to accomplish the goals of geophotography.|$|R

Inside this 'logical world' action is allowed to happen for no apparent reason, tensions build between the environment and its inhabitant, and the influences on the work are intentionally mixed.

40|$|In this study, the crispening {{effect was}} clearly {{observed}} when 38 neutral-coloured sample pairs with only lightness differences were assessed under 5 <b>neutral</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of different lightness values.

The colour differences of the same pair assessed under different backgrounds could differ by a factor of up to 8 for a sample pair with low lightness.

40|$|This {{proceedings}} covers four distinct topics {{related to}} an electron neutrino ap-pearance experiment in a long baseline neutrino beam. First we present a like-lihood that was created in order to distinguish charged current νe interactions from <b>neutral</b> current <b>background.</b> We compared the likelihood variables with the Super-K atmospheric neutrino data, when it was possible. We also optimized the cut on the likelihood variable. Second, we present {{a study of the}} sensitivity of the T 2 KK experiment to CP violation and mass hierarchy {{as a function of the}} off-axis angle using the optimized likelihood cut. Third, we present a short study which compares two methods to estimate the <b>neutral</b> current <b>background.</b> In one case we use the full Super-K atmospheric Monte Carlo, in the other case we use a matrix multiplication method similar to that used by the GLoBES software. Finally, we compare the results achievable by the T 2 KK setup with the results obtained for a long baseline beam from Fermilab to DUSEL, using the same anal-ysis framework. 1...|$|R

40|$|Although we {{know that}} {{emotional}} events enjoy a privileged status in our memories, we still have much to learn about how emotional memories are processed, stored, and how they change over time. Here we show a positive association between REM sleep and the selective consolidation of central, negative aspects of complex scenes. Moreover, we show that the placement of sleep is critical for this selective emotional memory benefit. When testing occurred 24 hr post-encoding, subjects who slept soon after learning (24 hr Sleep First group) had superior memory for emotional objects compared to subjects whose sleep was delayed for 16 hr post-encoding following {{a full day of}} wakefulness (24 hr Wake First group). However, this increase in memory for emotional objects corresponded with a decrease in memory for the <b>neutral</b> <b>backgrounds</b> on which these objects were placed. Furthermore, memory for emotional objects in the 24 hr Sleep First group was comparable to performance after just a 12 hr delay containing a night of sleep, suggesting that sleep soon after learning selectively stabilizes emotional memory. These results suggest that the sleeping brain preserves in long-term memory only what is emotionally salient and perhaps most adaptive to remember...|$|R
