5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>state</b> {{planners}} {{envisioned a}} system of arterial roads in Utica that would include connections to Binghamton and Interstate 81. Due to community opposition, only parts of the highway project were completed, including the North–South Arterial Highway running west of the city. Six <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> highways, one three-digit interstate highway, and one two-digit interstate highway pass through Utica. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Route 49 and State Route 840 are east–west expressways running along Utica's northern and southern borders, respectively, and the eastern terminus of each is in the city. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Route 5 and its alternate routes—State Route 5S and State Route 5A—are east–west roads and expressways that pass through Utica. The western terminus of Route 5S and the eastern terminus of Route 5A are both in the city. With Route 5 and Interstate 790 (an auxiliary highway of Interstate 90), <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>State</b> Route 12 and State Route 8 form the North–South Arterial Highway.|$|E
