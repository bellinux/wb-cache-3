40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon formulates ambitious {{goals for}} the European Union. It holds that the EU shall offer its {{citizens}} an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of citizens is guaranteed in combination with appropriate measures with respect to crime control. This wording – which explicitly establishes a relationship between citizenship, free movement and a common area of justice – raises certain expectations. Still, the promotion of free movement also induces <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> jurisdiction.

This contribution analyses this problem in light of the legality principle, a cornerstone of every criminal law system, which is also included in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Its central argument is that with the transfer of powers from the national to the European level and the increasing horizontal intertwinement of national criminal justice systems and the resulting intensified cooperation, it is also increasingly difficult to protect EU citizens against arbitrary investigation, prosecution, conviction and punishment in Europe’s area of freedom, security and justice. EU Charter rights therefore need to be interpreted in light of their new, transnational setting.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} and test a model of group processes (e. g. conflict), emergent states (e. g. trust), and group context (e. g. connectedness) to better understand the mechanisms that underlie the traditionally <b>negative</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A total of 27 workgroups of a Dutch telecommunications company participated in a survey. To assess trust as a mediator between conflict and performance bootstrapping analysis was used. In addition, the moderating role of the three connectedness types was investigated with hierarchical regressions. Findings – The results suggest that trust partially mediates the effect <b>of</b> task <b>conflict</b> and fully mediates the effect <b>of</b> relationship <b>conflict</b> on performance. Furthermore, trust is less affected by task conflict when group members are highly cognitively connected and less affected by relationship conflict when group members are highly task connected. Research limitations/implications – This research implies that task and cognitive connectedness decrease the <b>negative</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> on trust, and hence, performance. Shortcomings include discussing the causality between conflict and trust, and the possibility of different perceptions among group members regarding group phenomena. Practical implications – The findings suggest that managers can help to provide circumstances in which conflict is not necessarily destructive for intragroup trust and performance. Originality/value – Provides one of the first empirical examinations of the mediating role of trust in the relationship between task and relationship conflict and perceived group performance. Additionally, examines if connectedness (the level of active involvement of group members with each other) buffers the <b>negative</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> on trust...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the Articles 30, 34 and 36 of the EC-Treaty and <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> between the Community and the Member States. It deals {{especially with the}} delimitation between community concerns and national concerns {{in the field of}} non-tariff barriers to trade in community law. A new perspective concerning the application of Articles 30 and 34 of the EC-Treaty is introduced. It is argued that the application of Articles 30 and 34 of the Treaty could be based upon the criterion that national measures may not interpret with the possibilities of the producer to chose market for his product and may not interfere with the possibilities of the purchaser to choose between domestic and imported goods. This new criterion is derived from an investigation of the case law of the EC-Court concerning the Articles 30, 34 and the exception rules according to Article 36 and the so-called Cassis-doctrine (also called the rule of reason). Concerning agricultural goods, the principle of pre-emption of community law is decisive when delimiting community concerns from national concerns. In relation to national price- and profit regulations concerning agricultural goods the case law of the EC-Court must in general be more pragmatic than the conceptualist-federalist approach which was introduced in the Galli-judgement. This is i. e. due to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It seems that the EC-Court has been inspired by the case law of the U. S. Supreme Court, when developing its own case law in this particular field of community law. As the political integration at a community level increases, it may be assumed that the importance of the above mentioned rules of the EC-Treaty to promote integration is reduced. Too much harmonization can counteract market integration. Decentralization can thus also protect the achievement of the objectives of the EC-Treaty concerning the free movement of goods...|$|R
