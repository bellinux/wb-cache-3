5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936.

5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must decide whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target {{for the time being}} by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of his success with United, Bruce was {{contacted}} by Jack Charlton, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that he chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{was born}} and raised in Crystal City, Missouri, a small town 45 miles south of St. Louis where he excelled at {{basketball}} from an early age.

He earned a gold medal as a member of the 1964 Olympic basketball team and was the NCAA Player of the Year in 1965, when Princeton finished third in the NCAA Tournament.

5|$|Bure {{held out}} {{well into the}} 1998–99 season until he was traded on January 17, 1999, to the Florida Panthers, with Bret Hedican, Brad Ference, and Vancouver's third-round choice in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft (Robert Fried) for Ed Jovanovski, Dave Gagner, Mike Brown, Kevin Weekes, and Florida's first-round choice in the 2000 draft (Nathan Smith). Talks between Burke and Bryan Murray, {{general manager of the}} Panthers, had begun in late-December. After the trade was completed, Bure {{explained}} that he felt alienated from Canucks' management after arriving in North America having defected from Russia. He claimed he had been in Los Angeles for two weeks before any Canucks' representative came to see him, as well as several bitter contract negotiationsparticularly those of 1994. He also claimed that someone within the Canucks' management planted the constant allegations that he threatened <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> during the 1994 playoff run.

5|$|Hamlett was {{a three-year}} letterman in {{football}} at Meadowdale High School in Lynnwood, Washington as a tight end. He earned second-team All-WesCo League 3A honors his junior season. He recorded 43 receptions for 648 yards and six touchdowns his senior year, earning second-team All-State, Associated Press Class 3A honorable mention All-State, and first-team All-WesCo League 3A honors. He also played defensive end his senior year, which {{was his first}} year playing on the defensive line. Meadowdale High finished with an 11–1 record his senior year; winning the first 11 games before losing in the Class 3A state quarterfinals. He was selected {{to participate in the}} 2010 Class 3A/4A East–West All-Star Football Game as part of the West Team but chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the game. In addition to lining up at the normal tight end spot, Hamlett was also used split out wide at the wide receiver spot while at Meadowdale.|$|E
5|$|His best {{sport as}} a youth was soccer, while he also played {{baseball}} and golf.

He was selected by the St. Michael's Majors in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Draft, but chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the OHL so as to preserve his American college eligibility. Instead, he joined the Junior A Bramalea Blues of the Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League (OPJHL) where he was named the league's {{rookie of the year}} as a 15-year-old in 1997–98.

5|$|Historically this {{is nothing}} new, as the tense {{relations}} between Armenia and Azerbaijan because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting {{in the absence of}} players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012 was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to Kazan, with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan. More recently, Azerbaijan chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the 2015 World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor, and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship 2014 in Yerevan. Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 Chess World Cup in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.|$|E

5|$|On October 5, 2011, Universal Pictures {{announced}} that Tower Heist {{would be made}} available for home viewing via parent company Comcast's video on demand system three weeks after its theatrical debut at the rental cost of $59.99. The move was announced as a test case, to be conducted only in Atlanta and Portland. The move met with criticism from cinema chains over concern that the test and any further future implementation would impact ticket sales. The following day, Cinemark Theatres the third largest cinema chain in the United States threatened to not show the film at all if Universal proceeded with the test. On October 11, 2011, several independent theater chains, including Galaxy Theatres, Regency Theatres and Emagine Theatres, and small cinema houses representing approximately 50 screens across the country, also threatened <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Tower Heist. The following day the chains were joined by 950-screen National Amusements theater chain. In response, Universal Pictures released {{a statement saying that}} they would no longer pursue the proposed test.|$|E

5|$|Tallon's form saw him {{selected}} for the 1948 Ashes tour {{as part of the}} side that would become known to cricket history as the Invincibles. Tallon was the first-choice wicket-keeper, with Saggers as his deputy. Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature. As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling, since it would swing more. As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches. McCool was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a Test on the tour, depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the stumps to his Queensland team-mate.|$|E
5|$|The American Federation of Netball Associations (AFNA) hosts two tournaments each year: the Caribbean Netball Association (CNA) Under 16 Championship and the AFNA Senior Championship. The CNA {{championship}} involves {{two divisions}} of {{teams from the}} Caribbean islands.

Jamaica, which has lost only once in the tournament, decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the 2011 tournament. The AFNA Senior Championship includes Canada and the USA along with the Caribbean nations. The tournament serves as a qualifier for the World Championship. Jamaica, with its high ranking, {{does not have to}} qualify; this leaves two spots to the other teams in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battalion's playoff elimination, Hodgson was {{assigned}} to the Canucks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, for their 2009 playoff run. Making his professional debut with the Moose in Game 1 of the semi-finals against the Houston Aeros, he notched an assist on the game's first goal for his first professional point. He followed up with his first professional goal the next night, a wrist shot against Aeros goaltender Nolan Schaefer, in a 5–2 victory. While Hodgson started on the fourth line for the Moose, he quickly moved his way up to the second line with fellow Canucks first-round pick Michael Grabner. Advancing past the Aeros, Moose Head Coach Scott Arniel chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Hodgson in Game 4 of the Calder Cup Finals against the Hershey Bears. Arniel explained the decision was attributed to fatigue on Hodgson's part from a lengthy season in the juniors (including the 2009 World Juniors and a lengthy OHL playoff run). He returned the next game to help the Moose stave off elimination with a goal in a 3–2 Game 5 victory. Manitoba went on to lose the Calder Cup in Game 6 by a 4–1 score. Hodgson's assisted on the Moose's lone tally by Mário Bližňák.|$|E
