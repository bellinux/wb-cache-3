The two mountains are a popular traverse with cross-country skiers. The mountain is well seen from the A82 road and the Kings House Hotel, showing its steep and craggy northern buttress of Sròn na Creise. For many years the translated meaning of the mountains name from the Gaelic was unknown, however Irvine Butterfield <b>now</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> “creis” means grease or fat and refers to the rich grazing land around the hill which was used in the past by Glen Coe herdsman to fatten their cattle.|$|E

He <b>now</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the morpheme -sai attached to the main verb of a clause merely marks the clause as 'old information', {{and is not a}} nominalizer at all (or a marker of embedding). More recently, the German linguist Uli Sauerland of the Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft at Humboldt University (Berlin) has performed a phonetic reanalysis of experimental data in which Pirahã speakers were asked to repeat utterances by Everett.

6000|$|In the Senate of the United States, in 1856, Judge Trumbull in a speech, {{substantially}} if not directly, put {{the same}} interrogatory to Judge Douglas, {{as to whether}} the people of a Territory had the lawful power to exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution? Judge Douglas then answered at considerable length, and his answer will be found in the [...] "Congressional Globe," [...] under date of June 9, 1856. The Judge said that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution or not, was a question to be decided by the Supreme Court.

It seems to me that there is no difficulty in deciding it. In a variety of ways he said that it was a question for the Supreme Court.
