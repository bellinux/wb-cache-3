5|$|Although {{historically}} the U.S. {{state of}} Connecticut is <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> known to fall casualty to tornadoes, more than 100 of these powerful storms {{have affected the}} state in modern history, resulting in at least 48deaths, 780injuries, and more than $500million in damage. This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete, as official records date back only to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> seen by viewers, the set also {{includes}} a used letter board that shows contestants which letters are remaining in play, a scoreboard that is visible from the contestants' perspective, and a countdown clock. The used letter board is also used during the bonus round, and {{in at least one}} case, helped the contestant to see unused letters to solve a difficult puzzle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs can cause {{abnormally}} high {{blood levels of}} potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> cause hyperkalemia by themselves {{in the setting of}} normal renal function and euvolemic state.|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, {{parsnips}} {{were believed}} to be an aphrodisiac. However, parsnips do <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> feature in modern Italian cooking. Instead, they are fed to pigs, particularly those bred to make Parma ham. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of Chinese parsnip is used as an herbal medicine ingredient.|$|E
5|$|Medical imaging is not {{routinely}} {{needed as}} it is expensive and does <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> change how plantar fasciitis is managed. When the diagnosis is not clinically apparent, lateral view x-rays of the ankle are the recommended imaging modality to assess for other causes of heel pain such as stress fractures or bone spur development.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybe semilanceata fruits solitarily or {{in groups}} on rich and acidic soil, {{typically}} in grasslands, such as meadows, pastures, or lawns. It is {{often found in}} pastures that have been fertilized with sheep or cow dung, although it does <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> grow directly on the dung.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm is <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> suicidal behaviour, {{although}} {{there is the possibility}} that a self-inflicted injury may result in life-threatening damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E

5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. While Brazil bans since 1999 {{whatever}} pathologization or attempted {{treatment of}} sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code, the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> {{attract the attention of}} the public or major scrutiny; therefore, it has not been the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.|$|E

5|$|Minneapolis's Oak Street Cinema, a volunteer-run {{repertory}} cinema, ran films {{seven days}} per week until cutbacks in programming {{had to be made}} for financial reasons. A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed Take-Up Productions, which was established to promote showing films <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> screened in larger movie houses. The organization began with outdoor screenings, starting with Watermelon Man, which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop, and then began to rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul area, including the Riverview, Heights, and Parkway. Some screenings, such as that of Lawrence of Arabia and a series of Alfred Hitchcock films, drew hundreds of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Surgery (by craniotomy, open brain surgery) may {{be offered}} {{based on the}} risks of {{treatment}} {{as determined by the}} Spetzlerâ€“Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger lesions that are close to important brain structures and have deep venous drainage. High grade lesions (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> offered in those cases. Radiosurgery (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if the lesion is small but close to vital structures. Finally, embolization may be used on small lesions that have only a single feeding vessel.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is <b>not</b> <b>typically</b> as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E

As stated here, {{the order of the}} steps is <b>not</b> determined. <b>Typically,</b> it proceeds from LSB to MSB, starting at i = 0; the multiplication by 2i is then typically replaced by incremental shifting of the P accumulator to the right between steps; low bits can be shifted out, and subsequent additions and subtractions can then be done just on the highest N bits of P.There are many variations and optimizations on these details.....|$|R
