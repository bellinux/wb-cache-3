30|$|Second, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> is important.

However, some researchers have found that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and divorce risk has a U-shaped nonlinear relationship and that either too many or too few children are not favorable to the stability of a marriage (Thornton 1977). Intuitively, an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> increases a couple’s marriage capital and improves and promotes the couple’s feelings and interdependence, but these gains may have a diminishing marginal effect. As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> increases, the burden <b>of</b> raising <b>children</b> becomes increasingly heavy and the negative impact from children also increases. Therefore, the nonlinear relationship may be more realistic.|$|R

25|$|Some {{authors have}} noted the {{connection}} of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time.

This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also {{made it more difficult}} for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources.

30|$|Based on simple calculation, {{when the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> {{is equal to}} 4.3, the {{quadratic}} curve drops down to the lowest point.
