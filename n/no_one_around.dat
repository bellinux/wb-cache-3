5|$|Homer {{returns to}} {{apologize}} but is turned {{away by a}} fearful Burns. With <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around,</b> Burns learns to do things himself and soon becomes completely self-reliant. After thanking Homer for making him learn that he can fend for himself, Burns fires Smithers when he returns from his vacation. Smithers and Homer engage in a fight within Burns' office which ends when Burns accidentally falls out the window. Burns is seriously injured and becomes reliant on Smithers once again. In gratitude, Smithers sends Homer a fruit basket.|$|E
25|$|As the {{election}} of 1920 approached, Wilson momentarily imagined that a deadlocked Democratic convention might nominate him for a third term with a campaign focused on the League of Nations. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> the President adequately clarified for {{him that he was}} too incapacitated, had insufficient support, and that the League defeat was irreversible. In retirement, Wilson harbored hopes for a White House run in 1924 despite the absence of substantial support.|$|E
25|$|Chainfire {{continues}} {{the story of}} Richard {{in his attempt to}} teach the people that their lives are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E
500|$|By September, {{the band}} was {{experiencing}} financial difficulties. Financial planners Norton Warburg Group (NWG) had invested £1.3–3.3 million (up to £ in contemporary value) of the group's money in high-risk venture capital to reduce their tax liabilities. The strategy failed {{as many of the}} businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 percent. [...] "We made Dark Side and it looked as if we'd cracked it," [...] recalled Waters. [...] "Then suddenly these bastards had stolen it all. It looked as if we might be faced with huge tax bills for the money that had been lost. Eighty-three per cent {{was a lot of money}} in those days and we didn't have it." [...] Pink Floyd terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of uninvested funds. [...] "By force of necessity, I had to become closely involved in the business side," [...] recalled Gilmour, [...] "because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> us has shown themselves sufficiently capable or honest to cope with it, and I saw with Norton Warburg that the shit was heading inexorably towards the fan. They weren't the first crooks we stupidly allied ourselves with. Ever since then, there's not a penny that I haven't signed for. I sign every cheque and examine everything." ...|$|E

He would frequently meet with political figures but would always greet them seated.

Yes, it’s not fun playing the outsider who has nobody, and no strong leg to stand on," [...] said Braun.

2500|$|Every January {{for many}} years, Scruggs' {{birthday}} was celebrated by {{a party at}} his home on Franklin Road in Nashville. After a buffet dinner, guests would gather {{in the living room}} for an informal [...] "pickin' party" [...] where some of country music's best known stars would sing and play with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> but family and close friends. The attendees over the years included Tom T. Hall, Bela Fleck, Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Tim O'Brien, Emmy Lou Harris, Mac Wiseman, Marty Stuart, Porter Wagoner, Bill Anderson, Jerry Douglas, Josh Graves and many others. At Scruggs 80th birthday party in 2004, country singer Porter Wagoner said, “Earl is to the five-string banjo what Babe Ruth was to baseball.

After Randal leaves, Dante proceeds to count out the register and does not notice another person entering the store. Upon Dante's informing the latecomer that the store is no longer open, the customer shoots Dante, killing him in cold blood. Afterward, the killer makes off with all {{the money from the}} cash register. The sequence ends with Dante's dead face looking off past the camera; after the credits roll - the soundtrack over it being a cash register making noises - a customer (played by Smith, wearing glasses, in a ponytail and a baseball jersey, with his beard shaved off) comes into the store, sees <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> (Dante is lying dead behind the counter) and steals some cigarettes.|$|E

2500|$|McReynolds's rudeness was not {{confined}} to colleagues on the Court.

[...] The indignant chairman replied: [...] "Mr Justice, you wouldn't be a member of this club if it wasn't for your official position. The members of this club have put up with your discourtesy for years, merely because you are a member of the Supreme Court. But I'm telling you now that the next time there is a complaint against you, you'll be suspended from the privileges of the golf course." [...] Justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter transferred from the Chevy Chase club to Burning Tree because McReynolds [...] "got disagreeable even beyond their endurance".|$|E

Wellington, the incarnation of activity himself, spared <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> him, and from early dawn until late at night they were on horseback, carrying orders and bringing back reports. At night their quarters were sometimes in a village hut, sometimes in a straggling château, which afforded accommodation to the commander-in-chief and his whole staff.|$|E
60|$|For {{several minutes}} {{after he had}} stepped on to the wooden platform, Mr. Hamilton Fynes showed no {{particular}} impatience to continue his journey. He stood {{in the shadow of}} one of the sheds, looking about him with quick furtive glances, as though anxious to assure himself that there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> who was taking a noticeable interest in his movements. Having satisfied himself at length upon this point, {{he made his way to}} the London and North Western Railway Station, and knocked at the door of the station-master's office. The station-master was busy, and although Mr. Hamilton Fynes had the appearance of a perfectly respectable transatlantic man of business, there was nothing about his personality remarkably striking,--nothing, at any rate, to inspire an unusual amount of respect.|$|E
60|$|Whether it was Mr. Smirkie's popularity, or {{the general}} {{estimation}} {{in which the}} Babington family were held, or the delight which is taken by {{the world at large}} in weddings, there was a very great gathering at Babington church, and in the Squire's house afterwards. Though it was early in March,--a time of the year which, in the eastern counties of England, is not altogether propitious to out-of-doors festivity,--though the roads were muddy, and the park sloppy, and the church abominably open to draughts, still there was a crowd. The young ladies {{in that part of the}} world had been slow in marrying lately, and it was felt that the present occasion might give a little fillip to the neighbourhood. This was the second Suffolk young lady that Mr. Smirkie had married, and he was therefore entitled to popularity. He certainly had done as much as he could, and there was probably <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>around</b> who had done more.|$|E
