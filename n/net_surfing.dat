40|$|The vaunted Information Revolution is {{more than}} Web <b>surfing,</b> <b>Net</b> games, and dotcoms. Indeed, it is the {{foundation}} for an economic and social transformation on a scale comparable to the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century. As a culture we have learned from earlier such transformations {{and it is important}} to recognize those lessons and chart a path toward intellectual and practical mastery of the emerging world of information. This course will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to begin to address the key issues associated with the Information Revolution. Issues will range from the theoretical (what is information and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what are the basic architectures of computing and networks?). Successful completion of this ""gateway"" course will give you, the student, the conceptual tools necessary to understand the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age, providing a foundation for later study in Information or any number of more traditional disciplines...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to explore a}} case from Salyan district on resin tapping and its contribution to local and national economy. Resin tapping and its related activities like extraction, collection and transportation {{are one of the}} major sources of employment for a large number of rural poor people. Based on the quantity of resin collected and exported outside the district, revenue is generated to central as well as local government and Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs). In the mean time, some issues and challenges have been identified at local level regarding the sustainability of resin tapping. It, therefore, concludes that some practical measures are necessary to overcome the issues and challenges so that resin tapping could be done in a sustainable manner. Sources of information of this paper are records of District Forest Office and rosin companies and <b>net</b> <b>surfing</b> as secondary sources; field observation, interviews with CFUGs and resin collectors as primary sources...|$|E

However, because of the large amount of information and because of slow network connections, this activity tends to be very time consuming and frustrating. We argue that the capability of supporting cooperative WWW searching session is important to save time in organization and to retrieve data [...] ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the mobile access to the Internet can be foundin that it allows one to conduct information search in a ubiquitous manner. Accordingly, the time for <b>net</b> <b>surfing</b> required to gain necessary informationthrough the Internet would be reduced when the mobile access is combinedwith the ordinary PC access appropriately. As the mobile devices continueto advance rapidly, it then becomes quite important {{to find a way to}} assessthe impact of the mobile access to the Internet on the performance of ecommerce. Among such performance indicators, of particular interest wouldbe the conversion rate, where the conversion means that a customer takesa firm action at the website desired by the management of the e-commerce,e. g. to become a member, to place an order and the like. The purpose ofthis paper is to develop and analyze a mathematical model for describing theinformation search process through the Internet with or without the mobileaccess. The analytical framework enables one to assess the impact of themobile access on the information search completion time and the conversionrate.

40|$|Title: Methodological Analysis of Web Surveys: The Example of Estonian Public Broadcasting Audience Surveys. The Internet, and {{technology}} in general, are shaping several aspects of our daily lives — including the way surveys are conducted. We can see that different research methods have {{found their way to}} the Internet; what is more, the data presented in this thesis indicates that web surveys are widely used. The thesis at hand sets out to explore the methodological point of view of web surveys. Importance of this topic is enhanced by the fact that web surveys are often used by people with little survey experience. A web survey’s sampling can be unforeseeably large, often creating an illusion of very accurate and good quality results. Web surveys offer a large number of options that can be beneficial for those who know how to utilize them. For example, one advantage appears already in the course of questionnaire creation: a surveyor can choose between numerous audiovisual elements and use them to simplify the realization of their survey goal. For example, Estonian Public Broadcasting was able to carry out a survey where the respondents were asked to assess audio clips. On the other hand, it is important to identify the line beyond which the option to add elements might have an unwanted effect on the results. Web survey designs are made up of several important and specific nuances: what is the proper response format, how to avoid multiple submissions, what is the most appropriate color solution etc. The best part of methodological researches that tackle the subject of web surveys investigate sampling creation strategies. The Internet provides a surveyor with a multitude of methods for respondents’ recruitment, both probability-based and non-probability-based. In general, web surveys are not considered to be an appropriate method of research; however, if the surveyor wishes to represent the whole population, a web survey can be part of a mixed-mode survey. This kind of survey was used, for example, in the most recent population and housing census in Estonia. Nonetheless, the target groups’ access to the Internet is imperative to the success of a web survey. In Estonia, ca ¾ of the population uses the Internet, <b>net</b> <b>surfing</b> and browsing is more popular among younger age groups, but the users’ age difference is diminishing. Though the response rate is an important aspect of quantitative surveys, this paper does not give a clear overview of this particular data. Using literature as basis for such assessments is complicated, because researchers define the term differently; neither can one rely on options provided by surveys, because these are not homogenous. What is more, response activity (rate) is affected by numerous other factors, making it difficult to identify a specific method’s influence. Various influencing factors have been summarized in the chapter about response rate. It is simpler to obtain data about response rates of web panel samplings, because recruiters have access to survey invite recipients’ figures. For the most part, web surveys function as cheap and swift means of research; however, people can easily neglect the matter of results’ quality. The chapter about quality looks into this issue more thoroughly — examples from the USA show that providers of web survey panels have been exposed to external pressure, which, in the end, has undermined the quality of survey results. It is important to emphasize that web survey clients (the party ordering a survey) should learn more about the specifics of web surveys and related samplings. Also, survey clients and providers should work hand in hand to uplift web panel participants’ interest and will to partake. Abuse of e-mail addresses that have been added to databases for purposes unrelated to research can cause negative attitude towards web surveys and ultimately damage the practice’s success...|$|E
