40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the hybrid approach {{in a large}} population of patients with melanoma {{in the head and}} neck, on the trunk, or on an extremity who were scheduled for sentinel node (SN) biopsy. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Between March 2010 and March 2013, 104 patients with a melanoma, including 48 women (average age, 54. 3 years; range, 18. 5 - 87. 4 years) and 56 men (average age, 55. 2 years; range, 22. 4 - 77. 4 years) (P =. 76) were enrolled after obtaining written informed consent. Following intradermal hybrid tracer administration, lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography were performed. Blue dye was intradermally injected {{prior to the start of}} the surgical operation (excluding patients with a facial melanoma). Intraoperatively, SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> were initially pursued by using gamma tracing followed by fluorescence imaging (FI fluorescence imaging) and, when applicable, blue-dye detection. A portable gamma camera was used to confirm SN sentinel node removal. Collected data included number and location of the preoperatively and intraoperatively identified SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> and the intraoperative number of SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> that were radioactive, fluorescent, and blue. A two-sample test for equality of proportions was performed to evaluate differences in intraoperative SN sentinel node visualization through FI fluorescence imaging and blue-dye detection. Results Preoperative imaging revealed 2. 4 SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> (range, 1 - 6) per patient. Intraoperatively, 93. 8 % (286 of 305) of the SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> were radioactive, 96. 7 % (295 of 305) of the SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> were fluorescent, while only 61. 7 % (116 of 188) of the SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> stained blue (P <. 0001). FI fluorescence imaging was of value for identification of near-injection-site SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> (two patients), SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> located in complex anatomic areas (head and neck [28 patients]), and SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> that failed to accumulate blue dye (19 patients). Conclusion The hybrid tracer enables both preoperative SN sentinel node mapping and intraoperative SN sentinel node identification in melanoma patients. In the setup of this study, optical identification of the SN sentinel <b>node</b> <b>s</b> through the fluorescent signature of the hybrid tracer was superior compared with blue dye-based SN sentinel node visualization...|$|R

30|$|Proof According to Theorem 12, the <b>node</b> <b>S</b> 1, 1 {{forwarded}} {{the largest}} data packet, so the {{maximum energy consumption}} is in this <b>node.</b> Therefore, <b>node</b> <b>S</b> 1, 1 uses the optimal duty cycle to guarantee the maximum network lifetime.

30|$|For example, in Figure 1, {{multiple}} flows {{pass through}} the Node R 1 -to-R 2 link. These flows share a slot for transferring packets. Assume that the network employs the minimum length schedule. Then, Node R 1 allocates only one slot for transferring packets to node R 2. It is also assumed that <b>Node</b> <b>S</b> 1 and <b>Node</b> <b>S</b> 2 are supposed to send a packet to Node R 1 in the 1 st slot and the 2 ndslot, respectively. Moreover, Node R 1 is scheduled to send a packet to Node R 2 in the 3 rd slot. It is also assumed that, in each node, {{the arrival of a}} packet from application layer is concurrent with the start of a frame. In the 3 rdslot in the frame, Node R 1 has two packets to send:one from <b>Node</b> <b>S</b> 1 and another from <b>Node</b> <b>S</b> 2. However, <b>Node</b> R 1 can transfer the packet received from <b>node</b> <b>S</b> 1 in the current frame and can transfer the packet received from <b>Node</b> <b>S</b> 2 in the next frame because it can transfer only one packet per link in a frame as prescribed by the minimum length schedule. In conclusion, the minimum length schedule may work well in single-hop wireless networks with high throughput and short delay. However, in multihop wireless networks, it may cause secondary queuing delay because only one common slot is allocated for multiple flows.|$|R
