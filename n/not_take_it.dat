Upon Lisa's advice, Bart breaks up with Greta, who does <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> well.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's early {{preoccupation with}} the occult subsided, and he became more {{interested}} in other religions, {{although it is not}} known whether he practised any. He was enthusiastic about Parsi culture, but became disillusioned with Parsis after visiting India in 1932. He embraced only a few of aspects of Zoroastrianism, and in later years he was interested in Roman Catholicism, although he did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up. For much of his life he practised yoga, but it is not known what branch of it.|$|E

5|$|Béla IV died on 3 May 1270, and Ladislaus's {{father was}} crowned king two weeks later; the new monarch, however, could not {{stabilize}} his rule. Béla IV's closest advisors — Duchess Anna, and Béla IV's former palatine, Henry Kőszegi — left Hungary and sought assistance from Anna's son-in-law, King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The newly appointed Ban of Slavonia, Joachim Gutkeled, also turned against Stephen V and kidnapped Ladislaus {{in the summer}} of 1272. Gutkeled held Ladislaus in captivity in the fortress of Koprivnica in Slavonia. Historian Pál Engel suggests that Joachim Gutkeled planned to force Stephen V to divide Hungary with Ladislaus. Stephen V besieged Koprivnica, but could <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> Stephen fell seriously ill and died on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} college, VanDerveer {{took a year}} off, with a plan {{to return}} to law school. When she ran out of money she returned home. When her parents realized she was doing little beyond playing chess and sleeping, they urged her to help with her sister Marie's basketball team. Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, as the girls did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> seriously, but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E

25|$|First {{introduced}} to cricket aged 10 or 11, Rajitsinhji first represented {{the school in}} 1883 and was appointed captain in 1884; he maintained this position until 1888. While he may have scored centuries for the school, the cricket was not of a particularly high standard, and {{very different from that}} played in England. Ranjitsinhji did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> particularly seriously and preferred tennis at the time. No-one was certain what would become of him once he left the college but his academic prowess presented the solution of moving to England to study at Cambridge University.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} {{the trauma of the}} expedition, Charles Houston was keen to make another attempt on K2, and {{requested}} permission for further expedition in 1954. He was extremely disappointed that a large Italian expedition had booked the mountain that year. The Italian expedition was successful, and while Houston had permission for 1955 he did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up, and gave up mountaineering in order to concentrate on his career researching high altitude medicine. Pete Schoening, however, returned to the Karakoram in 1958 and, with Andy Kauffman made the first ascent of Gasherbrum I; at 8080m the highest first ascent ever made by an American team.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of flying the Jolly Roger {{was adopted by}} some other submarines during World War I, but became more widespread in World War II. Flotilla commanders began to issue flags to submarines, and procedures were drafted for usage. Although some sources report {{the use of the}} flag being a universal practice among British submariners, some submarine captains did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up as the felt the practice was boastful and the achievements could not always be confirmed. Usage of the Jolly Roger was copied by some Allied submarines during World War II, and the flag has also been used by submarines from other Commonwealth nations.|$|E

25|$|Blackburn {{was born}} on 26 July 1918. He {{was the son of}} Brigadier Arthur Seaforth Blackburn VC and Rose Ada Blackburn (née Kelly). His father was at that time a Commissioner of the now defunct Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. His father had {{previously}} been a prominent legal practitioner in South Australia. Blackburn was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide and was an undergraduate at St Mark's College at the University of Adelaide. He graduated with First Class Honours in English Literature from the University of Adelaide. He won the John Howard Clark Prize as the candidate who was placed highest in the final examination. He was chosen as the Rhodes Scholar for South Australia in 1940, but did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up immediately because of the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Lombard {{contingent}} had left Nicomedia, a separate force under William II of Nevers arrived at Constantinople. He had crossed into Byzantine territory over the Adriatic Sea from Bari, and the march to Constantinople {{was free of}} incident, an unusual occurrence for a crusade army. He quickly marched out to meet the others, but in fact never caught up with them, although the two armies must have been {{close to each other}} on numerous occasions. William briefly besieged Iconium (Konya) but could <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> and he was soon ambushed at Heraclea Cybistra by Kilij Arslan, who had just defeated the Lombards at Mersivan and was eager to stamp out these new armies as soon as possible. At Heraclea almost the entire contingent from Nevers was wiped out, except for the count himself and a few of his men.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, Soviet forces battled {{fiercely}} {{to capture}} Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, but could <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> {{which became a}} topic so sensitive to Stalin that he refused to allow his commanders to speak of it. The Germans held out in the subsequent Battle of Budapest until February 1945, when the remaining Hungarians signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. Victory at Budapest permitted the Red Army to launch the Vienna Offensive in April 1945. To the northeast, the taking of Belarus and western Ukraine permitted the Soviets to launch the massive Vistula–Oder Offensive, where German intelligence had incorrectly guessed the Soviets would have a 3-to-1 numerical superiority advantage that was actually 5-to-1 (over 2 million Red Army personnel attacking 450,000 German defenders), the successful culmination of {{which resulted in the}} Red Army advancing from the Vistula River in Poland to the German Oder River in Eastern Germany.|$|E

25|$|In Tutrakan the {{citizens}} allowed the Turks {{to install a}} small garrison but then they killed the Turkish soldiers and prepared for siege. Ali Pasha immediately burned the surrounding fields and soon the starving town had to surrender. After this success they advanced to the west towards Nicopolis, {{one of the strongest}} Bulgarian fortresses along the Danube. The defence was organized by Ivan Shishman who was currently in the town. Although the Ottomans had nearly 30,000 men they could <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> and Ali Pasha had to seek reinforcements from Murad himself. According to Seadeddin the Sultan marched to Nikopol with an enormous army firmly decided to seize the town at all costs. When Ivan Shishman faced the new enemy he sought a truce. Murad agreed and the Bulgarians saved Nikopol but were forced to cede another key Danubian fortress, Dorostolon. However, when Ali Pasha reached Silistra, the Bulgarians refused to surrender the town. Murad besieged Nikopol for a second time and this time Ivan Shishman agreed to the Ottoman conditions and a Turkish garrison was installed in Silistra.|$|E
