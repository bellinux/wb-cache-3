5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the shutdown, there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E

5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E

Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E

His eight elder siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, and Jean. John asked to be the newborn's godfather, a request his parents honored, though they did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> his request to name the baby George Washington Kennedy (the newborn had entered the world on the first president's 200th birthday); they named him after their father's assistant instead.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, at {{its peak}} in late 1944 {{there were more than}} 150 spotter {{stations}} deployed on islands and mainland territories throughout Papua, New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea.

However, in September 1944 the Australian military decided that it would <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> American requests for the unit to serve outside the Australian area of operations and it was subsequently withdrawn after being left without a future operational role. Returning to Australia, it was disbanded in April 1945.

5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E
5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta {{in any way that}} would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season.

In 1965, {{it was decided to}} expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E

5|$|Shortages of {{manpower}} {{also led to}} the establishment of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) in August 1941. AWAS members filled a wide range of roles to allow the Army to redeploy male soldiers to fighting units. While they mainly worked in clerical and administrative positions, and auxiliary roles such as drivers and signallers, many served in anti-aircraft batteries, operating radars and searchlights but not the guns themselves. While Blamey sought to have members of the AWAS posted overseas from early 1941 onwards, the Australian Government did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> this until 1945. As a result, only about 400 of the 24,000 women who joined the AWAS served outside Australia. The AWAS was reduced in size following the war, and was finally disbanded on 30 June 1947. Colonel Sybil Irving commanded the AWAS from September 1941 until 1947. In total some 35,000 women served in the Army, making up about 5 percent of the force.|$|E
5|$|The Borneo Campaign of 1945 was {{the last}} major Allied {{campaign}} in the SWPA. In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July, the Australian ICorps, under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, attacked Japanese forces occupying the island. Allied naval and air forces, centred on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, 1TAF and the US Thirteenth Air Force also played important roles in the campaign. The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo's oilfields and Brunei Bay to support the US-led invasion of Japan and British-led liberation of Malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945. The Australian Government did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> MacArthur's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July 1945, however, and its decision to not release the 6th Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead.|$|E

One of the oldest is the Mackinaw Trail, named after a former Indian trail that ran from Saginaw to Mackinaw City and Sault Ste. Marie. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US131. The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City, using a logo incorporating a trout for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the State Senate did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> the proposal.

Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were unreasonable to Galland. Göring, prompted by the desires of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible. Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, as he always did, defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E
5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's {{right to}} erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross {{was different from the}} Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied {{to erect a}} cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W.
