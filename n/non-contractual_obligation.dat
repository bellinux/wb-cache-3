From 11 January 2009, the Rome II Regulation creates a harmonised set of rules within the European Union to govern choice of law in civil and commercial matters (subject to certain exclusions) concerning non-contractual obligations, including specific rules for tort/delict and specific categories of tort/delict, unjust enrichment, negotiorum gestio and culpa in contrahendo.

The most important {{law in this}} area is the Rome II Regulation on the law applicable to <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> that applies since 11 January 2009. The Regulation creates a common regime of conflict of law rules for most civil and commercial <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations.</b> The general rule is the law of the place of injury (lex loci damni). The rule is subject to two exceptions, the common habitual residence exception and a general escape clause based on the closer connection principle. Special rules are laid down for some <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations,</b> such as product liability, unfair competition and acts restricting free competition, environmental damages, infringement of intellectual property rights, unjust enrichment, negotiorum gestio and culpa in contrahendo. However, in most cases, the parties may agree on the law applicable to the non- contractual obligations between them.

40|$|Precontractual {{liability}} is liability {{that arises}} {{out of a}} harmful conduct that occurs during the formation period of a contract. Where the harmful conduct occurs during international negotiations, a conflict of laws issue arises. The determination of the applicable law to precontractual liability can be a complex and tedious task, {{which is why the}} European Legislature has provided a special conflict-of-law rule in Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation on the applicable law to non-contractual obligations. Through this provision, the European Legislature aims to achieve uniformity between EU Member States, while providing an appropriate conflicts rule. The present essay assesses the European Legislature’s attempt at codification and offers a commentary of Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation. It {{comes at a time when}} the Commission is scheduled to submit a report on the application of the Rome II Regulation to the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Economic and Social Committee. This essay will show that the Legislature has displaced the traditional rules of European private international law by adopting a contractual connecting factor in order to determine the applicable law to a <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligation.</b> Indeed, the European Legislature has, for the purposes of European private international law, chosen to characterize culpa in contrahendo as non-contractual, but has chosen to determine the applicable law to this <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> on the basis of a contractual connecting factor. Thus, Article 12 (1) of the Rome II Regulation has, in fact, chosen to submit claims arising out of culpa in contrahendo to the lex contractus in negotio. According to this provision, the applicable law to claims arising out of culpa in contrahendo is the law of the contract that was under negotiation. In spite of its advantages, the rule provided by Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation lacks flexibility. The lack of escape devices and the relative inapplicability of the second paragraph of Article 12 of the Rome II Regulation make this rule a rigid one whose application cannot be displaced whenever it reaches inappropriate results...|$|E
40|$|The {{last five}} years have {{witnessed}} {{a decrease in the}} parallelism between EU competition and consumer law policies. Recent policy and legislative developments in these politically distinct areas of EU law highlight that effective consumer protection and redress – where it does not currently exist at the level of Member States – will increasingly rely upon effective regulation and enforcement of anti-competitive business practices via EU competition law. Indeed recital 7 of Regulation EC 1 / 2003 requires Member States to ensure that private individuals can pursue private redress mechanisms via national courts. Consequently, the increasing prevalence of private enforcement – namely private claims for damages – as a means of regulating market activity and enhancing consumer protection between the Member States necessitates reference to Community rules on private international law. In 2002 Withers commented that the ‘cause of action [for a claim in tort for breach of competition law] is very much at an incipient stage of development'. The same could be said for analogous rules of EU private international law. Indeed, at the time Withers's valuable analysis of jurisdiction and applicable law rules alluded to the need for many other significant ‘additional procedural and evidential issues’ to be addressed to ensure the effectiveness of private enforcement as a remedy for victims of anti-competitive behaviour. Nevertheless, in accordance with Treaty obligations, the EU has continued to implement measures designed to facilitate private enforcement of competition laws. Furthermore it has also continued to implement measures pursuant to judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. The most recent development connecting both measures is Regulation EC 864 / 2007 on the Law Applicable to Non-Contractual Obligations (hereafter the Rome II Regulation), which provides rules to determine the applicable law of a <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligation.</b> A key development offered by this new, communitarised private international law instrument is contained in Article 6. Article 6 of the Rome II Regulation determines the applicable law that will apply when private, final consumers or their representatives claim damages against businesses for anti-competitive practices or acts which have restricted competition, thereby impeding consumer choice...|$|E

The unification of conflict standards, as an instrument of the international private law, can be understood as a certain sign of unification of direct standards. Conflict standards do not govern directly the rights and obligations of the parties to a contract in international private law but they answer the question by which legal order the given relationship should be abided and therefore they provide certain degree of foreseeability and safety. The first (general) part called "European international private law - from conventions to regulations" is dedicated to development of the unification of conflict standards within the European community. At present, the unification of the conflict issue is represented by two new-adopted Roman regulations concurring to the Roman convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations.

With this, the Regulation - at first sight - seems to recognize the special status of industrial relations within the system of private international law.

50|$|The {{doctrine}} {{has been}} attributed to Pope Innocent IV, who seems at least to have helped spread the idea of persona ficta as it is called in Latin. In canon law, the doctrine of persona ficta allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty. Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of delict due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> to surrounding communities. This effectively moved such liability to individuals acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since individuals were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of being guilty of negligence and excommunicated.|$|R
40|$|The general {{conflict}} of law rule on <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> conveniently «reinterprets» the tradition, by balancing {{the need for}} foreseeability of the applicable law and legal certainty, on the one hand, {{and the demand for}} flexibility and proper consideration of the specific features of each case, on the other hand. In order to adequately appreciate the relevance of the rule in question within the context of Rome II Regulation, the paper stresses that Art. 4 has a merely residual character. Firstly, such article will apply only to cases not covered by the special {{conflict of}} law provisions contained in the same Regulation, which concern specific and very frequent hypothesis of liability. Indeed, product liability, unfair competition and acts restricting free competition, environmental damage, infringement of intellectual property rights and industrial action fall outside its scope of application. Secondly, the general conflict of law rule applies only when the parties have not exercised their freedom of choosing the law applicable to <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations.</b> According to Art. 14 of the Regulation, the choice of the applicable law will prevail over the criteria established by Art. 4. At this purpose, the paper underlines that Rome II Regulation ensures that the agreement of the parties concerning the applicable law is formed without prejudice to the «weaker» parties involved. Such a protective aim is pursued in a double perspective. Where the parties are exercising a commercial activity, the agreement can be reached also before the event giving rise to the damage occurs, provided that it is «freely negotiated»; otherwise, the agreement can be entered into only after the event giving rise to the damage occurred. However, it has to be mentioned that – since, after the event giving rise to the damage, the parties involved will have conflicting interests – it can be foreseen that the rule at issue {{will not be able to}} frequently exclude the application of the criteria codified by Art. 4.

40|$|The Community {{legislator}} {{is carrying}} out an ambitious project {{with the aim}} of laying down a regulatory framework for international relations governed by private law in order to provide them with greater legal certainty, without relinquishing the particular characteristics of the different national legislations. Within this framework, several initiatives have been taken for the unification of conflict of law, both in property and family matters, which are at different processing stages (Regulations, Proposals for Regulations or Green Papers). This work consists of a serious and rigorous analysis of all these initiatives, proposing keys and principles to solve them in order to make them known. The first part analyses the initiatives of the Community legislator in the field of property law. This field is at a later processing stage and this allowed the analysis of the content of the already approved Regulation concerning <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> –Regulation (EC) No 864 / 2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> (Rome II), as well as the proposal for a Regulation that is meant to replace very soon the Rome Convention of 19 June 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I). The second part deals with family law. Some of the initiatives in this field, which are analysed in this work, are at an early processing stage –Green Paper on succession and wills of 1 March 2005, or the Proposal for a Council Regulation of 17 July 2006 as regards jurisdiction and applicable law in matrimonial matters. Other initiatives have already become Regulations that regulate some other partial aspects of family law without dealing with applicable law –Council Regulation (EC) No 2201 / 2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility.

40|$|Abstract: Cross-border {{road traffic}} {{accidents}} raising jurisdictional issues represent about 1 % of road traffic accidents in the EU 27. The direct costs of these accidents {{can be set}} at approximately € 450 million yearly, of which € 150 million are due to medical expenses and damage to property, whereas € 300 million represent loss earnings and foregone production. If one also {{takes into account the}} indirect costs of cross-border road traffic accidents, namely the physical and psychological consequences for victims and their relatives, the total economic impact of those accidents amounts to about € 1. 04 billion annually. Several cross-border road traffic accidents create a risk of undercompensation of the non-resident victim, due to differences in the standard of living {{as well as in the}} calculation of the quantum of damages in member states. The problem of victims’ undercompensation in the event of a cross-border traffic accident has so far been approached mostly under the aegis of the proposed harmonisation of European Tort Law, especially within the debate on the “Rome II” regulation on <b>non-contractual</b> <b>obligations.</b> Already during first reading, the European Parliament proposed to address this issue by mandating the application of the law of habitual residence of the victim when assessing the quantum of damage awards...|$|R
