Our aim was to describe factors associated with UAI with multiple partners in a large sample of MSM from 38 European countries recruited for an online survey in 2010. Methods: Data are from the European Men-Who-Have-Sex-With-Men Internet Survey (EMIS). The analysis was restricted to men who reported any anal sex with a non-steady partner in the past 12 months, and who were either never diagnosed with HIV, or who {{had been diagnosed with}} HIV more than 12 months ago, reported a detectable viral load and did not exclusively serosort (n[*]=[*] 91, 477). Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare men reporting UAI with four or more (4 +) non-steady partners to two comparison groups: a) no UAI with non-steady partners, and b) UAI with 1 - 3 non-steady partners. Results: Overall, 9. 6 % of the study population reported UAI with 4 + partners in the past 12 months. In both models, factors consistently associated with this behaviour were: having been diagnosed with HIV, lower educational levels, use of nitrite <b>inhalants,</b> <b>drugs</b> associated with sex and parties, or erectile dysfunction drugs in the past 4 weeks, using sex-on-site venues in the past 4 weeks, buying or selling sex in the past 12 months, having experienced physical violence due to sexual attraction to men in the past 12 months, reporting sexual happiness, being out to all or almost all of one’s acquaintances, and knowing that ART reduces HIV transmissibility. Conclusions: Effective antiretroviral treatment drastically reduces HIV transmission for men diagnosed with HIV, irrespective of partner numbers.

Yet little is actually known about this area. Inaccurate statistics are prevalent throughout the drug world, but perhaps no greater inaccuracy exists than on the high school level (Blum & Associates, 1969, p. 332). Most studies of adolescent drug use are based on college populations. Much less research has been done with younger teenagers: those on the high school and Junior high school level. Yet this is where knowledge of the drug user is most important. It is necessary to be able to describe the drug user in order to predict who will be the future drug user. Knowing the extent of drug use in the schools today is important in planning preventive drug education and treatment programs for tomorrow. This paper will bring together the existing data on high school drug use as reported in studies of the last five years.

Using a variety of fixed-effects models that exploit variations over time and between siblings and twins, {{the results show that}} gun availability at home increases the propensity to commit crime by about two percentage points for juveniles but has no impact on damaging property. The results indicate that it is unlikely that gun availability is merely a measure of the unobserved home environment because gun availability does not influence other risky or bad behaviors of juveniles such as smoking, drinking and fighting, being expelled from school, lying, and having sex. No support is found for the hypothesis that gun availability decreases the propensity for being victimized. In fact, the results show that having access to guns increases the probability of being cut or stabbed by someone and of someone pulling a knife or gun on the juvenile.

40|$|Background Substance {{abuse by}} Americans Indians {{has long been}} studied, {{especially}} alcoholism. Most Quiluete tribal members live on or relatively close to the reservation. This {{may contribute to the}} number of people who end up using substances to cope with the limitations and lack of opportunity on the reservation. Several elders were interviewed to develop a better understanding of the culture and the effect substance abuse has had on it. Methods The random survey was designed to gather information about substance abuse by Quiluete tribal members. The survey was available to all Quiluete tribal members aged 12 and older. Tribal members of other tribes, who receive their health care at the Quileute Health Clinic, were also encouraged to answer the survey. People who had never used or abused substances were also encouraged to complete the survey. The completed surveys were dropped into a sealed collection box at the Quileute Health Clinic. The information was then analyzed by the researcher. Results Only twenty surveys were completed and returned for analysis. Seventeen of the surveys noted having used alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, crack, methamphetamine, <b>inhalants,</b> or prescription <b>drugs</b> in excess or 2 ̆ 2 illegal drugs. 2 ̆ 2 Two people of the seventeen have not been able to stop using. Mostly the lack of activities has contributed to this abuse. Counseling and rehabilitation have been helpful to most and the Quileute culture plays a vital role in encouraging a drug free environment. Conclusions The Quileute tribe has similar problems with substance abuse that other tribes also have. Part of the substance abuse develops from trans-generational trauma and abuse, either physical or sexual, among tribal members. By addressing some of the social and economic issues, improvements can be made. The hope is that by increasing substance abuse prevention education, the substance abuse numbers will decline while keeping the Quileute culture active, along with the support of a drug free reservation, and advocating more family activities...|$|R

The present report provides information on the perceived availability of substances, early onset of substance use and prevalence estimates of substance use (cigarettes, alcohol, illicit <b>drugs,</b> <b>inhalants,</b> new psychoactive substances and pharmaceuticals). The descriptive information includes indicators of intensive substance use and prevalence estimates of internet use, gaming and gambling by country and gender. Secondly, overall ESPAD trends between 1995 and 2015 are presented. For selected indicators, ESPAD trends are shown based on data from 25 countries that participated in at least four (including the 2015 data collection) of the six surveys. Finally, for some indicators, country-specific trends are shown. In the 2015 ESPAD data collection, 96 043 students took part from 35 countries: Albania, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroes, Finland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Ukraine. For comparative reasons, the tables of the 2015 ESPAD results contain, in addition to country-specific estimates, an average across all participating countries as well as prevalence estimates for two non-ESPAD countries: Spain and the United States. The instruments used in the Spanish and US surveys overlap to a large degree with the ESPAD questionnaire, and the methodology used in all three surveys allows for rough comparisons across the countries.

40|$|Dopamine (DA) neurons in the {{striatum}} mediate several {{functions of}} the brain and have been linked to a host of neurological disorders including Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease and addiction, both of which occur as a result of dysfunction in the DA system. In the present study, our first objective was to understand how the striatal DA system adapts to acute and repeated administration of inhalant toluene. The use of toluene as <b>inhalant,</b> like other <b>drugs</b> of abuse, is known to perturb DA neurotransmission in the brain reward pathway. However, the exact mechanism underling toluene 2 ̆ 7 s influence on striatal DA neurotransmission is unknown. The current work utilized behavior assays and neurochemical techniques such as slice fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), in vivo microdialysis, and brain tissue content analysis to examine how toluene inhalation alters the striatal DA system. Overall, both behavior and neurochemical data confirmed that toluene inhalation alters stimulated DA release in striatum. Mechanistically, the neurochemical data indicated that acute toluene inhalation potentiates striatal DA release and catabolism but there is no difference on DA uptake or extracellular DA levels in the caudate putamen (CPu). Furthermore, toluene induced potentiation in DA release is not mediated by DA D 3 autoreceptors. Meanwhile, chronic toluene exposure attenuated DA release only in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Repeated toluene exposure also increased extracellular DA levels in the NAc, which is typical of addictive drugs. However, repeated toluene inhalation had no effect on DA D 3 autorecepetors, and DA catabolism. Taken together, the present data suggest that acute or repeated toluene alters the striatal DA system through indirect neuronal action. The second objective was to understand how brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates striatal DA dynamics. Aside from its conventional role as a neurotrophic factor, BDNF has also been implicated in synaptic transmission and neurological disorders. Since BDNF mediates it neurotrophic functions through tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB, the functional effects of tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB on the striatal DA release and uptake rate were examined. This work utilized FSCV to evaluate the effect of exogenous BDNF, TrkB agonist; 7, 8 -dihydroxyflavone (7, 8 -DHF), and TrkB antagonists; genistein, tyrphostin 23, and K 252 a, on DA dynamics in the CPu of brain slices obtain from BDNF deficient (BDNF+/-) mice and their wildtype littermates. Overall, the results obtained highlighted the utility of FSCV to probe the functional effect of Trk receptors on DA dynamics. The results also showed that activation of TrkB receptors with exogenous BDNF and 7, 8 -DHF potentiated presynaptic DA release in BDNF+/- and wildtype mice respectively, with no effect on DA uptake. However, concentrations greater than 3 μM 7, 8 -DHF attenuated DA uptake rates in only BDNF+/− mice. In the presence of K 252 a, the BDNF or 7, 8 -DHF induced potentiation of DA release was abolished, suggesting that the effect of BDNF or 7, 8 -DHF on presynaptic DA release is TrkB mediated...|$|R
