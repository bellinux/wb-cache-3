5|$|Besides his {{collected}} music criticism, Shaw {{has left}} a varied musical legacy, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite (1930).|$|E

It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US10. There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933. The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge. The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the car ferry docks. At that time, M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street.|$|E

25|$|Torrejón set {{to music}} most of Calderón's text, but <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He cut {{half of the}} sixth scene: there a spell is cast upon Mars through the songs of the nymphs and vapors from the fountains of Venus' garden, {{inducing}} him to languor; the spell is counteracted by Belona and a chorus of soldiers, reviving Mars who heads for the forest looking for Adonis. In fact the scene is not necessary for the coherence of the plot, and the omission goes unnoticed by the common listener. Some modern performances (King, Garrido), nevertheless, recreated the cut scene, providing music for it.|$|E

After a massive overhaul, which included revamping rides and removing attractions deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, the waterpark was reopened as Mountain Creek Waterpark and operated under that name until 2013. With an increased emphasis on ride safety, the alpine slide and Motorworld areas were eliminated and some new water attractions were added.|$|E
25|$|Other believers {{maintain}} that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances already. They believe more of its science — if <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> — will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and found them unconvincing. Some arise because the book {{is said to have}} been written by the revelators by 1935, but then was not published until 1955. Discoveries from science during the two intervening decades can be perceived as prophetic by believers, while skeptics think such facts were added prior to publication. For instance, the catalytic role that carbon plays in the sun's nuclear reactions is described in the book, though Hans Bethe's announcement of the discovery was not made until 1938.|$|E

25|$|After the verdict, the {{question}} was how to collect. The former monarchy of Iran had {{billions of dollars in}} assets within the United States that were frozen after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. However, in order to secure an end to the Iranian Hostage Crisis, the assets were unfrozen and most if <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> was collected by 1982 due to the Iran–Iraq War. Rhode Island attorney David J. Strachman, along with other attorneys, representing the plaintiffs, found that the late Shah had purchased a home in Lubbock, Texas for his son, which was sold for $400,000;. After that, they attempted to go after assets of Iranians who had previously worked for the former monarchy, but the U.S. courts would overturn all their attempts to seize their assets, as they were not found to be liable for the damages. They then went after Iranian-owned objects held by U.S. museums in Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan. The Oriental Institute and its holdings from Persepolis became a primary target. Strachman said collectors are interested in the antiquities, potentially for tens of millions of dollars.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} {{their debut}} release, the Drill EP, with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, {{who had worked}} with US indie bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992. With the release of the [...] "Creep" [...] single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> favourable; NME described them as [...] "a lily-livered excuse for a rock band", and [...] "Creep" [...] was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 because it was deemed [...] "too depressing".|$|E

She said the expansion [...] "could be worse, but it could also be a whole lot better", but if you enjoyed Fallout 4, then [...] "there's good reason to pick up Nuka-World." [...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but others will be left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed it was worth the $20. Andrew Webster finished his review by saying Nuka-World was only for dedicated players.|$|E

500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{was positive}} about the episode, writing [...] "This was the strongest overall Thursday this season for NBC's comedies, and 'Sun Tea' brought the evening to a fine close. <b>Not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> worked, but enough of it did... that I was left happy." [...] He opined that if the episode gave more time to Kathy being represented by Teddy Ruxpin [...] "I would have given 'Sun Tea' my stamp of approval". In regards to the environment story, Sepinwall said it [...] "tied in nicely with both Frank's disgusting jars and the apartment plot". Nick Catucci [...] of New York magazine said that the episode was [...] "chockablock with great mini-sketches, gags, and flights of fancy." [...] Catucci enjoyed Tracy's Cosby dream, while he was anesthetized, calling it [...] "delightful". The A.V. Clubs Steven Hyden enjoyed the episode, writing it was [...] "one of the funniest and most enjoyable episodes of the season." [...] Hyden commented that Liz's plot had [...] "a string of craaazy [...] jokes. But they were amusing to laugh-out-loud jokes." [...] "I wouldn't claim {{that it was an}} absolutely top tier episode [...] but what the hell, it had some pretty great moments", said Sean Gandert for Paste magazine. Gandert enjoyed Jack/Tracy and Liz's plots, respectively, was glad that Chris Parnell returned as Dr. Spaceman, and said that Gore [...] "also rarely disappoints", but was not complimentary towards NBC [...] " [...] its green week thing" [...] into [...] "Sun Tea". Time contributor James Poniewozik observed that [...] "the best bits" [...] from this episode were [...] "Teddy Ruxpin the lawyer; the declaration that 'I, Bertram Geiss, am still Daddy's fancy boy'; and, especially, the show's treatment of the Green Is Universal mandate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{who accept}} the general {{scenario}} of Indo-European migrations follow Gimbutas in her {{observation that the}} transition was probably more gradual than suggested by Gimbutas. Some scholars following the same assumption tend to misquote her on this issue and emphasize a (not existent) difference. <b>Not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was raiding, but often the invadors [...] "took over" [...] the locals like a mafia racketeering, a strategy that the Greeks later often practiced founding their colonies. The migrations were certainly not a sudden, concerted military operation, but the expansion of disconnected tribes and cultures, spanning many generations. To what degree the indigenous cultures were peacefully amalgamated or violently displaced is thus {{not a matter of}} controversy among supporters of the Kurgan hypothesis, depends on opinion and thereby not scientific arguments. J. P.

2500|$|During 1986 {{the series}} became {{dominated}} by Angie and Den's storylines {{and the focus}} of the programme was very much concentrated on their combustible relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den's mistress Jan Hammond. Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year. Her menacing voice {{at the end of the}} telephone severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the phone rang. Jan's physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show's dramatic highlights. Her invasion of Angie's territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie's further dependence on alcohol and her attempted suicide. Dobson had been opposed to the suicide storyline from the beginning, she fought hard to get the scripts changed but she was eventually persuaded to play the scenes and was applauded for a [...] "brilliant performance". However Angie's suicide attempt provoked a massive reaction, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> favourable. There was a public outcry about the last two shots of the suicide episode, and Julia Smith subsequently had to cut one of them for the omnibus edition. Some accused the programme of sensationalising suicide and giving ideas to copy-cats. The buildup to Angie's desperate action and its sickening aftermath were intended to demonstrate the full despair of her situation and Holland and Smith have maintained that the horror of its on-screen depiction was meant to deter, not encourage, the act.|$|E

[...] In 1925, The New York Times noted, with approval, a scathing critique of crosswords by The New Republic; but concluded that [...] "Fortunately, {{the question of whether}} the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast and in a few months it will be forgotten." [...] and in 1929 declared, [...] "The cross-word puzzle, it seems, has gone the way of all fads...."

[...] The New York Times, however, was not to publish a crossword puzzle until 1942; today, the Times puzzle is one of the most popular in the country.|$|E
