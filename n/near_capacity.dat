Copper prices rose to 24 {{cents a pound}} in 1929, and United Verde and UVX operated at <b>near</b> <b>capacity.</b> Wages rose, consumers spent, and the town's businesses—including five automobile dealerships—prospered. United Verde, seeking stable labor relations, added disability and life insurance benefits for its workers and built a baseball field, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a public park in Jerome. Both companies donated to the Jerome Public Library and helped finance projects for the town's schools, churches, and hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The post-Taylor {{capacity}} of Highbury {{was limited to}} 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to <b>near</b> <b>capacity.</b> Restrictions, such as the East Stand's status as a listed building and the fact the stadium was surrounded on all sides by a residential area, made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive, although the club's directors {{would have liked to}} have kept Arsenal at a modernized and expanded Highbury. In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home to share with the England national football team, although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until more than six years later.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the initial}} Shinkansen {{prudence}} {{gave way to}} political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of Kanto and Kinki. In some areas regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues, sometimes influenced by fierce protests from locals against expanding Narita airport's runways to handle more traffic that extended well into the 2000s. Tokyo's airports were already at or <b>near</b> <b>capacity</b> {{and there was no}} room for another civilian airport given the geography and required US military presence. Shinkansen lines were extended to sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.|$|E

25|$|The “New Continental” began {{emerging}} {{while in}} bankruptcy. With its cost structure {{in line with}} any post deregulation upstart carrier, the airline began competing effectively with legacy carriers. By May 1984, Continental was operating 83 of its 105 aircraft, which had been mostly grounded upon filing for bankruptcy. Though operating <b>near</b> <b>capacity,</b> it was doing so with nearly half the 12,000 employees, on half the wages, than prior to bankruptcy. By the summer of 1984, the Lorenzo team had filled many of the positions downsized during the strike, and employment had reached 9,000 with a route system served 67 destinations. Planes were averaging a 67% load factor, amongst {{the highest in the}} industry. New Continental’s low-cost carrier strategy was beginning to bear fruit.|$|E
25|$|Residents {{of these}} {{communities}} and local Orange County politicians view the village as encroaching on them. Due to the rapid population growth occurring in Kiryas Joel, resulting almost entirely from the high birth rates of its Hasidic population, the village government has undertaken various annexation efforts to expand its area, {{to the dismay of}} the majority of the residents of the surrounding communities. Many of these area residents see the expansion of the high-density residential, commercial village as a threat to the quality of life in the surrounding suburban communities due to suburban sprawl. Other concerns of the surrounding communities are the impact on local aquifers and the projected increased volume of sewage reaching the county’s sewerage treatment plants, already <b>near</b> <b>capacity</b> by 2005.|$|E
25|$|Rail {{lines in}} the state used to be more prevalent, but many lines have been {{discontinued}} because of increased automobile traffic. Many old tracks have been converted to rail trails for recreational use, although the coal producing areas still have railroads running at <b>near</b> <b>capacity.</b> Amtrak's Cardinal roughly parallels I-64's path through the state. MARC trains serve commuters in the eastern panhandle. In 2006 Norfolk Southern along with the West Virginia and U.S. Government approved a plan to modify many of the rail tunnels in West Virginia, especially in the southern half of the state, to allow for double stacked cars (see inter-modal freight). This is expected to also help bring economic growth to the southern half of the state. An Intermodal Freight Facility is under construction near Prichard, south of Huntington.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} {{of crude oil}} by rail is far from new, but {{it is now a}} rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or <b>near</b> <b>capacity</b> and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.|$|E
25|$|After the 1945 {{passage of}} the GI Bill, a massive influx of former {{servicemen}} began to enter college and strained the capacities of many state public university systems. While this wave was expected to subside by the early 1950s, state and federal statistics released in the late forties all projected a massive demand for {{access to higher education}} in California in the near future. The UC system was then composed only of established campuses at Berkeley and Los Angeles, (Santa Barbara State had just entered the UC system in 1944) which were already operating <b>near</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 1947, the Regents and an Education Committee of the State Legislature appointed a large-scale study of California's needs, dubbed the Strayer Committee (after its chair, George D. Strayer, professor emeritus of Teachers College, Columbia University). As the Strayer Committee was empowered to make recommendations regarding the establishment of any new state campuses, a group of Riverside citrus growers and civic leaders, including many Cal (Berkeley) alumni, formed the Citizens University Committee (CUC) to lobby for a small liberal arts college attached to the UC Citrus Experiment Station. After diligent lobbying by the CUC, which sent gifts of oranges and grapefruit to every member of the Legislature, the Strayer committee recommended that Riverside become the location for the fourth UC undergraduate campus. (It also recommended that the existing Agricultural College at Davis be expanded to serve undergraduates.) Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage drafted Senate Bill 512, which allocated $6 million for the construction of the new college. Governor Earl Warren signed the bill approving the establishment of the College of Letters and Science in Riverside in 1949, after reducing its initial allocation for construction to $4 million.|$|E

The winds damaged a building that was under construction, injuring 44people. A woman was killed in Chongming when winds knocked a wall onto her. Rammasun downed trees and caused power outages in the region, and storm flooding forced over 2,700people to evacuate. High winds left about $85million in agriculture and aquaculture damage in Zhejiang; however, damage was less than expected due to the storm remaining offshore.|$|E

Ross herself offered to double the amounts both Wilson and Birdsong had originally been offered, but while Birdsong accepted, Wilson remained adamant, {{and as a result}} the deal fell through with both former Supremes. Eventually, the [...] "Return to Love" [...] tour went on as scheduled, but with Payne and Laurence joining Ross, although none of the three had ever been in the group {{at the same time and}} neither Payne nor Laurence had sung on any of the original hit recordings that they were now singing live.
