40|$|BACKGROUND Despite {{great effort}} and {{investment}} incurred over decades to control bovine tuberculosis (bTB), {{it is still}} one of the most important zoonotic diseases in many areas of the world. Test-and-slaughter strategies, the basis of most bTB eradication programs carried out worldwide, have demonstrated its usefulness in the control of the disease. However, in certain countries, eradication has not been achieved due in part to limitations of currently available diagnostic tests. In this study, results of in-vivo and post-mortem diagnostic tests performed on 3, 614 animals from 152 bTB-infected cattle herds (beef, dairy, and bullfighting) detected in 2007 - 2010 in the region of Castilla y León, Spain, were analyzed to identify factors associated with positive bacteriological results in cattle that were <b>non-reactors</b> to the single intradermal tuberculin test, to the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) assay, or to both tests applied in parallel (Test negative/Culture + animals, T-/C+). The association of individual factors (age, productive type, and number of herd-tests performed since the disclosure of the outbreak) with the bacteriology outcome (positive/negative) was analyzed using a mixed multivariate logistic regression model.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to solve the problem}} of whether a high or a low dose should be used for {{tuberculin}} testing a new method of statistical analysis is presented. It consists in tabulating the frequency of tuberculin “positive” children in households where the adults are tuberculin “positive” and tuberculin “negative” respectively; these frequencies are compiled for a wide range of arbitrarily chosen limits between “positive” and “negative” reactions. Values for these statistics have been obtained from data collected in Kenya; they strongly suggest that the reactors to the low-dose test are those infected with tubercle bacilli and the <b>non-reactors</b> to this test are the uninfected. However, a more detailed analysis is possible and this paper demonstrates that statistics of the type described may be used for testing the plausibility of a specific hypothesis about the patterns of tuberculin reactions among infected and uninfected persons. By testing a number of different hypotheses, the most plausible was found to be that the tuberculin sensitivities of infected and uninfected persons correspond to those of the reactors and the <b>non-reactors</b> to the low-dose test respectively. On the basis of the data presented it thus appears that the low-dose test is better suited than the high-dose test for distinguishing between infected and uninfected persons...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the relations between}} bronchial reactivity, baseline FEV 1, and annual decline of height corrected FEV 1 (delta FEV 1 /ht 3) over 7. 5 years in 227 men (117 smokers, 71 ex-smokers, and 39 non-smokers). Men with a clinical diagnosis of asthma or receiving bronchodilator treatment were excluded. Bronchial reactivity was determined as the provocation concentration (PC 20) of inhaled histamine sufficient to reduce FEV 1 by 20 %; subjects were divided into reactors (PC 20 {{less than or equal}} to 16 mg/ml) and <b>non-reactors</b> (PC 20 greater than 16 mg/ml). Thirty per cent of smokers, 24 % of ex-smokers, and 5 % of non-smokers were reactors. When smokers who were reactors were compared with <b>non-reactors,</b> the reactors showed a lower baseline FEV 1 as percentage predicted in 1981 - 2 (85 % v 108 %), and a faster delta FEV 1 /ht 3 (14. 1 v 9. 2 ml/y/m 3). Baseline FEV 1 correlated with PC 20 in both smokers (rs = 0. 51) and ex-smokers (rs = 0. 61), and all 15 subjects with an FEV 1 under 80 % of the predicted value were reactors. In ex-smokers delta FEV 1 /ht 3 was similar in reactors and <b>non-reactors</b> (m 9. 0 v 7. 4 ml/y/m 3), despite significant differences in baseline FEV 1. When analysis was confined to men with a baseline FEV 1 over 80 % predicted, the prevalence of reactors was significantly increased among smokers and slightly increased among ex-smokers compared with non-smokers, though the mean FEV 1 was higher in the non-smokers. Bronchial reactivity was not increased in smokers aged 35 years or less. In smokers delta FEV 1 /ht 3 was faster in those with a personal history of allergy (usually allergic rhinitis), but was not related to a family history of allergic disease, total serum immunoglobulin E level, absolute blood eosinophil count, or skinprick test score. delta FEV 1 /ht 3 was also faster in all subjects taking beta blocker drugs. Thus increased bronchial reactivity was associated with accelerated decline of FEV 1 in smokers. Although the association could be a consequence of a lower lower baseline FEV 1, a trend towards increased reactivity was found in smokers with normal baseline FEV 1 and delta FEV 1 /ht 3 was dissociated from increased reactivity in ex-smokers. These findings are compatible with the "Dutch hypothesis," but the association between allergic features and accelerated delta FEV 1 /ht 3 was relatively weak, and increased reactivity may follow rather than precede the onset of smoking...|$|R

40|$|Complaints of {{respiratory}} symptoms amongst {{workers in a}} factory using isocyanate to produce polyurethane foam led to a study of changes in ventilatory capacity {{in the course of}} several working days. Mean decreases of the order of 0 - 18 1. were observed in the forced expiratory volume at one second in 15 employees during each of three normal working shifts. No significant change occurred on days when a process involving the liberation of isocyanate was stopped, or when the men were given an oral aminophylline compound prophylactically. An aerosol of isoprenaline failed to reverse the decrease in ventilatory capacity observed during one normal working day.

40|$|Abstract Background Airway {{inflammation}} and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) are two characteristic features of asthma. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) has shown good correlation with AHR in asthmatics. Less {{information is available}} about FENO as a marker of inflammation from work exposures. We thus examined the relation between FENO and AHR in lifeguards undergoing exposure to chloramines in indoor pools. Methods 39 lifeguards at six indoor pools were given a respiratory health questionnaire, FENO measurements, spirometry, and a methacholine bronchial challenge (MBC) test. Subjects were labeled MBC+ if the forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) fell by 20 % or more. The normalized linear dose-response slope (NDRS) was calculated as the percentage fall in FEV 1 at the last dose divided by the total dose given. The relation between MBC and FENO was assessed using logistic regression adjusting on confounding factors. The association between NDRS and log-transformed values of FENO was tested in a multiple linear regression model. Results The prevalence of lifeguards MBC+ was 37. 5 %. In reactors, the median FENO was 18. 9 ppb (90 % of the predicted value) vs. 12. 5 ppb (73 % predicted) in <b>non-reactors.</b> FENO values ≥ 60 % of predicted values were 80 % sensitive and 42 % specific to identify subjects MBC+. In the logistic regression model no other factor {{had an effect on}} MBC after adjusting for FENO. In the linear regression model, NDRS was significantly predicted by log FENO. Conclusions In lifeguards working in indoor swimming pools, elevated FENO levels are associated with increased airway responsiveness. </p...|$|R

The Children's Reactions to Evaluation Stress Test is composed of three short tasks that children have to perform in front of a judge. The tasks are rigged so as to provoke (partial) failure in the child's performance. Participants were 42 children (M = 68. 0 months, SD = 4. 3). Six saliva samples were taken during the testing session to obtain cortisol measurements of baseline concentrations, stress reactivity, and recovery. Our findings showed that this paradigm was effective in provoking a significant increase in salivary cortisol concentration in the group as a whole, with no effects of possible confounders (child's sex, age or school, parental educational level, time of testing, sex of experimenter, and sex of judge). The mean cortisol concentration increase for the group was 127. 5 % (SD = 190. 9); 61 % of the children could be classified as reactors (mean increase of 214 %, SD = 201. 5), and 39 % as <b>non-reactors</b> (mean decrease of 7. 8 %, SD = 16. 8). To our knowledge, this is the first study in this age group that shows a significant cortisol response for the group as a whole to a standardized laboratory paradigm. As such, this paradigm is a promising tool to be used in future research on early life interactions between physiology and psychology...|$|R
40|$|In January, 1956 anti-tuberculosis {{campaign}} {{was organized by}} the authorities concerned in Ashio, Tochigi Prefecture. Under this plan, {{the inhabitants of the}} town have been examined for tuberculosis, receiving medical care if required. The program consists in: preliminary tests for tuberculin sensitivity, examination of the sputum for tubercle bacilli, roentgenographic examination, OMK tests (put forth by Dr. T. Okada as a method of determining tuberculous infection), and administration of chemotherapy to those in whom pulmonary involvement or reactivaton of lesions has been diagnosed as likely to occur. Parallel with this campaign, the author launched a plan for prevention of tuberculosis among infants and children. The program included all of 1, 200 school children of Honzan Elementary School and 42 infants and children with tuberculous adults in their families. The following results were obtained: 1. The inhabitants of Ashio had had a very high incidence of tuberculous infection, with tuberculin reactors accounting for 70 〜 80 per cent of children entering kindergartens and elementary schools every year. The high incidence of silicotuberculosis among the workers at copper mines, coupled with bad housing condition, is assumed to be responsible for high incidence of tuberculous infection among infants and children. 2. Prophylactic administration of INAH to cases of fresh infection (as determined by both tuberculin and OMK tests) has been asserted to be effective in preventing pulmonary involvement among infants and children. Repeated tuberculin tests of all <b>non-reactors</b> to discover fresh convertors were made once every three months, while OMK tests were made once a month. 3. To ward off tuberculosis, INAH was given in varying daily doses: to school children, 200 mg; to children under 6 years, 100 mg; and to infants under 2 years, 50 mg. The administration was contiuned for half a year every day in the first month, and from two to four days a week {{in the rest of the}} period. 4. INAH had no appreciable side effects...|$|R
