50|$|Interference drag {{plays a role}} {{throughout}} the entire aircraft (e.g., <b>nacelles,</b> <b>pylons,</b> empennage) and its detrimental effect is always kept in mind by designers. Ideally, the pressure distributions on the intersecting bodies should complement each otherâ€™s pressure distribution. If one body locally displays a negative pressure coefficient, the intersecting body should have a positive pressure coefficient. In reality, however, {{this is not always}} possible. Particular geometric characteristics on aircraft often show how designers have dealt with the issue of interference drag. A prime example is the wing-body fairing, which smooths the sharp angle at the intersection of the wing and the fuselage. Another example is the junction between the horizontal and vertical tailplane in a T-tail. Often, an additional fairing (acorn) is positioned to reduce the added supervelocities. The position of the nacelle with respect to the wing is a third example of how interference-drag considerations dominate this geometric feature. Interference drag is considered when deciding the lateral and longitudinal placement of nacelles on the wing. If there is little vertical space available between the wing and the nacelle (due to need for ground clearance) the nacelle is usually positioned much more in front of the wing. The NACA area rule is one approach to reducing transonic interference drag.|$|E

It covers both numerical and experimental studies, mainly targeted towards validation of CFD for maximum lift prediction of such configurations. It is a follow up to the EUROLIFT project of the 5 th framework programme. While in the former project a simplified wing-body high-lift configuration was investigated, the new project focuses on a more realistic configuration including engine <b>nacelles,</b> <b>pylons,</b> tracks and brackets. Additionally the next step is undertaken coming from analysis to design. Since it is a main aim of the project to deal with realistic configurations, this design will be done at a Reynolds number comparable to flight conditions of a real transport aircraft. The design activity within the project is targeted towards an improvement of the aerodynamic properties of the DLR-F 11 model already used in EUROLIFT.

40|$|A {{transonic}} {{model and}} a low-speed model were flutter {{tested in the}} Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at Mach numbers up to 0. 90. Transonic flutter boundaries were measured for 10 different model configurations, which included variations in wing fuel, <b>nacelle</b> <b>pylon</b> stiffness, and wingtip configuration. The winglet effects were evaluated by testing the transonic model, having a specific wing fuel and <b>nacelle</b> <b>pylon</b> stiffness, with each of three wingtips, a nonimal tip, a winglet, and a nominal tip ballasted to simulate the winglet mass. The addition of the winglet substantially reduced the flutter speed of the wing at transonic Mach numbers. The winglet effect was configuration-dependent and was primarily due to winglet aerodynamics rather than mass. Flutter analyses using modified strip-theory aerodynamics (experimentally weighted) correlated reasonably well with test results. The four transonic flutter mechanisms predicted by analysis were obtained experimentally. The analysis satisfactorily predicted the mass-density-ratio effects on subsonic flutter obtained using the low-speed model. Additional analyses were made to determine the flutter sensitivity to several parameters at transonic speeds...|$|R

Product Development Processes (PDP) {{has an important}} role in the value definition since it aims at defining the product and customer value, and this definition largely impacts production costs and production times.

40|$|Aircraft on {{approach}} in high-drag, high-lift configurations create inherently noisy flow structures. For flaps, slats, and undercarriage, the {{strong correlation between}} overall noise and drag suggests that future quiet aircraft will need to generate drag at low noise levels. This paper presents a novel noise-reduction concept {{based on the idea}} that appreciable pressure drag can be generated by a relatively quiet swirling exhaust flow. A first aeroacoustic assessment of ram-pressure-driven swirling exhaust flows and their associated vortex breakdown instability is presented. The technical approach combines 1) an in-depth aerodynamic analysis, 2) qualitative acoustic source descriptions via plausibility arguments, and 3) detailed quantitative phased microphone-array measurements of a model-scale engine nacelle with stationary swirl vanes at a full-scale approach Mach number of 0. 17. The analysis shows an acoustic signature composed of 1) quadrupole-type turbulent mixing noise in the swirling core flow and 2) scattering noise from vane boundary layers and turbulent eddies of the burst vortex structure near the <b>nacelle,</b> <b>pylon,</b> and vane centerbody trailing edges. The highest stable swirl-angle setting yields a nacelle-area-based drag coefficient of 0. 83 with a full-scale overall sound pressure level of about 40 dBA at the International Civil Aviation Organization approach certification point.

The reference atmospheric on flow conditions for the {{measurements were}}: â€¢ V = 60 m/sec â€¢ M = 0, 175 â€¢ Rec = 1. 3 x 106. For the engine/airframe integration studies a new through-flow-nacelle and a pylon were designed and manufactured. Additionally a strake device, a small vortex generator, was mounted on an optimal position on the inboard side of the nacelle {{in order to increase}} the lift coefficient cL at high angles of attack. In this framework 300 instantaneous 3 C-velocity vector fields were measured each in 5 cross flow planes along the flow direction on the suction side of the wing by a traversable Stereo PIV system. The goal of the test programme was to track the trajectory of the wake vortex of an optimal strake at several chord positions between the nacelle and the flap of the wing and at 3 different angles of incidence: 7 Â°, 16. 5 Â° and 18. 5 Â°. In parallel the two configurations at 7 Â° and 16. 5 Â° were measured without the strake for comparison reasons. In total more than 8000 instantaneous 3 C-velocity vector fields were calculated. This data provides information to understand the physical process of the stabilising effect of the strake wake vortex on the separated flow on the wing, which is caused by the wake of the <b>nacelle,</b> <b>pylon</b> and slat-cut-out.
