5000|$|Besides the {{traditional}} hydraulic automatic transmissions, {{there are also}} other types of automated transmissions, such as a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and semi-automatic transmissions, that free the driver from having to shift gears manually, by using the transmissions computer to change gear, if for example the driver were redlining the engine. Despite superficial similarity to other transmissions, traditional automatic transmissions differ significantly in internal operation and drivers feel from semi-automatics and CVTs. In contrast to conventional automatic transmissions, a CVT uses a belt or other torque transmission scheme to allow an [...] "infinite" [...] <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> instead of a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> A semi-automatic retains a clutch like a manual transmission, but controls the clutch through electrohydraulic means. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, {{can also be found}} on certain automated transmissions (manumatics such as Tiptronic), semi-automatics (BMW SMG, VW Group DSG), and CVTs (such as Lineartronic).|$|E
50|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) (also known as a single-speed transmission, stepless transmission, pulley transmission, or, in case of motorcycles, a twist-and-go) is an automatic transmission that can change seamlessly through a continuous range of effective gear ratios. This contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The flexibility of a CVT allows the input shaft to maintain a constant angular velocity.|$|E
5000|$|The IVT is a {{specific}} type of CVT that includes not only an infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> but an [...] "infinite" [...] range as well. This is a turn of phrase, it actually refers to CVTs that are able to include a [...] "zero ratio", where the input shaft can turn without any motion of the output shaft while remaining in gear. Of course, the gear ratio in that case is not [...] "infinite" [...] but is instead [...] "undefined".|$|E
2500|$|Most hybrid, touring, mountain, {{and racing}} {{bicycles}} {{are equipped with}} both front and rear derailleurs. [...] There are a few <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> which have a straight chain path, but most <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> will have the chain running at an angle. [...] The use of two derailleurs generally results in some duplicate or near duplicate <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> so that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> is typically around two-thirds <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> advertised <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The more common configurations have specific names [...] which are usually related to the relative step sizes between the front chainrings and the rear cogset.|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} transmission, {{also called}} auto, self-shifting transmission, n-speed automatic (where n is its <b>number</b> <b>of</b> forward <b>gear</b> <b>ratios),</b> or AT, {{is a type}} of motor vehicle transmission that can automatically change <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Like other transmission systems on vehicles, it allows an internal combustion engine, best suited to run at a relatively high rotational speed, to provide a range of speed and torque outputs necessary for vehicular travel. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> forward <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> is often expressed for manual transmissions as well (e.g., 6-speed manual).|$|R
50|$|Where large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> six or more, {{are to be}} {{provided}} then these will require a third or more gear clusters on the layshaft. To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional driven gear for each layshaft, but the mechanism is otherwise very similar. The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the multiple clutch gearbox, used for some buses, where each ratio has its own layshaft and separate plate or hydraulic clutches, rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them.|$|R
5000|$|Bicycles {{usually have}} a system for {{selecting}} different gear ratios. There are two main types: derailleur gears and hub gears. The derailleur type is the most common, and the most visible, using sprocket gears. Typically there are several gears available on the rear sprocket assembly, attached to the rear wheel. A few more sprockets are usually added to the front assembly as well. Multiplying the number of sprocket gears in front by the number to the rear gives the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> often called [...] "speeds".|$|E

The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> within the transmission depends on the model, but three was initially predominant. In the 1990s four and five speeds became common. Six-speed automatic transmissions were probably the most common offering in cars and trucks from about 2010, and were still common (especially in older or less expensive models of vehicles) in 2017. However, seven-speed automatics had become available in some high-performance production luxury cars (found in Mercedes 7G gearbox, Infiniti), as are eight-speed autos in models from 2006 introduced by Aisin Seiki Co. in Lexus, ZF, Hyundai Motor Company and General Motors. From 2013 are available nine speeds transmissions produced by ZF and Mercedes 9G. In the 2017 model year Ford and General Motors introduced a 10-speed transmission.|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} 5-speed {{manual transmission}} {{is often the}} standard equipment in a base-model car, while more expensive manual vehicles are usually equipped with a 6-speed transmission instead; other options include automatic transmissions such as a traditional automatic (hydraulic planetary) transmission (often a manumatic), a semi-automatic transmission, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> forward <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> is often expressed for automatic transmissions as well (e.g., 9-speed automatic).|$|R

It uses a driver-operated clutch engaged and disengaged by a foot pedal (automobile) or hand lever (motorcycle), for regulating torque transfer from the engine to the transmission; and a gear selector operated by hand (automobile) or by foot (motorcycle).|$|R

Automotive transmissions {{are required to}} efficiently transfer energy from the engine to the wheels. Automatic transmissions {{are one of the}} most widely used transmission systems in the United States. This transmission houses a hydraulic system which is used to actuate the clutch system to realize different gear ratios. Currently, these clutches are primarily controlled in open-loop using hydraulic valves in a physical embodiment designed specifically for a given transmission system in order to perform precise pressure and flow control. To meet the increasing demand for higher fuel economy, transmissions with greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are being introduced. The hydraulic architecture is becoming increasingly complicated with more clutches and control elements. With the advancement of MEMS technology, the sensor-based direct feedback control of clutches becomes possible. This paper first analyzes the current architecture of transmission hydraulic system and then presents a new architecture for the feedback-based clutches. The proposed architecture is further validated through experiments using hardware-in-the-loop system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT), in theory, has an unlimited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> between the highest and lowest settings. But most CVTs are complex, expensive, have poor efficiencies, and aren't scalable. A new type of CVT, CONTINUOSLY VARIABLE PLANETARY TRANSMISSION(CVPT),combines toroidaltraction CVT with the versatility of the planetary gear arrangement to create a low-cost, highly efficient drive for human-powered and motorized vehicles. While the CVPT uses rolling traction to distribute torque like toroidal CVTs, it distributes the transmitted torque over several spheres in an inherently stable configuration. The rotating balls between the input and output section of the CVT tilt to vary transmission speed. As the balls tilt, they change their contact diameters to vary the speed ratio. This lowers contact pressures and improves durability, stability, and torque density. And since it uses a planetary arrangement, torque can be summed or divided. In the present work, a CVPT has been mounted to a bicycle for conducting the experiments. Normally tilting of spheres for changing gear ratios is done manually, however in our case, this has been obtained automatically. For automated shifting, a shift actuator, a controller and a battery to power this circuit is used. Also, results have been obtained with speed variations of a bicycle with and without CVPT. Graphs are plotted using the obtained results and analysed...|$|E
