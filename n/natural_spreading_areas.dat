In the anatomical investigations, the radial transmission in the stem takes up a great deal of space in the bundles compared to the floem elements of the xylem elements. The body covers the epidermis cells of a thick capillary layer with dense fur, and the transmission bundles are generally arranged in a large, small bundle. The leaves are in the bifacial leaf type and accordingly the separation of palisade parenchyma and sponge parenchyma is clearly observed. The abaxial percentage is longer and more intense, and there are stoma cells that are arranged at regular intervals with cover and secretion feathers on both sides. Abdominal abdominal stomata is the upper case. The number of chromosomes was determined as 2 x = 2 n = 18 in karyological studies performed by Takson and chromosome measurements were made...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe genetic {{diversity}} {{and structure of}} 414 honeybee workers from eight different populations in Algeria were analyzed using 14 polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci. The {{results showed that the}} honeybee populations were characterized by substantial genetic variation in terms of the average number of alleles and the degree of heterozygosity. Most populations were at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Phylogenetic and population structure analyses confirmed the African origin of the studied Algerian populations and clustered them in a group distinct from evolutionary lineages West Mediterranean (M), North Mediterranean (C), and Oriental (O). Structure analyses revealed weak allelic introgression from both lineages M and C. High genetic variability was found within the Algerian populations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The overall {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to begin restoration of spawning and nursery fish-ery habitat for the sunfish family (largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill) lost from flood control opera-tions (seasonal drawdowns) in El Dorado Lake, Kansas. When initially impounded, flooded terrestrial structure provided good habitat for the sunfish fishery. As flood control operations were implemented, habitat structure (primarily flooded trees and brush) degraded, leaving the lake poorly suited for this fish-ery. The loss of structure also contributed to increases in turbidity, further affecting the sunfish fishery. Specific objectives of the project were to: (a) evaluate the suitability of several emergent, floating-leaved, and submersed aquatic plant species for establishment in the lake; (b) develop and test effective methods for establishing desirable aquatic plant species; and (c) establish founder colonies of aquatic plants in several areas of the lake. In addition to providing immediate nursery habitat for juvenile fish, these founder colonies were expected to provide propagules for <b>natural</b> <b>spread</b> to other <b>areas</b> of the lake.

Cells {{interact with their}} extracellular matrix (ECM) resulting in different degree of adhesion {{and spreading}}. However, {{it is not clear}} whether cell adhesion or cell spreading is more important for cell functions. In this study, 10 types of isotropical micropatterns that were composed of 2 [*]μm microdots were prepared to precisely control the adhesion <b>area</b> and <b>spreading</b> <b>area</b> of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

40|$|AbstractMechanical cues can {{influence}} {{the manner in which}} cells generate traction forces and form focal adhesions. The stiffness of a cell’s substrate and the available area on which it can spread {{can influence}} its generation of traction forces, but to what extent these factors are intertwined is unclear. In this study, we used microcontact printing and micropost arrays to control cell spreading, substrate stiffness, and post density to assess their effect on traction forces and focal adhesions. We find that both the <b>spread</b> <b>area</b> and the substrate stiffness influence traction forces in an independent manner, but these factors have opposite effects: cells on stiffer substrates produce higher average forces, whereas cells with larger <b>spread</b> <b>areas</b> generate lower average forces. We show that post density influences the generation of traction forces {{in a manner that is}} more dominant than the effect of <b>spread</b> <b>area.</b> Additionally, we observe that focal adhesions respond to <b>spread</b> <b>area,</b> substrate stiffness, and post density in a manner that closely matches the trends seen for traction forces.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} {{mechanical}} stimuli on A 549 lung cancer cells is studied. Modifications of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces are employed to alter the mechanical stimuli applied to the cells. Flat substrates are first studied and then micropillared substrates are designed, fabricated, and tested as a method to alter the mechanical properties of the PDMS surfaces. Molds with micro-pillars are designed then fabricated from silicon using deep reactive ion etching. From these molds, a negative then a positive replicate is made using PDMS. The pillared PDMS substrates are fabricated in 10 geometries and used for experiments. A 549 cells are cultured on these surfaces then analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fluorescence microscopy images processed by ImageJ software measure the cell <b>spreading</b> <b>area</b> (m 2) while AFM quantifies the cell stiffness (kPa). For flat substrates, the cell stiffness and <b>spreading</b> <b>area</b> increase with increasing substrate stiffness. Further, results on pillared substrates show a similar trend based on pillar geometry changes. For pillared substrates, the A 549 cell stiffness and <b>spreading</b> <b>area</b> increase as the height decreases, yet there is decreased cell stiffness and <b>spreading</b> <b>area</b> as the diameter and spacing decreases.
