30|$|Thermal {{hydrocracking}} and catalytic hydrocracking {{of heavy}} oil and model reactant {{have been carried}} out to investigate the effect of dispersed Mo catalyst on slurry-phase hydrocracking. The XRD and XPS patterns suggested that the major existence form of dispersed Mo catalyst in slurry-phase hydrocracking was MoS 2. Experimental data revealed that the conversion of feedstock oils and model reactant increased with the presence of catalyst, while the yields of light products (gas, naphtha) and heavy products (vacuum residue, coke) decreased, the yields of diesel and vacuum gas oil increased in the meantime. Besides, the yields of aromatic hydrocarbon and <b>naphthenic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> in naphtha fraction decreased. Effect parameters R G (the ratio of i-C 4 H 10 yield to n-C 4 H 10 yield) and isoparaffin/n-paraffin ratio were proposed to study the reaction mechanism of slurry-phase hydrocracking, the smaller effect parameters showed that there was no carbonium ion mechanism in slurry-phase hydrocracking, which still followed the free radical mechanism, and that the isomerization ratio of products decreased with the presence of Mo catalyst.|$|E

30|$|The {{relative}} {{proportions of}} saturated, aromatic fractions and polar compounds of the extracts {{of the rock}} samples were calculated. The samples from the Sargelu and Upper Neyriz zones contain similar amounts of fractions. Their saturated and polar components are around 54.4 – 61.6 % and 24 – 30 %, respectively (Table  2). Aromatic fractions range from 14.4 to 15.6 % (Table  2; Fig.  5). However, the Lower Neyriz zone contains relatively high amounts of polar component (61.3 %) and saturated and aromatic fractions of 21.4 % and 17.3 %, respectively (Fig.  5). The chemical composition of bitumen extracts depends on the parent organic matter and thermal maturity (Tissot and Welte 1984). The chemical quality of the organic matter within the rock samples {{was obtained from the}} fractional amounts of polar, saturated, and aromatic compounds, which were plotted on a classification triangular diagram of hydrocarbons (Tissot and Welte 1984) (Fig.  6). The distribution of fractional compounds indicates that the chemical composition of organic matter in the Upper Neyriz and Sargelu zones is paraffinic.

40|$|The {{gas phase}} {{oxidative}} cracking (GOC) and non-oxidative pyrolysis of heavy hydrocarbons were investigated, with decalin (decahydronaphthalene) and tetralin (tetrahydronaphthalene) {{as the model}} compounds for <b>naphthenic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and aromatic hydrocarbon, respectively. Unlike pyrolysis, the ring rupture of decalin or tetralin molecule and the decoking ability of system were significantly enhanced due {{to the introduction of}} O- 2 in GOC. For GOC of decalin, both the lower alkenes and the light fuels were obtained. At lower temperatures the light fuels mainly contained alkyl benzene, alkyl cyclohexane and isoparaffins, while it was rich in BTX (benzene, toluene and xylenes) at higher temperatures. A 38. 9 % yield of lower alkenes and 48. 0 % yield of light fuels (BTX mass content: 59. 9 %) at 100 % decalin conversion were obtained under the conditions of 800 degrees C and decalin/O- 2 = 0. 5. For GOC of tetralin, both the dehydrogenation and the cracking reactions dominated the reaction routes, resulting in a high mass content of alkyl naphthalene and alkyl benzene in the light fuels. The estimation of O- 2 distribution in the products demonstrated that O- 2 participated primarily in the oxydehydrogenation reactions at low temperatures, while mainly in the partial oxidation reactions at high temperatures to produce COx (x= 1, 2).

40|$|No Brasil, a producao de petroleo com alto teor de hidrocarbonetos (HC) naftenicos (cicloalcanos) e o forte crescimento da industria petroquimica, tem conduzido a necessidade de maximizar a transformacao desses compostos com producao seletiva de HC leves (em especial eteno e propeno). As novas tecnologias devem envolver o uso de catalisadores acidos que possuam altas atividade e seletividade. Embora os HC naftenicos sejam importantes constituintes da alimentacao do processo FCC, poucos estudos contemplam suas transformacoes sobre as zeolitas HUSY e HZSM- 5, principais componentes ativos do catalisador FCC e, tambem, sobre a zeolita HMCM- 22. Assim, objetivou-se neste trabalho avaliar a transformacao dos compostos cicloexano e metilcicloexano sobre as zeolitas mencionadas. A zeolita MCM- 22 foi sintetizada via tratamento hidrotermico sob condicoes estaticas e no caso das zeolitas USY e ZSM- 5 foram utilizadas amostras comerciais. As amostras foram caracterizadas por termogravimetria, difracao de raios X, analise quimica, fisissorcao de nitrogenio, microscopia eletronica de varredura, e avaliadas na transformacao do cicloexano e metilcicloexano a 400 oC, com {{posterior}} determinacao do teor de carbono. As zeolitas estudadas se mostraram ativas na conversao desses compostos, porem, a conversao, rendimento e seletividade a HC leves foram dependentes do sistema poroso, teor de aluminio, forca dos sitios e densidade de sitios externos. A zeolita HUSY apresentou maiores conversoes pelo seu maior teor aluminio, entretanto, pelos seus sitios acidos de menor forca e menores restricoes estericas que na HZSM- 5, apresentou maior seletividade a compostos provenientes de reacoes de isomerizacao. Ao contrario, a zeolita HZSM- 5 originou melhores rendimentos a produtos de craqueamento, principalmente C 3 e C 4. E a zeolita HMCM- 22, pelas suas caracteristicas estruturais e texturais, apresentou uma distribuicao mista de produtos de craqueamento e isomerizacao. A seletividade a olefinas leves (C 2 =, C 3 = e C 4 =) foi maior na zeolita HZSM- 5, na qual as reacoes bimoleculares de transferencia de hidrogenio foram desfavorecidas devido a restricoes estericas impostas pelo menor tamanho de seus microporos. A estrutura microporosa foi determinante na desativacao das zeolitas por formacao de coque. In Brazil, the {{oil production}} with high <b>naphthenic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (HC) {{content and the}} hard growing for the petrochemical market {{have led to the}} necessity to maximize the production of light HC (in special light olefins). The new technologies must involve the use of acid catalysts that have high activity and selectivity. In despite of the naphthenic HC make part of the feed of the FCC reactor, few studies have been devoted to their transformations on HUSY and HZSM- 5 zeolites, main active components of the FCC catalysts, and also on the MCM- 22 zeolite. In this context, the objective of this work was to evaluate the cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane transformations on the above mentioned zeolites. The MCM- 22 was hydrothermally synthesized under static conditions {{and in the case of}} USY and ZSM- 5 zeolites, commercial samples were used. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X ray diffraction, chemical analysis, nitrogen sorption, scanning electron microscopy, and evaluated in the cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane transformation at 400 oC, with after carbon analysis. The studied zeolites were active in the studied reactions, nevertheless, the conversion, yield and selectivity to light HC were dependent on the zeolite structure, number and strength of the acid sites and the external area. The HUSY zeolite, due to their higher aluminum content, showed higher activity with high yield to isomerization products. On the contrary, on the HZSM- 5 zeolite the cracking products were favored with high selectivity to propane and butane. On the base of their structural and textural properties, the HMCM- 22 zeolite showed a mixture of cracking and isomerization products. The selectivity to light olefins (C 2 =, C 3 = and C 4 =) was higher on the HZSM- 5 zeolite, in which the bimolecular reactions of hydrogen transference were not favored due to the steric restrictions imposed by their microporous, which are smaller in diameter. The microporous structure was determinant in the zeolite deactivation by coke formation...|$|E

The absence of an imparity of the n-alkanes (Fig.  5) is attributed to mature sediment. But developed hump in some chromatograms under C 25 –C 35 (Fig.  5 b) can be related to a strong biodegradation which characterizes the extracted samples {{from the top of the}} sequence (Fig.  6).

It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|R

It {{is the case of}} the light cycle oil (LCO) containing high concentrations of aromatics and <b>naphthenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> which lower the cetane number of the feed. In order {{to improve the quality of}} the fuel into diesel, these molecules must be converted into linear alkanes (2 ROP) and alkyl-cycloalkanes, or âbenzenes (1 ROP). This can be obtained by performing a selective ring opening (SRO) reaction. To focus our study on the SRO reactions, decalin - a saturated bicyclic molecule - can be used as model compound. Some supported metals like iridium or platinum [1] are known to be good candidates for SRO reactions, but activity decreases considerably in the presence of sulfur [2]. In this presentation, bifunctional catalysts containing both an acidic function (oxide support) and a metallic function (metal or metal sulfide nanoparticles) will be shown as thioresistant catalysts for SRO of decalin. The acidic function promotes cracking and isomerization reactions, while the latter favors hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. Both hydrogenolysis and (mild) cracking steps are suitable pathways for the ring opening. A major goal of our study was to investigate the synergy between the metallic and acidic functions in the presence of 1 % H 2 S. To this purpose, we have prepared and evaluated RuS 2 /HY catalysts for decalin SRO. The reaction products were identified by GCxGC. Figure 1 shows that the catalytic activity of the RuS 2 /HY supported catalyst is higher than that of the HY zeolite alone, and that hydrocracking and dehydrogenation routes are promoted by the metal sulfide phase addition. This work therefore suggests that sulfided metal catalysts supported on acidic zeolites are promising as catalysts for SRO reaction in the presence of H 2 S, provided that the hydrocracking function can be softened. 1.

In this method the concentration of most toxic components of oil (mainly monoaromatics) is determined.

Hence, in internal combustion engines lubricant is very essential for longer life of the engine. Lubricants are generally composed {{of a majority of}} base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. The types of the lubricant depend upon the types of base oils. The base oils may be mineral (petroleum originated), synthetic (polyalphaolefins, polyalkylene glycols, synthetic esters, silicones etc.) or vegetable (sunflower oil, soybean oil, palm oil etc.). When the base oil is a vegetable oil, then the lubricant is known as biolubricant, in case of synthetic oil it is called synthetic lubricant and when the base oil is mineral or petroleum based then the lubricant is known as mineral lubricant. Most of the lubricants used today are mineral or petroleum based and are a mixture of paraffinic, <b>naphthenic</b> and aromatic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Nowadays, with increasing environmental pollution although it is essential to use vegetable oils as base fluid rather than mineral oil or synthetic ester based oils, but due to the poor oxidative and hydrolytic stability, high temperature sensitivity of tribological behavior, poor cold flow properties and high cost vegetable oils are very limitedly used as base oils for industrial lubricants [1, 2].

40|$|This article {{presents}} an overview on carbon chemical structure transformation to understand kerogen thermal decomposition {{based on the}} chemical structure of kerogen. Formation of kerogen is highlighted to distinguish the typical types of kerogen containing in oil shale and coal. The oil production potential for oil shale and coal is found to little correlate with their organic amounts but {{to depend on the}} quality or chemical structure of organic matters. Aliphatic and aromatic carbons in kerogen are correlative with the yield of oil and carbon residue from Fischer Assay retorting, respectively. The aliphatic carbon moieties largely produce oil and gas, while aromatic carbon portion is apt to be converted directly to carbon residue during kerogen pyrolysis process. On this basis, an updated lumped mechanism model is proposed for viewing kerogen pyrolysis and provides a basis for understanding the transformation of carbon chemical structures. Further quantization and analysis conclude that: 1) 10 - 20 % aliphatic carbon leaves in carbon residue as methyl groups and methylene bridges attached to aromatic rings, 2) 45 - 80 % aliphatic carbon is directly distillated into oil, and 3) 15 - 40 % aliphatic carbon is aromatized into aromatic carbon. The aromatization degree of aliphatic carbon varies with secondary reactions and its intrinsic chemical structure (alkyl chains, <b>naphthenic</b> and hydroaromatic <b>hydrocarbons).</b> Thus, the article justifies that primary pyrolysis determines the potentially maximal oil yield according to original carbon chemical structure, while the subsequent secondary reactions should be selective and minimized to determine the final oil yield and quality.

They suggested that wax formation from multi-component oil mixtures produces pure immiscible phases. Lira-Galeana et al. (1996) stated that since the solubility of each component is highly dependent on temperature, it is expected that only part of components exist in solid–liquid equilibrium during cooling process. Dorset (1990) used calorimetry and investigated the solid formation from binary paraffinic systems. He observed that separated phases comprised from pure components. Lira-Galeana et al. (1996) suggested a new MS model for wax precipitation. They employed experimental data of <b>naphthenic</b> and aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and derived new correlation for prediction of fusion temperature. In addition, they suggested that fusion enthalpy correlation of Won (1986) overestimates the amount of wax precipitated below WAT; therefore, they developed a new correlation. The fusion heat capacity was estimated by Pedersen et al. correlation (Pedersen 1995). Ericsson et al. (1993) modified the Won (1986) model and proposed a new SS model. They showed that fusion temperature drops significantly when a branch is added to normal paraffin. They measured the amount of normal paraffins directly by performing laboratory composition analysis of component with carbon number up to 40. Won (1986) considered that all components with the same carbon number have the same melting temperature. However, Ericsson et al. (1993) revealed that melting temperature of aromatics and naphthenes is different from normal paraffins, and they modified Won (1986) correlation for fusion temperature of these components. Aftab et al. (2015) developed two SS models and measured the WDT of two ternary normal alkane systems. They applied PC-SAFT for liquid non-ideality illustration. In addition, solid-phase non-ideality has been described indirectly by EOS using solid-to-liquid fugacity ratio. In the second model, solid and liquid non-idealities were determined by different activity coefficient methods. They reported that regular solution theory for liquid-state non-ideality and predictive Wilson approach for solid-state non-ideality present improved accuracy relative to other activity models. Nichita et al. (2001) proposed an MS model for wax formation prediction in gas condensate systems. They used Won (1986) correlation to estimate fusion temperature of normal paraffins. The authors introduced new correlations for fusion enthalpy and transition temperature. Solid–solid-phase transition term was added into solid-to-liquid fugacity ratio equation of pure components. In addition, PR (Peng and Robinson 1976) EOS was utilized in their model for VLE calculation. Ghanaei et al.
