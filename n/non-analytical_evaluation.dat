40|$|The {{implementation}} of global non-analytical fit is exemplified by {{its application to}} the spectral analysis of the complex lineshape of Bi_ 2 Sr_ 2 CaCu_ 2 O_ 8 +δ at (π, 0). It deals with properly a multi-level globality in the fitting parameters and efficiently the <b>non-analytical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the fitting function, thus exhibiting a potential applicability {{to a wide range}} of systematic analysis task.
