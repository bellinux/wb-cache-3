40|$|Influenza {{is caused}} by {{influenza}} A virus, a single stranded RNA virus of the orthomyxoviridae family. In humans, it causes yearly outbreaks with high morbidity and excess fatality rates as a direct effect. Placed in its ecological niche however, in dabbling ducks, avian influenza virus (AIV) induce quite mild disease. It is when the virus crosses the species barrier that pathogenic traits are attributed to infection. Also infection of close relatives to dabbling ducks, the domestic chicken, cause morbidity and may in some cases change the virus into a highly pathogenic variant with nearly 100 % fatality rate. Being a very adaptable virus, these spill-over events are frequent, and numerous species are susceptible to influenza virus. When a subtype of influenza which has not previously infected humans crosses the species barrier, adapts to humans and spread easily, a pandemic event is imminent. There is no cure for influenza infection, and vaccination is a cumbersome endeavor, so currently the strategy when a pandemic strikes is damage control. In this thesis, I {{have been involved in}} a surveillance project, to increase our knowledge of how influenza travels across the globe with its natural host. We have also used animal models to investigate the pathological effects in mallard ducks and their susceptibility to re-infection. Furthermore, we have evaluated the effect and the potential risk of frivolous use of the anti-viral agent oseltamivir, and also investigated a novel approach to the classic virus isolation method of growing virus in embryonated chicken eggs (ECE s). Indication was found in northern Alaska that prevalence of influenza is probably not lower here than in other breeding areas for dabbling ducks, as has been previously suggested. As these birds travel over the Bering Strait, the reason for the genetic isolation of Eurasian and <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>influenza</b> A strains remains unclear. Inoculation of mallards equipped with subcutaneous data transmitters indicated very little effect on the host and no stress above background level, and all birds gained weight throughout the trial. Only in four of six birds (65 %) could a small temperature increase related to infection be recorded. However, more studies in a natural environment need to be conducted, to discern whether this variable is associated with an ecological cost as the captive trial ducks had access to food ad libitum. The most commonly used anti-viral drug, oseltamivir, is poorly degraded in sewage plants and surface water, where dabbling ducks forage. Extensive use of the drug thus increases environmental levels of the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). We show that mallards inoculated with A/H 1 N 1 in an OC enriched environment generates resistant virus sporadically at OC level found today. Higher level of OC caused the resistant subspecies to dominate the virus population, which is not desirable in the influenza reservoir. An introduction of a OC-resistant pandemic virus to the human population would render the only antiviral defense toothless. Isolation of influenza virus is traditionally performed by inoculation of infectious material into embryonated chicken eggs. As the chicken host is known to induce changes in AIV, we compared isolating and passaging two viruses both in ECE s and embryonated mallard eggs. Both egg species induced mutations in the primary passage, with no furthers changes in subsequent passages. Only in ECE s did one virus maintain wild-type configuration before one mutation was observed. Mallard eggs can based on these results not be advocated as preferable to ECE s when isolating and passaging AIV...|$|E

50|$|The {{virus is}} a novel strain of influenza. Existing {{vaccines}} against seasonal flu provide no protection. A study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in May 2009 found that children had no preexisting immunity to the new strain but that adults, particularly those over 60, had some degree of immunity. Children showed no cross-reactive antibody reaction to the new strain, adults aged 18 to 64 had 6-9%, and older adults 33%. Much reporting of early analysis repeated that the strain contained genes from five different flu viruses: <b>North</b> <b>American</b> swine <b>influenza,</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> avian <b>influenza,</b> human influenza, and two swine influenza viruses typically found in Asia and Europe. Further analysis showed {{that several of the}} proteins of the virus are most similar to strains that cause mild symptoms in humans, leading virologist Wendy Barclay to suggest that the virus was unlikely to cause severe symptoms for most people. Other leading researchers indicated that all segments of the virus were in fact swine in origin, despite it being a multiple reassortment. The first complete genome sequence of the pandemic strain was deposited in public databases on April 27, 2009, by scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Scientists in Winnipeg later completed the full genetic sequencing of viruses from Mexico and Canada on May 6, 2009.|$|R

40|$|The {{suddenly}} global {{outbreak of}} 2009 H 1 N 1 Flu reminds human being the danger {{and severity of}} influenza virus. The gene of the new strain come from five different <b>influenza</b> viruses: <b>North</b> <b>American</b> swine <b>influenza,</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> avian <b>influenza,</b> human influenza, and two swine influenza viruses typically found in Eurasia. The recombination of gene in virus evolvement makes it more and more {{important to understand the}} evolutionary characteristics of influenza. Hemagglutinin (HA), embedded on the surface of influenza virus, is one of two virally-coded integral envelope proteins of the virus. The three primary functions of hemagglutinin (HA) include receptor binding, membrane fusion, and antigenic variation. Study of HA structure and its evolutionary mechanism is crucial to fully understand influenza virus. In the first chapter, a study of diversifying selective pressure on influenze B virus hemagglutinin was reported. All the positively selected sites were located in the four epitopes (120 -loop, 150 -loop, 160 -loop and 190 -helix) of HA, and all of them have been identified in previous studies. This supports a predominant role of antibody selection in HA evolution. In the second chapter, we studied positive selection analysis of 2009 HINT Flu. Among a subgroup of human A(H 1 N 1) HAs between 1918 ∼ 2008, we found strong diversifying (positive) selection at HAI 156 and 190. We also analyzed the evolutionary trends at HAI 190 and 225 that are critical determinants for receptor-binding specificity of A(H 1 N 1) HA. Additional analysis of directional selection was also employed for H 1 N 1 gene data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{utilized}} glycan microarray technology {{to determine the}} receptor binding properties of early isolates from the recent 2009 H 1 N 1 human pandemic (pdmH 1 N 1), and compared them to <b>North</b> <b>American</b> swine <b>influenza</b> isolates from the same year, as well as past seasonal H 1 N 1 human isolates. We showed that the pdmH 1 N 1 strains, {{as well as the}} swine influenza isolates examined, bound almost exclusively to glycans with α 2, 6 -linked sialic acid with little binding detected for α 2, 3 -linked species. This is highlighted by pair-wise comparisons between compounds with identical glycan backbones, differing only in the chemistry of their terminal linkages. The overall similarities in receptor binding profiles displayed by pdmH 1 N 1 strains and swine isolates indicate that little or no adaptation appeared to be necessary in the binding component of HA for transmission from pig to human, and subsequent human to human spread...|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} {{reverse transcriptase}} PCR (RRT-PCR) assay {{based on the}} avian influenza virus matrix gene was developed for the rapid detection of type A influenza virus. Additionally, H 5 and H 7 hemagglutinin subtype-specific probe sets were developed based on <b>North</b> <b>American</b> avian <b>influenza</b> virus sequences. The RRT-PCR assay utilizes a one-step RT-PCR protocol and fluorogenic hydrolysis type probes. The matrix gene RRT-PCR assay has a detection limit of 10 fg or approximately 1, 000 copies of target RNA and can detect 0. 1 50 % egg infective dose of virus. The H 5 - and H 7 -specific probe sets each have a detection limit of 100 fg of target RNA or approximately 103 to 104 gene copies. The sensitivity and specificity of the real-time PCR assay were directly {{compared with those of}} the current standard for detection of influenza virus: virus isolation (VI) in embryonated chicken eggs and hemagglutinin subtyping by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. The comparison was performed with 1, 550 tracheal and cloacal swabs from various avian species and environmental swabs obtained from live-bird markets in New York and New Jersey. Influenza virus-specific RRT-PCR results correlated with VI results for 89 % of the samples. The remaining samples were positive with only one detection method. Overall the sensitivity and specificity of the H 7 - and H 5 -specific RRT-PCR were similar to those of VI and HI...|$|R
40|$|Human infections with subtype H 7 avian {{influenza}} viruses {{have been reported}} as early as 1979. In 1996, a genetically stable 24 -nucleotide deletion emerged in <b>North</b> <b>American</b> H 7 <b>influenza</b> virus hemagglutinins, resulting in an eight amino acid deletion in the receptor-binding site. The continuous circulation of these viruses in live bird markets, {{as well as its}} documented ability to infect humans, raises the question of how these viruses achieve structural stability and functionality. Here we report a detailed molecular analysis of the receptor binding site of the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> lineage subtype H 7 N 2 virus A/New York/ 107 / 2003 (NY 107), including complexes with an avian receptor analog (3 ′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, 3 ′SLN) and two human receptor analogs (6 ′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, 6 ′SLN; sialyllacto-N-tetraose b, LSTb). Structural results suggest a novel mechanism by which residues Arg 220 and Arg 229 (H 3 numbering) are used to compensate for the deletion of the 220 -loop and form interactions with the receptor analogs. Glycan microarray results reveal that NY 107 maintains an avian-type (α 2 - 3) receptor binding profile, with only moderate binding to human-type (α 2 - 6) receptor. Thus despite its dramatically altered receptor binding site, this HA maintains functionality and confirms a need for continued influenza virus surveillance of avian and other animal reservoirs to define their zoonotic potential...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{transmission}} of avian influenza viruses to mammals {{has become an}} increasingly investigated topic during the past decade; however, isolates that have been primarily investigated are typically ones originating from human or poultry outbreaks. Currently there is minimal comparative information {{on the behavior of}} the innumerable viruses that exist in the natural wild bird host. We have previously demonstrated the capacity of numerous <b>North</b> <b>American</b> avian <b>influenza</b> viruses isolated from wild birds to infect and induce lesions in the respiratory tract of mice. In this study, two isolates from shorebirds that were previously examined in mice (H 1 N 9 and H 6 N 1 subtypes) are further examined through experimental inoculations in the ferret with analysis of viral shedding, histopathology, and antigen localization via immunohistochemistry to elucidate pathogenicity and {{transmission of}} these viruses. Using sequence analysis and glycan binding analysis, we show that these avian viruses have the typical avian influenza binding pattern, with affinity for cell glycoproteins/glycolipids having terminal sialic acid (SA) residues with a 2, 3 linkage [Neu 5 Ac(a 2, 3) Gal]. Despite the lack of a 2, 6 linked SA binding, these AIVs productively infected both the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets, resulting in nasal viral shedding and pulmonary lesions with minimal morbidity. Moreover, we show that one of the viruses is able to transmit to ferrets via direct contact, despite its binding affinity for a 2, 3 linked SA residues. These results demonstrate that avian influenza viruses, which are endemic in aquatic birds, can potentially infect humans and other mammals without adaptation. Finally this wor...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of orally administered antimicrobial susceptibilities of common pathogens that cause community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) has become exceedingly important {{due to the}} number of office visits for this indication. Numerous local, regional and global studies have documented the susceptibilities of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, the most common CARTI pathogens. SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program sites in North and Latin America, and Europe were requested to send a combined total of 100 isolates of these pathogens to the local monitor for reference broth microdilution testing (1997 - 2001). This study compared the susceptibility profiles of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates (13, 370 strains) from the three geographic regions over a five year period. beta-lactamase mediated ampicillin resistance among H. influenzae was highest among <b>North</b> <b>American</b> isolates (27. 9 %) compared to Latin America and Europe (16. 2 to 16. 3 %), although it was noted that during the five year study period, ampicillin resistance was steadily increasing in the latter two regions. Cefprozil (84. 3 % susceptible) and clarithromycin (81. 1 % susceptible) were also less active against <b>North</b> <b>American</b> H. <b>influenzae</b> isolates. Latin <b>American</b> isolates were much less susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S; 59. 3 %) compared to the other regions (75. 8 to 78. 6 %). M. catarrhalis isolates were also significantly less susceptible to T/S in Latin America (10. 5 % resistance). the production of beta-lactamase enzymes among the M. catarrhalis isolates exceeded > 95 % in all three regions during the five year period. the fluoroquinolones (FQ) remained very active against these two respiratory pathogens with rare isolates with elevated FQ MIC results. It is apparent front this investigation that many commonly prescribed empiric treatments remain viable therapeutic options for CARTI caused by these two Gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens.
