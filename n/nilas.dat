In the tropics where sunlight falls more directly, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over near the poles, the temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice at its freezing point. Its salinity makes this lower than freshwater's, usually about [...] These temperature differences contribute to the continuous circulation of water through the sea. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics; as the water becomes denser, it sinks. The cold water in the deep sea moves back towards the equator before welling up again to the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between [...] {{in all parts of the}} globe. In freezing seas, ice crystals begin to form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil. In calm conditions, frazil will freeze into a thin, flat sheet called <b>nilas,</b> which thickens as new ice forms in the sea beneath it. In turbulent waters, frazil instead join together into larger flat discs known as [...] "pancakes". These slide over and under one another to form floes. During these processes, salt water and air are trapped amid the ice. <b>Nilas</b> forms with a salinity around 12–15‰ and is grayish in color but grows fresher over time: after a year, it is bluish and closer to 4–6‰ saline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nilas</b> designates a sea {{ice crust}} up to 10 cm in thickness.

50|$|<b>Nila</b> {{heads the}} monkey {{army in the}} battle led by Rama against Ravana and his rakshasa army. The Ramayana tells of <b>Nila</b> facing the demon Nikumbha. Though injured by the demon, <b>Nila</b> picks up the chariot wheel of Nikumbha and kills him with it. <b>Nila</b> also fights a fierce battle with Prahasta. The demon shoots many arrows at <b>Nila</b> who, unable to escape, bears them calmly with closed eyes. Later, when Prahasta dashes towards <b>Nila</b> with a mallet, the monkey fights back with rocks and finally hurls a huge boulder at him, thus slaying him. <b>Nila</b> also battles with Ravana, jumping onto his chariot. <b>Nila</b> and Hanuman {{together}} battle with demons Trishira and Mahodara, when <b>Nila</b> kills the latter with a rock. The Mahabharata states that he slays the rakshasa Pramathi in the battle. The Kamba Ramayana portrays him as being defeated and struck unconscious by Indrajit, Ravana's son.|$|R

50|$|Young ice is a {{transition}} stage between <b>nilas</b> and first-year ice, and ranges in thickness from 10 cm to 30 cm, Young ice {{can be further}} subdivided into grey ice - 10 cm to 15 cm in thickness, and grey-white ice - 15 cm to 30 cm in thickness. Young ice is not as flexible as <b>nilas,</b> but tends to break under wave action. In a compression regime, it will either raft (at the grey ice stage) or ridge (at the grey-white ice stage).|$|E

5000|$|When Rishi {{passes the}} letter through a drunk Stranger to <b>Nila</b> {{on the night}} before her wedding, she shows it to her ‘doctor’ groom. The Doctor reads the ‘suicide’ note and empathizes with Mohan and {{encourages}} <b>Nila</b> to go ahead and marry him, wishing her good luck, promising that he would marry <b>Nila’s</b> sister instead. <b>Nila</b> sneaks out of the wedding hall and gets into a car. The car stops halfway through and <b>Nila</b> is surprised to see Rishi in the driver seat. Rishi reveals his surprise that <b>Nila</b> hasn’t ran away from the car and subtly acknowledges his own defeat. The car stops at a house. Rishi lets <b>Nila</b> out and tells her that the house was where he was born and that that’s where her ‘first night’ is going to happen and asks her to go in. <b>Nila</b> warns Rishi that her first night {{will turn out to be}} Rishi’s last night. Rishi sarcastically approves her [...] "bravado" [...] but still encourages her to go in. <b>Nila</b> enters that house confused until she sees Mohan begging his Parents and his sister to approve his love for <b>Nila.</b> What follows is an ugly altercation among the four. Rishi who is drinking outside the house hears this and enters in. Mohan tells his parents that Rishi is his boss and he gave the house as a gift for their upcoming wedding. Mohan’s parents talk ill of Rishi and sarcastically suggest him to marry <b>Nila</b> since he gave her a ride in the middle of the night. Mohan changes his mind soon and asks Rishi to drop <b>Nila</b> back off at the wedding hall. Rishi gets upset at Mohan and tries to convince him about <b>Nila’s</b> trust but in vain. <b>Nila</b> gives up on Mohan and asks Rishi to leave the place.

50|$|Rafting, {{also called}} telescoped ice, is most {{noticeable}} when it involves new and young ice, but also occurs in ice of all thicknesses. The process of finger rafting as such is commonly observed inside a lead, once {{a thin layer}} of ice (at the <b>nilas</b> stage) has formed. Although this ice is typically very weak (it is unable to support its own weight outside the water), it contains a lot of brine and is also relatively warm, since being that thin, its temperature is near that of the water. Rafting is accompanied with rapid draining of the brine inside the overlying ice sheet. This brine acts as a lubricant, significantly reducing the friction between the two sheets during overthrusting. Such a mechanism, {{and the fact that the}} upper surface of <b>nilas</b> is already slippery, account for overthrust distances in excess of 100 m (a length-to-thickness ratio of 1000 to one).|$|E
50|$|Sea ice {{growth in}} {{turbulent}} water differs from sea ice growth in calm water. In turbulent water, the ice crystals accumulate at the surface, forming a grease-ice layer composed of individual ice crystals and small irregular clumps of ice crystals. In calm water conditions, <b>nilas,</b> a thick elastic crust, forms at the surface, which thickens as water molecules freeze to the ice-water interface.|$|E

As <b>nilà</b> products were distributed in other places, people came {{to refer to the}} area as Sa may <b>Nilà,</b> Tagalog for [...] "the place where there are nilàs". The word <b>nilà</b> itself is probably from the Sanskrit <b>nila</b> (नील), meaning [...] "indigo tree".|$|R

5000|$|Several {{formation}} {{mechanisms of}} sea ice have been identified. At its earliest stages, sea iceconsists of elongated, randomly oriented crystals. This is called frazil and mixed with water inthe unconsolidated state {{is known as}} grease ice. If wave and wind conditions are calm, thesecrystals will consolidate at the surface and by selective pressure, begin to grow preferentiallyin the downward direction, forming <b>nilas.</b> In more turbulent conditions, the frazil will consolidateby mechanical action to form pancake ice, which has a more random structure ...|$|E
50|$|In calm water, {{the first}} sea ice to {{form on the}} surface is a skim of {{separate}} crystals which initially are {{in the form of}} tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than 0.3 cm. Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable, and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile, and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an ice type called frazil or grease ice. In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent — that is the ice called <b>nilas.</b> Once <b>nilas</b> has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on {{to the bottom of the}} existing ice sheet, a process called congelation growth. This growth process yields first-year ice.|$|E

50|$|First-year sea ice is {{ice that}} is thicker than young ice {{but has no}} more than one year growth. In other words, it is ice that grows in the fall and winter (after it has gone through the new ice — <b>nilas</b> — young ice stages and grows further) but does not survive the spring and summer months (it melts away). The {{thickness}} of this ice typically ranges from 0.3 m to 2 m. First-year ice may be further divided into thin (30 cm to 70 cm), medium (70 cm to 120 cm) and thick (>120 cm).|$|E
