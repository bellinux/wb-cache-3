5|$|In Yao's {{first game}} in Miami on December 16, 2002, the Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies, an Asian {{cultural}} stereotype. Yao was not {{angry with the}} promotion {{because he was not}} familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese. In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.|$|E
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Sue Blane was not keen {{on working}} for the film until she became aware that Curry, an old friend, was committed to the project. Curry and Blane had worked together in Glasgow's Citizens Theatre in a production of The Maids, where Curry had worn a woman's corset in the production. Blane arranged it with the theatre to loan her the corset from the other production for Rocky Horror. Blane admits {{that she did not}} conduct research for her designing, had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> science fiction film, and is acutely aware that her costumes for Brad and Janet may have been generalizations.|$|E
5|$|He used actors {{of diverse}} backgrounds, from famous film stars {{to people who}} had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors {{who had worked for}} Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E

5|$|Kalinovka was {{a peasant}} village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated {{that she had}} <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> village as poor as Kalinovka had been. Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled {{for a total of}} four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a {{freethinker}} who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E

While Nancy does become a bit frustrated with the lizards' intellectual limitations, she becomes increasingly annoyed with Charlie's condescending attitude toward them. Yet, when the lizards want to go back—after Charlie drives Sarah to tears, and Leslie beats him up—Nancy wants them to stay and offers them help. This experience has given Nancy the excitement she craves, and she ensures that it continues.|$|E
25|$|Thomson's {{travels in}} China were often perilous, as he visited remote, almost {{unpopulated}} regions far inland. Most {{of the people}} he encountered had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> Westerner or camera before. His expeditions were also especially challenging because he had to transport his bulky wooden camera, many large, fragile glass plates, and potentially explosive chemicals. He photographed {{in a wide variety of}} conditions and often had to improvise because chemicals were difficult to acquire. His subject matter varied enormously: from humble beggars and street people to Mandarins, Princes and senior government officials; from remote monasteries to Imperial Palaces; from simple rural villages to magnificent landscapes.|$|E
25|$|The 1970–71 season was, in retrospect, the {{high-water mark}} of the 1970s for Boston. While Sinden {{temporarily}} retired from hockey to enter business (he was replaced by ex-Bruin and Canadien defenseman Tom Johnson), the Bruins set dozens of offensive scoring records: they had seven of the league's top ten scorers—a feat not achieved before or since—set the record for wins in a season, and in a league that had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> 100-point scorer before 1969, the Bruins had four that year. All four (Orr, Esposito, Bucyk and Hodge) were named First Team All-Stars, a feat matched in the expansion era only by the 1976–77 Canadiens. Boston were favored to repeat as Cup champions, but ran into a roadblock in the playoffs. Up 5–1 {{at one point in}} game two of the quarter-finals against the Canadiens (and rookie goaltender Ken Dryden), the Bruins squandered the lead to lose 7–5. The Bruins never recovered and lost the series in seven games.|$|E

25|$|Bill Oberst, {{the actor}} playing Sherman, {{states in a}} behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that while the general {{will always be a}} controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light on why the man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he met with courtesy and respect. (The documentary also shows the reactions of his soldiers as they met blacks along the March. Many had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> black person and were surprised to learn that blacks were ordinary people.) The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat {{in the wake of the}} Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as only doing his duty and that he did not care what people said about him one way or the other.|$|E
25|$|He {{was often}} left {{to fend for}} himself, getting into many fights without the {{supervision}} or guidance of his parents. Shamrock's father abandoned his family and when Shamrock was five years old, his mother, Diane Kilpatrick, now divorced from his father, remarried an Army aviator named Bob Nance. The newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent, they continued to cause trouble and get into fights and also began using drugs. Nance, who had fought in the Vietnam War, {{became a member of}} the local fire department and also found work in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved and excelled in sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.|$|E
25|$|An Ayrshire story {{tells of}} how an Ayrshire baron once strung up an {{innocent}} man, just because his visitor had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> man hanged before. Hopefully {{this was an}} isolated example, however the system suffered from many faults due to bias, lack of legal training, etc., etc. As stated, a right of appeal to Regalities and sheriffdoms courts did exist. Details of the sometimes shocking excesses of baron bailies can make painful reading. As their power was great and generally abused, {{so many of them}} enriched themselves. They had many ways of making money for themselves, such as (1) the bailie's darak, as it was called, or a day's labour in the year from every tenant on the estate; (2) confiscations, as they generally seized on all the goods and effects of such as suffered capitally; (3) all fines for killing game, blackfish, or cutting green wood were laid on by themselves, and went into their own pockets. These fines amounted to what they pleased almost. (4) Another very lucrative perquisite they had was what was called the Herial Horse, which was the best horse, cow, ox, or other article which any tenant on the estate possessed {{at the time of his}} death. This was taken from the widow and children for the bailie, at the time they had most need of assistance. This amounted to a great deal of extra income for the baillie of a large barony.|$|E
