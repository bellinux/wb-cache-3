40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} a new {{magnetometer}} setup and a novel model based data evaluation technique {{was used to}} determine the creep damage in ferritic power plant steel. The tested material was lCr- 0. 5 Mo- 0. 25 V ferritic steel which is commonly used as pipeline base material of steam generators in power plants. It is commonly accepted that a combined form of fatigue and the creep processes cause the deterioration of this structural parts due to long time elevated temperature service. Nowadays, there is increasing need for remaining lifetime estimation of these engineering structures. In this paper, the variation of magnetization curves of Cr-Mo-V ferritic steel due to creep measured and the relation between creep damage and the magnetic property changes is discussed. A new data evaluation technique is presented which is based on the hyperbolic model of magnetization.

Our methodology enables to draw the continuous <b>magnetization</b> <b>curve</b> {{from a series of}} the distinct scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of magnetic domains. Our image processing methodology has two distinguished features. One is that the contrast of a domain image is regarded as an average of flux density. Another one is that domain motion observed in several domain images is represented by the image Helmholtz equation. Its solution generates any magnetized states of the magnetic domains. Moreover, computing averaged contrast of each image gives value of flux density on a <b>magnetization</b> <b>curve.</b> In this paper, we apply our methodology to the domain images of a grain-oriented electrical steel.
