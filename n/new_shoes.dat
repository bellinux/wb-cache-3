5|$|One of {{the classic}} account of slaves that escaped on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional work, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which relates the story of Eliza Harris, a young slave girl who escaped the South by {{crossing}} the Ohio River on a winter night. Barefooted and carrying her baby, the fictional Eliza was exhausted and nearly dead when she reached safety. After receiving food, clothing, <b>new</b> <b>shoes,</b> and shelter from Stowe's fictional Quaker couple, Simeon and Rachael Halliday, Eliza continued her journey to freedom in Canada. Stow, who {{was living in the}} city at the time, was acquainted with the Coffins, who may have been the inspiration for the Halliday couple in her novel.|$|E

25|$|Caruso was {{encouraged}} {{in his early}} musical ambitions by his mother, who died in 1888. To raise cash for his family, he found work as a street singer in Naples and performed at cafes and soirees. Aged 18, he used the fees he had earned by singing at an Italian resort to buy his first pair of <b>new</b> <b>shoes.</b> His progress as a paid entertainer was interrupted, however, by 45 days of compulsory military service. He completed this in 1894, resuming his voice lessons upon discharge from the army.|$|E

25|$|Though {{a dynamic}} stage personality, Atwell was, in person, a shy, {{retiring}} and soft-spoken woman of modesty. Eloquent and intellectual, {{she was well}} read and, unlike many {{in the world of}} professional showbusiness, keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in her reading habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of <b>new</b> <b>shoes,</b> and a keen interest in televised cricket (she backed England). She was also a devout Catholic, who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church.|$|E
25|$|Gerda, posing under several aliases {{including}} that of Mrs Albert Chapman, invited Sainsbury Seale to visit her, killed her, and took her identity; {{but she had to}} buy <b>new</b> <b>shoes</b> because those of Sainsbury Seale did not fit her. This is why the buckles on the shoes found on the corpse were dull, whereas the buckle of the woman whom Poirot met going into Morley's surgery was shiny: the fake Mabelle had newer shoes. The woman in the trunk could hardly have worn through a new pair of shoes in a single day. Ironically, the face of the corpse had been disfigured not because it wasn't Mabelle Sainsbury Seale, but because it was.|$|E
25|$|Allen {{realized}} during {{college that}} he wanted to play music professionally and began trying to write music. He played his first gig at a local bar in downtown Conway during his sophomore year, and he went on to drop out of college {{in the middle of his}} junior year to follow his dream of becoming a professional musician. He worked as a shoe salesman at a sporting goods store during the day to make ends meet and continued playing gigs in Little Rock and Fayetteville at night. In 2007, Allen wrote and self-produced an album entitled Brand <b>New</b> <b>Shoes</b> with college friends and bandmates Michael Holmes (drums) and Chase Erwin (bass). The album's title makes reference to Allen's days as a shoe salesman, and only 600 copies of the album were produced, most of which were given to family and friends.|$|E

25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand <b>new</b> <b>shoes</b> and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
500|$|Disney has {{gradually}} been introducing new, modified versions of princess costumes at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. In September 2016, Jasmine's outfit received a [...] "modest" [...] makeover at; a redesigned, less revealing {{version of the}} character's blue outfit from the film debuted at both Disney World and Disneyland after 24 years. The costume consists of long sleeves, <b>new</b> <b>shoes,</b> full-length top concealing her midriff, high neckline, and a modified hairstyle while retaining the original turqoise-green color from the films. Her pants have been replaced with a floor-length dress. A gold belt featuring an embroidered design of Raja's face has also {{been added to the}} costume. Jasmine introduced her new outfit to guests with a public appearance at the first Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. Although similar modifications were made to Pocahontas and Mulan's costumes, Jasmine's redesign has inspired the most controversial response from the public. When questioned, park attendants and cast members explain that the redesigns were made to be more accurate to the cultures from which the characters hail, although Jasmine is from a fictional kingdom, Agrabah. Rachel Paige of Hello Giggles identified the main reason for the dramatic modifications is because several park guests were complaining about the character's exposed midriff and its effects on young girls; Paige defended that the outfit is in accordance to the location and time period in which the film is set. The redesign is expected to gradually begin to appear at other Disney theme parks around the world as well.|$|E

2500|$|Poverty deeply impacts individuals, families, {{society and}} costs governments {{perhaps as much}} as $80 billion annually. Individually it is {{characterized}} by people having to make tough choices between meeting basic needs like deciding whether to eat, buy <b>new</b> <b>shoes,</b> pay the rent etc. Studies have found poverty is strongly associated with poorer health, [...] physical and emotional, alcohol and drug abuse, recidivism in the criminal justice system, class divides that threaten Canadian social stability, and higher early mortality rates among those living in poverty.|$|E
2500|$|When General Hardee {{was given}} {{command of the}} [...] "Left Wing" [...] of the Army of Mississippi (now {{commanded}} by General Bragg, from the 33rd's Pensacola days), Wood's Fourth Brigade {{was assigned to the}} Third Division of the Left Wing, under command of Major General Simon Bolivar Buckner. In concert {{with the rest of the}} army, the 33rd left Corinth at the end of July and travelled by train from Tupelo, Mississippi, to Meridian; thence to Mobile, Alabama, and Montgomery, then on to Atlanta, Georgia, and Dalton before arriving at Tyner's Station, just east of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Following this, Wood's brigade marched into the city, where they crossed the Tennessee River on [...] "a ferry boat, propelled by two blind horses" [...] and picked up two months' pay (at $11 per month), a $50 bounty for each soldier, <b>new</b> <b>shoes</b> and clothing, and rations.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the return}} of the command to St. Louis on 18 November 1864, the men were {{supplied}} with <b>new</b> <b>shoes</b> and clothing. Then the command of General A. J.

The One Hundred and Twenty-second Regiment proceeded to Nashville, where, on 15 and 16 December 1864, it took part in the battle of Nashville, capturing four pieces of artillery and a battle flag from the enemy; and losing in killed and wounded 26 men. The conduct of the Regiment in this battle was commended specially in the report of General Garrard, the Division command. The Regiment was commanded in the battle by Lieutenant Colonel James F.

2500|$|Going as {{far back}} as the 1936 Olympics, Adolf Hitler used this as a stage to promote Aryan {{nationalism}} for Germany with his ideological belief of racial supremacy. The Olympics were used as a method of hardening the German spirit and instilling unity among German youth. It was also believed that sport was a [...] "way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables." [...] As a result, many Jews and Gypsies were banned from participating in sporting events. While Germany did top the medal table, the Nazi depiction of ethnic Africans as inferior was dispelled by Jesse Owens' gold medals in the 100m, 200m, 4 × 100 m relay and long jump events. There were questions as to whether Hitler acknowledged Owens' victories. On the first day of competition, Hitler left the stadium after only shaking hands with the German victors. An Olympic committee member then insisted that Hitler either greet every medalist or none at all; he chose the latter. At the games he was visited by Adi Dassler, the founder of Adidas, who offered <b>new</b> <b>shoes</b> to Owens.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{appearing}} on American Idol, Allen participated in missionary work {{in several countries}} around the world, including Burma, Thailand, Mozambique, Morocco, Spain, and South Africa with the University of Central Arkansas' Chi Alpha campus ministry. [...] In Morocco, during his first mission trip, Allen contracted a rare form of hepatitis that left him sick {{for an entire year}} after returning home. Allen credits this near-death experience with giving him the ability to write songs as he was finally able to compose his first original song while recuperating from his illness. A couple of years later, while on a mission trip in Thailand, Allen became moved when he saw a worship leader struggling with poor music and sound equipment during a church service at a refugee camp. He chose to leave behind a brand new guitar for the church to use even though that was the only guitar he owned at the time. His experiences in Thailand inspired the song [...] "Land of Smiles" [...] from his pre-Idol album Brand <b>New</b> <b>Shoes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The first mastersingers file {{into the}} church, {{including}} Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner {{and the town}} clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for {{the winner of the}} song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is squelched by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the masterguild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was Walther von der Vogelweide whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the [...] "Marker" [...] of the guild for worldly matters. [...] At the signal to begin (Fanget an!), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (So rief der Lenz in den Wald), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his chalkboard, maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that {{there is no point in}} finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) <b>new</b> <b>shoes,</b> which are overdue. Raising his voice over the masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.|$|E

50|$|On the French {{scene in}} 1970, Daniel Raufast {{came across a}} poster {{advertising}} the musical Hair. Interested by all the barefooted youngsters wearing jeans, he developed a <b>new</b> <b>shoe</b> concept which he believed to be more compatible with the blue-jean generation. The designer Jacques Chevallereau then created the first 'jean boot'. This <b>new</b> <b>shoe</b> was very different: the use of nubuck; shapes that looked more like short boots than regular shoes; tough crepe soles made with natural rubber, eyelets, contrast stitching, panels and appliqués all obviously referencing denim. The success was such that, within one season, Kickers production capacity grew from 300 to 12,000 pairs per month. Immediately successful in France, then Germany, by 1974, Kickers were selling in over 70 countries.|$|R
