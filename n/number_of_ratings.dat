40|$|Abstract Collaborative Filtering (CF) is {{a popular}} method for {{personalizing}} product recommendations for e-Commerce and customer relationship management (CRM). CF utilizes the explicit or implicit product evaluation ratings of customers to develop personalized recommendations. However, {{there has been no}} in-depth investigation of the parameters of CF in relation to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ratings</b> on the part of an individual customer and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ratings</b> for an item. We empirically investigated the relationships between these two parameters and CF performance, using two publicly available data sets, EachMovie and MovieLens. We conducted three experiments. The first two investigated the relationship between a particular customer’s <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ratings</b> and CF recommendation performance. The third experiment evaluated the relationship between the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ratings</b> for a particular item and CF recommendation performance. We found that there are ratings thresholds below which recommendation performance increases monotonically, i. e., when the numbers of customer and item ratings are below threshold levels, CF recommendation performance is affected. In addition, once rating numbers surpass threshold levels, the value of each rating decreases. These results may facilitate operational decisions when applying CF in practice...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the online one-class collaborative filtering (CF) problem {{that consists of}} recommending items to users over time in an online fashion based on positive ratings only. This problem arises when users respond only occasionally to a recommendation with a positive rating, and never with a negative one. We study {{the impact of the}} probability of a user responding to a recommendation, p_f, on the sample complexity, i. e., the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ratings</b> required to make `good' recommendations, and ask whether receiving positive and negative ratings, instead of positive ratings only, improves the sample complexity. Both questions arise in the design of recommender systems. We introduce a simple probabilistic user model, and analyze the performance of an online user-based CF algorithm. We prove that after an initial cold start phase, where recommendations are invested in exploring the user's preferences, this algorithm makes [...] -up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating the user's preferences [...] -perfect recommendations. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ratings</b> required for the cold start phase is nearly proportional to 1 /p_f, and that for updating the user's preferences is essentially independent of p_f.
