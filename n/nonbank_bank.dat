50|$|Glass-Steagall’s {{affiliation}} restrictions applied if the <b>nonbank</b> <b>bank</b> was {{a national}} bank or otherwise {{a member of the}} Federal Reserve System. The OCC’s permission for Dreyfus to own a nationally chartered “nonbank bank” was based on the OCC’s conclusion that Dreyfus, as a mutual fund company, earned only a small amount of its revenue through underwriting and distributing shares in mutual funds. Two other securities firms, J. & W. Seligman & Co. and Prudential-Bache, established state chartered non-Federal Reserve System member banks to avoid Glass-Steagall restrictions on affiliations between member banks and securities firms.|$|E
5000|$|The OCC’s action {{relied on}} a “loophole” in the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) that meant a company only became a “bank holding company” {{supervised}} by the Federal Reserve Board if it owned a “bank” that made “commercial loans” (i.e., loans to businesses) and provided “demand deposits” (i.e., checking accounts). A “nonbank bank” could be established to provide checking accounts (but not commercial loans) or commercial loans (but not checking accounts).

Glass-Steagall also did not prevent investment banks from affiliating with <b>nonbank</b> <b>banks</b> or savings and loans. Citing this competitive “inequality,” before the Federal Reserve Board approved any Section 20 affiliates, four large bank holding companies that eventually received Section 20 affiliate approvals (Chase, J.P. Morgan, Citicorp, and Bankers Trust) had threatened to give up their banking charters if they were not given greater securities powers. Following the Federal Reserve Board’s approvals of Section 20 affiliates a commentator concluded that the Glass-Steagall “wall” between commercial banking and “the securities and investment business” was “porous” for commercial banks and “nonexistent to investment bankers and other nonbank entities.” ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Risk {{and risk}} {{management}} {{have been given}} a considerable attention because of the complexities in the business world. The aim of this report is to analysis the difference of risk disclosure determinants between companies from UK and Hong Kong. This study seeks to address the gap in the literature of cross-country study. And it explores risk disclosure within 80 annual reports using self-conduct risk disclosure index and regression analysis. The paper confirmed a significant relationship between the number of risk disclosure and company size for both countries. It also found a significant difference between <b>banks</b> and <b>nonbanks.</b> <b>Banks</b> disclose more risk information than nonbanks. Moreover, it also confirmed a fairly significant association between the profitability and risk disclosure index. However, no association is found between gearing ratio and risk disclosure index. The results show no difference between UK and Hong Kong companies on risk disclosure. Oil companies are also not found to disclose more risk information than other companies. One key limitation of this report concerns on the calculation of risk disclosure index or whether it {{is the best way to}} present the risk in this report. In addition, the subjective judgment cannot be wholly avoided when read the risk management chapter of the annual report and the selection of the nine risk categories is subject to debate. Overall, the results of this report are effective in making important contributions to the existing literature. In order to inform the debates and ensure the outcomes are appropriate, the additional further research to this topic is still necessary. The future work may use other approaches to measuring the relationship between the risk disclosure and leverage, country and oil industry within this study. The cross-country and industry-specified risk disclosure studies could be helpful in understanding the determinants and affection of the risk disclosure...|$|R

40|$|Nonbanks {{have always}} been a key {{component}} of the nation's payments system. In recent years, however, nonbanks have become even more prominent. This heightened visibility raises several questions. In which payments activities are nonbanks engaged? What roles do nonbanks play in specific payments types? What types of risk are potentially associated with nonbank participation? This paper begins to address these questions. Preliminary findings include: (1) Nonbanks are involved in a myriad of activities and roles, both in traditional and emerging payments types; (2) Nonbank business relationships with banks and other participants in the payments systems are often highly complex and interrelated; (3) Nonbanks are rarely directly involved in settlement activities and, hence, appear to be associated with limited settlement and systemic risk; (4) Both <b>nonbanks</b> and <b>banks</b> appear to be increasingly susceptible to operational risk factors.; Published as a book in 2003.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the evolution, composition, and determinants of financing to the nonfinancial private sector in Mexico between 2000 and 2005. Supported by the macroeconomic environment and financial system reforms, total financing to the private sector (particularly consumer credit) increased relative to GDP, while accessibilityand affordability generally improved. Equity issuance did not play an important role during the period under consideration. Although the supply of financing shifted toward domestic <b>nonbank</b> providers, commercial <b>banks</b> remain the primary source of funding. Significant progress was made in cleaning up bank loan portfolios and in strengthening financial system soundness and infrastructure. The prospects for continued private sector financing growth remain very positive, but financing is not spread out evenly across all market segments.

I found that securities subsidiaries that are primary dealers of government securities, their higher risk partially comes from their higher leverage, whereas for {{those that are not}} primary dealers, despite having lower leverage, they tend to be riskier than their bank affiliates partly because of their aggressive trading behavior. Nevertheless, securities subsidiaries appear to provide diversification benefits to bank holding companies, as evidenced by the low return correlation between bank subsidiaries and securities subsidiaries. Within the class of securities activities, I found that securities trading tends to be more profitable and riskier than banking activities. Trading activities engaged by primary dealer securities subsidiaries tend to provide strong diversification benefits to banking activities, reducing the banking organization's overall risk. For non-primary dealers, due to their aggressive trading behavior, their trading activities were found to increase the firm's total risk. On the other hand, securities underwriting is found to be riskier, {{and in the case of}} non-primary dealers also less profitable, than banking activities. Nevertheless, its return exhibits low correlation with banking return and trading return, suggesting that securities underwriting provides potential diversification benefits to both banking and trading activities.

40|$|Three {{fundamental}} and interconnected issues should be carefully considered before making any decisions on altering the federal safety net or {{the structure of}} the U. S. banking system. The first is whether or not bank depositors and other creditors can exercise timely and meaningful restraint on excessive risk-taking by bank managements. The second is whether the government should handle the orderly resolution of large bank failures {{in such a way that}} uninsured depositors and other bank creditors are protected. The third fundamental issue is the degree to which banking should continue to be insulated from other financial and nonfinancial activities.; Drawing upon thirty-five years of experience in bank supervision and discount window administration, the author reviews these issues. He concludes that since market discipline cannot be effective in deterring excessive credit risks in banks, the authorities must continue to give all depositors of large banks at least the implicit assurance that their funds will be protected. He believes that bank involvement in investment banking and other financial activities should continue to be limited, and that <b>nonbank</b> entry into <b>banking</b> should continue to be restricted, in order to avoid broadening the federal safety net.

Direct cross-border lending to <b>nonbanks</b> by Austrian <b>banks</b> expanded rapidly over the last few years; the bulk of loans is extended to corporate customers and is denominated in a foreign currency, with the euro taking a prominent position. By means of a series of univariate analyses, we provide support for the relevance of geographic proximity – small and mediumsized banks mainly lend to neighboring countries. Banks’ direct lending also seems to follow nonfinancial FDI by Austrian corporates to CESEE and the CIS. We furthermore analyze the interdependencies between direct (i. e. by Austrian headquarters) and indirect (i. e. by local subsidiaries) cross-border lending and find support for a complementary effect between the two.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{the growth and}} risks of and regulatory responses to shadow banking—financial intermediaries or activities involved in credit intermediation outside the regular banking system, and therefore lacking a formal safety net. The largest shadow banking systems are found in advanced economies, where more narrowly defined shadow banking measures indicate stagnation, while broader measures (which include investment funds) gener-ally show continued growth since the global financial crisis. In emerging market economies, the growth of shadow banking has been strong, outpacing that of the traditional banking system. Although shadow banking takes vastly different forms across and within countries, {{some of the key}} drivers behind its growth are common to all: a tightening of banking regulation and ample liquidity conditions, as well as demand from institutional investors, tend to foster nonbanking activities. The current financial environment in advanced economies remains conducive to further growth in shadow banking. Many indications there point to the migration of some activities—such as lending to firms—from traditional <b>banks</b> to the <b>nonbank</b> sector. Shadow <b>banking</b> can play a beneficial role as a complement to traditional banking by expanding access to credit or by supporting market liquidity, maturity transformation, and risk sharing. It often, however, comes with bank-like risks, as seen during the 2007 – 08 global financial crisis. Although data limitations prevent a comprehensive assessment, the U. S. shadow banking system appears to contribute most to domestic systemic risk; its contribution is much less pronounced in the euro area and the United Kingdom.

40|$|One of {{the major}} lenders to small and medium-size {{enterprises}} (SMEs) is nonbank financial institutions. Unlike deposit-taking <b>banks,</b> <b>nonbank</b> financial institutions - {{those that do not}} take deposits - tend to charge high interest rates, instead of asking for collateral, in extending credit to SMEs. Thus, there is a high possibility that information asymmetry between such nonbank lenders and SME borrowers may be creating adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Using the data taken from the "Survey of Financial Environment" conducted by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, this paper empirically examines whether or not moral hazard exists on the part of SMEs borrowing from nonbank financial institutions. The paper asserts the following two points: 1) Despite a decrease in both the amount of outstanding loans and the number of establishments, nonbank financial institutions are maintaining a high level of return on assets (ROA), measured as a percentage of recurring profits to total assets, and the total number of branches is not decreasing. Thus, judging from the data available on the part of nonbank financial institutions, it is hard to say that the market for nonbank financial institutions is shrinking. 2) Findings from an analysis of microdata on SMEs with a Bivariate Probit Model point to a high probability that borrowers from a nonbank financial institution will fall into a state of net capital deficiency within one year after resorting to such nonbank financing. Based on this, it is conceivable that companies using nonbank financing are opting for high-risk businesses thus resulting in higher loan loss risks. Such quantitative analysis results suggest that the problem of moral hazard is arising. ...|$|R

Based on the study of eight countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and Venezuela), the magnitude of the slowdown is documented, comparing it to historical behavior and to slowdown episodes in other regions of the world. Second, changes in bank balance sheets are examined to determine whether the credit slowdown is merely a reflection of a slowdown in bank deposits, or whether the asset side has changed. Third, following an econometric disequilibrium approach used in recent studies of credit slowdowns in East Asia and Finland, the paper investigates possible causes for the slowdown in three countries: Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.

The BHCA was enacted and remains on the books for two fundamental reasons: 1) to prevent undue concentration in banking; and 2) to avoid the mixing of banking with other businesses unrelated to banking (generally called 2 ̆ 2 commerce 2 ̆ 2). Both of these purposes have been or are being discredited, {{and it is time}} to ask whether the BHCA should be repealed. On several levels, banking is combined with commerce and has been both before and after adoption of the BHCA in 1956.

They find: 1) There is no reliable statistical relationship between restrictions on commercial banks'ability to engage in securities, insurance, and real estate transactions and how well-developed the banking sector, how well-developed securities markets and non-bank financial intermediaries are, or the degree of industrial competition. Based on the evidence, it is difficult to argue confidently that restricting commercial banking activities benefits-or harms-the development of financial and securities markets or industrial competition. 2) There are no positive effects from mixing banking and commerce. 3) Countries that more tightly restrict and regulate the securities activities of commercial banks are substantially more likely to suffer a major banking crisis. Countries whose national regulations inhibit banks'ability to engage in securities underwriting, brokering, and dealing [...] and all aspects of the mutual fund business [...] tend to have more fragile financial systems. 4) The mixing of banking and commerce is associated with less financial stability. The evidence does not support admonitions to restrict the mixing of banking and commerce because mixing them will increase financial fragility. 5) On average, greater state ownership of banks tends to be associated with more poorly developed <b>banks,</b> <b>nonbanks,</b> and stock markets and more poorly functioning financial systems.

40|$|The first essay {{analyzes}} {{mutual funds}} proxy voting records on shareholder proposals. The {{results indicate that}} mutual funds support shareholder proposals and vote against management for proposals {{that are likely to}} increase shareholders wealth and rights, in firms with weaker external monitoring mechanisms, in firms with entrenched management, and when funds have longer investment horizon. Mutual funds mostly take management sides on executive compensation related proposals, when they have higher ownership concentration, and when they belong to bigger fund families. The results further indicate that there is a positive reputational effect for the funds undertaking a monitoring role. Moreover, mutual funds reduce holdings when they disapprove of managements policy, but before doing so they take on an activist role by supporting shareholder proposals. The second essay investigates institutional investors trading behavior of acquiring firm stocks surrounding merger activities. We label investment companies and independent investment advisors as active institutions and <b>banks,</b> <b>nonbank</b> trusts and insurance companies as passive institutions. We find active institutions increase holdings of acquiring firm stocks for mergers with higher wealth implications. However, active institutions overreact to stock mergers at the announcement, which they appear to correct at the resolution quarter of the merger. The trading behavior of passive institutions suggests that these institutions disregard the market response of merger announcement in trading acquiring firm stocks at the announcement quarter. The passive institutions gradually update their beliefs and trade on the basis of merger wealth effect at the resolution quarter. The third essay examines relation between executive compensation structure with the existing level and changes of takeover defense mechanisms of firms. According to managerial entrenchment hypothesis, higher managerial power from adoption of takeover defense mechanisms would lead to generating higher rents for executives. Efficient contracting hypothesis argue that higher anti-takeover provisions would contribute in achieving efficient contracting by deferring compensation into the future due to the low possibility of hostile takeover. The results support managerial entrenchment hypothesis with regard to existing level of takeover defense mechanisms. With regard to changes in anti-takeover provisions, the existing level of managerial power influence the future pay structure. Ph. D.
