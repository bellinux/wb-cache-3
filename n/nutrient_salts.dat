Mineral based commercial nutrient solutions are resource intensive and energy demanding, while also producing a lot of waste.

40|$|In {{studying}} the river environment, {{it is important}} to understand how the movement of <b>nutrient</b> <b>salts</b> affects that environment. Fine-grained SS in floodwater adsorb <b>nutrient</b> <b>salts.</b> While flowing downstream, some of the SS sink to the riverbed and become river sediment; conversely, sediment is taken up in the flow to become SS. This study has two purposes. The first is to clarify the relationship between SS and nutrient salt transport at times of flooding. The second is to estimate the amount of <b>nutrient</b> <b>salts</b> deposited in the high-water channel after two floods of different scales. The studied river is the Saru River. For one flood, analysis found a relationship between each kind of nutrient salt and each type of SS, and we expressed it as a single regression equation. The correlation between silt concentration and granular <b>nutrient</b> <b>salts</b> concentration was close. The estimations showed that the amount of SS deposited in the high-water channel differs by flood scale.

This work presents an attempt to declare the status of water quality including anions, cations, <b>nutrient</b> <b>salts</b> and trace metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn and Fe), besides concentrations of the selected trace metals, organic matter, carbonate and exchangeable nutrient in the lake's sediments. Results revealed that, the major ion (Cl, SO, Na and Mg) concentrations in the 1 lake (588, 452,- 2 - + 2 + st 4 401 and 88. 82 mg l, respectively) are less than the 2 (2613, 1018, 796. 7 and 393. 4 mg l, respectively) and the 1 nd 1 condition was governed mainly by; the intrusion of drainage water through El-Wadi Drain.

The moist sediments of three different pearl oyster beds, which contained relatively a large amount of orgauic matter, were used for the preparation of sediment-water layer. And in the water layers, ammonia, phosphate, COD, total organic acids and viable count of aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were estimated. The change in pH and Eh of the waters was also determined. The results obtained from the experiments are as follows: 1. The leaching of ammonia, phosphate and organic acids from the sediments was noticed in each of the samples. In the sample in which much of the <b>nutrient</b> <b>salts</b> is released, the leaching of organic acid was also found to be large. 2. The quantity of organic acids in the waters increased gradually but the organic acid appeared to be decomposed and consumed by bacteria after the increase. The accumulation of organic acids in the water was larger in the anaerobic condition than in the aerobic, and the increase of bacterial population was inversely less in the anaerobic condition than in the aerobic. 3. In the sample in which organic acids are released relatively in abundance, the consumption rate of the organic acids was also rapid in comparison with that of others. ﻿有機物が比較的に多い長崎県の 3 真珠養殖場の底質を試料として,海泥中の有機物の分解による栄養塩類ならびに可溶性有機物の浸出,特に後者と有機栄養細菌の消長について,実験室的に比較検討し次のような結果を得た. 1) 泥質からアンモニア,燐酸塩および有機酸の浸出を各試料で認め,栄養塩類が多浸出した試料では有機酸の浸出も多かった. 2) 有機酸は海水中に次第に増加するが,その後微生物によって分解・消費されるようであった. 嫌気条件では好気条件よりも有機酸の蓄積が多く,菌数増加は逆に少なかった. 3) 比較的多量に有機酸を生成した試料では,その分解・消失の速度も他に較べて速かであった...|$|E
