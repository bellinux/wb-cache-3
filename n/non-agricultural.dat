5|$|Despite the storm's {{powerful}} intensity, Hurricane Dean's {{damage was}} moderate. It {{did not have}} severe or lasting effects on infrastructure, and the <b>non-agricultural</b> sectors of economies throughout the Greater Antilles recovered quickly.|$|E
5|$|Abram Nathaniel Spanel founded Playtex's {{predecessor}} parent company, the International Latex Corporation, in Rochester, New York in 1932 {{to produce}} latex products, like bathing caps, swimwear and baby pants. ILC moved to Dover, Delaware, in 1939, {{making it the}} first large, <b>non-agricultural</b> business in the city.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 8678 acres, or 41% of the Briar Creek {{watershed}} is forested land. Much {{of this is}} on Knob Mountain or belongs to the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 55. A total of 7210 acres, or 34% of the watershed, is farmland and 1143 acres, or 6% of the watershed, is urban land. Most of {{this is in the}} southeastern part of the watershed. A total of 3984 acres, or 19% of the land in the watershed, is <b>non-agricultural</b> grassland.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a <b>non-agricultural</b> {{calendar}} is the Tzolk'in calendar of the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, which is a cycle of 260 days. This count {{is based on an}} earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of Maya calendars which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dean's {{significant}} damage, it did {{not have}} severe effects on infrastructure, and the <b>non-agricultural</b> sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly. Most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the Western Caribbean in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's passage, though by August 27 all were back on schedule, except those with damaged ports in Belize and the Yucatán. The Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines, as their ports opened within days.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing <b>non-agricultural</b> exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of <b>non-agricultural</b> subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E
25|$|According to The World Bank, 42% {{of people}} {{employed}} in the <b>non-agricultural</b> sector were women.|$|E
25|$|The largest <b>non-agricultural</b> segment was ship building, {{which was}} from 5 to 20% of total employment. About 45% of American made ships {{were sold to}} foreigners.|$|E
25|$|The H-2B visa {{allows a}} foreign {{national}} {{entry into the}} US for temporary or seasonal <b>non-agricultural</b> work for eligible employers under certain conditions (seasonal job, no available US workers).|$|E
25|$|The calpulli {{was ruled}} by a local chief (calpuleh), to whom its members were {{normally}} related. He provided the calpulli members with lands for cultivation (calpullālli) or with access to <b>non-agricultural</b> occupations in exchange for tribute and loyalty.|$|E
25|$|Women still {{contribute}} to their communities in many regions mainly through agricultural work. In Southern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa, only 20% of women work at paid <b>non-agricultural</b> jobs. Worldwide, women's rate of paid employment outside of agriculture grew to 41% by 2008.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{to climate change}} by (1) anthropogenic {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs), and (2) by the conversion of <b>non-agricultural</b> land (e.g., forests) into agricultural land. Agriculture, forestry and land-use change contributed around 20 to 25% to global annual emissions in 2010.|$|E
25|$|As the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution {{produced}} civilization, {{the modern}} Agricultural Revolution, begun in Britain (British Agricultural Revolution), {{made possible the}} industrial civilization. The first precondition for industry was greater yields by less manpower, resulting in greater percentage of manpower available for <b>non-agricultural</b> sectors.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Moldavians of Bessarabia {{were free}} peasants, of which most being landless, leasing their land from landlords and monasteries, while 12% (in 1861) were răzeşi ("yeomen"). The Emancipation reform of 1861 had little effects in Bessarabia, {{where there were}} few serfs: just 12,000 most of which being brought from Russia for <b>non-agricultural</b> activities.|$|E
25|$|Portland's {{urban growth}} boundary, adopted in 1979, {{separates}} urban areas (where high-density development is encouraged and focused) from traditional farm land (where restrictions on <b>non-agricultural</b> development are very strict). This was atypical {{in an era}} when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along interstate highways, in suburbs, and satellite cities.|$|E
25|$|This new {{definition}} is aimed to exclude payments to applicants who exercise no real or tangible agricultural activity on their land. The Commission is proposing that payments {{would not be}} granted to applicants whose CAP direct payments are less than 5% of total receipts from all <b>non-agricultural</b> activities This doesn't apply to farmers who receive less than 5 000 Euros in direct payments.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{accounted}} for about 53% of GDP in 1947. While per-capita agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by {{the growth of the}} <b>non-agricultural</b> sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen rapid growth in industries (such as apparel, textiles, and cement) and services (such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and finance).|$|E
25|$|Between {{the late}} 1970s and 2005, <b>non-agricultural</b> {{employment}} in the Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in {{employment in the}} late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined. But this trend appears to be changing, {{as the number of}} manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.|$|E
25|$|Millions of Chinese became {{state workers}} as a {{consequence}} of this industrial investment: in 1958, 21 million were added to <b>non-agricultural</b> state payrolls, and total state employment reached a peak of 50.44 million in 1960, more than doubling the 1957 level; the urban population swelled by 31.24 million people. These new workers placed major stress on China's food-rationing system, which led to increased and unsustainable demands on rural food production.|$|E
25|$|In Pakistan SMEs have a {{significant}} contribution in the total GDP of Pakistan, according to SMEDA and Economic survey reports, the share in the annual GDP is 40% likewise SMEs generating significant employment opportunities for skilled workers and entrepreneurs. Small and medium scale firms represent nearly 90% of all the enterprises in Pakistan and employ 80% of the <b>non-agricultural</b> labor force. These figures indicate the potential and further growth in this sector.|$|E
25|$|The Tequestas {{changed their}} {{habitation}} during the year. In particular, {{most of the}} inhabitants of the main village relocated to barrier islands or to the Florida Keys during the worst of the mosquito season, which lasted about three months. While the resources of the Biscayne Bay area and the Florida Keys allowed for a somewhat settled <b>non-agricultural</b> existence, they were not as rich as those of the southwest Florida coast, home of the more numerous Calusa.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the county's {{population}} has mostly been employed as agricultural workers. An 1835 survey showed Suffolk to have 4,526 occupiers of land employing labourers, 1,121 occupiers not employing labourers, 33,040 labourers employed in agriculture, 676 employed in manufacture, 18,167 employed in retail trade or handicraft, 2,228 'capitalists, bankers etc.', 5,336 labourers (<b>non-agricultural),</b> 4,940 other males aged over 20, 2,032 male servants and 11,483 female servants. The same publication records {{the total population}} of the county at 296,304.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversification}} of the Economy includes a multi-disciplinary {{approach to the}} development of <b>non-agricultural</b> sector, including the creation of special sectorial zones in industry, tourism and services outsourcing. In addition, reforms to the higher educational system and business law are also planified in the new program-contract signed in 2009 between the government, the banking sector and some zone-development companies. The approach also include a better sustaining of small-business development and prospection of external markets. The objective is to become an emerging industrial country of the likes of Vietnam by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Laredo has {{increased}} the number of <b>non-agricultural</b> jobs from 55,100 in January 1996 to 86,600 in October 2007. Laredo has had a higher job growth rate (2%-6.5%) than the state as a whole because of expanded international trade through the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 2007, Laredo experienced a job growth rate of 2.5%. As of October 2007, the Laredo unemployment rate was 4.1% or 3,700 unemployed persons, as compared to 3.9% in Texas statewide. This is a significant drop since the mid-1990s, when Laredo's unemployment was over 15%.|$|E
25|$|Real GDP {{growth is}} {{expected}} to average 5.5% in the 2009–13 period, seen the prospects in the tourism and the <b>non-agricultural</b> industry, as demand growth in the Eurozone — Morocco's key export market and source of tourists is projected to be more subdued. Growth will be well below the 8–10% levels that are widely regarded as necessary {{to have a major}} impact on poverty and unemployment. Economic growth will also be intermittently hindered by the impact of periodic droughts on the rain-fed agricultural sector, the country's largest employer.|$|E
25|$|The bill {{may also}} be reduced by having one or more reliefs applied to it, such as reliefs for empty properties, or for charities. Reliefs are {{administered}} by the local authority {{and they do not}} affect the rateable value of a property. While some are mandatory, others are at the discretion of the local authority, who also have to bear, in whole or in part, the costs of some reliefs. In addition to specific reliefs, a hardship relief is available at the discretion of the local authority. A relief on <b>non-agricultural</b> business on agricultural land or former agricultural buildings has been removed with effect from 14 August 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{history of the}} county centres round {{the growth of the}} mining industry, which at its heights employed almost the whole of the <b>non-agricultural</b> population, with large numbers of pit villages being founded throughout the county. Stephen possessed a mine in Durham which he granted to Bishop Pudsey, and in the same century colliers are mentioned at Coundon, Bishopwearmouth and Sedgefield. Cockfield Fell was one of the earliest Landsale collieries in Durham. Richard II granted to the inhabitants of Durham licence to export the produce of the mines, the majority being transported from the Port of Sunderland complex which was constructed in the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{is a major}} food staple and a {{mainstay}} for the rural population and their food security. It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than 1 hectare. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or <b>non-agricultural</b> sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition {{of much of the}} population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population. Developing countries account for 95% of the total production, with China and India alone responsible for nearly half of the world output.|$|E
25|$|Eleanor Nesbitt, a {{professor}} of History and Religions in India, states that the colonial government hardened the caste-driven divisions in British India not only through its caste census, but {{with a series of}} laws in early 20th century. The British colonial officials, for instance, enacted laws such as the Land Alienation Act in 1900 and Punjab Pre-Emption Act in 1913, listing castes that could legally own land and denying equivalent property rights to other census-determined castes. These acts prohibited the inter-generational and intra-generational transfer of land from land-owning castes to any <b>non-agricultural</b> castes, thereby preventing economic mobility of property and creating consequent caste barriers in India.|$|E
25|$|The city is the administrative, commercial, and {{industrial}} center of Namibia. A 1992/93 study estimated that Windhoek provides {{over half of}} Namibia's <b>non-agricultural</b> employment, with its national share of employment in utilities being 96%, in transport and communication 94%, finance and business services 82%. Due to its relative size Windhoek is, even more than many other national capital cities, the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. Nearly every national enterprise is headquartered here. The University of Namibia is, too, as are the country's only theatre, all ministry head offices, and all major media and financial entities. The governmental budget {{of the city of}} Windhoek nearly equals those of all other Namibian local authorities combined. Of the 3,300 US$-millionaires in Namibia, 1,400 live in Windhoek.|$|E
25|$|Modi {{entered the}} real estate {{business}} with a company called Amer Heritage City Construction Pvt Ltd, where his wife, Minal, served as a director. Modi pressured local officials and secured control of two havelis near the Amer Fort, in contravention of Archaeological Survey of India's rules. He intended to renovate and convert these havelis into a heritage resort. Mahant Shiv Prakash Bhattacharya, the 75-year-old titleholder of the Choor Singh ki Haveli, initiated a court case to thwart Modi's attempt to take over his haveli. During Raje's tenure, the Jaipur Development Authority framed ad-hoc rules to allow re-classification of agricultural land and its use for <b>non-agricultural</b> purposes. This change, which benefited several big builders from Delhi, was allegedly presided over by Lalit Modi.|$|E
25|$|From this point, the nullifiers {{accelerated}} {{their organization}} and rhetoric. In July 1831 the States Rights and Free Trade Association {{was formed in}} Charleston and expanded throughout the state. Unlike state political organizations in the past, which were led by the South Carolina planter aristocracy, this group appealed to all segments of the population, including non-slaveholder farmers, small slaveholders, and the Charleston <b>non-agricultural</b> class. Governor Hamilton was instrumental in seeing that the association, which was both a political and a social organization, expanded throughout the state. In the winter of 1831 and spring of 1832, the governor held conventions and rallies throughout the state to mobilize the nullification movement. The conservatives were unable to match the radicals in either organization or leadership.|$|E
25|$|With {{these issues}} pushed aside, the negotiators in Geneva {{were able to}} {{concentrate}} on moving forward with the Doha Round. After intense negotiations in late July 2004, WTO members reached what {{has become known as}} the (sometimes called the July Package), which provides broad guidelines for completing the Doha round negotiations. The agreement contains a 4-page declaration, with four annexes (A–D) covering agriculture, <b>non-agricultural</b> market access, services, and trade facilitation, respectively. In addition, the agreement acknowledges the activities of other negotiating groups (such as those on rules, dispute settlement, and intellectual property) and exhorts them to fulfill their Doha round negotiating objectives. The agreement also abandoned the 1 January 2005 deadline for the negotiations and set December 2005 as the date for the 6th ministerial to be held in Hong Kong.|$|E

25|$|The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{resulted}} in {{major changes in}} the country, some of which were quantified in a 1998 UNESCO report. Some two million people, about half the country's population, were displaced. In 1996 there were some 435,346 ethnic Serb refugees from the Federation in Republika Srpska, while another 197,925 had gone to Serbia. In 1991, 27% of the <b>non-agricultural</b> labor force was unemployed in Bosnia and this number increased due to the war. By 2009, the unemployment rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina was estimated at 29%, according to the CIA's The World Factbook. Republika Srpska's population of Serbs had increased by 547,741 due to the influx of ethnic Serb refugees from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former unrecognised state of the Republic of Serbian Krajina in the new Republic of Croatia.|$|E
