She had hoped her work on Selznick's prestige picture would lead to first-rate roles at Warner Bros., but instead she received third billing below the title as the queen's lady-in-waiting. In early September, she was lent out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for Sam Wood's romantic caper film Raffles with David Niven, about a high-society cricketer and jewel thief. She later complained, [...] "I had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> style of film." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry Harrison {{had been}} {{involved}} in the negotiations between SFWA and Cohen, and when the agreement was reached in 1967 Cohen asked Harrison if he would take over as editor of both magazines. [...] Harrison was available because SF Impulse, which he had been editing, had ceased publication in early 1967. [...] Cohen agreed to phase out the reprints {{by the end of the}} year, and Harrison took the job. [...] Cohen added Harrison's name to the masthead of two issues of Great Science Fiction, although Harrison had had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> magazine, but the reprints in Fantastic and Amazing continued and Harrison decided to quit in February 1968. [...] He recommended Barry Malzberg as his replacement. Cohen had worked with Malzberg at the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and felt Malzberg would be more cooperative than Harrison. [...] Malzberg, however, turned out to be just as unwilling as Harrison to work with Cohen if the reprints continued, and soon regretted taking the job. [...] In October 1968 Cohen refused to pay for a cover that Malzberg had commissioned; Malzberg insisted, threatening to resign if Cohen did not agree. [...] Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. [...] Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. [...] Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White took over in October 1968, but because there was a backlog of stories Malzberg had acquired, the first issue on which he was credited as editor was the June 1969 issue.|$|E

[...] Henry Rollins stated that for him, getting dressed up meant putting on a black shirt and some dark pants; Rollins viewed an interest in fashion as being a distraction. Jimmy Gestapo from Murphy's Law describes his own transition from dressing in a punk style (spiked hair and a bondage belt) to adopting a hardcore style (shaved head and boots) as being based on needing more functional clothing.|$|E
2500|$|After Iron Jacket was killed, Ford’s Lieutenant’s {{expected}} him to immediately attack his outnumbered warriors. [...] They believed they could kill them, kill or capture the fleeing women and children, and continue on upriver. [...] Ford’s Lieutenant’s, and Placido, were surprised when he ordered the force to hold fast. [...] Ford had seen movement in the hills above Little Robe Creek, and believed a large force of Indians was coming. [...] His feeling may have saved his forces from disaster. [...] Iron Jacket had sent messengers to warn and summon help, especially the nearest encampment, led by his son Peta Nocona. [...] The husband of Cynthia Ann Parker, {{arrived on the scene}} with at least 100, and perhaps more, Comanche reinforcements. [...] (Ford claimed in his report to the Governor that Peta Nocono commanded at least 500 warriors, but this is highly unlikely, as he rarely had more than 100 men under his command, and additional warriors would have taken more time arriving from more distant encampments. [...] Realizing that his warriors, with their bows and lances, could not fight at close quarters with the Rangers and their six shooters, and not intending to repeat the mistake of his father, Peta Nocona attempted to lure them into the woods surrounding Little Robe Creek, where the Comanches' legendary skill on horseback and with bows and lances could be brought into play, with the woods negating some of the advantages of the Texan superior firepower. [...] But Ford was having <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> [...] Despite the attempts of the Comanche to lure their traditional enemies, the Tonkawa to single combat, and repeated challenges to the Rangers to do the same, Ford ordered the Tonkawa to cease accepting after a number were killed in single combat by Comanche warriors. [...] Ford later reported of the Comanche challenges to single combat: ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{the punk}} style was popular among people aged 18–22. Characterized by multi-colored mohawks, ripped skinny jeans, worn band tee-shirts, and denim or leather jackets. This style was popular {{among people who}} listened to punk music such as The Sex Pistols, and later, (despite the band's self-proclaimed rock'n'roll image) Guns N' Roses. Usually the denim jackets (which became an {{identity}} of the group) were adorned by safety pins, buttons, patches, and several other pieces of music or cultural memorabilia. Oftentimes, fans of the punk style would take random bits of fabric and attach them to their other clothes with safety pins. This soon became a popular way of attaching clothing, {{and it is now}} known as [...] "pin shirts" [...] with young women. The shirts are, essentially, rectangular pieces of fabric that are pinned on one side with safety pins. In the 1980s, a dressed down look (e.g. buzzed hair, T-shirts, jeans and button up shirts) was also very popular with people involved in punk rock, more specifically the hardcore punk scene. The Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris said [...] "Some of those punk rock kids they interviewed were a little over the top, but the thing historically is – the L.A./Hollywood punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Black flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or submarine shop." [...] Punk dress was not simply a fashion statement. It epitomized a way of thinking and seeing oneself as an individual cultural producer and consumer. In this way, punk style led many people to ask further questions about their culture and their politics.|$|E
