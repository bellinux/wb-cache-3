5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and <b>naturally</b> <b>to</b> any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E

But on the rest, she does what comes most <b>naturally</b> <b>to</b> her—belting to her heart's desire, perhaps to mollify those who don't care much for her detours into raunchier rap territory.|$|E
5|$|Abraham {{carried on}} the {{preservation}} effort begun by Elizabeth Moreton until he and his son transferred ownership to the National Trust in 1938. The Dale family continued to farm the estate until 1945, and acted as caretakers for the National Trust until 1955. The Trust has carried out extensive repair and restoration work, including re-roofing; restoration of elements of the hall's original appearance, and removal of some painted patterning added during earlier restoration work. The familiar black-and-white colour scheme is a fashion introduced by the Victorians; originally the oak beams would have been untreated and left to age <b>naturally</b> <b>to</b> a silver colour, and the rendered infill painted ochre. In 1977 {{it was discovered that}} the stone slabs {{on the roof of the}} south range had become insecure, and work began on a six-phase programme of structural repairs, the final phase of which was completed in 1992. Replacement timbers have been left in their natural state.|$|E

50|$|Likewise, {{some say}} that the human mind is not <b>naturally</b> {{inclined}} <b>to</b> form beliefs based on evidence, viz. cognitive dissonance. While {{this may be the}} case, evidentialists admit, evidentialism is only meant to separate justified beliefs from unjustified beliefs. One can believe that evidentialism is true yet still maintain that the human mind is not <b>naturally</b> inclined <b>to</b> form beliefs based on evidence. He would simply have to conclude that the mind is not <b>naturally</b> inclined <b>to</b> form justified beliefs.|$|R
5|$|An {{interest}} in farming came <b>naturally</b> <b>to</b> William Halliday. Besides teaching, his father, Samuel, farmed successfully in Scotland {{and in the}} United States. Halliday owned a prosperous cotton plantation in Arkansas in addition to several thousand cultivated acres not connected with the model town. The 3500 cultivated acres surrounding the village provided important staples for the town. Forage for the mine mules as well as food for mining families came from company farms. In order to process its own meat, the company operated a slaughterhouse. By using this system the store was able to sell fresh meat at affordable prices.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. His {{interest}} in mass spectroscopy led <b>naturally</b> <b>to</b> {{an interest in}} the relative abundance of isotopes. The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help. There was little interest in their work because research was being carried out elsewhere. In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by Edwin McMillan for use by the U. S. Army. It was packed up and carted off to Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{career as}} a Republican newspaperman led <b>naturally</b> <b>to</b> {{involvement}} in Republican party politics. In 1856, he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention. From the party’s early days, Blaine identified with the conservative wing, supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over the more radical John C. Frémont, the eventual nominee. The following year, Blaine was offered the editorship of the Portland Daily Advertiser, which he accepted, selling {{his interest in the}} Journal soon thereafter. He still maintained his home in Augusta, however, with his growing family. Although Blaine’s first son, Stanwood, died in infancy, he and Harriet had two more sons soon afterward: Walker, in 1855, and Emmons, in 1857. They would have four more children in years to come: Alice, James, Margaret, and Harriet. It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife's new denomination, becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the cervid species in which CWD is known <b>to</b> <b>naturally</b> occur, Black-tailed deer and European red deer have been clinically demonstrated <b>to</b> be <b>naturally</b> susceptible <b>to</b> CWD. Other cervid species, including reindeer and caribou, are also suspected <b>to</b> be <b>naturally</b> vulnerable <b>to</b> this disease. Many other non-cervid mammalian species have been experimentally infected with CWD, either orally or via intracerebral inoculation. These species include monkeys, sheep, cattle, prairie voles, mice, and ferrets.|$|R

In 1960 the company had around 200 franchised restaurants; by 1963 this had grown to over 600, making it the largest fast food operation in the United States. In 1963, Sanders met John Y. Brown, Jr, a young Kentucky encyclopaedia salesman, who {{explained that he was}} keen to join the company. Sanders instead proposed the sale of the company, as business skills did not come <b>naturally</b> <b>to</b> him, and he lacked an obvious or willing heir among his relatives.|$|E

5000|$|Hume's account {{relies on}} three mechanisms. First, the [...] "association of ideas": the mind tends {{to move from}} one idea to another idea that is <b>naturally</b> related <b>to</b> it. Second, the [...] "association of impressions": the mind tends {{to move from one}} passion to another passion that resembles it in feeling (e.g., from joy to love). Third, their [...] "mutual assistance": if we feel a passion towards something, we will tend to feel a {{resembling}} passion towards something else <b>naturally</b> related <b>to</b> it (e.g., from anger at one person to impatience at a related person). Applying all this to pride, Hume argues that the pleasant sensation of pride, directed at ourselves, <b>naturally</b> tends <b>to</b> be called up when something <b>naturally</b> related <b>to</b> ourselves produces a pleasant sensation of its own. Likewise with humility: when something <b>naturally</b> related <b>to</b> ourselves produces an unpleasant sensation of its own, it tends to make us ashamed of ourselves. These indirect passions are thus the product of the [...] "double relation of impressions and ideas".|$|R
