5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing to leave the country or expected to leave in the near future and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> for immediate combat operations.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in his ankle. An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing bone in his ankle. Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E
5|$|Series 6 {{began on}} 26 September 1998 and {{began with the}} leprechaun Mr Onion being {{temporarily}} written out of the show after supposedly being swept down the plughole in the bath. This was done intentionally as puppeteer John Eccleston was in Australia filming for Farscape for the year and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available.</b> To compensate for Eccleston's absence, a new leprechaun puppet was added called 'Shamrock' (voiced by Rebecca Nagan of Rosie and Jim fame) who made her debut {{at the end of}} the first show as their long lost sister. She then became a regular fixture from the following week and performed alongside Mr Sage for the rest of the series as a replacement to Mr Onion.|$|E

5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs. Following the President’s decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective and less time consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E
5|$|There {{are limits}} on the power a device may draw, {{stated in terms of}} a unit load, which is 100mA or 150mA for SuperSpeed devices. There are {{low-power}} and high-power devices. Low-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load, and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured. High-power devices draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices. A high-powered device must be configured, and may only draw as much power as specified in its configuration. I.e., the maximum power may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{costs are}} {{surprisingly}} high—one agent who represents an unnamed NBA player set to earn $10 {{million in the}} 2010–11 season said the player had received a $400,000 quote to insure his contract for his national team's FIBA qualifier. The Spanish Basketball Federation said that insuring all the NBA players on its national team for EuroBasket 2011, which doubles as the European Olympic qualifiers, could {{cost as much as}} $5.67 million. Basketball Australia announced that Andrew Bogut would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> for the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship; his agent indicated that the final deal-breaker was when insurers stated that they would not insure his remaining $39 million in NBA salary unless pre-existing elbow, wrist, and back injuries were excluded from the policy.|$|E

5|$|Although a 17-page {{petition}} with 298 signatures {{in favor}} of a public referendum was presented at the meeting, the board felt that OSI funds would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> by the proposed November referendum. Opponents of the board's decision protested it by placing signs near the mountain deriding the purchase as an unwise expenditure. The town was not legally obligated to hold a referendum, regardless of public sentiment, because the money budgeted for the purchase was not borrowed; board members planned to tap a $340,000 surplus fund, generated by the 2010 sale of town land to the OSI, which intended to allow bouldering on the property. The $340,000 fund was originally intended for capital improvements, specifically {{the construction of a new}} town hall, but a June 2011 audit of the town's 2010 budget found that a large part of the surplus had already been used to offset budget and tax shortfalls; only $79,000 remained available.|$|E
5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} {{added a new}} SR117, which extended this part of SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU airborne radar to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter to every four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft to every two German fighters. Even had the fighter controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little that could be done. Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nhill {{was always}} {{meant to be}} a {{temporary}} location for No.1 OTU, whose home was to be East Sale, also in Victoria. As accommodation at East Sale would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> until October 1942, the school's 1,630 personnel were relocated to Bairnsdale in June and July. The base's living quarters, recreational buildings and 88 tents could not fully accommodate this influx, so the RAAF rented hotels in Bairnsdale for 320 airmen. On 10December 1942, No.1 OTU Detached Flight, consisting of 15 Hudsons and 108 personnel including air and maintenance crews, was sent to North-Eastern Area Command to help fulfill urgent transport requirements in New Guinea. This force joined a military Douglas DC-2 and eleven civil aircraft pressed into service to form RAAF Special Transport Flight, which operated out of Wards Airfield from 14December 1942 to 11January 1943. The Hudsons flew 645 sorties, carrying some 1,100 troops and almost 800 tons of equipment. Two of the Hudsons were lost, one to enemy action and one to friendly fire, and several were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E
5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available.</b> To counter this, workers are able to extract {{a significant amount of}} water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E

5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; {{but there would be}} no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that {{he would be able to}} correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> in the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, Sega {{began to}} develop an add-on for the Genesis, the Sega 32X, which {{would serve as a}} less-expensive entry into the 32-bit era. The {{decision}} to create the add-on was made by Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employees. According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> until after 1994 and that the recently released Atari Jaguar would reduce Sega's hardware sales. As a result, Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch {{by the end of the}} year. The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn. This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. According to Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the 32X served a role in assisting development teams to familiarize themselves with the dual SH-2 architecture also used in the Saturn. Because both machines shared many of the same parts and were preparing to launch around the same time, tensions emerged between Sega of America and Sega of Japan when the Saturn was given priority.|$|E
