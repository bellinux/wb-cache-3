A linear time-invariant model is fitted to the data and eig enfrequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes and, whenever possible, modal scaling factors, are extracted from the model. The current operational modal testing practice, where the model is estimated from output-only da ta, suffers from three important problems: the modal scaling factors can not be determined, the frequency content of the excitation can not be c ontrolled, and most often {{the accuracy of the}} modal parameters that are estimated in a single test can not be assessed. The goal of this work is to provide solutions for these problems.

The work c an be divided into three main sections. i) - Synthesis of Glaucine 6 -Bromo- 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylacetic acid, prepared by the action of bromine i n acetic acid on 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylacetic a cid, was converted into its acid chloride by t he action of thionyl chloride. This on treatment with 3, 4 - dimethoxyphenylethylamine pr ovided N-(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylethyl) - 2 -(2 -bromo- 4,S-dimethoxyphenyl) -acetamide which on dehydration with phosphoryl chloride (Bischler Napieralski reaction) in dry benzene afforded l -(2 -bromo- 4,S-dimethoxybenzyl) - 3, 4 -dihydro- 6, 7 -dimethoxyisoquinoline, isolated as hydrochl oride. A new method o f destroying the excess of phosphoryl chloride was developed which proved to be quite useful. Methylation of the dihydroisoquinoline'with methyl iodide in methanol, and subsequent reduction with sodium borohydride provided (±) - 6 -bromolaudanosine. Act ion of potassamide or sodamide in anhydrous liquid ammonia on (±) - 6 -bromolaudanosine yielded the corresponding amino derivative along with other products. Diazotization and ring closure of (±) - 6 -aminolaudanosine then a f forded (±) -glaucine which was isolated as methiodide. ii) - Intramolecular Capture of Aryne During Glaucine Synthesis, and Subsequent Reactions. This section deals with the by-products formed under the conditions of the aryne stage of t he glaucine synthesis. The crude product, obtained in the reaction of potassamide or sodamide in liquid ammonia on (±) - 6 -bromolaudanosine, was s eparated by chromatography, Three products were separated and identified. a) - 5, 6 -Dimethoxy- 2 -(3, 4 -dimethoxy- 6 -ethylphenyl) -lmethylindole.

Its formation represented a new method of Hofmann degradation. Further confirmation of structure was done by performing the normal Hofmann reaction on 5, 6, 12, 12 a-tetrahydro - 2 / 3, 9,lO-tetramethoxy ~ 7 -methyldibe nz[b,g]indolizinium iodide.

Para isso acreditamos, necessário diagnosticar os conteúdos culturais (atividades) mais vivenciados nos momentos de lazer, com que freqüência (tempo) e em que locais (espaços) acontecem,bem como perceber as formas de participação e organização das atividades (atitudes) de Jazer. Por buscarmos esses dados no ambiente natural onde se encontram essas PPDF, e por termos como {{principal}} instrumento de pesquisa o próprio pesquisador, caracterizamos essa pesquisa como qualitativa. A abordagem etnográfica norteou o presente estudo à medida que este serviu para descrever um sistema de significados culturais de um determinado grupo, o grupo "Fraternidade Cristã de doença e deficiência"(FCD) de Campinas SP. Após freqüentarmos as reuniões mensais do grupo, no período compreendido entre Julho de 1995 a Dezembro de 1997, bem como participarmos de vários eventos juntamente com o grupo (passeios, manifestações, festas de confraternização), entrevistamos oito (8) membros que participam regularmente do grupo, a fim de detectar as dificuldades que eles encontram para ter acesso ao lazer. Através das respostas às nossas indagações, foi possível chegar a algumas conclusões, que podemos assim resumir: existem importantes barreiras para o Jazer da PPDF que podem ser consideradas como "arquitetônicas ou físicas". Nesse caso, incluímos o problema de deslocamento (transporte). Ao lado dessas, também apresentam-se as barreiras "atitudinais" (que se referem às atitudes da sociedade em geral para com as PPDF). Ainda outras barreiras apontadas referem-se à auto-aceitação da PPDF que enfrenta dificuldades em lidar com sua própria deficiência. Constatamos que muitas dessas barreiras podem ser amenizadas se a PPDF não perceber-se de forma individual, mas, sim, inserida em um grupo que também compartilha de problemas semelhantes. É {{nesse sentido}} que resgatamos o grande papel que desempenha o grupo FCD no lazer da PPDF. De forma indireta, o grupo fortalece a espiritualidade e a auto- estima da pessoa, fazendo com que essa sinta-se "capaz" de lutar, de reagir à deficiência, de forma direta. Através dos eventos que organiza e participa, o grupo facilita a socialização de seus membros com a família e outros grupos, mobiliza para diferentes atividades sócioculturais, estimula a participação de todos, manifesta-se publicamente em várias situações e, enfim, tenta retirar a PPDF do isolamento que a deficiência provoca. Ao realizar um estudo acerca das barreiras que interferem no lazer das PPDF pretendemos que este possa contribuir para o embasamento de futuras políticas municipais que venham a promover o lazer das PPDF. Acreditamos que esses dados possam servir como um diagnóstico inicial, de fundamental importância para que o planejamento das atividades de lazer nessa área seja realmente eficaz e efetivo. Com isso, pensamos ter dado um "primeiro passo" ou, como disse um dos entrevistados, o primeiro impulso" no sentido de que, através do lazer, as PPDF possam superar algumas de suas limitações, seja de ordem física, pessoal ou socialAbstract: A study {{about the group}} "Fraternidade cristã de doença e deficiência (FCDCampinas, SP.) ". In this work we proposed to study the social cultural barrier that interfere in the leisure of people physically deficient (PPDF). For that {{we believe it is}} necessary diagnose cultural contents (activities) more practiced in the leisure moments, what frequency (time) and which places (spaces) they happen as well as to perceive the ways of participation and organization of leisure activities. By searching for these data in the natural environment where those people live and have as main research instrument the own researcher, we characterize this research as the quality research. A ethnography approach led the present study while it was useful to describe a system of cultural meanings of a determinate group, the group "Fraternidade cristã de doença e deficiência (FCD-Campinas, SP.) ". After attending the meetings of the group between July/ 95 and /december/ 97 and h. ad participated of several events with the group (walks, manifestations, parties) we interviewed eight members who participate regularly of the group in order to find out the difficulties that they usually find to have access in leisure. Through the answers founcLit was possible to come to some conclusions: there are important obstacles for leisure of people physically deficient that can be considered as "physical". In this case we included the problem of transportation. There are also attitude obstacles (that refers to the attitudes of society with the people physically deficient. The others obstacles refers to the self acceptance of the PPDF that faces difficulties with his own deficiency. We carne to the conclusion that many of those obstacles can be decreased ifthe PPDF doesn't consider he is alone but inserted in a,group that also shares similar problems. 1 <b>n</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> we emphasize the contribution that performs the FCD group in the leisure of the PPDF. By an indirect way the group gives a reinforcement the spirituality of the person, so that he feels able to fight and react to deficiency by a direct way. Through the events that they organize and participate the group facilitates the socialization of jts members with their families and other groups, mobilizes different social-cultural activities, stimulates the participation of everyone, manifests itself public in several situatio~s and the group tries to take the PPDF off the isolation that the deficiency causes. By achieving a study about the obstacles that interfere in leisure of the PPDF we intend that it can contribute to found new municipal policies that will promote the leisure of the PPDF. We believe that those data can be usefuI as an initial diagnosis of fundamental importance so that the planning of leisure activities. in this area will be real and effective.

In the Ising case our construction corresponds to having a spin field as a defect operator; in the folded formulation this is mapped onto an orbifolding of the boundary sine-Gordon theory at β 2 / 8 π = 1 / 8, or a version of the anisotropic Kondo model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe analyze {{properties}} of a map f sending a unitary matrix U of size N into a doubly stochastic matrix B=f(U) defined by Bi,j=∣Ui,j∣ 2. For any U we define its defect, {{determined by the}} dimension of the image Df(TUU) of the space TUU tangent to the manifold of unitary matrices U at U under the tangent map Df corresponding to f. The defect of U equal to zero for a generic unitary matrix, gives an upper bound for the dimension of a smooth orbit (a manifold) stemming from U of inequivalent unitary matrices mapped into the same doubly stochastic matrix B=f(U). We demonstrate several {{properties of}} the defect and prove an explicit formula for the defect of the Fourier matrix FN of size <b>N.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>way</b> we obtain an upper bound for the dimension of a smooth orbit of inequivalent unitary complex Hadamard matrices stemming from FN. It is equal to zero iff N is prime and coincides with the dimension of the known orbits if N is a power of a prime. Two constructions of these orbits are presented {{at the end of}} this work...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an on-line {{algorithm}} for adding words (strings) in deterministic directed acyclic word graphs (DAWGs) i. e. acyclic deterministic 5 nite-state automata (DFAs). The proposed algorithm performs optimal insertion, meaning that if {{applied to a}} minimal DAWG, the DAWG after the insertion will also be minimal. The time required to add a new word is O(n) {{with respect to the}} size of the DAWG. Repetitive application of the proposed insertion algorithm can be used to construct minimal deterministic DAWGs incrementally, although the algorithm is not time-e 8 cient for building minimal DAWGs from a set of words: to build a DAWG of <b>n</b> words <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> O(n 2) time is required. However, the algorithm is quite useful in cases where existing minimal DAWGs have to be updated rapidly (e. g. speller dictionaries), since each word insertion traverses only a limited portion of the graph and no additional minimization operation is required. This makes the process very e 8 cient to be used on-line. This paper provides a proof of correctness for the algorithm, a calculation of its time-complexity and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for calculating super-horizon curvature perturbation from the dynamics of preheating, which gives a reasonable match to the lattice results. Hubble patches with different initial background field values evolve differently. From the bifurcation of their evolution trajectories we find curvature perturbation using Lyapunov theorem and δ <b>N</b> formulation. In <b>this</b> <b>way</b> we have established {{a connection between the}} finer dynamics of preheating and the curvature perturbation produced in this era. From the calculated analytical form of the curvature perturbation we have derived the effective super-horizon curvature perturbation smoothed out on large scales of CMB. The order of the amount of local form non-gaussianity generated in this process has been calculated and problems regarding the precise determination of it have been pointed out.

30|$|The {{size of the}} {{transformed}} {{training and}} testing data vectors is n, which is very less than original size m. This size reduction {{is due to the}} number of hidden layer neurons that are less than the number of input layer neurons or <b>n</b> ≪ m. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> the proposed technique improves the classification performance by enhancing the feature representation and reducing the size of the training and testing data vectors. In typical case, an input training and testing spectrum vector of size 6000 is reduced to hidden layer size of 50 after transformation. The small size of training vector requires small set of weight in a classifier and the cost function is easy to optimize for these small set of weights. This improves the classification performance with reducing training time.|$|R
