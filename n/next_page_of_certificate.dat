In this it is related that certain peasants entered Rome by the Viridarian Gate, driving two mares laden with timber; that, in crossing the Square of St. Peter's, some servants of the Pope's ran out and cut the cords so that the timber was loosened and the beasts relieved of their burden; they were then led to a courtyard within the precincts of the palace, where four stallions were loosed upon them. [...] "Ascenderunt equas et coierunt cum eis et eas graviter pistarunt et leserunt," [...] whilst the Pope at a window above {{the doorway of the}} Palace, with Madonna Lucrezia, witnessed with great laughter and delight, the show which it is suggested was specially provided for their amusement.|$|R

40|$|Utilizing {{data from}} a log file, a {{two-stage}} model for step-ahead web page prediction that permits adaptive page customization in real-time is proposed. The first stage predicts the <b>next</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> a viewer based on a variant of a Markov transition matrix computed from <b>page</b> sequences <b>of</b> other visitors who read the same pages as that viewer did thus far. The second stage re-analyzes the incorrect exit/continuation predictions of the first stage through data mining, incorporating the visitor's viewing behavior observed from the log file. The two-stage process takes advantage of a robust, theory-driven nature of statistical modeling for extracting the overall feature of the data, and a flexible, data-driven nature of data mining to capture any idiosyncrasies and complications unresolved in the first stage. The empirical result with a test site implies that the first stage alone is sufficiently accurate (50. 3 %) in predicting <b>page</b> transitions. Prediction <b>of</b> site exit was even better with 100 % of the exit and 90. 8 % of the continuation predictions being correct. The result was compared against other models for predictive accuracy. ...|$|R
