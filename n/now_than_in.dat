5|$|The {{zebra shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|Due to handbells' {{relative}} rarity {{outside of}} the confines of church services—although less so <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s and early 1990s—the majority of pieces last approximately four minutes. A few composers and arrangers write longer and more intricate works; generally these pieces use handbells {{in combination with other}} instruments.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many more jazz musicians in Germany <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s and 1970s, it is much easier for the public to form their own {{individual}} opinion of the jazz musicians and their music because of electronic media. Traditional opinion makers like public broadcasters' jazz editors are losing influence.|$|E

25|$|Changes – Diminishing {{guilt by}} association: In the past {{it was common}} for the {{authorities}} to send entire families to political prison camps for political crimes committed by close relatives (including forebears, to the third generation) {{on the basis of}} the principle of guilt by association. Such cases still occur but appear to be less frequent <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> past decades.|$|E
25|$|While {{adolescence}} {{is a time}} frequently marked by participation in the workforce, the number of adolescents in the workforce is much lower <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> years past {{as a result of}} increased accessibility and perceived importance of formal higher education. For example, half of all 16-year-olds in China were employed in 1980, whereas less than one fourth of this same cohort were employed in 1990.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s onwards, Western {{countries}} {{have experienced a}} drop in Mass attendance (in the United States, from 75% of Catholics attending in 1958 to 25% attending by 2002). These same countries saw a decline in seminary enrollments and {{in the number of}} priests (in the United States, from 1,575 ordinations in 1954 to 450 in 2002), and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the Catholic faith. Opponents of the revision of the Mass liturgy argue, citing opinion poll evidence in their support, that the revision contributed to this decline. Others, pointing, among other considerations, to the fact that, globally, there are more priests and seminarians <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> previous years (in 1970, there were 72,991 major seminarians worldwide, in 2002, there were 113,199, an increase of 55%, at a time, however, when there was an increase of global population of 64%), suggest that the apparent decline of Catholic practice in the West is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on Western societies rather than to developments within the Catholic Church.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1960, Rivers {{suffered}} from a stroke which left him paralysed down his right side. [...] Amber was distraught and during {{the last years of}} his life she worried a lot and became depressed. She wrote to her daughter Anna-Jane, who was in Singapore at the time, [...] "If there is a Confucian temple in K.L., you might make a little offering (if he does like offerings).....I have more faith in him <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> our own deity who seems to be letting us down all round". When Rivers died on 28 March 1966, Amber was determined to keep living as normally as possible. She was visited by New Zealand historian Keith Sinclair who was writing a biography of her father, and twice by interviewers from the BBC. Although she enjoyed discussing politics and world affairs, she felt disillusioned about the socialist hopes of her youth, and supported the Conservatives in the 1970 election. She believed that the wrong people were leading the left and that only diehards would vote for them.|$|E
2500|$|Singing without drums is {{extremely}} rare and considered inappropriate (Nettl, 1989). The drum accompaniment to songs is rhythmically independent to the singing but in perfect unison, [...] "slightly off the beat", and [...] "often related roughly by {{the proportion of}} 2:3", to the vocal pulse or beat level (though see Pantaleoni, 1987). Another change in Blackfoot music is increased relatedness of the drum part to the song <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the past. Often drumming over repeated sections that comprise a song begins with players softly striking {{the rim of the}} bass drum. The tempo increases as the drumming moves further {{to the center of the}} drum skin. At some point [...] "hard beats", loud strokes off the rhythm by an individual, sometimes the leader, and beats may be omitted. Drumming may pause for a phrase or two in the last stanza of the last repetition and finish loudly. When playing the stick game, players drum upon a plank, and the drumming is more likely to coincide with vocal beats, but less accurate unison playing. Rattles are no longer used.
