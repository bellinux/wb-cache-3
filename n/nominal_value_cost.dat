40|$|A {{particular}} {{scheduling problem}} over a single machine is considered. Jobs belong to different classes, and two jobs {{belonging to the}} same class are considered as completely equivalent. A sequence of due dates is specified for each class of jobs, and the serviced jobs, for each class, are assigned to the due dates according to the EDD rule. The service time of any job of a given class has to be selected within an interval of possible values (the highest possible one being the nominal service time). A deviation of the actual service time from the <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> determines a <b>cost</b> that has a linear dependence on such a deviation. The cost function to be minimized {{is the sum of}} the total (weighted) tardiness cost and the overall service time deviation cost. The decision variables are those concerning job sequencing (taking into account the equivalence of jobs of the same class) and service times. In this paper, a solution to this problem is provided in terms of closed-loop strategies...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a single}} machine allowed to process jobs {{belonging}} to different classes is considered, {{and the problem}} of determining the class of the next job to be processed is dealt with. The single machine is characterized by the following features: (i) two jobs belonging to the same class are considered as completely equivalent; (ii) a sequence of due-dates is specified for each class of jobs, and the serviced jobs, for each class, are assigned to the due-dates according to the EDD rule (generalized due-dates framework); the service time of any job of a given class has to be selected within an interval of possible values (controllable processing times); (iv) a setup time is required by the machine when switching between different classes. A deviation of the actual service time from the <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> determines a <b>cost</b> which has a linear dependence on such a deviation. The optimal (closed-loop) strategies are determined through a four-steps procedure. Such strategies provide the optimal values of the control variables (next job's class and processing time) as functions of the system state...|$|R
30|$|Here, we use {{a robust}} {{approach}} to deal with uncertain costs with non-stationary moments in a lot-sizing problem. Deviations of uncertain costs are postulated in a closed and convex space, namely U. The covariance matrix and the mean value vector of the costs calculated on the historical data are used to formulate the uncertainty region. The uncertainty region U is a unit ball centered by a <b>nominal</b> (mean) <b>value</b> of the uncertain parameter. Radius of the uncertainty region changes by exerting coefficient r, according to the expected risk for the decision maker. The meaning of the unit ball differs in various structures defined by norms, and the appropriate norm is chosen (Hanafizadeh and Seifi 2004). Such uncertainty region {{can be considered for}} all uncertain parameters such as costs, demands, lead time and so forth. However, in this study, the uncertainty has been considered only for future costs to keep the formula simple. After determining the uncertainty region, considering the worst-case behavior for uncertain costs in the U uncertainty region, the robust counterpart of a lot-sizing problem is developed. Robust formula of the objective function and the constraint of the lot-sizing problem are used inside the classical Wagner–Whitin algorithm to find an optimal solution for its robust counterpart. Therefore, in this article, an extension of Wagner–Whitin algorithm is considered as the so-called robust algorithm. After that, an analysis is done on the robust relations to find out what happens if some parameters of the relations vary. The next step is to solve an example from the literature and use the robust approach versus the classical Wagner–Whitin algorithm in finding the optimal solution. It is noteworthy that the robust algorithm offers an optimal solution for the robust counterpart of the lot-sizing model, while the classical Wagner–Whitin algorithm offers an optimal solution for the lot-sizing problem with <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of <b>costs.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{tolerance}} synthesis, which involves {{the allocation of}} the specified assembly tolerances among the component dimensions of an assembly to ensure a specified yield. Even though the issue of tolerance synthesis has been discussed widely, most research often assumes that component alternatives have equal <b>nominal</b> <b>values.</b> Therefore, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are negligible. However, there may be situations where the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are different. In such cases, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> should be considered.

50|$|In 1924, coins {{were put}} into {{circulation}} in {{the territory of the}} Soviet Union. These were in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3 and 5 kopecks in copper; 10, 15, 20 kopecks in base-alloy silver; and 50 kopecks and 1 ruble in silver. Copper coins of the smallest <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of half kopeck were minted in 1925 - 1928.In 1923, the first Soviet gold coin (1 chervonets in <b>nominal</b> <b>value)</b> was minted. This conformed in all its features to the gold coin worth of 10 rubles of Russian Empire. It almost never appeared in circulation and was only used in foreign trade transactions.Starting from 1926, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3 and 5 were made of bronze; starting from 1931, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 10, 15 and 20 kopecks were made of cuprum-nickel alloy.There has been a great variety of the first Soviet banknotes. In circulation were the Soviet chervonets (10 rubles) and the rubles designed to portray the symbols of the Soviet ideology. The types of banknotes of this period were often replacing each other.A monetary reform was passed in 1947 with a key objective to promote to a quick recovery of the war-suffered economy, withdrawal of counterfeit money from circulation and replacement of the old samples with new ones.The monetary reform of 1961 was aimed to change the price scale (10:1), improve the money cycle and issue banknotes of new design. New series of coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 kopecks and 1 ruble {{were put into}} circulation. The series of banknotes consisted of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles in nominal value.In 1991, to regulate the money cycle, banknotes in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 rubles were withdrawn from circulation and substituted by new ones - banknotes of the 1991 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 rubles (two different types). Later on, banknotes of the 1991 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 3, 5, 10, 200, 500 and 1000 rubles were put into circulation. Since February 1992, prices were liberalized, which led to the rise in prices and devaluation of the ruble. Banknotes of the 1992 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50, 200, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000 rubles were put into circulation.|$|R

Banknotes of the former Soviet Union, in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1-500 rubles of the 1961-1992 issue were allowed to co-circulate with the Dram up until March 17, 1994.Coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 10, 20, 50 luma and 1, 3, 5, 10 drams of aluminum alloy were put into circulation since February 21, 1994.Banknotes in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1000 and 5000 drams were put into circulation since October 24, 1994 and September 6, 1995, respectively.Starting 1998, banknotes of the second series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 20000 drams were put into circulation. The banknotes of this series meet modern requirements in terms of security, endurance, quality and design.On June 4, 2001, the commemorative banknote in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50000 drams dedicated to 1700th anniversary of adoption of Christianity in Armenia was put into circulation.In the period 2004 - 2005, the banknotes in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 drams of the 1993-1995 series and the 1998 series were withdrawn from circulation. These have been {{ceased to be a}} legal tender in the Republic of Armenia yet are allowed to be exchanged at their par in commercial banks and the Central Bank of Armenia, without limitation. In the period 2003 - 2004, the coins of the second series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 drams were put into circulation.Since August 24, 2009, the banknote in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 100000 drams was put into circulation. The banknote depicts the king Abgar the Fifth of Edessa. According to accounts of Armenian historians, Abgar was the first king of Armenian origin to have adopted Christianity.
