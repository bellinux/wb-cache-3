In this paper, we value a perpetual American call option, which gives the monopoly right to invest in a market in which the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> <b>customers</b> (and hence the sales rate) follows a birth and death process. The problem contains a singular point, and we develop a mixed analytic/numeric method for handling this singular point, based on the method of Frobenius. The method may be useful for other cases of singular points. The birth and death model gives lower option values than the geometric Brownian motion model, except at very low volatilities, so that if a firm incorrectly assumes a geometric Brownian motion process in place of a birth and death process, it will invest too seldom and too late. real options, birth and death processes and Frobenius method,...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the IEEE 802. 22 standard is aimed at providing broadband access in rural areas by effectively utilizing the unused TV band, provided no harmful interference is caused to the incumbent operation. This thesis presents the analytical framework to evaluate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> <b>customer</b> premise equipments (CPEs) in a wireless regional area network. Initial ranging is the primary process in IEEE 802. 22 networks for CPEs to access the network and establish their connections with the base station (BS). A comprehensive analysis of initial ranging mechanism is provided in this work and initial ranging request success probability is derived based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> contended CPEs and the initial contention window size. Further, the average ranging success delay is derived for the maximum backoff stages. The collision probability is highly dependent {{on the size of}} the initial contention window and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> contended CPEs. To keep it at a specific level, it is necessary for the BS to schedule the required size of the initial contention window to facilitate the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> CPEs to establish their connections with reasonable delay. Therefore, the optimized initial window size is proposed that meets the collision probability constraint for a particular <b>number</b> <b>of</b> contended CPEs. An analytical model is also developed to estimate the ranging request collision probability depending upon the size of initial contention window and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> contended CPEs. Moreover, this approximation provides the threshold size for contention window to start the initial ranging process in the IEEE 802. 22 network. Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan, Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> muscles {{during a}} complex action is useful information {{to identify the}} action, and to determine pathologies. Biosignals such as surface electromyogram {{are a result of}} the summation of electrical activity <b>of</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sources. The complexity of the anatomy and actions results in difficulty in identifying the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> sources from the multiple channel recordings. ICA has been applied to sEMG to separate the signals originating from different sources. But {{it is often difficult to}} determine the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> sources that may vary between different actions and gestures. This paper reports research conducted to evaluate the use of ICA for the separation of bioelectric signals when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> sources may not be known.

40|$|The online {{collection}} of coarse-grained traffic information, {{such as the}} total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> flows, is gaining in importance due {{to a wide range}} of applications, such as congestion control and network security. In this paper, we focus on an active queue management scheme called SRED since it estimates the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> flows and uses the quantity to indicate the level of congestion. However, SRED has several limitations, such as instability in estimating the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> flows and underestimation <b>of</b> <b>active</b> flows in the presence of non-responsive traffic. We present a Markov model to examine the capability of SRED in estimating the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> flows. We show how the SRED cache hit rate can be used to quantify the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> flows. We then propose a modified SRED scheme, called hash-based two-level caching (HaTCh), which uses hashing and a two-level caching mechanism to accurately estimate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> flows under various workloads. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme provides a more accurate estimation <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>active</b> flows than SRED, stabilizes the estimation with respect to workload fluctuations, and prevents performance degradation by efficiently isolating non-responsive flows...|$|R

Characteristics can then be efficiently computed by choosing values for the differences at the start and end of the inbound phase, propagating these towards the middle, and looking for matches in the input and output of the S-Box. For AES like ciphers this can typically be done row- or column-wise, making the procedure relatively efficient. Choosing different starting and ending values leads to many different differential characteristics in the inbound phase.|$|R
