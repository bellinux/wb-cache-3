In my profession, one has to be so careful. Of course, people think it's worse than it is; father gets fits sometimes. But you know, Mrs. Fiorsen, home's awful. We have mutton--you know what mutton is--it's really awful in your bedroom in hot weather. And there's nowhere to practise. What I should like would be a studio. It would be lovely, somewhere down by the river, or up here near you. That WOULD be lovely. You know, I'm putting by. As soon as ever I have two hundred pounds, I shall skip. What I think would be {{perfectly}} lovely would be to inspire painters and musicians. I don't want to be just a common 'turn'--ballet business year after year, and that; I want to be something rather special. But mother's so silly about me; she thinks I oughtn't to take any risks at all. I shall never get on that way. It IS so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Mrs. Fiorsen, because you're young enough to know what I feel; and I'm sure you'd never be shocked at anything. You see, about men: Ought one to marry, or ought one to take a lover? They say you can't be a perfect artist till you've felt passion. But, then, if you marry, that means mutton over again, and perhaps babies, and perhaps the wrong man after all. Ugh! But then, on the other hand, I don't want to be raffish. I hate raffish people--I simply hate them. What do you think? It's awfully difficult, isn't it?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes {{she lived}} at Simla, the summer {{capital city of}} the British Raj, when in India. It was there that she entertained E. M. Forster in 1912. He noted a {{characteristic}} ambivalence in her manner, saying that she was [...] "clever and odd - times very (crossed out) <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> alone, but at times the Social Manner descended like a pall".|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth Compton {{was about}} to protest, but there was {{something}} about the way in which the stranger went at the job that indicated that he would probably finish it if he wished to, in spite of any arguments she could advance to the contrary. As he worked she talked with him, discovering not only that he was a rather <b>nice</b> person <b>to</b> look at, but that he was equally <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R

6000|$|That season {{came up to}} Simla one {{of these}} crazy people with only a single idea. These are the men who make things move; {{but they are not}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> This man's name was Mellish, and he had lived for fifteen years on land of his own, in Lower Bengal, {{studying}} cholera. He held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool-flake. The germ could be rendered sterile, he said, by 'Mellish's Own Invincible Fumigatory'--a heavy violet-black powder--' the result of fifteen years' scientific investigation, Sir!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{there any}} limit, I wonder, to the brutish stupidity of some men? I thought I had {{discovered}} Armadale's limit when I was his neighbor in Norfolk; but my later experience at Naples shows me that I was wrong. He is perpetually {{in and out}} of this house (crossing over to us in a boat from the hotel at Santa Lucia, where he sleeps); and he has exactly two subjects of conversation--the yacht for sale in the harbor here, and Miss Milroy. Yes! he selects ME as the confidante of his devoted attachment to the major's daughter! 'It's so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a woman about it!' That is all the apology he has thought it necessary to make for appealing to my sympathies--my sympathies!--on the subject of 'his darling Neelie,' fifty times a day. He is evidently persuaded (if he thinks about it at all) that I have forgotten, as completely as he has forgotten, all that once passed between us when I was first at Thorpe Ambrose. Such an utter want of the commonest delicacy and the commonest tact, in a creature who is, to all appearance, possessed of a skin, and not a hide, and who does, unless my ears deceive me, talk, and not bray, is really quite incredible when one comes to think of it. But it is, for all that, quite true. He asked me--he actually asked me, last night--how many hundreds a year the wife of a rich man could spend on her dress. 'Don't put it too low,' the idiot added, with his intolerable grin. 'Neelie shall be one of the best-dressed women in England when I have married her.' And this to me, after having had him at my feet, and then losing him again through Miss Milroy! This to me, with an alpaca gown on, and a husband whose income must be helped by a newspaper! ...|$|R
40|$|Writing {{a thesis}} {{is done by}} a single person: the one who graduates. However, doing {{research}} and gaining knowledge {{can not be done}} without the help of other people. Writing a protocol, aimed to be an international standard, is, despite that it probably will be published as an “experimental ” instead of a “standard ” protocol, is not an effort I would attempt on my own. It is sometimes hard to discriminate between the work I did on my own and the work done by others. I have written the chapter about PAP, CHAP and EAP (called “Supporting various client Authentication Protocols”), but I lost count on the number of times others authors rewrote it. Likewise, I hope some of my input improved the other chapters. Co-authors My gratitude goes to all co-authors. In particular I would like to thank John Vollbrecht for his endless questions and patient answers. He did make me feel comfortable, in particular when I presented some slides at the IETF conference for a room full of people. My thanks also go to Walter Weiss, who pushed the drafts and got everybody writing. He astounded me twice by compiling the draft at the last minutes before the deadline, even though that seemed impossible to me. I still wonder how he managed it – even if he didn’t sleep! A special thanks goes to Ravi Sahita who kindly took the time in Salt Lake City to sit down and explain some details about the accessor issues which must have been obvious, but I completely misunderstood. Gratitude to Kwok Ho Chan, who showed in Minneapolis that he is a good technician and lobbyist, and is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> A last thanks goes to Dave Durham, who showed, when I feared disaster when I had <b>to</b> give a <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the RAP group, there was nothing to fear about. In the mean time he elevated my knowledge about what I was doing. I am in debt to Cees de Laat, who supervised me, and kept an eye on what I was doing, even though he moved from Utrecht University to University of Amsterdam during work. In particular I am very grateful for the way he allowed me to work on my own pace, but still took the decision to get me on track when I got stuck in the original 802. 1 x work. Also, he was very generous by sponsoring my attendance at two IETF-conferences, held in the USA and reserving money from his research budget to cover my expenses there...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, I {{look at it}} in this light. Music {{is merely}} background, and ought to be kept in its place. I am no enemy of music, George. The air in a room should be melodious, {{for the same reason that}} it should be faintly {{pleasing}} to the olfactory sense, and neither hot nor stuffy. Just as the walls should be delightfully coloured and softly lit, and the refreshments pleasant and at the moment of need. But surely we meet for human intercourse. When I go to see people I go to see the people--not to hear a hired boy play the piano. But these people plant a chevaux de frise of singers and performers upon instruments of music between themselves and me. They gag me with a few pennyworths of second-hand opera. There I was bursting <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> and <b>nice,</b> intelligent-looking girls <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> and whenever I began to say something they said 'Sssh!' Tantalus in a drawing-room it was--the very Hades of hospitality.|$|R
5000|$|Kai Nanami (Nanami Kai)The school nurse. Nanami is {{possibly}} the most feminine character in Sukisho (second most feminine would probably be Ran). The perfect housewife, Nanami cooks and cleans {{with a smile on}} his face. He lives with Shin-ichirou, whom he is in love with (they are seen sharing the same bed in the anime and the dramas show them to be married). He is very <b>nice</b> and easy <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> although he is constantly haunted with guilt because of his past where he worked with Aizawa conducting immoral experiments on humans in an effort to help Shin-ichiro with his own mental condition.There is hardly any difference between the games and the anime when concerning Nanami, but in the games he tends to be slightly more high strung (he can and WILL punch Shin-ichirou when he feels the need for it). Nanami has brown shoulder length hair (may be slightly longer) and blue eyes. (Voiced by: Akira Ishida) ...|$|R
40|$|I {{personally}} {{found it}} easiest to rent an iPad {{from the library}} to collect my data. The crowd was remotely open to answering students questions. The aspect of introducing myself and meeting new people wasn’t the difficult part. The questions we had to ask were what deterred people away and the aspect of a stranger coming up to them. To get all the information needed {{to answer the questions}} we were given took about 10 minutes. When you catch someone walking down the street, they really don’t want <b>to</b> spend 10 minutes <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a stranger. After the time constraint people were also hesitant to let us measure their hands. During the prelim trials on Wednesday I would say I spent a solid 5 hours in the downtown area. It was very dismaying asking people questions and them walking past you. Most of the time I spent downtown was being ignored by bystanders. In larger crowds, later in the week, it was easier <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> people because they had less room to run away. I would change the way of going about collecting data. People loved our shirts and overall love free things. If we would have offered free t shirts or coozies people might have been more inclined to give us detailed answers and more insight. Overall the people that did give me the time of day, were incredibly <b>nice</b> and friendly <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> [URL]...|$|R
