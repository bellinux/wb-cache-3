40|$|LIGA <b>fabricated</b> <b>materials</b> and {{components}} exhibit several processing issues affecting their metallurgical and mechanical properties, potentially limiting their usefulness for MEMS applications. For example, LIGA processing by metal electrodeposition is {{very sensitive to}} deposition conditions which causes significant processing lot variations of mechanical and metallurgical properties. Furthermore, the process produces a material with a highly textured lenticular rnicrostructural morphology suggesting an anisotropic material response. Understanding and controlling out-of-plane anisotropy is desirable for LIGA components designed for out-of-plane flexures. Previous work by the current authors focused on results from a miniature servo-hydraulic mechanical test frame constructed for characterizing LIGA materials. Those results demonstrated microstructural and mechanical properties dependencies with plating bath current density in LIGA fabricated nickel (LIGA Ni). This presentation builds on that work and fosters a methodology for controlling the properties of LIGA <b>fabricated</b> <b>materials</b> through processing. New results include measurement of mechanical properties of LIGA fabricated copper (LIGA Cu), out-of-plane and localized mechanical property measurements using compression testing and nanoindentation of LIGA Ni and LIGA Cu...|$|R

Thanks to our data-driven process, {{we are able}} to measure, simulate, and obtain material combinations of non-linear base materials that match a desired deformation behavior. We can then print those objects with multimaterial 3 D printers using two materials (blue and black) with varying internal microstructure. This paper introduces a data-driven process for designing and <b>fabricating</b> <b>materials</b> with desired deformation behavior. Our process starts with measuring deformation properties of base materials. For each base material we acquire a set of example deformations, and we represent the material as a non-linear stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We have validated our material measurement process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of <b>fabricated</b> <b>material</b> stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization process that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user’s criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space. We demonstrate the complete process by designing and fabricating objects with complex heterogeneous materials using modern multi-material 3 D printers. Keywords: design...|$|R
40|$|The {{class of}} <b>fabricated</b> <b>materials</b> known as metamaterials, with its {{promises}} for unconventional material properties or characteristics, {{has opened up}} a whole new paradigm of possibilities and challenges. The primary enablers have been capabilities at the very low length scale and novel design configurations. Pentamode metamaterials, having fluid like properties, is one such idea to have been realized in recent past. This type of <b>fabricated</b> <b>materials</b> show high bulk modulus but low shear modulus. The fundamental constituent element is a rod like structure tapered down on both ends. Four of such elements meet at any joint, two of which in a plane orthogonal to that of the other two. The dynamics and wave propagation characteristics of such structures have been studied with an aim to obtain band structures formed because of their periodic nature. Here, a methodology has been developed to compute the wave propagation characteristics of such pentamode structures using spectrally formulated finite elements based on frequency domain Ritz method. Bloch theory has also been used to represent the dynamics of an infinite structure through that of a unit cell. The proposed method is computationally more efficient compared to one using conventional finite element. A few variants of pentamodes are also analyzed to arrive at configurations with superior wave propagation characteristics...|$|R
