5|$|The {{radiation}} doses {{received in}} these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy. A {{large part of the}} dose was due to neutron radiation, which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available equipment, film badges, were not worn by personnel during the accident, and badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful data about gamma radiation.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured.</b> These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income {{is not sufficient to}} evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E

Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E

25|$|In 925 Pope John X summoned a Church Council in Split. It was to {{be decided}} which of the bishops in the former Roman {{province}} of Dalmatia will gain ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The jurisdiction was contested between Gregory, the Croatian bishop of Nin, and John, the archbishop of Split. Prior to the council Bishop Gregory was responsible for a significantly larger territory than Archbishop John, but his reputation and financial situation could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> with the Archbishopric of Split. Split also claimed its continuity with the ancient Archbishopric of Salona, so due to its tradition the council confirmed Split as the archiepiscopal see. The territory from the river Raša in Istria to Kotor, including Nin, were subjected to Split. Furthermore, {{the use of the}} Slavic language and Glagolitic script in the ecclesiastical service has also been discussed. The Pope sought to condemn it, but the council did allow the use of Slavic for local priests and monks, but they were prevented from advancing to higher positions.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} years of the French Revolution, the leaders of the French National Constituent Assembly decided to {{introduce}} a completely new system of measurement based on the principles of logic and natural phenomena. [...] Specifically, the metre was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, and the kilogram as the mass of one thousandth of a cubic metre of pure water. [...] Although these definitions were chosen so that nobody would [...] "own" [...] the units, they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> with sufficient convenience or precision for practical use.

500|$|For the 1981 season, a BT49C {{specification}} {{was produced}} with a chassis lightened through {{increased use of}} carbon composite materials. Five of this variant were built {{and two of the}} previous year's cars converted to this specification. That year a minimum ride height of [...] was introduced and sliding skirts were banned, with the intention of limiting ground effect and slowing the cars. The BT49C regained its front wings to compensate in part for the downforce lost. More significantly, Murray devised a hydropneumatic suspension system for the BT49C in which soft air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary. At speed, where the ride height could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured,</b> downforce compressed the air and the car settled to a much lower height, creating more downforce. Because the skirts now had to be fixed, the suspension had to be very stiff to allow them to consistently seal around the sides of the car: {{by the end of the}} 1981 season, total suspension movement was only , half of which came from the compression of the tyres. A lightweight qualifying chassis was produced, featuring a small fuel tank and lighter reinforced carbon-carbon brake discs and pads.|$|E

2500|$|Natural light, {{and most}} other common sources of visible light, are incoherent: {{radiation}} is produced independently by {{a large number of}} atoms or molecules whose emissions are uncorrelated and generally of random polarizations. In this case the light is said to be unpolarized.

2500|$|For {{writers on}} {{kinematics}} before Galileo, since small time intervals could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured,</b> the affinity between time and motion was obscure.

Only Domingo de Soto, a Spanish theologian, in his commentary on Aristotle's Physics published in 1545, after defining [...] "uniform difform" [...] motion (which is uniformly accelerated motion) – the word velocity wasn't used – as proportional to time, declared correctly that this kind of motion was identifiable with freely falling bodies and projectiles, without his proving these propositions or suggesting a formula relating time, velocity and distance. De Soto's comments are shockingly correct regarding the definitions of acceleration (acceleration was a rate of change of motion (velocity) in time) and the observation that during the violent motion of ascent acceleration would be negative.|$|E
