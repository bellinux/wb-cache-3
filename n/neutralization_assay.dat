The <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> {{proved to be the}} most sensitive method, and results obtained by this method were reproduced most easily. The frequency of nonspecific results may be up to 1 % of the sera tested. Among patients with acute type B hepatitis, e antibody was found regularly soon after the clearance of hepatitis B e antigen by using the <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay,</b> whereas this antibody was found on the average several weeks later and in a lower percentage of patients by using the other methods.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In {{this review}} we present current {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of HIV- 1 <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays</b> that employ primary cell types, as compared with those that utilize cell lines and the newer, more standardized pseudovirus assays. A commentary on the challenges of standardizing in-vitro <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays</b> using primary cells is included. RECENT FINDINGS: The data from reporter cell line <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays</b> may agree with results observed in primary cells; however, exceptions have recently been reported. Multiple variables exist in primary cell assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-seronegative donors; in-vitro neutralization titers can vary significantly based on the donor cells used for assay targets and for virus propagation. Thus, more research is required to achieve validated primary cell <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays.</b> SUMMARY: HIV-vaccine-induced antibody performance in the current <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays</b> may function as a 'gatekeeper' for HIV- 1 subunit vaccine advancement. Development of standardized platforms for reproducible measurement of in-vitro neutralization is therefore a high priority. Given the considerable variation in results obtained from some widely applied HIV neutralization platforms, parallel evaluation of new antibodies using different host cells for assay targets, as well as virus propagation, is recommended until immune correlates of protection are identifie...|$|R

The current study characterized the mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) 18 A 10, specific for VZV envelope glycoprotein K (gK), and applied this antibody to a new type of <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> in the VZV field. The procedure is called the neutralization enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (N-ELISPOT) assay and evolved from the VZV immunoperoxidase focus assay. Optimization of the assay involved defining the optimum combination of virus plaque-forming units (PFU) and antibody dilution, which were found to be 0 - 100 PFU and 1 : 200, respectively. Furthermore the N-ELISPOT assay produced results consistent with that obtained for the plaque-reduction <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay.</b> Considering that the plaque-reduction <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> is time-consuming and labor-intensive, the VZV N-ELISPOT assay offers several advantages including reproducibility and applicability for high-throughput analysis of humoral immune responses to VZV.

40|$|Passive {{transfer}} of antibody {{may be useful}} for preexposure prophylaxis against biological agents used as weapons of terror, such as Bacillus anthracis. Studies were performed to evaluate the ability of anthrax antiprotective antigen (anti-PA) and antilethal factor (anti-LF) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to protect against an anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) challenge in a mouse model and to identify correlates of immunity to LeTx challenge. Despite having similar affinities for their respective antigens, anti-PA (3 F 11) and anti-LF (9 A 11), passive {{transfer of}} up to 1. 5 mg of anti-PA 3 F 11 mAb did not provide significant protection when transferred to mice 24 h before LeTx challenge, while passive transfer of as low as 0. 375 mg of anti-LF 9 A 11 did provide significant protection. Serum collected 24 h after passive transfer had LeTx-neutralizing activity when tested using a standard LeTx <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay,</b> but neutralization titers measured using this assay did not correlate with protection against LeTx challenge. However, measurement of LeTx-neutralizing serum responses with an LeTx <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> in vitro employing the addition of LeTx to J 774 A. 1 cells 15 min before {{the addition of the}} serum did result in neutralization titers that correlated with protection against LeTx challenge. Our results demonstrate that only the LeTx neutralization titers measured utilizing the addition of LeTx to J 774 A. 1 cells 15 min before the addition of sample correlated with protection in vivo. Thus, this LeTx <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> may be a more biologically relevant <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> to predict the in vivo protective capacity of LeTx-neutralizing antibodies...|$|E

To start to analyze the antigenic basis underlying serotype specificity, we produced a library of 13 VP 4 -specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NMAbs) to two HRVs, the serotype P 1 A strain Wa and the serotype P 2 strain ST 3, and characterized the reactivity of these NMAbs with a panel of serotypically diverse HRV strains by <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We characterized the serotypic specificity of the NMAbs by using a fourfold or an eightfold-or-greater difference in titer against the homologous (i. e., immunogen) and heterologous strains as a criterion for serotype. Some ST 3 -derived NMAbs reacted specifically with serotype P 2 HRVs by ELISA and/or <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay,</b> while some Wa-derived NMAbs reacted specifically by ELISA and/or <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> with some or all serotype P 1 A HRVs. Other Wa- and ST 3 -derived NMAbs reacted with some or all serotype P 1 A and P 2 HRV strains by <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> and ELISA. Most NMAbs did not react with serotype P 1 B or P 3 strains. In previous studies, three distinct operationally defined epitopes have been identified on VP 4 by examining the reactivity patterns of selected antigenic variants of HRV strain KU.

40|$|Recently {{chimeric}} influenza haemagglutinins (cHAs) {{have been}} generated as potential ‘universal’ vaccination antigens and as tools to identify HA stalk-directed antibodies via their use as antigens in ELISA, and virus or pseudotype-based <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays.</b> The original methods [1, 2] used for their generation require the amplification of regions of interest (head and stalk) using primers containing SapI sites and subsequent cloning into pDZ plasmid.

As an alternative strategy we have developed and optimized a new protocol for assembling the cHA by exploiting Gibson Assembly. • This method also requires precise primer design, but it is rapid and methodologically simple to perform. We have evaluated that using this method it is possible to construct a cHA encoding DNA in less than a week. • Additional weeks are however necessary to optimize the production of pseudotyped lentiviral particles and to perform <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays</b> using them as surrogate antigens. • In comparison to the original protocols, we have also observed that performing parallel <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays</b> using pseudotypes harbouring the two parental HAs, permits effective delineation between stalk and head antibody responses in the samples tested...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of vaccines against human papillomaviruses (HPVs) {{has long been}} hampered by the inability to grow HPVs in tissue culture {{and the lack of}} an efficient <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay.</b> To date, less than 10 % of more than 100 different HPV types can be grown in athymic and “SCID” mouse xenograft systems or raft culture systems. Recently, the in vitro generation of HPV pseudovirions and their use in neutralization assays were demonstrated. The major shortcomings of the current approaches to HPV neutralization are the lack of HPV virions for most types for the xenograft methods and the time-consuming and inefficient generation of infective pseudovirions for the latter methods, which precludes their use in large-scale HPV clinical trials or epidemiological studies. We describe here a novel and efficient approach to generating pseudovirions in which HPV virus-like particles (VLPs) are coupled to the β-lactamase gene as a reporter. We show that {{it is not necessary to}} encapsidate the reporter gene constructs into the pseudovirions. Using sera from human volunteers immunized with HPV- 11 VLPs expressed in yeast, we demonstrate that our novel <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> compares favorably with the athymic mouse <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay.</b> Furthermore, our assay was used to define neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to HPV- 6, which were previously unknown...|$|E

When the ASO titers derived by the two methods were compared, the correlation coefficient was 0. 93. When {{the ability of the}} LA test to demonstrate a significant ASO titer rise (greater than or equal to 2 dilutions) was compared with that of the standard <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay,</b> the LA test had a sensitivity of 91 %, a specificity of 86 %, a positive predictive value of 83 %, and a negative predictive value of 92 %. Triplicate LA test determinations were performed on a subset of 31 serum specimens, and for 29 (94 %), the repeated ASO titers were all within 1 dilution of each other; the width of the 95 % confidence interval for the triplicate measurements of each serum specimen was +/- 32. 8 IU.

40|$|Antibodies against reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) have been detected in seropositive subjects by immunoprecipitation, Western immunoblotting, and <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay.</b> Recently, we noticed that the antibodies against RT stabilized RT upon heat inactivation, and we have developed a stabilization assay of RT antibody. Briefly, the RT of HIV- 1 is completely inactivated by incubation at 56 degrees C for 20 min, but this inactivation is inhibited {{in the presence of}} a specific antibody directed against this molecule. We examined the specificity and clinical significance of this stabilization assay. HIV- 1 antibody-positive sera stabilized HIV- 1 RT but not HIV- 2 RT, whereas half of these sera cross-neutralized HIV- 2 RT. Antibody titers against RT determined by the <b>neutralization</b> <b>assay</b> and the stabilization assay were compared with clinical characteristics.

40|$|Background: The monomer of {{influenza}} haemagglutinin (HA) is synthesized {{as a single}} polypeptide precursor that during maturation is cleaved by proteases into two active subunits. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} the human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS 2) and the human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) can activate, by cleavage, the HA of human seasonal influenza viruses. As a model of activation of all influenza subtypes (human H 1, H 2, H 3 viruses and other representative viruses from group 1 and group 2 avian subtypes), we have investigated the use of human TMPRSS 2 and HAT to produce high titre influenza HA lentiviral pseudotypes. Such pseudotypes represent powerful and safe tools to study viral entry mechanisms and zoonotic potential. Materials and Methods: Influenza pseudotype particles are obtained by cotransfecting human embryonic kidney HEK 293 T/ 17 cells using plasmids coding for the influenza HA, HIV gag-pol and a retroviral vector incorporating firefly luciferase. To investigate the role of these proteases in the HA activation necessary for infective particle generation, a plasmid expressing TMPRSS 2 or HAT was cotransfected during pseudotype production. The HA lentiviral pseudotypes produced were used to investigate cell entry potential via transduction of target cell lines and as surrogate antigens in <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays.</b> Results: Influenza pseudotype particles produced by cotransfection of these proteases can transduce HEK 293 T/ 17 cells with high efficiency compared with the pseudotypes produced in the absence of proteases. The high titre of these influenza pseudotypes permits their use as surrogate antigens in <b>neutralization</b> <b>assays</b> and subtype-specific sera can readily neutralize them. Conclusions: TMPRSS 2 and/or HAT can activate, in vitro, both the HA of human seasonal influenza and also other avian HA influenza strains in a pseudotype particle production system.
