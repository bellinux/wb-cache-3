5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E
5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} crops are wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and rice, which together {{account for more}} than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 25,750,000 metric tons of wheat, more than all of Africa and <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> all of South America, according to the USDA. Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} this is that {{conventional}} single-hop VPN protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying HTTP packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However some protocols like OpenSSH and OpenVPN required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.|$|E
25|$|Victorian {{politics}} was volatile at this time, with {{a succession of}} weak short-term governments. The electoral system was malapportioned in favour of rural areas, which gave the minority Country Party disproportionate power. As a rural Liberal, Bolte despised the Country Party <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the Labor Party. In April 1935 Albert Dunstan (Deputy Premier {{and leader of the}} Country Party) unexpectedly withdrew support for the Premier, Stanley Argyle, breaking the coalition agreement and forming a minority Country Party government, which Labor supported in return for some policy concessions.|$|E

25|$|While gliding occurs {{independently}} from powered flight, it {{has some}} ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very energy-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as fruits, nectar, and insects. In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a dozen times among extant vertebrates), however these groups have not radiated <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> have groups of flying animals.|$|E

While Clarissa still enjoys everyday life, it seems Richard's illness has sapped his energy for life and the cleanliness of his apartment is subsequently suffering. As Clarissa fusses about, {{paying attention to the}} details of Richard's life that he has neglected, Richard seems resigned. He {{does not seem to be}} looking forward to the party Clarissa is organising for him <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Clarissa is.

25|$|Many American {{presidents have}} ancestral links to Ulster, {{including}} three {{whose parents were}} born in Ulster. The Irish Protestant vote in the U.S. has not been studied <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> that of the Catholic Irish. In the 1820s and 1830s, supporters of Andrew Jackson emphasized his Irish background, as did James Knox Polk, but since the 1840s it has been uncommon for a Protestant politician in America {{to be identified as}} Irish, but rather as 'Scotch-Irish'. In Canada, by contrast, Irish Protestants remained a cohesive political force well into the 20th century, identified with the then Conservative Party of Canada and especially with the Orange Institution, although this is less evident in today's politics.|$|E

25|$|Women tend to {{earn less}} than men in almost all industries, {{including}} government and academia. Women {{are less likely to}} be hired in highest-paid positions. The data showing the differences in salaries, ranks, and overall success between the genders is often claimed to be a result of women's lack of professional experience. The rate of women's professional achievement is increasing. In 1996, the salaries for women in professional fields increased from 85% to 95% relative to men with similar skills and jobs. Young women between the age of 27 and 33 earned 98%, <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> their male peers. In the total workforce of the United States, women earn 74% as much as their male counterparts (in the 1970s they made 59% as much as their male counterparts).|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the {{proximal}} part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the adjoining oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. Male part of the genitalia with a single retractor muscle, without flagellum or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can be judged {{on the basis of the}} transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. Proximal half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple luminal surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the retractor muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the proximal half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple luminal surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. Vas deferens, a short part of the penis and <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the proximal half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E

500|$|Kīlauea's bulk affects {{local climate}} {{conditions}} through {{the influence of}} trade winds coming predominately from the northeast, which, when squeezed upwards by the volcano's height, results in a moister windward side and a comparatively arid leeward flank. The volcano's ecology is further complicated by height, though not <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> with its other, far taller neighbors, and by the local distribution of volcanic products, which make for varied soil conditions. The northern part of Kīlauea is mostly below [...] and receives more than [...] mean annual rainfall, and can mostly be classified as a lowland wet community; further south, the volcano has squeezed out much of the precipitation and receives less than [...] mean annual rainfall, and is considered mostly a lowland dry environment.|$|E

Parker and Stone both said Buffer was friendly and they enjoyed working with him. Voice actor Mike Judge, star of Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, had originally been slated to provide the voice of the Damien character, and even recorded several lines for the part.
