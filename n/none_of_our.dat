500|$|Studios Hergé serialised Tintin in Tibet weekly from September 1958 to November 1959, {{two pages}} per week, in Tintin magazine. Because {{of his desire}} for accuracy, Hergé added the logo of Air India to the {{airliner}} crash debris. A representative of Air India complained to Hergé about the adverse publicity the airline might suffer, arguing, [...] "It's scandalous, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> aircraft has ever crashed; you have done us a considerable wrong." [...] Air India had cooperated with Hergé, aiding his research by providing him reading material, contemporary photographs, and film footage of India and Nepal, particularly Delhi and Kathmandu. While the crashed aircraft's tail number remained [...] "VT", the country code for Indian aircraft, Hergé agreed to change the airline logo in the published edition to the fictional Sari-Airways, dryly noting that {{there were so many}} Indian airlines it was possible that there really was a Sari-Airways.|$|E
500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, [...] "all along {{we have been told}} by Fox that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{complaints}} were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. But now we have a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults." [...] The League also complimented the members' participation, writing, [...] "It only goes to prove what can be done when Catholics get actively involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rhinoceros Party (French: Parti Rhinocéros) was a {{registered}} political party in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s. Operating within {{the tradition of}} political satire, the Rhinoceros Party's basic credo, their so-called primal promise, was [...] "a promise to keep <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> promises". [...] They then promised outlandishly impossible schemes designed to amuse and entertain the voting public.|$|E

2500|$|Carbon Tracker's {{analysis}} {{has been cited}} by investment banks HSBC, Citi and JP Morgan, consultancies such as Accenture, and the Dutch Central Bank. It has also provoked a range of responses from major oil companies: ExxonMobil has stated it is 'confident that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become “stranded.”' [...] Chevron, while admitting that ' certain high-cost assets around the world could be impacted by a hypothetical GHG-constrained case', has similarly argued {{that the risk of}} stranded assets is 'manageable'. Different positions have also been expressed by BP [...] and Statoil.|$|E

Of course I don't believe he signed anything, these were verbal orders. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> talks was taped and I never took a paper and pencil when I talked with him.

[...] "I think Jian is wonderful. Likely TMI for an old fogey like me, but his private life is <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> beeswax.", May wrote. May then wrote [...] "I have known Jian and something at work here doesn't make sense. Innocent until proven guilty." [...] When one user accused her of [...] "buying into" [...] rape culture, she replied, [...] "As a feminist, I do not buy into rape culture." [...] May later stated that she regretted defending Ghomeshi, stating that she had not yet read about the allegations of physical violence in the Toronto Star and that she was still [...] "shaken up" [...] by the Parliament Hill shootings when she wrote the tweets.|$|E

2500|$|Although it bore an {{unlikely}} title (picked {{up from a}} radio talk show), the jaunty single [...] "Life Is a Minestrone" [...] (1975) was another UK Top 10 placing, peaking at No.7. Their biggest success came with the dreamy [...] "I'm Not in Love", which gave the band their second UK No.1 in June 1975. The song also provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No.2. A collaborative effort built around a title by Stewart, [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] is notable for its innovative production, especially its richly overdubbed choral backing. Godley stated:If I was to pick one track from everything we've done, [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] would be my favourite. It's got something that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> other tracks have at all. It's not clever in a conscious way but it says it all so simply in, what, six minutes. – NME, February 1976 ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 December 2007, updates by Jagex removed free player-versus-player {{combat and}} {{unbalanced}} trading {{in order to}} rid the game of activities involving real currency being traded for virtual goods. The updates also affected legitimate players, resulting in many of them actively complaining on the forums. Jagex issued a Customer Support News article admitting the updates {{may not have been}} an ideal replacement for what was removed, requesting patience and promising to remedy potential problems with updates in the future. During the changes, subscription numbers fell by 60,000. No figures were given as to how many of those subscriptions belonged to legitimate players and how many to gold farmers. In an interview in February 2008, Jagex's head of content stated that, [...] "we were really afraid we were going to lose our members over this change, because other games had in the past. But we are very, very pleased to say that we have lost practically <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> members." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of his {{direction}} of the film, Bakshi stated, [...] "My approach to animation as a director is live action. I don't approach it in the traditional animation ways. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> characters get up and sing, because that's {{not the type of}} picture I'm trying to do. I want people to believe my characters are real, and it's hard to believe they're real if they start walking down the street singing." [...] Bakshi wanted the film to be the antithesis of any animated film produced by the Walt Disney Company. Accordingly, Fritz the Cat includes two satirical references to Disney. In one scene, silhouettes of Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck, and Donald Duck are shown cheering on the United States Air Force as it drops napalm on a black neighborhood during a riot. Another scene features a reference to the [...] "Pink Elephants on Parade" [...] sequence from Dumbo. A sequence of the camera panning across a garbage heap in an abandoned lot in Harlem sets up a visual device which recurs in Hey Good Lookin'.|$|E
