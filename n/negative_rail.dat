25|$|One oddity is that, {{almost from}} its opening until 1917, the Bakerloo {{operated}} with the polarity of the conductor rails reversed, the outside rail negative and the centre rail positive.

On the Bakerloo, the outside conductor rail tended to leak to the tunnel wall, whereas on the District Railway, the centre rail shared a similar problem. The solution was to reverse the polarity on the Bakerloo line, so that the <b>negative</b> <b>rail</b> leaked on both systems.

500|$|The {{design of}} the {{permanent}} way was a departure from that of London's previous tube railways, which used track laid on timber baulks across the tunnel with {{the bottom of the}} tube left open. This approach caused what the BS's management regarded as an unacceptable level of vibrations. They resolved this by mounting the sleepers on supports made of sand and cement grout, with the sleeper ends resting on comparatively soft broken stone ballast underneath the running rails. A drain ran parallel with the rails underneath the middle of the track.

50|$|Early MOS logic had one {{transistor}} type, {{which is}} enhancement mode {{so that it}} can act as a logic switch. Since suitable resistors were hard to make, the logic gates used saturated loads; that is, to make the one type of transistor act as a load resistor, the transistor had to be turned always on by tying its gate to the power supply (the more <b>negative</b> <b>rail</b> for PMOS logic, or the more positive rail for NMOS logic). Since the current in a device connected that way goes as the square of the voltage across the load, it provides poor pullup speed relative to its power consumption when pulled down. A resistor (with the current simply proportional to the voltage) would be better, and a current source (with the current fixed, independent of voltage) better yet. A depletion-mode device with gate tied to the opposite supply rail is a much better load than an enhancement-mode device, acting somewhere between a resistor and a current source.|$|E
50|$|On 14 January 1931 a workman who {{was engaged}} in {{dismantling}} a wooden staging fixed across the track of the Metropolitan Railway Station at Kings Cross, slipped and fell from a height of about 20 feet to the permanent way of the down Inner Circle line. He was unconscious and lay face downwards across one running rail with his head close to the <b>negative</b> <b>rail</b> of the electrified system. Mr. Thomas, who was acting as flagman {{for the protection of}} the workmen, saw the man fall and at the same time heard a down train approaching the station round the curve. Realising that a signal could not be seen by the driver in time for him to stop the train, Mr, Thomas immediately jumped down from the platform to the up line and, crossing two positive and two negative rails carrying 600 volts, snatched the unconscious man from almost under the wheels of the approaching train and held him in a small recess in the wall whilst the train passed within a few inches of them.|$|E
50|$|Also, PMOS {{circuits}} {{are slow}} to transition from high to low. When transitioning from low to high, the transistors provide low resistance, and the capacitive charge at the output accumulates very quickly (similar to charging a capacitor through a very low resistance). But the resistance between the output and the <b>negative</b> supply <b>rail</b> is much greater, so the high-to-low transition takes longer (similar to discharge of a capacitor through a high resistance). Using a resistor of lower value will {{speed up the process}} but also increases static power dissipation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{switching}} device {{is one where}} the non-linearity is utilised to produce two opposite states.

Here the non-linearity {{is designed to be}} extreme, and the analyst can actually take advantage of that fact.

5000|$|In {{the domain}} of MOSFET circuits, [...] "bootstrapping" [...] is {{commonly}} used to mean pulling up the operating point of a transistor above the power supply rail. The same term has been used somewhat more generally for dynamically altering the operating point of an operational amplifier (by shifting both its positive and <b>negative</b> supply <b>rail)</b> {{in order to increase}} its output voltage swing (relative to the ground). In the sense used in this paragraph, bootstrapping an operational amplifier means [...] "using a signal to drive the reference point of the op-amp's power supplies". A more sophisticated use of this rail bootstrapping technique is to alter the non-linear C/V characteristic of the inputs of a JFET op-amp in order to decrease its distortion.|$|R
5000|$|The ECL {{circuits}} usually {{operate with}} negative power supplies (positive {{end of the}} supply is connected to ground) in contrast to other logic families in which negative end of the supply is grounded. This is done mainly to minimize {{the influence of the}} power supply variations on the logic levels as ECL is more sensitive to noise on the VCC and relatively immune to noise on VEE. Because ground should be the most stable voltage in a system, ECL is specified with a positive ground. In this connection, when the supply voltage varies, the voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (in the case of emitter constant current source, they do not change at all). As the collector resistors are firmly [...] "tied up" [...] to ground, the output voltages [...] "move" [...] slightly (or not at all). If the negative end of the power supply was grounded, the collector resistors would be attached to the positive rail. As the constant voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (or not at all), the output voltages follow the supply voltage variations and the two circuit parts act as constant current level shifters. In this case, the voltage divider R1-R2 compensates the voltage variations to some extent. The positive power supply has another disadvantage - the output voltages will vary slightly (±0.4 V) against the background of high constant voltage (+3.9 V). Another reason for using a negative power supply is protection of the output transistors from an accidental short circuit developing between output and ground (but the outputs are not protected from a short circuit with the <b>negative</b> <b>rail).</b>|$|E

40|$|Some {{practical}} basic {{points are}} now considered regarding the allowable {{input and output}} voltage ranges of a real op amp. This obviously varies with not only the specific device, but also the supply voltage. While we can always optimize this performance point with device selection, more fundamental considerations come first. Any real op amp will have a finite voltage range of operation, at both input and output. In modern system designs, supply voltages are dropping rapidly, and 3 V to 5 V total supply voltages are now common for analog circuits such as op amps. This {{is a far cry}} from supply systems of the past, which were typically ± 15 V (30 V total). Because of these smaller voltages, it is very important to understand the limitations of both the input and the output voltage ranges—especially during the op amp selection process.

50|$|One unusual {{feature of}} the ICTS cars {{is that they are}} driven by linear {{induction}} motors: instead of using conventional motors to turn the wheels, they push themselves along the route using alternating flat magnets reacting with the distinctive di-magnetic aluminum metal plate that runs down the centre of the tracks. This system requires very few moving parts, and therefore leads to lower maintenance costs. When the car motors are accelerating, they actually lift the car off the track an extremely small distance, repelling against the aluminum plate. This micro-lifting prevents the truck wheels from making a solid electrical contact with the track. Instead of using the conventional method, in which motive power is supplied by a single third rail, with return current travelling through the running rails, a separate positive and <b>negative</b> power <b>rail</b> are provided {{on one side of the}} track. With respect to the accelerating trucks and the micro-lifting, the truck wheels have a somewhat larger flange than normal in order to keep the car inline on the track during the micro-lifting. The linear induction motors also allow the cars to climb steeper grades then would be possible with traditional subway technology since wheel slip is not an issue. This is an important consideration when trying to build a rail transit system into a built-up urban environment, such as Toronto.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{results have}} {{highlighted}} {{the presence of}} a natural third body ranging in thickness from a few micrometres to several dozen micrometres on the rail and wheel. The third body layer, initially composed of particles stemming from the wheels and rails, flows into the contact to accommodate local sliding inside it.

This influence can be considered as significant if it enters the contact, affects surface properties, modifies the third body layer, and possibly damages or protects the rail.
