50|$|In 1998 Red-Horse {{started a}} FINRA {{licensed}} securities Jersey City, New Jersey-based firm, Native <b>Nations</b> <b>Securities,</b> {{believed to be}} the first Native American owned investment banks. The firm provided financial services geared specifically to tribal finance, tribal economic development, and youth training programs. In 1999, in a desire to expand, Native <b>Nations</b> <b>Securities</b> identified for possibleacquisition, a 96 year old New Jersey bond firm, Freeman Securities. In 2001 after nearly two years of due diligence, Ms. Red-Horse learned that a long-time employee of Freeman Securities had engaged in a series of fraudulent stock loan transactions prior to the acquisition, which were hidden on Freeman’s books and had been undisclosed to Red-Horse and the NASD auditors. Ms. Red-Horse and the other original directors of Native <b>Nations</b> <b>Securities</b> immediately reported these transactions to the U.S. Attorneys’ Office, the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASD (now FINRA). With NASD approval, Red-Horse reversed the purchase agreement of Freeman Securities, then already known as Native <b>Nations</b> <b>Securities.</b> The purchase was reversed but some press continued to incorrectly associate Ms. Red-Horse with the subsequent SIPC payout and bankruptcy simply due to the premature name change from Freeman Securities. Red-Horse was never the target of any investigation relating to this matter.|$|R
40|$|Russia - Georgia war officially {{took place}} from 7 - 15 August 2008, where {{on the one}} side was Georgia and on the {{opposite}} side were Russian Federation, South-Ossetia and Abkhazian separatists. The purpose of this Bachelor thesis is to analyze the United Nations work and to describe how Russia-Georgia war became international. The analyze is based on the question – did the United Nation do as much as it could to resolve the war. Both countries are members of the United <b>Nation</b> <b>Security</b> Council, but only Russia has a veto. To accomplish the purpose the author used all debates and speeches which took place in the United Nation General Assembly and in the United <b>Nation</b> <b>Security</b> Council. Thereby the author analyzed the report by the United Nation Secretary. During the period of 8 August till 9 October there took place six debates about Russia-Georgia war in the United <b>Nation</b> <b>Security</b> Council which ended with the resolution. The United <b>Nation</b> <b>Security</b> Council’s resolutions are mandatory for all members and 9 October 2008 they voted for the resolution. This resolution describes the results of the debates where 15 members gave a vote. None of the countries used their veto. Resolution decides to extend the mandate of the United Nations mission for a new period terminating 15 February 2009 and decides to remain actively seized of the matter. Considered all debates in the United <b>Nation</b> <b>Security</b> Council and the resolution {{it can be said that}} the United Nation did everything what was possible to resolve the conflict peacefully.

5|$|The UNPROFOR mandate was {{extended}} several times, in increments {{of up to}} six months, with consent {{of the government of}} Croatia. That changed in early 1995, when Croatian President Franjo Tuđman wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Nations informing him that Croatia would not accept further extensions of the mission once it expired on 31 March and asking that UNPROFOR leave Croatia by the end of June. At the time, it was established UN practice to seek consent of the country where its peacekeepers were deployed, and the letter effectively required UNPROFOR to withdraw completely from Croatia. Such action would also require abolishment of the UNPAs, which had been identified as integral parts of Croatia by United <b>Nations</b> <b>Security</b> Council Resolution 815 of 30 March 1993. Two days later, the Secretary-General reported to the United <b>Nations</b> <b>Security</b> Council (UNSC) that UNPROFOR was unable to implement important elements of the Vance plan, enforce a ceasefire, or protect its own vehicles against hijackings in the UNPAs.|$|E
