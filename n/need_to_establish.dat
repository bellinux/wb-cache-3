5|$|Advocacy of such {{a nation}} became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization {{and that it was}} necessary to work towards it.|$|E
5|$|Many young enforcers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> {{their role}} {{early in their}} career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most {{professional}} hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E

5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E
5|$|Kippenberger {{appreciated}} the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a career {{for himself and}} to this end, decided on a profession in law. In early 1918 he enrolled at Canterbury College to study law {{and later in the}} year found a job as a law clerk in a legal practice in Christchurch. Here he met Ruth Isobel Flynn, a secretary, whom he married in 1922. The couple had three children, two sons and a daughter. Working by day, and studying in the evenings, he qualified as a solicitor in 1920. He moved to Rangiora, becoming the manager and then a partner of the Rangiora branch of a Christchurch legal firm.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren played little cricket in 1898, {{initially}} {{owing to}} his teaching commitments and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> {{himself and his}} wife in a new home. After making his first appearance in July, he did not play again until August. He played nine first-class games, scoring 478 runs at 29.87, before his season was ended by neuralgia. Despite his frequent absences—again he missed {{the first part of}} the season—Lancashire re-appointed MacLaren as joint captain for 1899. That summer, the Australians toured England and the first Test took place before MacLaren had played any cricket. For the second game, MacLaren replaced W. G. Grace as England captain; the other candidate for the leadership was Stanley Jackson, who was senior to MacLaren at Harrow and had preceded him into the England side, but MacLaren was favoured owing to his previous experience in the role with Lancashire and England.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, in Re Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved judicial review of an applicant's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E
