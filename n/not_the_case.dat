5|$|Although the {{original}} covering of the Senne resolved sanitary problems and flooding in Brussels’ old city, this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in peripheral areas. The Senne {{was still very}} polluted, despite work done to the sewers and spillways in the canal.

5|$|In a liberalised energy market, investors, {{operators}} and consumers should face {{the full cost}} of their decisions. But this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.|$|E
5|$|Nonmetals do {{not have}} any {{universal}} or near-universal applications.

50|$|However, this is <b>not</b> always <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the amount of large organizations going to court over misleading claims, stating that products are ‘school canteen approved’ or ‘all natural,’ hence claiming their products are healthy or only uses natural ingredients, but this is <b>not</b> always <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R

5|$|Some sources erroneously {{state that}} the XTSF-1 became the XTB2F, however this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The XTSF-1 was the only {{aircraft}} ever designated by the U.S. Navy in the 'TS for Torpedo Scout' category, the designation being superseded and incorporated, along with 'BT for Bomber-Torpedo', 'SB for Scout-Bomber' and 'TB for Torpedo-Bomber', into the new 'A for Attack' series.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E

5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, which is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and {{have been described as}} resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, which is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E

For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57. In 1927, the entire highway was renumbered, and since this change, the trunkline has carried the M-75 moniker. The M-75 designation was left unaltered when US27 between Gaylord and Indian River was {{converted to a}} freeway; this freeway was redesignated as I-75 in 1962. Some states, such as California, do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number, which is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Michigan. A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway and straightened sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake. As of 2008, the highway remains unaltered since the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone {{with them on the}} flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted a review of the issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds.

In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.|$|E

Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but {{there is no evidence that}} populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the public}} take part in Parliament in two ways that are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at Westminster: a public petitioning system, and cross-party groups on policy topics which the {{interested}} public join and attend meetings of, alongside MSPs.
