50|$|Cowhide is the <b>natural,</b> <b>unbleached</b> {{skin and}} hair of a cow. It retains the {{original}} coloring of the animal. Cowhides are {{a product of the}} food industry from cattle; other cows are killed specifically for their skin. Cowhide can also be processed into a leather, which {{can be used to make}} such things as shoes, wallets, leather jackets, and belts.|$|E
50|$|Containerboard, (CCM or {{corrugated}} case material) {{is a type}} {{of paperboard}} specially manufactured for the production of corrugated board. It includes both linerboard and corrugating medium (or fluting), the two types of paper that make up corrugated board. Since containerboard is made mainly out of <b>natural</b> <b>unbleached</b> wood fibers, it is generally brown, although its shade may vary {{depending on the type of}} wood, pulping process, recycling rate and impurities content. For certain boxes that demand good presentation, white bleached pulp or coating is used on the top ply of the linerboard that goes outside the box.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristics}} of natural dye colouring {{are derived from}} the aul tree or madder dye (Morinda citrifolia) extracted from {{the root of the}} Indian madder tree. Since it is prepared out of natural resources which are non-toxic, the dye is not harmful to the skin. Even though it is only a limited colour range, it is eco-friendly and shades developed are very suiting and pleasant. The colours ranging from deep maroon to dark brown depend on the age of the root bark and the proportion of the dye used and is obtained with the addition of harikari or iron sulphate. These colours mixed with the <b>natural</b> <b>unbleached</b> off-white color of the cotton yarn produce dramatic results. The motifs used on the fabric are conch, boat, axes, crab, bow, temple, fish, and fan, which reflect the culture of the area. These motifs are developed by the extra wefts. By use of multi-shuttle by interlocking method, a solid border effect of the fabric is brought up by the pig by pig insertion of thread.|$|E
30|$|Mitchell’s burial {{clothing}} uses predominantly undyed and <b>unbleached</b> <b>natural</b> {{fibers and}} fabrics of mostly silk and wool. Overall, his aesthetic {{for the collection}} is theatrical with elements of glamour reminiscent of old Hollywood and nineteenth century Parisian couture. As Mitchell himself explains, “My choice of techniques for work like Burial [I] is limited to late 19 th and early twentieth century dressmaking techniques. I use slow, fine-handsewing techniques, the best natural materials, and don’t take any shortcuts” (personal communication, August 1, 2015). Pieces in the Burial I collection featured classic details such as rows of fabric covered bridal-style buttons, hand-embroidered tattoo-inspired motifs, and hand-knitting.|$|R
30|$|Laccase {{has also}} been used in paper making to {{increase}} its strength related properties {{with the help of}} ferulic acid applied in sisal pulp (Aracri et al. 2011). It {{has also been}} grafted with <b>natural</b> phenols in <b>unbleached</b> fibers along with the analysis of antibacterial activity (Elegir et al. 2008). The industrial preparation of paper requires the use of chemicals which actually causes environmental pollution. However, LMS can be used as an eco-friendly tool where the use of chlorine-based treatment process can be minimized. It has already found practical applications in Lignozym®-process (Call and Mücke 1997). However, bio-bleaching studies were focused on wood pulps and Camarero et al. (2004) explored the potential of LMS to remove lignin-derived products responsible for color from high-quality flax pulp. They showed the feasibility of LMS to substitute chlorine-containing reagents in manufacturing of these high-priced paper pulps.|$|R
