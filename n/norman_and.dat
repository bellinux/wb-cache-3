5|$|A new organ was {{supplied}} to the abbey in 1895 by <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console {{standing on the}} floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
5|$|Because Iguanodon {{is one of}} {{the first}} dinosaur genera to have been named, {{numerous}} species have been assigned to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs (such as Megalosaurus) became, Iguanodon has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting I. bernissartensis to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of Iguanodon from France and Spain as valid.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{coronation}} and 1071, William consolidated {{his hold}} over England, defeating {{a number of}} rebellions that arose particularly {{in the north and}} west of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> other continental nobles.|$|E

5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E
5|$|During the 10th and 11th centuries, {{power struggles}} {{occurred}} between rulers in northern and western France {{including those of}} Anjou, Normandy, Brittany, Poitou, Blois, Maine, and the kings of France. In the early 12th century Geoffrey of Anjou married Empress Matilda, King Henry I's only surviving legitimate child and heir to the English throne. As {{a result of this}} marriage, Geoffrey's son Henry II inherited the English throne as well as <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> Angevin titles, thus marking the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.|$|E

His older sister died shortly before his birth, and he was followed by three younger siblings, Wilma, <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> Lowell. As a child he attended the local Church of Christ, where he remained a lifelong member. He joined the Boy Scouts' Troop 46 earning the rank of Star Scout.|$|E

5|$|In 1190, York Castle was the {{location}} {{of one of the}} worst pogroms in England during the medieval period. The Normans had introduced , where some occupied a special economic role as moneylenders, an essential but otherwise banned activity. English Jews were subject to considerable religious prejudice and primarily worked from towns and cities in which there was a local royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks from the majority Christian population. Royal protection was usually granted as the <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown, reverting to the king on a Jew's death.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} rebuilt by them in 1930, {{and then by}} Hill, <b>Norman</b> <b>and</b> Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was {{increased}} {{to a total of}} 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E
