5|$|According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} in the early 1870s by the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston</b> Air Line Railroad.

5|$|By October 1938, {{the ship}} had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman Steamship Company.

5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock explosion of the late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and New Wave of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting in short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth. Hardcore exploded in the American metropolises of Los Angeles, Washington, DC, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston</b> and most American cities had their own local scenes {{by the end of}} the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Most Armenian Americans are {{concentrated}} in major urban areas, especially in California and the Northeast, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the Midwest. The highest concentrations of Americans of Armenian ancestry are in Los Angeles, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston.</b> According to the 2000 Census, the states with largest Armenian populations were California (204,631), Massachusetts (28,595), New York (24,460), New Jersey (17,094), Michigan (15,746), Florida (9,226), Pennsylvania (8,220), Illinois (7,958), Rhode Island (6,677) and Texas (4,941).|$|E

5|$|The Upper Boston Post Road was {{established}} in 1673 between <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston</b> via New Haven, Hartford, Springfield, and Worcester. From New Haven to Hartford, it ran at various times via Middletown (now roughly Route 17 and Route 99) and via Meriden (now very roughly US 5). North of Hartford, the road remained {{on the west side}} of the Connecticut River, following the general path of present Route 159.|$|E
5|$|Fort Sullivan {{was renamed}} Fort Moultrie {{shortly after the}} battle to honor Colonel William Moultrie for his {{successful}} defense of the fort {{and the city of}} Charleston. Extensively modified in the years after the battle, it was supplanted by Fort Sumter as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. In 1876, to celebrate the centennial, companies from Savannah, Augusta, Macon, Columbia, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston</b> were invited to Charleston. The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960, and is now part of Fort Sumter National Monument.|$|E
5|$|In August 1933, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that the Shepard Line had secured a year-long charter of Exford for their expanded intercoastal service between North Atlantic ports and the Pacific ports of Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle. Later in 1933, the ship was renamed Pan Royal to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, {{and it is likely}} that Pan Royal called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston</b> from this time.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} education program at Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, was the first such program in the United States. Its facilities were first housed within the school's Calisthenium and Riding Academy which opened in 1866, a year after Vassar's opening in 1865. Alumna Forence Cushing, along with a cohort of other Boston-based alumnae, observed in 1883 that Vassar's {{physical education}} program was lagging behind those at other recently opened Seven Sisters schools including Wellesley College and Smith College. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston</b> alumnae clubs began an attempt to raise $20,000, which they believed to be an adequate sum to pay for a new home for athletics at the school.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the three-game series {{between the}} two teams on the weekend of August 5–7 drew large {{television}} viewers. The Friday game (August 5) on MLB Network drew 563,000 viewers, making it the most-watched game on the network during the 2011 season and the second-most watched game on the network, behind Stephen Strasburg's debut. In <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boston,</b> it was blacked out because the YES Network had local rights in New York City and NESN in Boston. The Saturday game on Fox was most-watched non-primetime regular season MLB telecast on the network {{in more than three}} years with 4.10 million viewers. The last Fox non-primetime telecast to record higher numbers also was Boston vs. New York on July 5, 2008. The Sunday game on ESPN drew 4.72 million viewers, making it the most-watched baseball game on ESPN since June 3, 2007, when both teams faced each other, and the most-watched MLB broadcast of the 2011 season on any network.|$|E
