40|$|AbstractWhen noise {{checks are}} small, spatial noise mimics {{the effect of}} white noise in grating {{detection}} {{in the sense that}} contrast energy threshold is directly proportional to the spectral density of noise and the physical signal-to-noise ratio at threshold thus remains constant. We investigated how {{the size and shape of}} noise checks affect the masking properties of noise by using vertical and polar-circular gratings embedded in the spatial noise. The <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> shape and area was varied in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. For polar-circular gratings, noise mimicked the effect of white noise when both the <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> width and height were below a critical size. For vertical gratings there was a critical <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> width, but not critical <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> height. Thus, when the <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> side length was at or below the critical size across the grating bars, and at or below the stimulus size along the grating bars, contrast energy threshold was proportional to the spectral density of noise, calculated by multiplying the <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> area by the r. m. s contrast of noise squared both for one- and two-dimensional check noises...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen masking {{one-dimensional}} gratings, {{the strongest}} masking effect {{is achieved by}} using one-dimensional spatial noise, which {{can be regarded as}} a special case of two-dimensional noise where the <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> height is equal to the grating height. The extent of spatial integration in the human visual system is limited, however. Hence, our aim was to investigate whether the effective height of noise checks of one-dimensional noise is similarly limited. We measured detection thresholds for vertical sinusoidal gratings with added spatial noise. The width of the noise checks remained constant, but their height increased until equal to the height of the image window which made noise one-dimensional. The contrast energy thresholds increased in direct proportion to increasing <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> height and the spectral density of noise, calculated by taking into account both the height and the width of the noise checks. The increase levelled off, however, after the critical <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> height (nyc). The critical <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> height in grating cycles changed as a function of spatial frequency (f) as nyc= 4. 7 [1 +(1. 4 /f) 2]− 0. 5. According to our results the effective height of noise checks was thus limited in accordance with studies on spatial integration, showing scale invariance above 1. 4 c/deg...|$|E

We used a novel stimulus to investigate how signals are combined to improve estimates of global orientation. Stimuli were 29 × 29 element arrays of 4 c/deg log Gabors, spaced 1 ° apart. A proportion {{of these elements}} had a coherent orientation (horizontal/vertical) with the remainder assigned random orientations. The observer's task was to identify the global orientation. The spatial configuration of the signal was modulated by a checkerboard pattern of square checks containing potential signal elements. The other locations contained either randomly oriented elements (''noise check'') or were blank (''blank check''). The distribution of signal elements was manipulated by varying the size and location of the checks within a fixed-diameter stimulus. An ideal detector would only pool responses from potential signal elements. Humans did this for medium check sizes and for large check sizes when a signal was presented in the fovea. For small check sizes, however, the pooling occurred indiscriminately over relevant and irrelevant locations. For these check sizes, thresholds for the <b>noise</b> <b>check</b> and blank check conditions were similar, suggesting that the limiting noise is not induced by {{the response to the}} noise elements. The results are described by a model that filters the stimulus at the potential target orientations and then combines the signals over space in two stages.

In particular, the statistics of the operating <b>noise</b> is <b>checked</b> against its simple model and the compliance to the expected shape of the candidates for burst gravitational wave events is assessed by means of a χ 2 test.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if the same object frequency information mediates letter contrast threshold in the presence and absence of additive luminance noise (i. e. noise-invariant processing) for letters of different size. Methods: Contrast thresholds for Sloan letters {{ranging in size from}} 0. 9 to 1. 8 log MAR were obtained from three visually normal observers under three paradigms: 1) high- and low-pass Gaussian filtered letters were presented against a uniform adapting field; 2) high- and low-pass Gaussian filtered letters were presented in additive white luminance noise; and 3) unfiltered letters were presented in high- and low-pass Gaussian filtered luminance noise. A range of high- and low-pass filter cutoffs were used to limit selectively the object frequency content of the letters (paradigms 1 and 2) or noise (paradigm 3). The object frequencies mediating letter identification under each paradigm were derived from plots of log contrast threshold vs. log filter cutoff frequency. Results: The object frequency band mediating letter identification systematically shifted to higher frequencies with increasing log MAR letter size under all three paradigms. However, the relationship between object frequency and letter size depended on the paradigm under which the measurements were obtained. The largest difference in object frequency among the paradigms was observed at 1. 8 log MAR, where the addition of white noise nearly doubled the center frequency of the band of object frequencies mediating letter identification, compared to measurements made in the absence of noise. Conclusions: Noise can affect the object frequency band mediating letter contrast threshold, particularly for large letters, an effect that is likely due to strong masking of the low frequency letter components by low frequency <b>noise</b> <b>checks.</b> This finding indicates that noise-invariant processing cannot necessarily be assumed for large letters presented in white noise...|$|R

But far wing slope of PDF is not affected by noise and, for moderate mismatch between optical and electrical bandwidth, is only slightly affected by bandwidth limitation. The generation spectrum often becomes broader at higher power in experiments, so the spectral/electrical bandwidth mismatch factor increases over the power {{that can lead to}} artificial dependence of the PDF slope over the power.

An analysis procedure to eliminate noise faults that cannot actually happen when such correlations are considered is described.

Because of the short integration time of the LHC electronics (25 ns), the shot noise contribution is negligible {{as long as the}} current is kept to an acceptable level. However, any inter-strip capacitance increase after irradiation will degrade the noise performances of the detectors. A dependence of the capacitance on the crystal orientation of the silicon crystal used as a substrate for silicon detectors has been recently reported (Feld L., et al., Radiation induced changes in the Interstrip Capacitance of Silicon Microstrip Detectors, 4 th ROSE Workshop on Radiation Hardening of Silicon Detectors, CERN 2 - 4 December 1998, Published in CERN/LEB 98 - 11 (697)).

Quality control also includes consequences of constraints such as site access limitations, risk, hazards and safety requirements, conflicts and compromises, available resources (including people, equipment, and funding), and other issues (regulatory, litigation, proprietary, security, liability, insurance, training, licenses, customs, etc.). Quality control becomes most important for problems where the answer may be a negative – as in proving the absence of something like a void. Quality control can help answer questions like what is the biggest void that might be there that couldn’t be detected by the process performed? These types of questions are often important in hazard and risk analysis, for example in advance of mining. Quality control goes beyond any single discipline, but is discussed here only in the context of geophysics...|$|R
40|$|Digital image {{correlation}} (DIC) is a surface measurement technique {{that can be}} applied whilst performing experimental tests. At Delft University of Technology, a fatigue test is to be conducted and DIC will be used to measure surface displacements around the developing crack. These surface displacements are directly related to the crack geometry parameters. These crack geometry parameters can be found numerically via a minimisation algorithm where the difference between the surface displacements measured via DIC and surface displacement found via finite element analysis is minimised. Aim of present study is to perform a preliminary analysis before the experiment is performed in order to assess what is to be expected. It is looked into whether the out-of-plane surface displacement information that has {{to be taken into account}} since this influences the DIC hardware to be used during the experiment. Secondly, it has been looked into the noise as consequence of using DIC, and the influence of the noise on the minimisation to be performed. Finally it has been looked at the influence of the DIC noise on the accuracy of the minimisation. Since present study describes a preliminary analysis, simulated DIC surface measurements have been used. A finite element (FE) model of the specimen to be tested has been used in order to perform the study for uniaxial tension only. An algorithm using the FE model to perform the minimisation has been build and tested for simple 2 D cases and a simpler 3 D first before performing the 3 D analysis with geometry considered. The simulated DIC noise taken is 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 5 % and 10 % of the mean measured displacement field in order investigate the influence of the noise on the minimisation. Present study showed that neglecting the out-of-plane displacement information introduces an error of around 2 x 10 ^- 2 millimetres for 1000 MPa uniaxial tension applied. It is assumed that the algorithm used finds the same crack geometry parameters as have been used to construct the simulated DIC surface displacement field in case no noise is applied. It is found that this is not the case in present study. Reason is the algorithm converging to local minima located very close to the global minimum. Present study showed the location of the global minimum becoming less defined when noise applied is increased, i. e. the area in which the global minimum is located becomes larger. Present study shows that the algorithm can convergence towards the target crack geometry parameters. Accuracy of the algorithm as function of the <b>noise</b> has been <b>checked</b> for the full displacement field and the displacement field where out-of-plane information is neglected. Confidence intervals increase for increasing DIC noise, as can be expected. Due to the local minima the algorithm might converge to, it is not possible to draw conclusions on whether the full displacement field should be taken into account in order to have the accuracy required. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to change the algorithm to take extra information into account to make the algorithm converge to the global minimum. Furthermore, it is recommended to improve the numerical model, in order to improve the speed of the algorithm...|$|R
