25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E
2500|$|The Glacier View {{project was}} {{proposed}} after an earlier proposal by the Corps of Engineers and the Bonneville Power Administration {{to raise the}} level of Flathead Lake by damming its outlet was rejected following local protests. [...] Located in a relatively unpopulated area, the Glacier View reservoir would have flooded lower Camas Creek and would have raised the level of Logging Lake by , inundating much of the winter range for the park's white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer and moose. The proposed reservoir was to extend nearly to the Canada–US border, at an estimated cost of $94,962,000. The dam was supported by Montana Representative Mike Mansfield and Flathead Valley interests, but was opposed by former Senator Burton K. Wheeler, local ranchers, the National Park Service, the Glacier Park Hotel Company, the Sierra Club, Society of American Foresters and the Audubon Society. Public hearings were held in 1948 and 1949. Turnout at the 1948 hearings at Kalispell was influenced by extensive flooding then occurring in the Flathead Valley. Exploratory drilling took place in 1944 and 1945 at Glacier View and Foolhen Hill. The project was terminated by a joint memorandum between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army on April 11, 1949, but Mansfield introduced an unsuccessful bill later in the year directing the Corps of Engineers to proceed with the dam, stating that the dam [...] "would not affect the beauty of the park in any way but would make it more beautiful by creating a large lake over ground that ... has no scenic attraction." [...] The Corps of Engineers report on the project noted: [...] The park lands that will be inundated and required for freeboard of 5 feet above <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> elevation amounts to , or about 1 percent of the total Glacier National Park area. This area does not lie within the rugged, glacier-covered portion of the park for which it is noted, but rather is on the western boundary line, in a little-used valley. The reservoir area is covered with lodge-pole pine, an inferior species of limited use. Other species of pine timber such as ponderosa pine, are predominate above the normal full reservoir and will not be injured by the project. Other lands inundated or required by this project are in private, State and United States Forest Service ownership and hence should be of no concern to the Park Service. Although there would be some effect on the wildlife in the area, the construction of Glacier View Reservoir would inconvenience but relatively few people as it is situated in a sparsely populated area.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} an {{experimental}} human immunoglobulin preparation for intravenous use, containing <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> IgM (IVIgM), have shown its beneficial therapeutic effect in experimental autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms of its immunomodulatory activity remain however, poorly understood. In the experiments reported here, IVIgM inhibited {{the proliferation of}} various autonomously growing human lymphoid cell lines in vitro, {{as well as of}} MLR- and of PHA-stimulated human T-lymphocytes. These effects of IVIgM were observed at non-apoptotic concentrations and were stronger on a molar basis than those of <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> IgG for intravenous use (IVIg). Both preparations, when administered to SCID mice, repopulated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, delayed the expression of the early activation marker CD 69 on both human CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocytes, activated by the mouse antigenic environment. The data obtained show that <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> human IgM exerts a powerful antiproliferative effect on T-cells that is qualitatively similar but quantitatively superior to that of therapeutic IVIg. Our results suggest that infusions with IVIgM might have a significant beneficial immunomodulating activity in patients with selected autoimmune diseases...|$|R

40|$|Serum {{from three}} {{patients}} with a complete, selective deficiency of the second component of complement (C 2) did not promote optimal killing of Staphylococcus aureus, 502 A by neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in vitro. The addition of C 2 reagent or the presence of heat-stable opsonin in the C 2 -deficient serum corrected the defective killing of S. aureus that was observed with patient or control PMN. PMN from the patients or control subjects killed bacteria with equal efficiency under conditions of optimal opsonization (<b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> serum). However, twice-washed control PMN were better than patient PMN in killing S. aureus under circumstances of suboptimal opsonization (C 2 -deficient serum, heated C 2 -deficient serum, heated <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> serum, or no replacement of serum). The latter finding was due to residual C 2 {{on the surface of}} twice-washed control cells. As repeated washing of control PMN progressively removed cell-associated C 2, the staphylocidal effectiveness of the control RMN decreased to the level of patient PMN. In contrast to the findings with S. aureus, triply-washed PMN from patients or controls killed normal numbers of Escherichia coli, ON 2, in C 2 -deficient serum...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial {{results of a}} survey of the occurrence and characteristics of geopressured fluid resources in California using the publicly-available database involving more than 150, 000 oil and gas wells drilled in the State. Of the 975 documented on-shore oil and gas pools studied, about 42 % were identified as potentially geopressured. Geothermal gradients in California oil and gas fields lie within the normal range of 1 °F to 2 °F per 100 feet. Except for the Los Angeles Basin, {{there was no evidence of}} higher temperatures or temperature gradients in geopressured pools. The porosity of geopressured pools shows the same normal distribution as for <b>normal</b> pressured <b>pools,</b> with a mode in the range of 20 to 25 %. The salinity distribution of both the geopressured and <b>normal</b> pressured <b>pools</b> appear to be bimodal, each with two peak ranges of 0 to 10, 000 and 25, 000 to 30, 000 ppm. Compared to the U. S. Gulf Coast region, geopressured pools in California display much lower water salinities, and therefore, should have a higher solubility for methane. Geopressured pools in California occur in the depth range of less than 1, 000 feet to more than 18, 000 feet. The modal depth of geopressured pools in California is 2, 000 to 4, 000 feet, much shallower than that encountered in the Gulf Coast region. The distribution of thickness of geopressured pools is similar to that of <b>normal</b> pressured <b>pools,</b> the majority being less than 250 feet thick.

This isolate {{differed from the}} proline-requiring, serovar IA- 1 and IB- 4, wheat germ-agglutination-negative gonococcal isolates recovered from three patients during a recent outbreak of gonococcal meningitis in Philadelphia. HT- 1 was killed by <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> human sera (greater {{than or equal to}} 98 % at 30 min) but not effectively killed by the convalescent-phase sera of the patient (greater than 30 % survival at 30 min). Similar results were obtained when mucosal and cerebrospinal fluid isolates from a Philadelphia patient were exposed to these sera, but mucosal and blood isolates from another Philadelphia case showed increased resistance to killing by <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> human sera. Further characterization revealed multiple differences in outer membrane and cellular proteins and lipopolysaccharide between case isolates. Absence of the L 8 lipopolysaccharide epitope was noted for all isolates. Sera of our patient were found to have low total hemolytic complement (CH 100 = 21 U/ml; normal = 55 to 100 U/ml) due to deficiency of C 8 (C 8 less than 1, 000 CH 50 U/ml; normal = {{greater than or equal to}} 16, 000 CH 50 U/ml). This is the first reported case of gonococcal meningitis occurring in a patient with a terminal-complement deficiency. Gonococcal meningitis is a rare complication of gonococcal bacteremia.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} method for the {{isolation}} of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from human serum which could be used in a routine Hospital Laboratory to study serum GAGs in normal individuals of various ages. The method developed here included proteolytic digestion of serum using papain, dialysis of the digested sample against phosphate buffer and precipitation of GAGs with cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC). The isolation of GAGs by this method was shown to be reproducible and accurate. The advantage of the present method was that a uronic acid level and electrophoretic separations could be obtained from a single 5 ml sample. Glycosaminoglycans were isolated from <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> sera using the present method and characterized by enzymatic and chemical analysis. The results showed that the major serum GAG was chondroitin sulphate (CS), which was present in both undersulphated and oversulphated forms. The identification of a small amount of glucosamine was significant but its origin was unclear. A pilot study on <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> sera collected in decades (0 - 10 years to 71 - 80 years) indicated that uronic acid levels were higher in children, then decreased during early adult life and increased again in older age groups. Scanning densitometry of the relative proportions of oversulphated and undersulphated GAG fractions did not show any clear changes with age. A study on normal individual sera of various ages (21 - 64 years) also showed a gentle decrease in uronic acid levels throughout adult life followed by a slight increase in the 61 - 70 year age group. It was concluded from these studies that total serum GAG content appeared to change with age and further work on serum GAGs in children and older individuals might be rewarding. Finally the possible origins and fate of serum GAGs as reflections of GAG metabolism in man were discussed. Department of Chemical Pathology, Torbay Hospita...|$|R
