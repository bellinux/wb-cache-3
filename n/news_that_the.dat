5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange {{tries to}} {{convince}} them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{of strangers}} on the Atlantic coast reached Chiapas {{long before the}} {{physical}} presence of Spaniards in the region. This was followed by messengers from the Aztec emperor, Moctezuma II, to the K'iche' Maya of the Guatemalan Highlands, warning them to prepare for war against the Spanish intruders. This was soon followed by <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the conquistadores. A mixed embassy that included Chiapanecas, K'iche's and Kaqchikel Maya visited Hernan Cortés in the recently conquered Aztec capital, and were well received.|$|E

5|$|Île de France {{had been}} in a state of turmoil since the French Revolution and in 1792 the republican party on the island seized control. In 1794 {{suspected}} royalists were arrested, including the naval commander , their executions forestalled by the arrival of <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French Convention had abolished slavery. Only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented unrest. The preoccupation of the naval authorities had prevented any offensive operations and the reduced squadron, now commanded by Captain Jean-Marie Renaud, remained in Port Louis.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} monks extol {{the power of}} the Church. Bertram has freed Robert from the guards and the two arrive to prevent the {{marriage}} of Isabelle to the Prince of Granada. Bertram attempts to get Robert to sign a document in which he promises to serve Bertram for all eternity. He reveals to Robert that he is his true father and Robert decides to sign the oath from filial devotion. Before he can do so, Alice appears with the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Prince has been prevented from marrying Isabelle. Alice prays for divine help (Dieu puissant, ciel propice) and hands Robert his mother's will. Robert reads his mother's message, in which she warns him to beware the man who seduced and ruined her. Robert is wracked by indecision. Midnight strikes and the time for Bertram's coup is past. He is drawn down to hell. Robert is reunited with Isabelle in the cathedral, to great rejoicing.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing the}} <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States had {{informed}} Britain {{it would be}} ending its obligations under the Treaty of 1818 {{and looking for a}} division of the Oregon Country, the legislature scaled back its agenda. One piece of legislation passed was a pilotage law that set standards and licensed boat pilots {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as the speaker and leader. Noah Huber served as a clerk and Knighton as sergeant at arms.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains open-ended from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later to the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purifier is working well and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to {{the introduction of}} the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent into the chamber in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Puerto Rico, in January 1521, he {{received}} the terrible <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dominican convent at Chiribichi had been sacked by Indians, and that the Spaniards of the islands had launched a punitive expedition, led by Gonzalo de Ocampo, into {{the very heart of}} the territory that Las Casas wanted to colonize peacefully. The Indians had been provoked to attack the settlement of the monks because of the repeated slave raids by Spaniards operating from Cubagua. As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves from the land Las Casas had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia. After several months of negotiations Las Casas set sail alone; the peasants he had brought had deserted, and he arrived in his colony already ravaged by Spaniards.|$|E
5|$|At the time, John was in {{south-east}} England recruiting mercenaries {{in preparation}} for his war with the barons. Rochester blocked the direct route to London, which was also held by the rebels. According to Roger of Wendover, the rebels at Rochester were led by William d'Aubigny, lord of Belvoir. Estimates {{of the size of}} Rochester's garrison vary, with the chroniclers' figures ranging from 95 to 140knights, supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. Hearing the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city was in enemy hands, John immediately rode to Rochester and arrived on 13October. Royal forces had arrived ahead of John and entered the city on 11October, taking it by surprise and laying siege to the castle. Rochester bridge was pulled down to prevent the arrival of a relief force from London. The siege that followed was the largest in England up to that point, and would take nearly two months.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the tunnel}} had been completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach its destination {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E

5|$|Histiaeus now {{gathered}} a large force of Ionians and Aeolians {{and went to}} besiege Thasos. However, he then received the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to Lesbos. In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was {{in the area and}} eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line. Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, thinking that {{he would be able to}} talk himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus's past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius.|$|E
5|$|In April 1918 {{the militia}} {{artillery}} was again mobilised, although this time {{only for a}} month, when <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German commerce raiders Wolf and Seeadler had entered Australian waters the previous year. In June 1918 {{the number of troops}} actively employed on home service was 9,215, of which 2,476 were regulars. At this time the Navy took over the task of providing guards for ships in harbour and communications facilities, thus allowing for many of the militia troops to be released for further training, and as such it was decided to increase the period of camp training for the militia from eight days to 24.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1862, Colonel Lightburn {{became aware}} of rebel cavalry led by Colonel Albert G. Jenkins, which invaded Ohio. After a brief {{incursion}} into Ohio, Jenkins positioned his cavalry at Barboursville, which blocked one of Lightburn's possible routes {{to the safety of}} the Ohio River. Jenkins also prepared to move toward the Kanawha River and Charleston—which could block all of Lightburn's retreat routes to Ohio. Lightburn also received <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Confederate General William W. Loring was advancing from the south with a force rumored to be between 8,000 and 10,000 men. (The actual number was 5,000 plus new recruits.) Lightburn faced the possibility of confronting an army (Loring) that he thought was much larger than his while having no easy way to retreat because of Jenkins.|$|E

On the afternoon of the 12th, however, he told the Fiji Village <b>news</b> service <b>that</b> <b>the</b> meeting had in fact taken place, but said he was {{not in a position to}} reveal what had been discussed.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 223 BC, Antigonus {{advanced}} upon Tegea. He was joined there by the Achaeans and together they laid siege to it. The Tegeans held {{out for a few}} days before being forced to surrender by the Macedonians' siege weapons. After the capture of Tegea, Antigonus advanced to Laconia, where he found Cleomenes' army waiting for him. When his scouts brought <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> garrison of Orchomenus was marching to meet Cleomenes, however, Antigonus broke camp and ordered a forced march; this caught the city by surprise and forced it to surrender. Antigonus proceeded to capture Mantinea, Heraea and Telphusa, which confined Cleomenes to Laconia. Antigonus then returned to Aegium, where he gave another report about his operations before dismissing the Macedonian troops to winter at home.|$|E
5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the <b>news</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|Promotion for {{the game}} began shortly after.
