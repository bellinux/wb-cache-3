5|$|Early {{intervention}} {{helped to}} ensure that the <b>Nationalist</b> faction survived the initial stages of the war; German involvement then steadily expanded. The training they provided to <b>Nationalist</b> force proved as valuable, if not more so, than direct actions. Approximately 56,000 <b>Nationalist</b> soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E

In August, Chinese communists {{launched a}}n offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material {{resources for the}} communists. Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and <b>nationalist</b> forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation. In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked {{the headquarters of the}} Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao. In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese <b>nationalist</b> forces.|$|E

Inspired by the <b>nationalists,</b> the chief engineer Osman decided to join the <b>nationalists.</b> On 5 February 1921, Alemdar with a crew of 7, sailed to Karadeniz Ereğli to join the <b>nationalists</b> under the pretext of a salvage operation. They consigned the ship to the <b>nationalists.</b> The number of the crew was now 21 excluding Osman who fell ill in Karadeniz Ereğli.

This was recognition that Darwaza's contribution to the spread of Arab <b>nationalist</b> sentiments gained influence not only in an-Najah School, but throughout Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{officers}} {{were members of}} other anti-communist <b>nationalist</b> groups that were opposed to Diệm, such as the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (<b>Nationalist</b> Party of Greater Vietnam) and the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, Vietnamese <b>Nationalist</b> Party), which were both established before World War II. The VNQDĐ had run a military academy in Yunnan near the Chinese border {{with the assistance of}} their <b>nationalist</b> Chinese counterparts, the Kuomintang. Diệm and his family had crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDĐ and Đại Việt trained {{officers were}} denied such promotions. They felt that politically minded officers, who joined Diệm's secret Catholic-dominated Cần Lao Party, which was used to control South Vietnamese society, were rewarded with promotion rather than those most capable.|$|E

Some white <b>nationalists</b> draw on 19th-century racial taxonomy. Some white <b>nationalists,</b> such as Jared Taylor, have argued that Jews can be considered [...] "white".

25|$|Some of {{the younger}} {{elements}} within the Indian National Congress were dissatisfied with {{the achievements of the}} Early <b>Nationalists</b> and vociferous critics of the methods of peaceful constitutional agitation that they promulgated. Young members advocated the adoption of European revolutionary methods to counter British imperialism while mainstream Early <b>Nationalists</b> remained loyal to the crown, with their desire to regain self-government lacking conviction. The Early <b>Nationalists</b> failed to attain their objectives, giving rise to another group of leaders known as Assertive or Extremist <b>Nationalists.</b> The most prominent leaders of the Assertive <b>Nationalists</b> were Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai and Bipin Chandra Pal, who are known collectively as the Lal-Bal-Pal trio.|$|R
5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} splintered into a liberal-decentralist <b>nationalist</b> faction led by Croatia and Slovenia {{that supported}} a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist <b>nationalist</b> faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, <b>nationalist</b> doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E

5|$|Although the PanzerI would {{participate}} {{in almost every}} major <b>Nationalist</b> offensive of the war, the <b>Nationalist</b> army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower.

Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T-26 at close range—150meters (165yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92millimeter bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the PanzerI.|$|E

Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the <b>nationalist</b> histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E

From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for <b>nationalist</b> newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a völkisch emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were survivals of pre-Christian, pagan religion. He published three novels, Carnuntum (1888), Jung Diethers Heimkehr (1894), and Pipara (1895), each set among the German tribes of the Iron Age, as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing völkisch articles, now largely for the <b>nationalist</b> Ostdeutsche Rundschau newspaper, with his works taking on an anti-semitic dimension halfway through that decade. In 1893, he co-founded the Literarische Donaugesellschaft literary society, and involved himself in Austria's Pan-German <b>nationalist</b> movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the German Empire.|$|E
