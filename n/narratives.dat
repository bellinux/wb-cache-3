5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} <b>narratives</b> in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of {{invention}} in the Gospel <b>narratives</b> of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E

Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel <b>narratives</b> WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover <b>narratives</b> about the past.

40|$|Abstract] This paper {{examines}} how <b>narrative</b> can function as medium of communication. There are various {{approaches to the}} study of <b>narrative.</b> Recent approaches have become more concerned with cognition and context than with <b>narrative</b> structure itself. These approaches provide enquirers with a view of <b>narrative</b> as potential medium for communication between the storyteller and the addressee. Particularly insofar as the concept of communication involves context, as well as a shared situation and opinion between communicators, the issue of what is communicated comes to be a focus. This aspect includes communicators themselves as important components along with the message for communication. Based on the concept of communication, the paper examines <b>narrative</b> as medium of communication by looking at the symbolic form of the <b>narrative</b> text to be transmitted. This requires interpreting activity incorporated with semiotic enterprise. At this point, the Peircean semiotic is a methodology to discover how symbolic text of <b>narrative</b> can be used for communication. This method has the great advantage of revealing the three domains of narrative: <b>narrative</b> structure as semiotic maneuver, <b>narrative</b> context as basis for cognition, and <b>narrative</b> communication as dialogic process. Within the Peircean semiotic framework, not only the concept of communication but also the concept of <b>narrative</b> is redefined, in which the definition of <b>narrative</b> is extended to the representation of reality for constructing knowledge. Thus, <b>narrative</b> is not limited to fiction, but it also includes <b>narrative</b> in life. This study focuses on <b>narrative</b> discourse in art by analyzing a film. The study suggests four conditions of <b>narrative</b> to become a communication medium: first, fictionality as <b>narrative’s</b> sense based on firstness; second, temporal-spatial structure as <b>narrative’s</b> meaning based on secondness; third, symbolic representation as <b>narrative’s</b> significance based on thirdness; and fourth, combination of these three to produce a final opinion through dialogic process. This study will contribute to the advancement of communication studies...|$|R
5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like <b>narratives</b> where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” <b>narratives,</b> modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E

[...] - <b>Narrative</b> approaches are increasing within music education research. Following this, the interest towards methodological considerations, and ways to discuss quality in <b>narrative</b> research also are increasing in these research environments. This article provides frames and references for such considerations in a Scandinavian language, with examples from the Nordic area, in dialogue with international fields of literature on <b>narrative</b> inquiry in music education. Our research question is: How can <b>narrative</b> inquiry contribute to music education research? We first reflect on central concepts connected to <b>narrative</b> theory with {{a special interest in}} Paul Ricoeur’s threefold mimesis. We bravely apply his thoughts on <b>narrative</b> research. After that we describe ways of generating material for <b>narrative</b> analysis, and discuss different ways of understanding <b>narrative</b> data. The final theme we discuss is how to judge quality in <b>narrative</b> research. As a conclusion we suggest <b>narrative</b> approaches to be a contribution to existing research approaches that in unique ways can provide complexity and closeness to experiences in artful events.

40|$|Interactive <b>narrative</b> {{systems are}} {{storytelling}} systems {{in which the}} user can influence the content or ordering of story world events. Conceptually, an interactive <b>narrative</b> can be represented as a branching graph of <b>narrative</b> elements, implying points at which an interactive user’s decisions influence the content or ordering of the remaining elements. Generative approaches to interactive <b>narrative</b> construct <b>narrative</b> at runtime or pre-construct on a per-session basis highly interactive branching <b>narrative</b> structures. One generative approach – <b>narrative</b> mediation – represents story as a linear progression of events with anticipated user actions and system-controlled agent actions together in a partially-ordered plan. For every possible way the user can violate the story plan, an alternative story plan is generated. If <b>narrative</b> mediation is powerful enough to express the same interactive stories as systems that use branching <b>narrative</b> structures, then linear <b>narrative</b> generation techniques {{can be applied to}} interactive <b>narrative</b> generation. This paper lays out this argument and sketches a proof that <b>narrative</b> mediation is at least as powerful as acyclic branching story structures...|$|R

Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward <b>narratives.</b> Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted <b>narratives</b> that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{deals with}} a number of {{conceptual}} and theoretical issues that underlie the proposal to employ <b>narrative</b> explanations in science education: What is <b>narrative?</b> What is explanation? and What is <b>narrative</b> explanation? In answering these questions, we develop a framework of <b>narrative</b> elements and characteristics of <b>narrative</b> explanations. Two possible examples of <b>narrative</b> explanation are presented and examined in light of the framework. This examination brings to light various conceptual and empirical questions related to the examples and to the larger issue of the use of examples like them in science instruction. The value of the framework lies partly in its power to point to such questions. The questions can guide a program of theoretical and empirical research into the psychological reality of the <b>narrative</b> form of explanation, the existence of <b>narrative</b> explanations in science, the use of <b>narrative</b> explanations in science teaching, and {{the nature and extent of}} the <b>narrative</b> effect upon which proposals for the use of <b>narrative</b> often are justified...|$|R

40|$|The present {{work has}} two aims. The first {{aim is to}} {{introduce}} the method of <b>narrative</b> criticism to New Testament scholars and we attempt {{to do this in}} Part One. <b>Narrative</b> criticism of the Bible has been practised since the early 1980 's, but since that time no one has established the nature and the aims of the method. This thesis is the first work to define what a comprehensive narrative-critical approach to the gospels might entail. It is also the first work to include historical concerns in the narrative-critical programme. The examples of <b>narrative</b> criticism we do have in New Testament studies all assume that <b>narrative</b> criticism must be an a-historical method. We point out the fallacy of this view by drawing attention to the recent sociological studies of the <b>narrative</b> form and to the <b>narrative</b> history debate in History Faculties during the 1960 's and 1970 's. These two movements in scholarship necessitate an historical dimension to <b>narrative</b> criticism if the <b>narrative</b> form is not to be greatly restricted and over-simplified. In Part One we provide an apology for <b>narrative</b> criticism and we show how future Johannine scholars might examine JOHN as <b>narrative</b> Christology (chapter one), <b>narrative</b> performance (chapter two), community <b>narrative</b> (chapter three) and <b>narrative</b> history (chapter four). In Part Two we provide an illustration of the method at work. Taking the Johannine passion <b>narrative</b> as our text (John 18 - 19), we show how this part of JOHN might be examined as <b>narrative</b> Christology (chapter five), <b>narrative</b> performance (chapter six), community <b>narrative</b> (chapter seven) and <b>narrative</b> history (chapter eight). This thesis is the first to expose these chapters to a thorough and rigorous literary approach. Our analysis reveals that the fourth evangelist has constructed his passion story with great artistry. We draw particular attention to <b>narrative</b> echo-effects, characterization, tragic mood, the reader's response of "home-coming" and time-shapes in John 18 - 19. These, and many other <b>narrative</b> strategies, contribute towards the classic, disclosing power of JOHN's story of the death of Jesus...|$|R
40|$|<b>Narrative</b> asides in the <b>narrative</b> of {{the book}} of Revelation to John. Concerning the {{language}} (le parole) of the <b>narrative</b> {{of the book}} of Revelation, many ignorant and negative remarks have been thrown around. Therefore, to properly excavate the deadly accurate meaning of the <b>narrative</b> of the text requires narratological knowledge and skills from the informed linguist and exegete. Every hint of information to lighten up the text is very important. In the dramatic <b>narrative</b> {{of the book of}} Revelation we find most valuable references which have to be taken into consideration in analysing the text. They are called <b>narrative</b> asides, inter alia to awaken emotion in the reader, provide semantic explanations, give functional meaning to the sequence of the <b>narrative</b> or can just be causal. Combined with vocalisation these <b>narrative</b> aside enables the linguist and exegete hermeneutically {{to a better understanding of}} the message of Revelation and 4 Esra. The <b>narrative</b> of 4 Esra is chosen as a comparable and contemporary <b>narrative</b> to put the <b>narrative</b> of Revelation even more into narratological perspective. </p...|$|R
40|$|Reader-focused {{analyses}} of frame <b>narrative</b> (usually assuming and elaborating a liminal, distinguishing, or transitional “picture-frame” metaphor) are incomplete, describing only the initial experience of “coming at” and “moving off from” {{the text as}} a pre-existing artifact. An alternative analysis would emphasize <b>narrative</b> acts and enabling texts (guided by the metaphor of an internal, form-giving “frame-work”), and thus describe {{the process by which}} the textual artifact comes into being, shaping itself over time into the text we eventually read. In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, we might distinguish three frame sequences: a reading sequence, an action sequence, and a <b>narrative</b> sequence. The <b>narrative</b> sequence is the primary, enabling frame shaping the novel, and is dependent upon three levels of <b>narrative</b> refiguring: rhetorical, elemental, and intentional. Each <b>narrative</b> act in Shelley’s novel is enabled and shaped by a previous <b>narrative</b> act, and each <b>narrative</b> text produced by these acts is the peculiar result of the <b>narrative</b> sequence that engenders it. The tension between <b>narrative</b> act and <b>narrative</b> text in Frankenstein forms a fundamental dialectic process, producing an ambiguously authoritative artifact...|$|R

40|$|Stephen Adly Guirgis {{has created}} an era-melting play, The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, which explores the {{timeless}} debate between divine mercy and free will.

This qualitative study focused on Guirgis 2 ̆ 7 s <b>narrative,</b> using Walter R.
