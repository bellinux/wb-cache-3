25|$|NY88 {{begins at}} a commercialized {{intersection}} with NY96 in the otherwise residential western {{portion of the}} village of Phelps in northeastern Ontario County. It heads north on Newark Street, running along the west edge of several residential blocks before leaving the village and descending into a <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> to pass under the New York State Thruway (Interstate90 or I-90). Past the Thruway, the route curves to the northwest, briefly following the outlet of Canandaigua Lake across rolling farmland. The outlet turns southwest ahead of a junction with County Road25, at which point NY88 turns to follow a more northerly routing into Wayne County and the sprawling village of Newark {{just north of the}} county line.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} the Battle of Rossbach is as much the {{story of the}} five days of {{maneuver}} leading to the battle as it is those famous 90 minutes of battle, and the maneuvers were shaped by the terrain. Initial activity focused on the village of Weissenfels, where the middle Saale emerges from the Buntsandstein of the Thuringian Basin in the Leipzig highlands, not far from the modern-day A9 highway; the locale lies [...] from the town of Saale and [...] southwest of Jena. Parts of the valley between Leipzig and Saale were relatively <b>narrow,</b> <b>cut</b> by the river and its tributaries; the hillsides were steep, and there were limited river crossings; this influenced the troop movements leading to the battle, as the various armies competed for sites to cross the river.|$|E
60|$|Five minutes' {{work was}} {{sufficient}} to show a <b>narrow</b> <b>cut,</b> some two feet wide, in the hillside, {{at the end of}} which stood a low door.|$|E
5000|$|As Egg Hill {{separates}} Georges Valley from Penns Valley so too does Brush Mountain from Brush Valley. Brush Mountain raises to {{an elevation}} of 1,936 ft [...] and has one large pass, the Millheim <b>Narrows,</b> <b>cut</b> by Elk Creek. This pass allows travel from Rebersburg to Millheim and greater Penns Valley.|$|R
50|$|It forms {{part of the}} {{boundary}} between the civil parishes of Albury and St Martha which contains most of Chilworth. Like the Tillingbourne, the lower Law Brook was harnessed by the construction of leats (<b>narrow</b> <b>cuts)</b> and mill ponds to provide power for industrial mills, including a long leat dividing Chilworth and supplying its largest pond, known today as The Fish Pond, Chilworth.|$|R
50|$|The cost is {{determined}} by the number of features, which determine what tooling will need to be used. It is advised to keep the features as simple as possible to keep the cost of tooling to a minimum. Features that are close together produce a problem because it may not provide enough clearance for the punch, which could result in another station. It can also be problematic to have <b>narrow</b> <b>cuts</b> and protrusions.|$|R
60|$|The {{floor of}} the pass was level, {{although}} rugged, and the rocks on either side rose in a sheer precipice, so that whoever should attempt to penetrate without wings to the region beyond must needs go by that <b>narrow</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E
60|$|As a rule but few passers-by availed {{themselves}} of this short and <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> {{down to the}} river-side. Nathless, the unarmed citizen was scared by these dank and dreary shadows, whilst the city watchman, mindful of his own safety, was wont to pass the mean street by.|$|E
60|$|So, {{followed}} only by her maid, Greta, Lysbeth glided lightly {{as a bird}} {{down the}} ice path on to the moat, and across it, through the <b>narrow</b> <b>cut,</b> to the frozen mere beyond, where the sports were to be held and the races run. There the scene was very beautiful.|$|E

5000|$|Dōzuki [...] - [...] a Japanese backsaw, {{used for}} centuries by {{carpenters}} and cabinetmakers in Japan. Although this saw {{does not share}} an ancestry with the other backsaws in this group, the concept is the same. Like most Japanese saws, the dōzuki cuts on the pull stroke, allowing for much straighter and <b>narrower</b> <b>cuts</b> than those achieved with push-stroke saws. This is due to tension on the blade during the cut (versus compression for a western saw), so less thickness is required to keep the saw blade straight.|$|R
60|$|She {{pointed to}} the open door. Arthur entered by a <b>narrow</b> passage <b>cut</b> through the {{thickness}} of the adobe wall into another room beyond, and paused on the threshold.|$|R
60|$|If Casey {{remembered the}} lay of the land, there was a long, {{straight}} stretch of track, ending in several curves, the last of which turned sharply into the <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> where the Sioux would ambush and obstruct the train. At this point it was Casey's intention to put off the brake and let his car run wild.|$|E
60|$|The {{place of}} refuge to which chance had brought them was admirable both for {{purposes}} of defense and for hiding. It was a deep, <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> extending thirty feet into {{what appeared to be}} a mass of sandstone, and at the entrance was not more than ten feet wide, while over the top the foliage grew so luxuriantly as to completely conceal them from the view of any one who might be above.|$|E
60|$|To {{know the}} Sioux were there made a {{tremendous}} difference. A dark and terrible sternness actuated Casey. He projected his soul into that clattering car {{of iron and}} wood. And it was certain he prayed. His hair stood straight up. There! the <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> in the hill! {{the curve of the}} track! He was pounding at it. The wheels shrieked. Looking up, he saw only the rocks and gray patches of brush and the bare streak of earth. No Indian showed.|$|E

50|$|At around 1:45 am, {{the general}} speed of traffic dropped {{due to the}} {{motorway}} becoming narrower, reducing from three lanes to two. Two cars, which were overtaking the two coaches at {{the point that the}} road <b>narrowed,</b> <b>cut</b> across behind one of the coaches and in front of the other. At the same time, the leading coach braked suddenly due to a slow-moving vehicle ahead. The second coach hit the back of the second car, causing a pile-up. The fuel tank of one of the cars was ripped open and emptied onto the road, and the petrol ignited. Six vehicles caught fire.|$|R
50|$|The town {{is perched}} on a mountain, {{formerly}} only accessible by a <b>narrow</b> stairway <b>cut</b> into the rock. Amadiya has a well-integrated community of Christians, Jews and Muslim Kurds who share the city and local social events.|$|R
60|$|Casey {{appeared}} to be grimly and conscientiously concerned over his task, and {{he was worried about}} the outcome. He must get his car beyond that <b>narrow</b> <b>cut.</b> If it jumped the track or ran into an obstruction, or if the Sioux spied him in time, then his work would not be well done. He welcomed the gathering momentum, yet was fearful of the curve he saw a long distance ahead. When he reached that he would be going at a high rate of speed--too fast to take the curve safely.|$|E
60|$|When {{his companions}} had departed, Ian Macdonald cleaned his gun {{carefully}} and loaded with ball; then placing his axe {{in his belt}} beside his scalping-knife, he proceeded with long and rapid strides towards the gap or pass above referred to. The bear's track led through this pass, which was a <b>narrow</b> <b>cut,</b> not more than thirty feet wide, in a steep rocky ridge with which the country at that place was intersected for a considerable distance. The ridge itself, and the pass by which it was divided, were thickly covered with trees and dense undergrowth.|$|E
6000|$|We edged {{along the}} still trench, where the {{soldiers}} stared, with justified contempt, I thought, upon the civilian who scuttled through their {{life for a}} few emotional minutes {{in order to make}} words out of their blood. Somehow it reminded me of coming in late to a play and incommoding a long line of packed stalls. The whispered dialogue was much the same: [...] "Pardon!" [...] "I beg your pardon, monsieur." [...] "To the right, monsieur." [...] "If monsieur will lower his head." [...] "One sees best from here, monsieur," [...] and so on. It was their day and night-long business, carried through without display or heat, or doubt or indecision. Those who worked, worked; those off duty, not five feet behind them in the dug-outs, were deep in their papers, or their meals or their letters; while death stood ready at every minute to drop down into the <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> from out of the narrow strip of unconcerned sky. And {{for the better part of}} a week one had skirted hundreds of miles of such a frieze! ...|$|E
50|$|Public {{access to}} the quiet pebble beach is disputed with only one road which is {{currently}} illegally blocked. Access is now by a <b>narrow</b> path <b>cut</b> {{into the side of}} the steep cliff and a hot climb down to the beach.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{extent of}} the parish {{is marked by a}} steep, <b>narrow</b> river valley <b>cut</b> into the downs, meeting the sea at Kynance Cove. The coastline {{along the edge of the}} downs between Kynance Cove and Mullion Cove consists of high dramatic sheer cliffs with the exception of a deep <b>narrow</b> cleft <b>cut</b> into the Downs at Gew-graze, also known as Soapy Cove. This cove is named after Soapstone (or talc), a type of serpentine rock found around the cove. Talc was quarried here in the 18th century.|$|R

60|$|About twenty-two {{miles from}} Exeter {{we go to}} Totnes, on the River Dart. This {{is a very good}} town, of some trade; but has more gentlemen in it than tradesmen of note. They have a very fine stone bridge here over the river, which, being within seven or eight miles of the sea, is very large; and the tide flows ten or twelve feet at the bridge. Here we had the {{diversion}} of seeing them catch fish with the assistance of a dog. The case is this:--On {{the south side of the}} river, and on a slip, or <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> or channel made on purpose for a mill, there stands a corn-mill; the mill-tail, or floor for the water below the wheels, is wharfed up on either side with stone above high-water mark, and for above twenty or thirty feet in length below it on that part of the river towards the sea; at the end of this wharfing is a grating of wood, the cross-bars of which stand bearing inward, sharp at the end, and pointing inward towards one another, as the wires of a mouse-trap.|$|E
60|$|Even in {{descending}} to the boat, this trained and cool young seaman betrayed no haste. His movements were quick, {{and everything was}} done with readiness and knowledge certainly, but no confusion or trepidation occasioned {{the loss of a}} moment. He hoisted the sail, brought down the tack, and then descended beneath the roof, having first hauled in the painter, and given the boat a long and vigorous shove, to force it {{from the side of the}} vessel. By this last expedient he at once placed thirty feet of water between the boat and the Montauk, a space that the Arabs had no means of overcoming. As soon as he was beneath the roof the sheet was hauled in, and Paul seized the tiller; which had been made, by means of a <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> in the boards, to play in one of the shutters. Mr. Sharp took a position in the bows, where he could see the sands and channels through the crevices, directing the other how to steer; and just as a shout announced the arrival of the raft at the other side of the ship, the flap of their sail gave those in the boat the welcome intelligence that they had got so far from her cover as to feel the force of the wind.|$|E
60|$|When {{he arrived}} at Boston it was very late. This was owing to a {{detention}} which {{took place on the}} road through a somewhat singular cause. It seems that there was {{in one part of the}} road a very <b>narrow</b> <b>cut,</b> through a rocky hill, and the company were attempting to widen it in order to make a double track. They had accordingly been blasting the rocks on one side of the cut, and having fired a very heavy charge just before the train that Stuyvesant was in came along, an immense mass of rocks had fallen down into the cut and covered the track so that the train could not get by. The workman had accordingly sent a man along with a red flag to stop the train when it should come, and in the mean time they went to work with an enormous crane, which was set up on the rocks above, to hoist the stones off from the track, and swing them out of the way. A great many of the passengers got out and went forward when the train stopped, in order to see this operation; and Stuyvesant felt himself authorized by Beechnut's rule to go with them. It took more than half an hour to raise and remove the rocks so as to clear the track, and Stuyvesant had a very pleasant time in watching the operation, and in listening to the remarks of the men who were standing around.|$|E
5000|$|Titus Canyon is a deep, <b>narrow</b> gorge <b>cut</b> {{into the}} steep {{face of the}} Grapevine Mountains of the Mojave Desert, within Death Valley National Park in southeastern California and southwestern Nevada.

25|$|What is now Virginia Key was the {{southern}} end of a barrier island that extended from the New River inlet in Fort Lauderdale to just north of Key Biscayne. Early accounts by Spanish explorers indicated the existence of one or more inlets somewhere on the long spit of land enclosing the northern end of Biscayne Bay, but such inlets open and close over time. At the beginning of the 19th century, there was no inlet through the barrier island between the New River Inlet and Bear Cut, at the northern end of Key Biscayne. Hurricanes in 1835 and 1838 opened a new inlet, <b>Narrows</b> <b>Cut</b> (now known as Norris Cut), separating Virginia Key from what is now Fisher Island {{at the south end of}} Miami Beach.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha! Ha!' said Mowgli, on his back. 'Now thou knowest!' and {{the torrent}} of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the ravine just as {{boulders}} {{go down in}} flood-time; the weaker buffaloes being shouldered out {{to the sides of}} the ravine where they tore through the creepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand. Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up and lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of escape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on, heavy with his dinner and drink, willing to do anything rather than fight. The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing till the <b>narrow</b> <b>cut</b> rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot of the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their calves), and then Rama tripped, and stumbled, and went on again over something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the plain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and slipped off Rama's neck, laying about right and left with his stick.|$|E
