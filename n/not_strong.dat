5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Despite the modifications, it was {{realized}} that the walls of Valletta were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to withstand a long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of Floriana developed in the area between the Floriana Lines and the Valletta Land Front, {{and it is now}} a town in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike {{because of low}} pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger {{and the price of}} uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks because he thought they were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> supporters.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward {{to reinforce the}} 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough {{to break through the}} Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to form their own defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to break human skin.|$|E
5|$|On the airplane, Jack jokingly tells {{a flight}} {{attendant}} named Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) that his alcoholic drink is <b>not</b> <b>strong,</b> and {{she gives him a}} stronger one. Charlie runs by while being called after by flight attendants before turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.|$|E

5|$|Throughout October, {{the media}} {{emphasized}} the lead Johnson had over Goldwater, stating that Goldwater had {{little chance of}} winning the election. This negative coverage of the campaign caused many independent voters, who were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> supporters of either candidate, not to vote, for they believed {{the result of the}} election had been already determined.|$|E
5|$|Under Venetian rule, a small harbour {{was built}} in Rethymno, which became the third most {{important}} city on Crete after Heraklion and Chania. On 8 April 1540, a line of fortifications began to be built around the city. The walls were designed by the architect Michele Sanmicheli, and were completed in around 1570. These fortifications were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to withstand a large assault, and when Uluç Ali Reis attacked in 1571, the Ottomans captured and sacked the city.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were well designed, they were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to withstand a heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|By 1913 Silvester was {{suffering}} from continual poor health. He resigned his position at the tabernacle on medical advice in January 1914, and intended to resign his parliamentary seat. On a speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at Yale University, and then took the ferry to Toronto; as it entered the harbour, he collapsed and died, aged 49; Horne was aged seven at the time. From September that year Horne attended St George's School, Harpenden as a boarder—the seventh of the Horne children to attend the school. Although he was <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> academically, he developed into a good sportsman, representing the school in rugby and cricket, and during the summer holidays {{took part in the}} Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at Queen's Club; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future Wimbledon finalist Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|By then, Reitz had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} law, and he continued his studies at South African College, reading law with professor F.S. Watermeyer. The latter's death only months after Reitz started working with him, made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London, at the Inner Temple. It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son to return to the farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was <b>not</b> <b>strong.</b> However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became interested in politics, and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> enough to dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E
5|$|Evidence against Croitoru and Gravelle was {{presented}} {{over the course}} of eight weeks in 2006, but the judge stated that the case against the two accused was <b>not</b> <b>strong.</b> Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant withdrew the charges on June 12, 2006. Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 for court costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to the charges of extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are <b>not</b> <b>strong,</b> and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E
