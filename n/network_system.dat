5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the <b>network</b> <b>system.</b> The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E

30|$|In the {{previous}} sections, we {{have investigated the}} particle filtering methods and state estimation for <b>networked</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively. In the cases where nonlinear systems or non-Gaussian PDFs are addressed, particle filtering becomes a more suitable choice. The applications of PF to <b>networked</b> <b>systems,</b> however, {{have given rise to}} some new challenges. This is mainly because in particle filtering methods, a large amount of particles are required to represent the posterior PDF, which implies a huge communication burden if local information is exchanged among nodes. One major concern of particle filtering for <b>networked</b> <b>systems</b> is, therefore, how to achieve an affordable communication cost while maintaining an acceptable accuracy. On the other hand, the network-induced phenomena should also be addressed when PF is applied to <b>networked</b> <b>systems.</b> In this section, we will discuss the applications of PF algorithms to the filtering problems of <b>networked</b> <b>systems,</b> highlighting how the network-induced phenomena are treated by particle filters and how, in <b>networked</b> <b>systems,</b> local particle filters work coordinately to accomplish the state estimation task with an affordable communication cost.|$|R

40|$|This {{self-contained}} book, {{written by}} leading experts, offers a cutting-edge, in-depth {{overview of the}} filtering and control of wireless <b>networked</b> <b>systems.</b> It addresses the energy constraint and filter/controller gain variation problems, and presents both the centralized and the distributed solutions. The first two chapters provide an introduction to <b>networked</b> control <b>systems</b> and basic information on system analysis. Chapters (3 – 6) then discuss the centralized filtering of wireless <b>networked</b> <b>systems,</b> presenting different approaches to deal with energy efficiency and filter/controller gain variation problems. The next part (chapters 7 – 10) explores the distributed filtering of wireless <b>networked</b> <b>systems,</b> addressing the main problems of energy constraint and filter gain variation. The final part (chapters 11 – 14) focuses on the distributed control of wireless <b>networked</b> <b>systems.</b> <In view of the rapid deployment and development of wireless <b>networked</b> <b>systems</b> for communication and control applications, the book represents a timely contribution and provides valuable insights, useful methods and effective algorithms for the analysis and design of wireless <b>networked</b> control <b>systems.</b> It is a valuable resource for researchers in the control and communication communities...|$|R

State estimation for <b>networked</b> <b>systems</b> are studied in Sect. 3, where existing filtering algorithms addressing network-induced phenomena are discussed and distributed filtering methods are briefly reviewed. In Sect. 4, the applications of particle filtering methods to the state estimation of <b>networked</b> <b>systems</b> are investigated. Particle filtering under network-induced phenomena and particle filtering for <b>networked</b> <b>systems</b> are reviewed, respectively. Conclusions and future research topics are presented in Sect. 5.|$|R
