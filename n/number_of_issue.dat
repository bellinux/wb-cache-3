After being appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2004, he was defeated by the Judge Michael Gableman in the April 1, 2008 elections. Butler was the first sitting Wisconsin Supreme Court justice to be defeated in a reelection campaign since 1967. The Wall Street Journal argued this loss stemmed from opinions he wrote in medical malpractice, search and seizure and product liability cases. Business groups, including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (WMC), paid for an unprecedented <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> ads in this campaign cycle, although the Butler campaign outspent Gableman's by several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{evolving}} software {{systems are}} often managed using an issue repository. This repository {{may contribute to}} information overload in an organization, {{but it may also}} help navigating the software system. Software developers spend much effort on issue triage, a task in which the mere <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> reports becomes a significant challenge. One specific difficulty is to determine whether a newly submitted issue report is a duplicate of an issue previously reported, if it contains complementary information related to a known issue, or if the issue report addresses something that has not been observed before. However, the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> reports may also be used to help a developer to navigate the software development project to find related software artifacts, required both to understand the issue itself, and to analyze the impact of a possible issue resolution. This chapter presents recommendation systems that use information in issue repositories to support these two challenges, by supporting either duplicate detection of issue reports or navigation of artifacts in evolving software systems...|$|E

For the sake of simplicity, we study only the first rejection, the first early backout, the first late backout, and the first reopening of an issue report. Therefore, we do not measure directly the number of patches that were rejected; instead, we measure the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> reports that had at least one patch rejected.|$|E

40|$|A software-extended {{architecture}} (SEA) enhances {{a hardware}} architecture {{by placing a}} high-performance dynamic instruction-set translator between the application binary and the processor, improving processor utilization and enabling new functionality with no changes to either the processor or the binaries. Our prototype implementation of a software-extended Alpha 21164 can provide new system functionality while adding only 1 %- 30 % to the running time of an application. Using this prototype, we have implemented software simultaneous multithreading (SSMT), a new software technique for allowing programs to make greater use of the processor pipeline. SSMT merges instruction streams from independent processes, {{in order to increase}} instruction-level parallelism. Experiments with SSMT on the software-extended Alpha 21164 show that processor throughput can be improved by up to 30 % on real programs, despite the small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> slots on this processor...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm that allocates registers optimally for straight-line code {{running on a}} generic multi-issue computer. On such a machine, an optimal register allocation is one that minimizes the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> slots that the code requires. Optimal spill selection and load/store placement are used to minimize the number of additional issue slots needed, given a schedule for the non-memory reference instructions and a fixed number of available physical registers. The generic multi-issue machine model closely models the operation of vector and VLIW processors, and could be extended to model super-scalar processors. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to search the state space of feasible register allocations; implicit and explicit state pruning are {{used to make the}} problem tractable without sacrificing optimality. The optimal allocation produced by the algorithm for a substantial example is presented. 1 Introduction High performance processors are increasingly memory [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis {{presents the results}} of a study conducted to determine the resource impact of raising the delinquent debt threshold used to expand background investigations on security clearances from $ 500 to $ 2000. Statistical analysis was used to investigate the effects of this change in policy on the frequency of financial issue case security clearance investigations. The results of the analysis indicate that a reduction did occur in the number of financial related issue cases {{as a percentage of the}} total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> cases after the threshold change had taken place. As a result, resources are saved as case controllers, investigators, adjudicators, administrators, and secretarial staff spend less time, effort, and related travel on financial related issue cases. Additional savings are realized as defense contractor employees spend less time on menial tasks waiting for security clearances to be approved. Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserv...|$|E
40|$|Software data {{prefetching}} is {{a well-known}} technique to improve the performance of programs that suffer many cache misses at several levels of memory hierarchy. However, it has significant overhead in terms of increased code size, additional instructions, and possibly increased memory bus traffic due to redundant prefetches. This paper presents two novel methods to reduce the overhead of software data prefetching and improve the program performance by optimized prefetch scheduling. These methods exploit the availability of rotating registers and predication in architectures such as the Itanium architecture. The methods (1) minimize redundant prefetches, (2) reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> slots needed for prefetch instructions, and (3) avoid branch mispredict penalties [...] all with minimal code size increase. Compared to traditional data prefetching techniques, these methods (i) do not require loop unrolling, (ii) do not require predicate computations and (iii) require fewer machine resources. One of these methods has been implemented in the Intel Production processor. This technique is compared with traditional approaches for software prefetching and experimental results are presented based on the floating-point benchmark suite of CPU 2000...|$|E

40|$|Achieving a {{sustainable}} energy future requires {{a revolution in}} the energy system. At the heart of such a transformation lies strong and coherent governance at all political levels, including the global level. While the need for global governance is taken for granted in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> areas such as health, peacekeeping and environment, pursuit of global energy governance has been almost a taboo in political and foreign policy circles and has also had limited attention in the literature. In this paper, we explore how the viewing of {{a sustainable}} energy system as a global public good could serve as one approach to reducing the sensitivity towards global energy governance. The global public good concept together with the principle of subsidiarity is applied as a framework for understanding the role that the international community could play in, and the key ingredients for, global energy governance. Using two examples of international energy efficiency and renewable energy policy, we identify some types of international collaboration measures that would be both efficient and necessary to support a sustainable energy system...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we focus on}} {{power-aware}} solutions for the issue queue in an out-of-order superscalar processor. We propose two different schemes. Our first approach partitions the issue queue into FIFOs such that only the instructions {{at the head of}} each FIFO may request to issue. We then dynamically monitor the FIFO usage and disable FI-FOs that are not being efficiently used. In our second approach we also use a FIFO scheme, but dynamically vary the number and size of each FIFO simultaneously {{while at the same time}} keeping the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> queue entries constant. We analyze both approaches and compare them in terms of the performance and power reduction. We find that although the first scheme of completely disabling issue queue entries is more straight-forward to implement, it may not be the best option, particularly for floating point applications. Our best experimental result shows an average power saving of 27. 3 % in the issue queue with a performance degradation of only 2. 7 %. 1...|$|E
40|$|Bug {{localization}} {{refers to}} the task of automatically processing bug reports to locate source code files that are responsible for the bugs. Many bug localization techniques have been proposed in the literature. These techniques are often evaluated on issue reports that are marked as bugs by their reporters in issue tracking systems. However, recent findings by Herzig et al. find that a substantial <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> reports marked as bugs, are not bugs but other kinds of issues like refactorings, request for enhancement, documentation changes, test case creation, and so on. Herzig et al. report that these misclassifications affect bug prediction, namely the task of predicting which files are likely to be buggy in the future. In this work, we investigate whether these misclassifications also affect bug localization. To do so, we analyze issue reports that have been manually categorized by Herzig et al. and apply a bug localization technique to recover a ranked list of candidate buggy files for each issue report. We then evaluate whether the quality of ranked lists of reports reported as bugs is {{the same as that of}} real bug reports. Our findings shed light that there is a need for additional cleaning steps to be performed on issue reports before they are used to evaluate bug localization techniques...|$|E
