5|$|Wigner was {{disappointed}} that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> construction. He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it {{by the head of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem. Without the additional tubes, the reactor could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power; but this would have set the project back a year. During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site. Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.|$|E

25|$|The {{tapestry}} collection {{includes a}} fragment of the Cloth of St Gereon, the oldest known surviving European tapestry. A highlight of the collection is the four Devonshire Hunting Tapestries, very rare 15th-century tapestries, woven in the Netherlands, depicting the hunting of various animals; <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> age but their size make these unique. Both of the major English centres of tapestry weaving of the 16th and 17th centuries respectively, Sheldon & Mortlake are represented in the collection by several examples. Also included are tapestries from John Vanderbank's workshop which was the leading English tapestry manufactory in the late 17th century and early 18th century. Some of the finest tapestries are examples from the Gobelins workshop, including a set of 'Jason and the Argonauts' dating from the 1750s. Other continental centres of tapestry weaving with work in the collection include Brussels, Tournai, Beauvais, Strasbourg and Florence.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

He noted progressive aspects to the album's style, but felt that the band {{were still in the}} process of growth. Terada felt that the reason why many people saw the band as being a successor to Supercar and Quruli was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> [...] "nostalgic soundwork": a mix of kayō and speedy inorganic four on the floor arrangements, but simply Yamaguchi's [...] "comfortable" [...] vocals.|$|E

According to the BBC documentary series Boss Woman, she rarely stays at parties for more than 20minutes at a time and goes to bed by 10:15 every night. She exerts a great deal of control over the magazine's visual content. Since her first days as editor, she has required that photographers not begin until she has approved Polaroids of the setup and clothing.

500|$|Wigner {{participated in}} a meeting with Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein that {{resulted}} in the Einstein-Szilard letter, which prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate the Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. Wigner was afraid that the German nuclear weapon project would develop an atomic bomb first. During the Manhattan Project, he led a team whose task was to design nuclear reactors to convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium. [...] At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. Wigner was disappointed that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> construction. He became Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in early 1946, but became frustrated with bureaucratic interference by the Atomic Energy Commission, and returned to Princeton.|$|E
500|$|Under one person, one vote, each country's {{number of}} votes is {{directly}} proportional to its population. This {{would be similar to}} how U.S. states are represented in the United States House of Representatives. In The Future of Sovereignty – Rethinking a Key Concept of International Relations, Hasenclever et al. sum up {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this system: [...] "In a strict meaning of democracy based on individuals as subjects, every person's vote would have to have exactly the same weight. None of the known proposals, however, supports such a strict interpretation, because the inequality among the states' voting powers would be extreme with only four countries – China, India, the United States and the former USSR – disposing of an absolute majority." [...] A way to resolve the disparity in population between countries would be to apportion representation to regions instead of nations. This would, for example, place Suriname and Brazil, the least and most populated South American countries, in a single South American voting bloc of approximately 400 million people, preserving the one person, one vote system while eliminating extreme disparities in population. This approach, however, is dependent upon elected officials being entrusted to represent said regions and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> home countries, and could potentially leave some less populated countries with no representatives from their country if they are either outvoted by people in more populated countries in their assigned region or if the people in less populated countries vote in large numbers for candidates or political parties from other countries.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{met with}} [...] "a crackle of {{favorable}} reviews in major papers". The New Republic hailed it as [...] "an exceptional work", both [...] "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as [...] "a superb character writer", and the Denver Post {{called her a}} [...] "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's [...] "deft" [...] handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, The Guardian complaining that [...] "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that [...] "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed" [...] (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone {{gets in the way}} of plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel [...] "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader [...] "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that [...] "sex plays virtually no role in the story... one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The New Statesman reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as [...] "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen– or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." [...] However, she also criticised the book: [...] "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points. Maguire wrote in the New York Times: ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed's ethical code {{is known}} as [...] "The Honor Principle". First {{introduced}} as an agreement to promote ethical academic behavior with the explicit end of relieving the faculty of policing student behavior, the Honor Principle was extended to cover all aspects of student life. While inspired by traditional honor systems, Reed's Honor Principle differs from these {{in that it is}} a guide for ethical standards themselves and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> enforcement. Under the Honor Principle, there are no codified rules governing behavior. Rather, the onus is on students individually and as a community to define which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.|$|E
2500|$|The Rosicrucian {{belief in}} being {{specially}} {{chosen for the}} ability to communicate with angels or spirits is echoed in Newton's prophetic beliefs. [...] Additionally, the Rosicrucians proclaimed {{to have the ability to}} live forever through the use of the elixir vitae and the ability to produce limitless amounts of time and gold from the use of the Philosopher's Stone, which they claimed to have in their possession. [...] Like Newton, the Rosicrucians were deeply religious, avowedly Christian, anti-Catholic, and highly politicised. [...] Isaac Newton would have a deep interest in <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> alchemical pursuits, but also their belief in esoteric truths of the ancient past and the belief in enlightened individuals with the ability to gain insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.|$|E

2500|$|Mahathir {{continued}} to attract controversy in retirement for remarks on international affairs. He is a strident critic of Israel, {{to the point}} where in 2012 he stated: [...] "I am glad to be labeled antisemitic [...] How can I be otherwise, when the Jews who so often talk of the horrors they suffered during the Holocaust show the same Nazi cruelty and hard-heartedness towards <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> enemies but even towards their allies should any try to stop the senseless killing of their Palestinian enemies." [...] Mahathir established the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission to investigate the activities of the United States, Israel and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.

2500|$|Historian William C.

They prayed to the same deity, spoke the same language, shared the same ancestry, sang the same songs. National triumphs and catastrophes were shared by both." [...] He stated that culture was not the cause of the war, but rather, slavery was: [...] "For all the myths they would create to the contrary, the only significant and defining difference between them was slavery, where it existed and where it did not, for by 1804 it had virtually ceased to exist north of Maryland. Slavery demarked <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> labor and economic situations, but power itself in the new republic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Democratic {{consultants}} and strategists also evaluated {{the importance and}} effectiveness of the speech.

[...] She called the speech [...] "incredibly honest and personal" [...] and argued that Obama [...] "changed {{the terms of the}} debate." [...] Donna Brazile—former manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign—said that Obama {{was one of the few}} politicians who [...] "could weave <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>their</b> own personal history with American history but [...] themselves up as an example of the contradictions in this country." [...] According to Brazile, Obama had reclaimed the [...] "high road", but the question remained as to whether that road would [...] "lead to the White House or back to the United States Senate." [...] Unaffiliated Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons called it [...] "an incredibly honest speech" [...] and [...] "a brave thing to do politically."
