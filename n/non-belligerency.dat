500|$|In {{a private}} conference with President Grant, Fish agreed {{to support the}} Santo Domingo {{annexation}} if President Grant sent Congress a <b>non-belligerency</b> statement not {{to get involved with}} the Cuban rebellion against Spain. Charles Sumner, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was against the treaty, believing that Santo Domingo needed to remain independent, and that racism against U.S. black citizens in the South needed to be dealt with in the continental United States. Sumner believed that blacks on Santo Domingo did not share Anglo-American values. [...] On January 10, 1870 Grant submitted the Santo Domingo treaty to the United States Senate. Fish believed Senators would vote for annexation only if statehood was withdrawn; however, President Grant refused this option. [...] The Senate took its time deliberating, and finally rejected the treaty on June 30, 1870. [...] Eighteen Senators led by Charles Sumner defeated the treaty. Pres. Grant, angered at Sumner's refusal to support the treaty, fired Sumner's friend J. Lothrop Motley, Grant's ambassador to England, for disregarding Fish's instructions regarding the Alabama Claims. Grant believed that Sumner had in January 1870 stated his support for the Santo Domingo treaty. Sumner was then deprived of his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1871 by Grant's allies in the Senate.|$|E

50|$|Japan was {{politically}} disturbed {{both from the}} security threat to Japan because of the initial defeat of South Korea and from left-wing activities in support of North Korea and aiming {{to bring about a}} communist revolution in Japan. Additionally, as American occupation armies were dispatched to Korean peninsula, Japan's security became problematic. Under United States guidance, Japan established Reserved Police, later the Japan Self-Defense Forces (自衛隊). The signing of the Treaty of Peace with Japan (日本国との平和条約; popularly known as the Treaty of San Francisco) was also hastened to return Japan back into international communities. In the eyes of some American policy makers, the <b>non-belligerency</b> clause in the Constitution was already being considered a “mistake” by 1953.|$|E
50|$|The Deir Yassin {{massacre}} {{was carried}} out in a village west of Jerusalem that had signed a <b>non-belligerency</b> pact with its Jewish neighbors and the Haganah, and repeatedly had barred entry to foreign irregulars. On 9 April approximately 120 Irgun and Lehi members began an operation to capture the village. During the operation, the villagers fiercely resisted the attack, and a battle broke out. In the end, the Irgun and Lehi forces advanced gradually through house-to-house fighting. The village was only taken after the Irgun began systematically dynamiting houses, and after a Palmach unit intervened and employed mortar fire to silence the villagers' sniper positions. The operation resulted in five Jewish fighters dead and 40 injured. Some 100 to 120 villagers were also killed.|$|E
5000|$|According to a NATO {{diplomatic}} {{source in}} August 2009 some key officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. [...] "Turkey, Romania, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic states" [...] {{are among the}} members backing a fast track for Azerbaijan's NATO membership. While President Ilham Aliyev has generally supported <b>non-belligerency</b> (though not neutrality due to the unresolved conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh) since his rise to power in 2003, Azerbaijan has hosted NATO military exercises and high-profile meetings in 2009. The unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh would present a major roadblock to membership. Azerbaijan made its policy of not being aligned with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 2011.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1947, the residents of Zarnuqa considered entering into a <b>non-belligerency</b> pact with Rehovot but apparently it was not formalized. In April 1948, Arab irregulars moved into the village. The Dar Shurbaji clan {{was in favor of}} the village surrendering its weapons and accept protection by Haganah but others objected. Women, children and the elderly were evacuated to the nearby village of Yibna, leaving the Shurbajis and several dozen armed men from other clans. Zarnuqa was depopulated on 27-28 May by the Givati Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. One account in Al HaMishmar described how a soldier fired with a Sten gun at three people (one old man, old woman and a child) and how the villagers were taken out from the houses and had to stay in the sun, in hunger and thirst, until they surrendered the weapons they claimed they did not have. They were then expelled towards Yibna. In total, six died and 22 were taken prisoners. The day after, the inhabitants returned and recounted that the Yibna villagers saw them as traitors. The Zarnuqa villagers saw their village being ransacked by Jewish soldiers and nearby settlers. They were expelled again and the houses were demolished the month after.|$|E

5000|$|The Civil War {{began on}} 30 November 1947. In December 1947 a village notable Tawfiq Kadkuda {{approached}} local Jews {{in an effort}} to establish a <b>non-belligerency</b> agreement. The 31 January 1948 Stern Gang attack on a bus leaving Qisarya, killed 2 and injuring 6 people, precipitated an evacuation of most of the population, who fled to nearby al-Tantura. The Haganah then occupied the village because the land was owned by Palestine Jewish Colonization Association, but, fearing that the British would force them to leave, decided to demolish the houses. This was done on February 19-20, after the remaining residents were expelled and the houses were looted. According to Benny Morris, the expulsion of the population {{had more to do with}} illegal Jewish immigration than the ongoing civil war. In the same month the 'Arab al Sufsafi and Saidun Bedouin, who inhabited the dunes between Qisarya and Pardes left the area. Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village remains in 1992: [...] "Most of the houses have been demolished. The site has been excavated in recent years, largely by Italian, American, and Israeli teams, and turned into a tourist area. Most of the few remaining houses are now restaurants, and the village mosque has been converted into a bar." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Franco {{government}} of Spain {{had risen to}} power as a result to a significant degree of Italian and German intervention and support. Spain, which was suffering {{the aftermath of the}} recently finished Spanish Civil War, did not have the resources to join the war on its own, and Franco and Hitler did not achieve an agreement about the terms of the Spanish participation. Despite its <b>non-belligerency,</b> Spain sent volunteers to fight alongside Germans against the Soviet Union {{in the form of the}} Blue Division. As the Allies emerged as possible victors, the regime became more neutral, at least in theory, finally declaring its neutrality in July 1943 although the complete removal of Spanish troops from Eastern Front was not completed until March 1944. Although it sought to avoid entering the war, Spain did make plans for defence of the country. Initially, the mass of the Spanish army was stationed in southern Spain in case of an Allied attack from Gibraltar during 1940 and 1941. However, Franco ordered the divisions to gradually redeploy in the mountains along the French border in case of a possible German invasion of Spain as Axis interest in Gibraltar grew. By the time it became clear that the Allies were gaining the upper hand in the conflict, Franco had amassed all his troops on the French border and received personal assurances from the leaders of Allied countries that they did not wish to invade Spain.|$|E
5000|$|British strategists {{regarded}} Portuguese <b>non-belligerency</b> as [...] "essential to keep Spain {{from entering}} the war {{on the side of}} the Axis". Britain recognised Salazar's important role on 15 May 1940, when Douglas Veale, Registrar of the University of Oxford, informed him that the University's Hebdomadal Council had [...] "unanimously decided at its meeting last Monday, to invite you Salazar to accept the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law". The same Life magazine article of July 1940 that praised Salazar's work on behalf of the Portuguese nation commented, [...] "this year, for the first time in centuries, Portugal is important to America. It is the funnel through which to pour all the exchanges - of people and messages and diplomacy - between America and Europe. The war, by cutting the lines of intercourse to Northern Europe, has made Portugal what might say geography intended - not a faraway corner of Europe but its front door." [...] In September 1940, Winston Churchill wrote to Salazar to congratulate him for his policy of keeping Portugal out of the war, avowing that [...] "as so often before during the many centuries of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, British and Portuguese interests are identical on this vital question." [...] Sir Samuel Hoare, the British Ambassador in Madrid from 1940 to 1944, recognised Salazar's crucial role in keeping Iberia neutral during World War II, and lauded him for it. Hoare averred that [...] "Salazar detested Hitler and all his works" [...] and that his corporative state was fundamentally different from a Nazi or fascist state, with Salazar never leaving a doubt of his desire for a Nazi defeat. Historian Carlton Hayes, a pioneering specialist on the study of nationalism, was the American Ambassador in Spain during the war. He met Salazar in person and also praised him, expressing a similar opinion to Hoare's in his book Wartime Mission in Spain. In November 1943, the British Ambassador in Lisbon, Sir Ronald Campbell, wrote, paraphrasing Salazar, that [...] "strict neutrality was the price the allies paid for strategic benefits accruing from Portugal's neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of being strict had been more benevolent in our favour Spain would inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of Germany. If this had happened the Peninsula would have been occupied and then North Africa, with the result that the whole course of the war would have been altered to the advantage of the Axis." ...|$|E

40|$|As war approached, Kemalist Turkey sought safety through {{collective}} security arrangements. Despite her proclamation of <b>non-belligerency</b> in 1939, she remained {{during the first}} phase of the world conflict a willing ally of Britain and France. In the second period she became increasingly cautious, and in the third (that of the Axis zenith) she embraced neutrality. From early in 1943 until the declaration of war, she returned to a pro-Allied partiality, although this was much complicated by Russian presence among the Allies. Indeed, throughout the war her main fear was of Soviet imperialism...|$|E
40|$|Further {{expanding}} {{an analysis}} previously {{made by the}} same author, this essay addresses the nine months of Mussolini’s «non-belligerency» and adds new evidence on the factors that inflenced Mussolini’s decision to join Hitler {{in the war on}} 10 June 1940. In particular, the article provides an insight into the efforts made by Mussolini to differentiate his position from that of Germany and to validate himself as a reliable mediator for peace negotiations. Having failed to achieve this during the fist half of the <b>non-belligerency,</b> Mussolini apparently reverted to a policy of solidarity with Berlin. Then, as defeat loomed for the Allies, Mussolini’s pressure increased along with German successes until he thought of the declaration of war as a last resort to embolden the peacemakers in Paris and London and to bring them to the peace table to save what remained of the European balance...|$|E
40|$|Peace is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} state of <b>non-belligerency</b> between states. This means that it is defined negatively as the absence of war. So is peace just a pause between two wars? In French, the term is significant: peace is considered a slice of life between two conflicts. Thus, we speak of the early 20 th century as the «Belle Époque» {{and we talk about}} the «interwar period», which implies the failure of peace. Twenty {{years after the end of}} the Great War, another, even more terrible conflict began. At the same time, an inversion of values took place in European minds that along with the horrors of war made it very difficult for any Franco-German reconciliation to take place. We would have to wait for the end of the Second World War and its consequences to speak of peace as a realistic utopia. This volume brings together a number of articles in Portuguese, French and English – on topics such as «thinking peace», intellectuals and peace, federalism and universalism, religiosity and secularism, women and peace, and campaigns and mobility – from many prestigious experts and young researchers. They bring new ways of thinking and interdisciplinary perspectives, and provide an attentive, critical reading of the core subject. This volume proposes to substantiate concepts, projects, movements, speeches, images and representations, and to deepen the knowledge of the key personalities who thought about peace between 1849 and 1939...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{historian}} Nils Orvik, the Great War witnessed {{the decline of}} neutrality as a valuable foreign policy for small European states. The Netherlands was no exception and faced {{the daunting task of}} upholding its neutrality whilst resisting pressure from the two belligerent powers flanking the country (Germany and Britain). Neutrality entailed more than maintaining friendly relations with warring states, it also involved upholding strict standards of impartiality and territorial integrity. The roles played by the armed forces to this end were vital. The Dutch anned forces mobilised with the purpose of protecting neutrality and, if that proved impossible, defending against invasion. It quickly became apparent that the two aims were mutually exclusive - neutrality required dispersion of troops, while defence asked for concentration. The war years only heightened the inadequacies of the armed forces to fulfil both tasks, as they were unable to maintain techonological parity with warring states. By 1918, the emphasis for the military was on maintaining neutrality, in all its multifarious forms. By that time, its tasks extended well beyond the expectations of 1914, focusing not only on defence and territorial integrity, but also on policing smuggling, interning foreign soldiers, administering municipal affairs in the "state of war" and "siege", and helping to preserve public order. The Netherlands managed to stay neutral during the war, but mainly due to the wishes of the belligerents, rather than its own actions. Nevertheless, the military's involvement in neutrality matters helped preserve its <b>non-belligerency.</b> By 1918, however, the armed forces were less able to protect neutrality than in 1914 : they were not strong enough to act as a deterrent to invasion; and there were not enough soldiers to meet required neutrality obligations in the face of increasing demands from the belligerents. The Netherlands' saving grace was that, during 1918, neither warring side could afford the resources to wage war on another front. While neutrality was safeguarded, by the signing of the Armistice, it ceased being the attractive foreign policy that it had seemed to be in 1914...|$|E
