40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{equipment}} performance and reliability are decreasing as the storage time increases due to many factors such as humility, temperature, shocks, vibration, radiation and corrosion. To specify these factors and characterize their impacts are therefore important in storage reliability design and maintenance strategy development. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the impact factors which will influence the equipment reliability in a <b>non-operating</b> <b>state</b> and explore the methods to improve the equipment reliability. A case study is implemented with a qualitative approach. The literature related to the impact factors and prognostics method of equipment reliability in a <b>non-operating</b> <b>state,</b> FMEA and PHM has been reviewed for identifying the existing methods {{in order to develop}} new ones. Telephone interviews have been made for collecting valuable information on the case system: one type of the emergency rescue equipment on the HLD- 9 C ship. As the result, the impact factors on the equipment reliability in a <b>non-operating</b> <b>state</b> have been identified, and an integrated prognostics method integrating FMEA and PHM is developed in this thesis. Moreover, the limitations, the recommendations for the administrators and suggestions for further research are provided...|$|E
30|$|A variable-controlling {{approach}} is {{applied in the}} experiment to analyze the effects of each factor on the interactive operation. The first factor is the guidance force (fg) provided by the motors to guide the operator {{to move toward the}} target. Suppose the guidance force of 0  N, 2  N, and 4  N is for conditions a 1, a 2, and a 3 respectively. The second factor is the restoration force (fr) exerted by the motors which drives the haptic device back to the originating pose after operating or in the <b>non-operating</b> <b>state.</b> Suppose the restoration force of 0  N, 2  N, and 4  N is for conditions b 1, b 2, and b 3 respectively. The third is the speed of the virtual avatar which is set at 0.5  cm/s, 1.5  cm/s, and 2.5  cm/s for conditions c 1, c 2, and c 3 respectively.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{the causes of}} death and main cardiovascular complications in adolescents and adults with congenitally malformed hearts. Design: Retrospective review of 102 necropsy reports from a tertiary centre obtained {{over a period of}} 19 years. Methods: The diagnosis, the operated or <b>non-operated</b> <b>state</b> of the main defect, the cause of death, and main complications were related to the age and gender. Other clinically relevant conditions, and identifiable sequels of previous diseases, were also noted. Results: The ages ranged from 15 to 69 years, with a mean of 31. 1 and a median of 28 years, with no difference detected according to the gender. Of the patients, two-thirds had been submitted to at least one cardiac surgery. The mean age of death was significantly higher in non-operated patients (p = 0. 003). The most prevalent cause of death in the whole group was related to recent surgery, found in one-third. From them, two-fifths corresponded to reoperations. Among the others, cardiac failure was the main terminal cause in another third, and the second cause was pulmonary thromboembolism in just over one-fifth, presenting a significant association with histopathological signs of pulmonary hypertension (p = 0. 011). Infection was the cause of death in 7. 8 % of the patients, all previously operated. Acute infective endocarditis was present or was the indication for the recent surgery in one-tenth of the patients, this cohort having a mean age of 27. 8 years. There was a statistically significant association between the occurrence of endocarditis and defects causing low pulmonary blood flow (p = 0. 043). Conclusions: Data derived from necropsies of adults with congenital heart defects can help the multidisciplinary team refine both their diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
