40|$|We {{determine}} theoretically {{the effect}} of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic excitation spectrum of itinerant multi-orbital systems, with specific application to iron-based superconductors. Our microscopic model includes a realistic ten-band kinetic Hamiltonian, atomic spin-orbit coupling, and multi-orbital Hubbard interactions. Our results highlight the remarkable variability of the resulting magnetic anisotropy despite constant spin-orbit coupling. At the same time, the magnetic anisotropy exhibits robust universal behavior upon changes in the bandstructure corresponding to different materials of iron-based superconductors. A natural explanation of the observed universality emerges when considering optimal nesting as a resonance phenomenon. Our theory is also of relevance to other itinerant system with spin-orbit coupling and <b>nesting</b> <b>tendencies</b> in the bandstructure. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|We have {{calculated}} the one-electron susceptibility of hydrated NaxCoO 2 and find strong nesting nearly commensurate with a 2 X 2 superstructure. The nesting involves about 70 % of all electrons at the Fermi level and is robust {{with respect to}} doping. This <b>nesting</b> creates a <b>tendency</b> to a charge density wave compatible with the charge order often seen at x approx 0. 5, which is usually ascribed to electrostatic repulsion of Na ions. In the spin channel, it gives rise to strong spin-fluctuations, which should be important for superconductivity. The superconducting state most compatible with this nesting structure is an odd-gap triplet s-wave state. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in South-Western Wielkopolska, an area of 837 km 2. The area is highly diverse with regard to differences in land surface, the density of the hydrographical network, woodland cover and landuse. Field observations from 1973 to 2005 were conducted when White Stork Ciconia ciconia fledglings were leaving the nest, usually between the 10 th and the 25 th of July. The number of nests (HPa) on the study site fluctuated between 30 and 64. The mean density (StD) amounted to 6. 42 ± 0. 90 pair/ 100 km 2. A significant decline in breeding pairs was noticed, with a simultaneous increase in the mean number of nestlings per breeding pair. The most frequent reason for nestling death were adverse weather and fights for the nest with other storks. During the 33 -year research study great changes were noticed in the location of <b>nests.</b> The <b>tendency</b> to place <b>nests</b> on buildings and thatched buildings was declining. An increasing tendency appeared in the case of nests placed on poles and chimneys. In this paper we also present informa-tion on breeding colony extinction and a preliminary analysis of recovery information about ringed storks.

40|$|Parental {{preferences}} during {{feeding and}} care-giving may select for ornamental traits in young, such as bright coloration. For chicks of coots, there is experimental {{evidence for this}} idea. We examined the hypothesis that bright yellow, orange and red mouths of chicks of songbirds have been favoured by feeding preferences in parents. In a field experiment, the orange–yellow mouths of great tit nestlings were dyed brightly red, and the feeding response of parents recorded. In nest boxes with extra daylight through a window, experimental chicks were on average given twice as much food (biomass) as control chicks (sham dyed). In normal <b>nest</b> boxes, the <b>tendency</b> was similar, but not significant. Thus, at least in good light, great tit parents prefer to feed young with red mouths, a preference for colourfulness that helps explain the evolution of bright gapes in chicks of songbirds (passerine birds) ...|$|R
500|$|Like other amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is gregarious while {{performing}} daily activities, but territorial around its nest. The {{size of the}} territory around the nest is usually around [...] Pairs are extremely cautious near their nest, usually moving in a slow manner when leaving the nest to avoid the attention of predators. Although territorial defense is mostly composed of loud vocalizations there are instances of actual physical combat. Pairs will defend their nest sites against invading couples, sometimes focusing on the location's defense instead of egg-laying. Pairs nesting in areas uninhabited by other parrots will remain mostly silent unless other parrots enter the zone. Some pairs may display moderate territoriality even when not apparently intending to <b>nest,</b> with these <b>tendencies</b> beginning {{in the latter half}} of the breeding season. One hypothesis is that this would occur in young pairs that had still not reached full maturity, serving as [...] "practice territoriality".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sand {{temperatures}} and loggerhead turtle nest temperatures (Caretta caretta) at Mon Repos rookery (Australia) were monitored over the 2005 – 06 and 2006 – 07 nesting seasons and hatchling sex ratios of clutches were estimated using the Constant Temperature Equivalent method. Nest temperatures were {{positively correlated with}} the sand temperature and air temperature in both seasons. Both seasons produced a female-biased sex ratio, especially the 2005 – 06 season, when almost all hatchlings were predicted to be female. Hatch success rate was not affected by nest temperature and averaged 85 %, but hot nests from 2005 – 06 had a reduced emergence success compared with other nests. Daily cyclic temperature fluctuations of 0. 5 – 1. 5 °C were a feature of <b>nests,</b> with a <b>tendency</b> for greater daily amplitude in the 2005 – 06 season when the average daily temperature was hotter. These daily temperature fluctuations increased the constant temperature equivalent temperature by 0. 1 – 0. 5 °C above mean nest temperature during the sex-determining period and resulted in an increased female bias in the estimated hatchling sex ratio...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the ecology of Manx shearwaters on Rhum, with particular emphasis on the influence of predation and other extrinsic factors upon breeding success and population dynamics. Brown rats were not found to be active predators of shearwaters on Rhum. Few rats were present in the shearwater colony during the birds' breeding seasons, but larger numbers scavenged on the remains of shearwater eggs and chicks during the autumn and early winter. Rats are apparently prevented from becoming established in the shearwater colony by food shortage in late winter and by the colony's location within Rhum. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons and great black-backed guils do prey upon shearwaters on Rhum but have an insignificant effect upon the shearwater population. Hatching success in the colony varies markedly from year to year and is significantly negatively correlated with the incidence of heavy rain during the incubation period. This arises from the variation in susceptibility to flooding among <b>nesting</b> burrows. The <b>tendency</b> for individual burrows to flood was quantified and was found to have a significant influence upon the probability of successful breeding. Weights at fledging showed a significant seasonal decline, apparently due to increased difficulty for adults in provisioning chicks late in the season. Heavy fledglings are apparently more likely to survive than light ones so that there is selective advantage in breeding as early as possible. The ultimate and proximate control of timing of laying is discussed. There was evidence of year to year variation in feeding conditions around the colony. Chicks grew more slowly in 1985 than in 1984 and were fed less frequently. The implications of these findings to the population dynamics and conservation of the colony are discussed...|$|R
