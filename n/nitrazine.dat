50|$|<b>Nitrazine</b> or phenaphthazine is a pH {{indicator}} dye {{often used}} in medicine. More sensitive than litmus, <b>nitrazine</b> indicates pH {{in the range of}} 4.5 to 7.5. <b>Nitrazine</b> is usually used as the disodium salt.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nitrazine</b> test: A sterile {{cotton swab}} {{is used to}} collect fluid from the vagina {{and place it on}} <b>nitrazine</b> (phenaphthazine) paper. Amniotic fluid is mildly basic (pH 7.1 - 7.3) {{compared}} to normal vaginal secretions which are acidic (pH 4.5 - 6). Basic fluid, like amniotic fluid, will turn the <b>nitrazine</b> paper from orange to dark blue.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nitrazine</b> strips: {{measures}} pH about 4.5 to 7.5 {{with more}} precision ...|$|E
5000|$|Like amniotic fluid, blood, semen, vaginal infections, [...] antiseptics, basic urine, and {{cervical}} mucus [...] {{also have a}} basic pH and can also turn <b>nitrazine</b> paper blue. Cervical mucus can also make a pattern similar to ferning on a microscope slide, but it is usually patchy [...] and with less branching.|$|E
5000|$|This test {{involves}} {{putting a}} drop of fluid obtained from the vagina onto paper strips containing <b>Nitrazine</b> dye. The strips change color depending on the pH of the fluid. The strips will turn blue if the pH is greater than 6.0. A blue strip means it's more likely the membranes have ruptured.|$|E
50|$|The test is {{fast and}} can be {{performed}} in a doctor's office. A patient must not be receiving antibiotics. At least half a milliliter of feces is collected and a strip of <b>nitrazine</b> paper is dipped in the sample and compared against a color scale. A pH of less than 5.5 indicates an acidic sample.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{the urine}} pH to around 6.5 {{provides}} optimal conditions for dissolution of uric acid stones. Increasing the urine pH to a value higher than 7.0 {{increases the risk}} of calcium phosphate stone formation. Testing the urine periodically with <b>nitrazine</b> paper can help to ensure the urine pH remains in this optimal range. Using this approach, stone dissolution rate can be expected to be around 10 mm of stone radius per month.|$|E
50|$|Amniotic fluid {{normally}} has a pH of 7.0 to 7.5. Because pH in {{the upper}} vagina is normally acidic (pH 3.8-4.5), a vaginal pH test showing a pH of more than 4.5 strengthens a suspicion of rupture of membranes in case of clear vaginal discharge in pregnancy. Other tests for detecting amniotic fluid mainly include <b>nitrazine</b> paper test and fern test. One main test that is performed on amniotic fluid is the L/S ratio test (lecithin/sphigomyelin). This test is used to determine fetal lung maturity. Both lecithin and sphingomyelin are lung surfactants that are present in increasing amounts in the maturing fetus, though past week 33, sphigomyelin levels remain relatively constant. Measuring a ratio of L/S of 2:1 or greater indicates that the fetus can be safely delivered, with functioning lungs.|$|E
40|$|Background: Rupture {{of fetal}} {{membranes}} can occur at any gestational age. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) means rupture of fetal membranes before {{the onset of}} labor. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate and compare the reliability of the vaginal washing fluid urea and creatinine for the diagnosis of PROM and to determine cut-off values. Materials and Methods: A total of 179 pregnant women were recruited. All patients underwent different examinations. These included <b>nitrazine</b> paper test, fern test, amniotic fluid pooling, vaginal washing fluid urea and creatinine sampling. The one group consisted of 126 pregnant women between 14 and 41 weeks of gestation with the complaint of vaginal fluid leakage. Patients who had positive pooling, <b>nitrazine</b> paper test and fern test were considered as confirmed PROM group (group 1). On the other side, patients with pooling (-) and/or <b>nitrazine</b> paper test (-) and/or fern test (-) were taken as suspected unconfirmed PROM cases (group 2). The control group consisted of 53 pregnant women between 14 and 41 weeks of gestation without any complaint or complication. Weconducted one-way ANOVA test on the urea and creatinine measures and post-hoc comparison test. Cut-off value was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Vaginal fluid concentrations of urea and creatinine were significantly different between the three groups (p< 0. 001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were all 100 % in detecting premature rupture of membranes by evaluation of vaginal fluid creatinine concentration with a cut-off value of 0. 45 mg/dl, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that of two markers investigated creatinine has the higher diagnostic power...|$|E
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} To {{evaluate}} diagnostic accuracy studies for rupture of the fetal membranes (ROM). Recent findings Sample sizes of recent studies {{are small and}} studies used different 'silver standard' definitions for ROM. Therefore, reported results should be interpreted with caution. Over the review period the focus of diagnostic studies has been on two bedside test strips: insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) and placental a microglobulin- 1 (PAMG- 1). Bedside tests improve {{the confidence of the}} clinician about their diagnosis. Compared to <b>nitrazine</b> or ferning test alone, IGFBP- 1 and PAMG- 1 are more accurate. However, compared to the conventional testing (combination of history, ferning, <b>nitrazine,</b> speculum and ultrasound) no statistical difference in accuracy was found. In-vitro PAMG- 1 is shown to be superior to IGFPB- 1. Furthermore, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (Axl) seem to be promising new specific biomarkers for diagnosing ROM. Summary IGFBP- 1 and PAMG- 1 are the most commonly used bedside tests for diagnosing ROM.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of placental alpha microglobulin- 1 assay and standard diagnostic methods for detecting rupture of membrane. Study Design. Prospective diagnostic study, between June 2011 to November 2011 at a tertiary centre. Initial evaluation included both the standard diagnostic methods for rupture of membranes and placental alpha microglobulin- 1 immunoassay. The actual rupture of membranes was diagnosed on {{review of the}} medical records after delivery (absence of membrane or a positive pad chart). Main Outcome Measures. Placental alpha microglobulin- 1 immunoassay and standard diagnostic methods for diagnosis of rupture of membrane. Results. A total of 211 patients were recruited. At initial presentation, 187 patients (88. 6 %) had ruptured membranes, while 24 patients (11. 4 %) had intact membranes. Placental alpha microglobulin- 1 immunoassay confirmed rupture of membranes at initial presentation with a sensitivity of 95. 7 % (179 of 187), specificity of 100 % (24 of 24), positive predictive value of 100 % (179 of 179), and negative predictive value of 75. 0 % (24 of 32). By comparison, the conventional standard diagnostic methods had a sensitivity of 78. 1 % (146 of 187), specificity of 100 % (24 of 24), positive predictive value of 100 % (146 of 146), and negative predictive value of 36. 9 % (24 of 65) in diagnosing rupture of membrane. Conclusion. Placental alpha-microglobulin- 1 immunoassay is a rapid and accurate method for confirming the diagnosis of rupture of membrane. It was superior to conventional standard diagnostic methods (pooling, <b>nitrazine,</b> and ferning), the <b>nitrazine</b> test alone or fern test alone...|$|E
40|$|Background: Premature rupture of {{membranes}} (PROM) is {{a common}} obstetric issue during pregnancy which might lead to serious fetal or maternal problems. Therefore, an appropriate diagnosis and management of PROM are of significant importance in patients. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the accuracy of placental alpha microglobuline- 1 (PAMG- 1) test in PROM diagnosis and compare this diagnostic method with other standard tests in diagnosis of PROM. Materials and Methods: In this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, patients with symptoms of membrane rupture in 16 - 39 weeks of gestation were involved. Three tests including Fern, <b>Nitrazine</b> and PAMG- 1 were performed at the same time. Results: PROM was confirmed in 86 patients out of 100. The sensitivity and specificity were respectively 81. 3...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the clinical value of insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) for detection of rupture of membranes {{in women with}} preterm labor and advanced cervical dilatation. Materials and Method: Seventy-eight women with the diagnosis of preterm labor were evaluated, 44 of whom also had complaints of vaginal fluid leakage. IGFBP- 1 level was measured in cervical and vaginal secretions of pregnant women in preterm labor using immunochromatography. Definitive diagnosis of rupture of membranes (ROM) was made using the combination of <b>nitrazine</b> test, amniotic fluid index follow-up, repeated speculum examinations and evaluating the presence of vaginal infections. Results: Thirty-four women (43 %) had the diagnosis of ROM. A positive IGFBP- 1 test was detected in 30 (88. 2 %) women with ROM and 8 (18. 2 %) women without ROM. The sensitivity of IGFBP- 1 detection for the diagnosis of ROM as a single step test {{in the presence of}} preterm labor and advanced cervical dilatation was 88 % while the specificity was 81 %, positive predictive value was 79 % and negative predictive value was 90 %. Discussion: IGFBP- 1 detection in cervical and vaginal secretions is a valuable single step test in the diagnosis of ruptured membranes even in cases with preterm labor and dilated cervices. It can be used as an adjunct to clinical examination...|$|E
40|$|Background: Premature Rupture of Membrane (PROM) {{refers to}} the rupture of fetal {{membranes}} at least 1 hour {{before the onset of}} labor pain. The present study intended to determine the predictive value of maternal serum level of Procalcitonin in the early diagnosis of Chorioamnionitis in mothers with PPROM. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, a total of 48 patients with PPROM were selected as the intended sample size due limited financial resources and in accordance with previous articles in Kosar ward of Motahhari hospital of Urmia city, Iran. Inclusion Criteria were amniotic fluid leak, positive <b>Nitrazine</b> and Fern test, gestational age from 28 to 33 weeks and lack of fetal tachycardia. Exclusion Criteria were chronic and congenital heart disease as well as use of NSAIDs. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19 and descriptive statistics, independent t-test and Pearson test were performed. Results: The present study was conducted on 48 pregnant women and their neonates. About % 39. 6 of mothers was pathologically infected with Chorioamnionitis while % 60. 4 of the patients were not infected with the disease. Moreover, % 68. 8 of the neonates had a five-minute Apgar score of ≥ 7. There was a significant correlation between infection of mothers with histopathologic Chorioamnionitis and neonatal hospitalization in NICU (P< 0. 001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of PCT inflammatory index were % 100, % 79, % 57. 5 and % 100 respectively for the diagnosis of histopathologic Chorioamnionitis. Conclusion: It was found that there was a significant correlation between PCT index at delivery time and histopathologic Chorioamnionitis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The fern {{test was}} first {{described}} by Kardos and Tamasi in 1955 {{as a test}} used to determine rupture of amniotic membranes. The test is done by collection of fluid from the vagina which is then allowed to dry for 10 minutes on a slide. The slide is then inspected with microscopy for evidence of ferning. Accurate determination of rupture of membranes is important due to its significant implications on the management of obstetrical patients. Case: EC is a 23 year old G 1 P 0 at 40 and 3 / 7 weeks gestation who presented to an outpatient facility with a chief complaint of vaginal fluid leaking. Approximately 12 hours prior she had leaked sufficient vaginal fluid to wet her underwear, but not sufficient to soak through her pants. She denied loss of vaginal fluid since then. A speculum exam revealed {{a small amount of}} pooling in the vaginal vault. A sample of this fluid was obtained. Fern test was negative and vaginal pH was 4. 5. Her history was concerning for premature rupture of membranes (PROM) so she was further evaluated with an Amnisure test which was positive. She was subsequently admitted with PROM for induction of labor. Discussion: The fern test has been noted to have a sensitivity as high as 100 %, with most studies reporting a sensitivity at least 90 % or greater. These statistics can be very misleading as most of these studies were done in patients who were in labor. The sensitivity of the fern test is much lower in patients who are not in labor. A more recent study reported a sensitivity of 51 % and a specificity of 70 % for detecting PROM in patients who were not in labor. It was noted that sensitivity was slightly higher and specificity slightly lower for medical students and residents when compared to gynecologists. The sensitivity of the Amnisure test has been reported to be 98 % to 99 % with specificity ranging from 88 % to 100 %. Rupture of membranes has previously been diagnosed either by visualization of fluid leaking from the cervical os or having 2 of the following: vaginal pooling, positive fern test, or positive <b>nitrazine</b> test. Conclusion: The fern test is only one of several methods {{that can be used to}} assess rupture of membranes. Base on this recent study, ferning should not be relied on to rule out rupture of membranes in a nonlaboring patient with clinical history suspicious for PROM...|$|E
