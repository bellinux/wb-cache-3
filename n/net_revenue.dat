5|$|Mughal-e-Azam was {{released}} on 5 August 1960 in 150cinemas across the country, establishing a record for the widest release for a Bollywood film. It became a major commercial success, earning 4million (US$839,000) in the first week, eventually earning a <b>net</b> <b>revenue</b> of 55million (US$11,530,000), and generating a profit of 30million for the producers. Mughal-e-Azam also experienced a long theatrical run, screening to full capacity at the Maratha Mandir for three years. The film thus became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time by surpassing Mother India (1957), and retained this record until Sholay (1975) surpassed its <b>net</b> <b>revenue.</b> In terms of gross revenue, Mughal-e-Azam earned 110million.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms had a {{great impact}} on the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's <b>net</b> <b>revenue</b> from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.|$|E

40|$|Generic {{advertising}} {{of fluid}} milk and cheese represents the principal promotional activity undertaken with the $ 370 {{million per year}} provided by dairy farmers and fluid milk processors. This article describes a stock-flow-feedback simulation model that includes 17 intermediate and final dairy products, short-term and long-term milk supply response and government policies that influence the impacts of generic advertising on <b>net</b> <b>revenues</b> for dairy farmers. Permanent increases in generic advertising expenditures increase <b>net</b> <b>revenues</b> for dairy farmers, with a cumulative net benefit to cost ratio of 2. 8.

The increase in International System Solutions <b>net</b> <b>revenues</b> was largely attributable to growth in the Latin American market, primarily Brazil as several of Verifone's largest Brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products, as well as higher demand for prepaid top-ups, medical and health care System Solutions.

25|$|Yield {{management}} is of especially high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected <b>net</b> <b>revenue</b> contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E
