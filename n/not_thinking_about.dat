25|$|People {{who support}} and found reasons {{to feel good}} over these {{incidents}} are doing more than one wrong thing: first, ignoring the tragedy of killing an innocent group of people. Second, <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the reaction of showing they found satisfaction in the incidents. Third, they are considered accomplices in the crime. Fourth, they are committing a wrongful act not approved by religion.|$|E
25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E

25|$|With {{existing}} behavioral, prosthetic, {{and pharmaceutical}} treatments providing limited {{relief from the}} overt symptoms of stuttering, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support by professionals and people who stutter. Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering. One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the stammer for prolonged periods. Psychoanalysis has claimed success {{in the treatment of}} stuttering. Hypnotherapy has also been explored as a management alternative. Support groups further focus on the fact that stuttering is not a physical impediment but a psychological one.|$|E
25|$|At the March 20, 2015, Real Japan event, Sayama was {{defeated}} by All Japan wrestler Akebono following a splash from the former yokozuna. Afterwards, Sayama began experiencing chest pains, which forced him {{to pull out of}} subsequent matches. After multiple tests, it was determined that Sayama needed to undergo emergency heart surgery, which took place on May 22. Following the surgery, Sayama began suffering from angina, which forced him to pull out of Real Japan's 10th anniversary event on June 11. On June 5, Sayama held a press conference, stating that he was <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> retiring from professional wrestling despite his life being in danger prior to the catheter surgery.

While Mir Mustafa Khan is alive, your government will have to protect the Khan his rights, by treating him personally and with due care; but once he will die his heirs will lose its independence and autonomy, turning in speechless and unfortunate slaves, the fault of the mad and visionary would degenerate Mir Mustafa Khan, the same who pursue only their personal goals in order to meet their lust for power, being a heartless and hardened egoist, as they're <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the sad and desolate future of their offspring, who will betray him to anathema, because they will invite you here and handing the fate of their homeland to unfaithful strangers — rapists turning his people into meaningless plebeians.

500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This {{is the opportunity to}} win another trophy.

500|$|Sam's {{personality}} {{was further}} developed in an episode which saw the character discover {{one of his}} patients to be a male escort. Although {{he was aware that}} the woman accompanying his patient was a client rather than a relative, he persuaded her to sign consent forms on the patient's behalf.

500|$|After her {{win in the}} 2014 Breeders' Cup Distaff aboard Untapable, Napravnik {{announced}} that she was seven weeks pregnant and announced a [...] "retirement" [...] from race riding.

500|$|Cohn and Levithan {{had written}} the novel in {{alternating}} chapters: Cohn writing from Norah's perspective and Levithan writing from Nick's perspective. Cera and Dennings recorded voice-over narration to mimic the first-person perspective from which the novel is written, but the voice-overs {{were not included in}} the final cut of the film. Scafaria says that the differences between the novel and the film were [...] "to make it a little more cinematic". She said that Nick and Norah's parents were written out of the script [...] "to absorb what it's like to be young, [...] you're <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> your parents when you're out all night". In addition to searching for Where's Fluffy?, Sollett felt that the film needed a second MacGuffin to propel the story forwards, so Norah's best friend Caroline got drunk and then lost, giving Nick and Norah an additional objective.|$|E
500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. This time, I {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just give me something where you're <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> anything.' By using it in context, the audience will read an emotion into it." ...|$|E
500|$|Buemi {{believed}} {{that the increase in}} competition for the championship's third season meant he was unable to focus on emulating his triumph from the previous season, saying that while he was <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> clinching the title he wanted to win as many races as he could. Lucas di Grassi, who finished second to Buemi in the drivers' championship the previous season, stated that his team had a high amount of motivation and aimed to become the new drivers' champion after having placed third and second in the previous two seasons but felt that the sport was going to possibly experience [...] "the most diverse and perhaps most exciting Formula E season.” Di Grassi hoped to win the race and it would be [...] "amazing" [...] if he became the event's inaugural winner. Heidfeld revealed that he was looking forward to the new season commencing and aimed to help his team gain positions in the championship.|$|E

500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E
500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is <b>not</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making {{a big deal out}} of nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E
