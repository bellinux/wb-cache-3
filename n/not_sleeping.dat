5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or translucent third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when <b>not</b> <b>sleeping,</b> use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is <b>not</b> <b>sleeping,</b> it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, <b>not</b> <b>sleeping</b> well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the large}} number of clubhouses there, South 2nd Street (Two Street) often serves as a party {{location}} after the parade, with the center of activity being South 2nd Street and Mifflin Street. Local residents and others in the area for the parade crowd the local bars, clubhouses and sidewalks, sometimes joining in the unofficial parade. With the parade they spent months preparing for finished, the Mummers let loose and celebrate. This multi-block party continues well into the night or early morning, with some Mummers <b>not</b> <b>sleeping</b> for twenty-four hours straight.|$|E
25|$|Alonso Quixano, {{the protagonist}} of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later in the book), is a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing 50 years of age, living in an unnamed section of La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper, {{as well as a}} boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. Although Quixano is usually a {{rational}} man, in keeping with the humoral theory of the time, <b>not</b> <b>sleeping</b> adequately — because he was reading — has caused his brain to dry; Quixano's temperament is thus choleric, the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger and believes every word of these fictional books of chivalry to be true.|$|E
25|$|George Hardy {{began working}} as a janitor at the main branch of the San Francisco Public Library in 1935. One night, a foreman dropped a match behind a radiator; when Hardy missed it, he was fired. Angry at the pettiness and mistreatment, Hardy, his father and other Irish janitors formed a new local for office {{building}} janitors, Local 87. George Hardy became an organizer for the new union in 1936. Hardy worked by day, and by night (often <b>not</b> <b>sleeping</b> for several days) he organized workers into the new union. Repeatedly fired for his off-hours union work, Hardy was blacklisted. Under future leaders such as Herman Eimers Rex Kennedy, and Robert Parr, members of Local 87 continued to enjoy improved wages, benefits and working conditions. These victories were all won with very few strikes.|$|E

500|$|Douglas and Zeta-Jones {{have two}} children, a son Dylan Michael (born August 2000) and a {{daughter}} Carys Zeta (born April 2003). The family lived in Bermuda until 2009, and as of 2016, live in rural New York State. In 2010, Douglas was diagnosed with tongue cancer, and Zeta-Jones faced an emotionally turbulent time; she said, [...] "When you get sideswiped like that [...] it's an obvious trigger for your balance {{to be a little}} bit off – <b>not</b> <b>sleeping,</b> worry, stress." [...] This trigger led to Zeta-Jones suffering from depression, and despite initial apprehension, she spoke publicly about suffering from bipolar II disorder. She sought treatment by checking herself into hospital in 2011, and again in 2013. Owing to the stress of both their illnesses, the couple decided to live separately in 2013, though without taking legal action towards separation or divorce. They reconciled in 2014, with Douglas stating that they were [...] "stronger than ever".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{interpret}} the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways. [...] Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality. Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship {{in such a}} manner that Jake knew [...] "that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been getting something for nothing' and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill." [...] Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid to San Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike. In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, [...] "you learned a lot about a woman by <b>not</b> <b>sleeping</b> with her." [...] By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her. Reynolds believes that Jake represents the [...] "everyman," [...] and that {{in the course of the}} narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as a morality play with Jake as the person who loses the most.|$|E
500|$|In Saxony-Anhalt, {{the species}} forages deep in valleys when {{temperatures}} are above , but on warmer slopes or rocky areas {{when it is}} colder. There, M.alcathoe {{is relatively easy to}} capture in August, because M.brandtii and M.mystacinus already start swarming in late July. Although there are some records of M.alcathoe in caves during the winter, {{it is also possible that}} animals spend the winter in tree cavities, and whether swarming behavior occurs in M.alcathoe is unclear. An animal found in a cave in Saxony-Anhalt in January was <b>not</b> <b>sleeping</b> deeply. Reproduction may also take place in caves, but pregnant females have been found as late as June. Relatively many juveniles are caught between July and September. In England, one individual of M.alcathoe was captured in 2003 (and identified at the time as M.brandtii) and again in 2009. Three individuals that were telemetrically tracked (in eastern France, Thuringia, and Baden-Württemberg, respectively) moved only , , and [...] from their night quarters; M.brandtii and M.mystacinus tend to move over longer distances. A study in Poland suggested frequent hybridization among M.alcathoe, M.brandtii, and M.mystacinus sharing the same swarming sites, probably attributable to male-biased sex ratios (1.7:1 in M.alcathoe), a polygynous mating system, and the high number of bats at swarming sites. M.alcathoe showed a particularly high proportion of hybrids, perhaps because it occurs at lower densities than the other two species.|$|E
