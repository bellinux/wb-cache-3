50|$|Lathyrus sylvestris, {{the flat}} pea or <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>everlasting-pea,</b> is a plant {{species of the}} genus Lathyrus. It is native to parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>everlasting-pea</b> forms a mat of herbage. The stems are winged. Each leaf {{is made up}} of two {{elongated}} leaflets. The {{flowers are}} pink. The fruit is a legume pod about 2 inches long.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{supports}} two uncommon legumes being <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>everlasting-pea</b> {{and wild}} liquorice. The embankments have colonised naturally and support yellow-wort, lady's bedstraw, ploughman's-spikenard, field scabious and marjoram. The track bed supports common restharrow, wild strawberry and common toadflax.|$|E
50|$|The site {{contains}} two main types of vegetation: {{an area of}} marsh, which contains a varied plant community, including Water Parsnip and Wild Celery, and an area of wasteland which is also botanically notable, with species including <b>Narrow-leaved</b> <b>Everlasting-pea.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>everlasting-pea</b> is {{native to}} parts of Africa, Europe and Asia. Its natural habitat is forest edges, sparse {{broad-leaved}} hillside forests, dry hillside meadows, hedgerows, embankments and waste ground. It uses is tendrils to scramble over plants, shrubs and the lower branches of trees.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>everlasting-pea</b> is a {{perennial}} plant which can grow 200 cm by climbing with its tendrils. Without any support it can reach about 75 cm tall. The stem is floppy and flat with wide wings. The leaves are alternate with short winged stalks and stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate {{with a single}} pair of narrow lanceolate leaflets with entire margins and three tendrils. The inflorescence has a long stem and three to ten pinkish-red flowers. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the [...] "standard", the lateral two as the [...] "wings" [...] and the lowest two are joined to form the [...] "keel". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long pod containing five to fifteen seeds.|$|E

On the other hand, those of man orchid fall suddenly and continually. Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the wood small-reed, before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management. The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores. Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering.|$|E
