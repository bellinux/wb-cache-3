The intended conference was turned into a <b>non-event</b> by Donnchad's refusal to appear the lesser party by boarding Fiachnae's ship and Fiachnae's refusal to come ashore for the same reason. This was commemorated in verse in the margins of the Annals of Ulster.|$|E

40|$|In {{longitudinal}} cohort studies, {{potential risk}} factors are measured at baseline, subjects are followed over time, and disease endpoints are ascertained via extensive surveillance. Individual follow-up time is from baseline to the event, {{if one is}} observed during the study period. Follow-up time is censored for subjects who are not observed to have the event during the study period, {{at the end of}} the study period for subjects who remain event-free, but during the study period for subjects who leave the study early by choice or by mortality, or whose last evaluation was before the end of the study. Survival analytic techniques are unique in that the unit of analysis is not the individual but the person-time contributed by the individual. Surveillance in longitudinal studies is generally quite rigorous. Subjects are examined in waves and their event status is ascertained. Surveillance continues between waves, and events come to the attention of the investigator. If there is a long time between waves, analyses can be conducted on all available data, with <b>non-events</b> censored early at the last examination and events followed beyond the general examination to the incident event. Motivated by analyses using the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) with cardiovascular endpoints, we consider four censoring methods for <b>non-events</b> and evaluate their impact on estimates of incidence, and on tests of association between risk factors and incidence. We further investigate the impact of early censoring of <b>non-events</b> (as compared to events) under various scenarios with respect to incidence estimation, robustness, and power using a simulation study of Weibull survival models over a range of sample sizes and distribution parameters. Our FHS and simulation investigations show early censoring of <b>non-events</b> causes over estimation of incidence, particularly when the baseline incidence is low. Early censoring of <b>non-events</b> did not affect the robustness of the Wald test [Ho: Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1]. However, in both the FHS and over the range of simulation scenarios, under early censoring of <b>non-events,</b> estimates of HR were closer to the null (1. 0), and the power to detect associations with risk factors was markedly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Most {{approaches}} to event extraction focus on mentions anchored in verbs. However, many mentions of events surface as noun phrases. Detecting them {{can increase the}} recall of event extraction and provide the foundation for detecting relations between events. This paper describes a weaklysupervised method for detecting nominal event mentions that combines techniques from word sense disambiguation (WSD) and lexical acquisition to create a classifier that labels noun phrases as denoting events or <b>non-events.</b> The classifier uses bootstrapped probabilistic generative models of the contexts of events and <b>non-events.</b> The contexts are the lexically-anchored semantic dependency relations that the NPs appear in. Our method dramatically improves with bootstrapping, and comfortably outperforms lexical lookup methods {{which are based on}} very much larger handcrafted resources. ...|$|R

Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama {{it was all over}} the place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the <b>non-event</b> of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks".

Brian Lowry felt that [...] "unlike last year's bloated sequel, it at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent - if no less numbing during the protracted finale." [...] Total Film praised the performances but complained that the twists and exposition {{made it hard to}} care for the characters. Edward Douglas liked the film but had issues with its pacing, while Blake Wright criticized the Davy Jones's Locker and Calypso segments. James Berardinelli found it the weakest of the trilogy as [...] "the last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments... which doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged, self-indulgent, and uneven production." [...] Peter Travers praised Richards and Rush but felt [...] "there can indeed be {{too much of a good}} thing," [...] regarding Depp's character. Travers later declared the movie to be one of the worst films of the year. Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film was overall a disappointment and that [...] "the final showdown ... is a <b>non-event</b> and the repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by the end". Richard Roeper gave a positive review, saying [...] "Gore Verbinski and the stunt and special effects crews have created one of the most impressive blends of live-action work and CGI wizardry ever put on film," [...] and believing it [...] "rarely drags and is almost always entertaining." [...] He praised the performances of the actors as one of the best things about the film.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2003 season, Kenseth's {{championship}} [...] {{became a}} source of controversy and criticism. Critics of the Sprint Cup points system, most notably Roger Penske, pointed out the flaw in having a driver who won only one race out of 36 winning a championship. Additionally, the fact that Kenseth led the points standings for 33 weeks despite only having the one victory, as well as already having clinched the Winston Cup title with one week {{to go in the}} season (rendering the final race in essence a <b>non-event)</b> led to discussions on how to prevent Kenseth's feat from happening again (by comparison, in 2000, under the same points system, Bobby Labonte had won the Winston Cup championship after leading in points for 25 races, but unlike Kenseth, Labonte also won four races in his championship year).

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Modern LanguagesMary T. CoppleThe {{formation}} of English past tense by EFL (or ESL) learners {{has been the}} object of much second language acquisition research. This study investigates the production and marking of English past tense verbs by 55 adult Afghan EFL learners who use Pashto or Dari as their first language. The participants were first required to produce the past tense while responding to a questionnaire about their daily activities, and then completed a correction task in which sentences with verb errors appeared. The collected data was analyzed based on verb regularity (Pinker & Ullman 2002, Jaeger et al. 1996, Hoeffner 2000, Housen 2000) and the sequential inflection of events or <b>non-events</b> based on inherent lexical aspect (Vendler 1967, Salaberry 2000, Bardovi-Harlig & Reynolds 1995, Tickoo 2001, 2005). Results show that the participants were more accurate in marking and producing regular verbs than irregular verbs for the past tense in both experimental tasks. When examining the role of regularity of the verb in the sequential marking of lexical aspect, {{it was discovered that}} past tense production of irregular verbs was influenced by the lexical aspectual verb type as <b>non-events</b> exhibited lower accuracy rates for past tense inflection...|$|R
50|$|Pokey the Penguin is {{an online}} comic strip created in 1998. It chronicles {{the adventures of}} a penguin named Pokey and a large cast of other characters. Pokey comics are drawn crudely and minimalistically, and they consist largely {{of a string of}} non-sequiturs and absurd journeys, with a token effort towards more {{traditional}} plots and continuity (such as the conflict with the Italians over arctic-circle candy) that tend to be established through oblique references to off-screen characters and <b>non-events.</b> Today, new comic strips appear sporadically, although formerly the site was updated daily.|$|R
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of the predictions is very high. However, the accuracy deduced from the confusion matrix is a problematic metric with skewed class distributions of the binary response. Lawrence et al. (1998) stated that the model “may always predict the most common class and still provide relatively high performance”. Hence, other statistics, such as sensitivity and specificity, are more meaningful. In the present data set, the amount of <b>non-events</b> (class 0) is very high – five {{times as many as}} events of threshold exceedance (class 1). It is, therefore, challenging to achieve a high sensitivity that describes the number of correct classified events. With a sensitivity of 0.586 in the original model fit, the events of threshold exceedances are predicted significantly worse than the <b>non-events</b> (specificity of 0.966, Table 4). In the validation, the sensitivity decreases to 0.53. The lower prediction performance in comparison to the original model fit, {{can be explained by the}} reduced database used in the 777 model calibrations. Since the validation measurement occasion and all chronologically younger records of the respective stand were excluded in the validation runs, the predictions are less accurate than in the original model fit. However, the model is able to achieve a prediction {{accuracy of}} 90 % in the cross validation and the mean prediction error of the validation runs is close to zero.|$|R
