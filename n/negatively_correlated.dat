5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated</b> with high hyena populations.|$|E
5|$|The pied currawong's {{impact on}} smaller birds that are {{vulnerable}} to nest predation is controversial: several {{studies have suggested that}} the species has become a serious problem, but the truth of this widely held perception was queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed that common introduced birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of Gould's petrel at a colony on Cabbage Tree Island, near Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated</b> with the presence of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis).|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that the native blue crab in eastern North America, Callinectes sapidus, is able to control populations of C.maenas; numbers of the two species are <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated,</b> and C.maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent. On the west coast of North America, C.maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats, in part because of predation by native rock crabs (Romaleon antennarium and Cancer productus) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina carcini, a parasitic barnacle, as a potential biological control agent of C.maenas. In the laboratory, Sacculina settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus nudus, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Any potential benefits of using Sacculina to control C.maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non-target impacts.|$|E

In the domain of tutorial dialogue systems, however, where the primary evaluation metric is student learning, there has been little investigation of whether speech recognition errors also <b>negatively</b> <b>correlate</b> with learning. In this paper we examine correlations between student learning and automatic speech recognition performance, in a corpus of dialogues collected with an intelligent tutoring spoken dialogue system. We examine numerous quantitative measures of speech recognition error, including rejection versus misrecognition errors, word versus sentence-level errors, and transcription versus semantic errors. Our results show that although many of our students experience problems with speech recognition, none of our measures <b>negatively</b> <b>correlates</b> with student learning. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether an overall student disengagement label and six different labels of disengagement type are predictive {{of learning in}} a spoken dialog computer tutoring corpus. Our results show first that although students' percentage of overall disengaged turns <b>negatively</b> <b>correlates</b> with the amount they learn, the individual types of disengagement correlate differently with learning: some <b>negatively</b> <b>correlate</b> with learning, while others don't correlate with learning at all. Second, we show that these relationships change somewhat depending on student prerequisite knowledge level. Third, we show that using multiple disengagement types to predict learning improves predictive power. Overall, our results suggest that although adapting to disengagement should improve learning, maximizing learning requires different system interventions depending on disengagement type. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
