40|$|The {{flagellum}} of Euglena gracilis {{has been}} studied comparatively, using the freeze-fracture technique and with thin sections involving a tannic acid staining procedure. The flagellar membrane exhibits specializations {{in the form of}} two groups of intramembrane particle rows (IMP rows; mean IMP diameter, 6 nm) and single clusters of larger IMPs (mean IMP diameter, 10 nm) associated with the edge of one of the two groups of IMP rows.

The novelty in this paper is the extension of cores from existing methods that handle branching tubular objects to a broader ability to handle <b>non-tubular,</b> or slab-like, objects. The slab-like core extraction method presented utilizes a coarse-to-fine grid-based marching scheme with branch handling and automated end detection.

In this paper, {{we propose}} a new variational {{framework}} based on distance transform and gradient vector flow, to compute flight paths through tubular and <b>non-tubular</b> structures, for virtual endoscopy.

During Expedition 87 of the Icebreaker POLARSTERN in August 2014, a sedimentechosounding profile was recorded and a boxcore station was collected from the crest of Hovgård Ridge at 1169 m water depth.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Complex {{formation}} between halloysites, from {{soil and}} geological sources, {{and a series}} of amides has been investigated. All the amides used can be intercalated to give single-layer complexes with basal spacings between 10. 4 A (for formamide) and 12. 4 A (for N,N-dimethylacetamide). When the interlayer space of halloysite has already been expanded by water, {{as is the case with}} fully hydrated samples, the rate and extent of intercalation depend more on the properties of the organic species than on the mineralogy of the clay. With partially and completely dehydrated halloysite, however, complex formation is influenced by the particle size, crystallinity, and iron content of the mineral. A large particle size, a high degree of crystallinity, and a low iron content are all conducive to complex formation. The iron content of halloysite also appears to affect particle shape. Low structural iron contents are associated with long tubular particles, intermediate contents with short and/or wide tubes, and high contents with spheroidal nd other <b>non-tubular</b> forms. Halloysites containing high amounts of extractable (non-structural) iron generally show a low intercalating ability. The ability of 1 : 1 type layer-silicates to form interlayer complexes with a wide range and variety of organic compounds has been known for a long time (MacEwan, 1946; Caill~re et al., 1950).

The localization of IGF-I peptide and IGF-I mRNA was investigated in the post-ischemic regenerating rat kidney using immunohistochemistry and non-radioactive in situ hybridization techniques. In addition, the distribution and relative quantity of IGF-I binding sites were studied by autoradiographic ligand-binding techniques. Two and {{three days after the}} injury, morphological signs of an intense regenerative activity was evident. By this time a substantial number of the regenerating cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody against the M 1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, a proliferative marker used. Low proliferative tubular cells, replacing those that had been injured, were seen lining the tubular basement membrane. By seven days, the morphology in the cortex was quite normalized, while cells of the S 3 segments in the outer medulla remained dedifferentiated. The regenerative cells expressed IGF-I peptide and IGF-I mRNA in a transient manner and this was found to correlate better to cell differentiation than cell division. In addition, <b>non-tubular</b> cells, predominantly macrophages, expressed both the IGF-I peptide and the mRNA. The IGF-I binding was significantly increased in the regenerative zone at all times studied and began to decline at day seven.
