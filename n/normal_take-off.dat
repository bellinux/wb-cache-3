25|$|The second non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 14 January 1969. It involved a BUA mainline BAC One-Eleven 201AC (registration: G-ASJJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Milan's Linate Airport to London Gatwick. This {{was the same}} aircraft BUA had used to operate the One-Eleven's inaugural revenue service. On {{the day of the}} accident, the aircraft had been diverted to Linate on the outbound flight because of fog at Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo Airport. A <b>normal</b> <b>take-off</b> run was followed by a bang immediately after the aircraft had become airborne. The captain in the jumpseat who was supervising the co-pilot at the time thought that there was a problem with the no. 1 engine. He advised the pilot in command to close the throttle a short while later. The pilot in command followed this advice and lowered the nose pitch from 12 to six degrees. The engine shutdown was accompanied by an decrease in airspeed from 140 knots (161mph/ 259km/h to 115 kn (132mph / 212km/h). Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing on snow-covered sand about two miles from the end of runway 18, there were no fatalities among the 33 occupants (seven crew and 26 passengers) though there were two serious injuries. The accident investigators concluded that this crash was caused by the crew failing to recognise their mistake, which had resulted in shutting down the wrong engine (no. 1) in error following a compressor bang/surge in the no. 2 engine. In addition, the crew did not notice that an inadvertent movement of the relevant throttle lever had partially reduced the no. 2 engine's thrust.|$|E

5000|$|The action-filled {{second half}} of the film sees the Tu-154 Aeroflot {{airplane}} landing in the fictional foreign town of Bidri, which appears to be located somewhere in the mountain region of the Asia. Soon after, an earthquake destroys the city, and the damaged runway is no longer suitable for <b>normal</b> <b>take-offs</b> (another plane — a Boeing — is shown crashing in the attempt). Still, there is no alternative to escaping by air, because the airport will soon be buried by an approaching mudflow. The experienced senior officer decides {{to take advantage of the}} fact that the airport was built on a mountain, so the plane will be able to descend rather than ascend as soon as it leaves the runway. Despite the [...] "not ready for flight" [...] warning lighting up on the dashboard, the plane successfully takes off at the last moment. The captain had first insisted on going through a speedy but complete take-off protocol, involving a check of the aircraft in accordance with the prescribed rules — perhaps in order to calm the crew by having them perform their normal tasks.|$|R

5000|$|The total payload of 2800 kg {{was shared}} between the crew (320+ kg/705+ lb), weapons (200 kg/441 lb), radios and other {{equipment}} (100 kg/220 lb), fuel (2,200 L/581 US gal), oil (1,500 kg/3,307 lb), oxygen and bombs. There was almost no chance of carrying a full load of fuel with the maximum bombload, (other Italian bombers were generally capable of a 3,300-3,600 kg/7,275-7,937 lb payload). The lack of power made take-offs when over-loaded, impossible. Indeed, even with a <b>normal</b> load, <b>take-offs</b> were problematic [...]|$|R
50|$|Modern {{companies}} have employed a new, patented, methodology of banner towing that greatly reduces {{the risks associated}} with the older, grappling hook method. With the new take-off technique, the pilot no longer has to pick up the banner in the tow hook - a time-consuming and technically demanding manoeuvre. Instead, the pilot can take the banner, already set up for towing, directly from the hangar across the taxiway to the airstrip, and then carry out a <b>normal</b> <b>take-off.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The aircraft's twin {{engines are}} mounted under {{extended}} wing roots, which reach as far forward as the windscreen.

Removal of two of the fuselage bomb racks reduced the maximum bomb load to 700 kg, one 250 kg bomb on each of the fuselage racks and one 100 kg in each of the engine nacelles. The electric bomb release system was removed and the bombs had to be dropped using the mechanical system, initially designed as the emergency system.

50|$|Nexcelle began {{full-scale}} testing of its nacelle demonstrator - called PANACHE (Pylon And Nacelle Advanced Configuration for High Efficiency) - in May 2012, marking a first {{validation of the}} thrust reverser element for the company’s Integrated Propulsion System technology. This activity occurred at GE Aviation’s Peebles Test Operation in Ohio, and it involved 200 cycles representing <b>normal</b> deployments, rejected <b>take-off</b> deployments and aborted landings.|$|R
50|$|The {{safety system}} cable, {{responsible}} for pulling the power lever to the idle position, {{was no longer}} able to withstand the physical strain of being pulled one way by the actuator, while the copilot forced it the other way by pushing the throttle lever to the fully open position - the cable soon parted at a maintenance connection. With the lever no longer restrained by the safety system, the copilot continued to hold the right throttle fully open. The combination of the right engine at full thrust in reverse and the left engine still at <b>normal</b> forward <b>take-off</b> thrust caused the aircraft to roll violently to the right and descend into the ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{consortium}} {{was formed}} in 1959 by the German aircraft companies Bölkow, Heinkel and Messerschmitt to develop a Mach 2 VTOL interceptor for the German Air Force. In 1964 Heinkel left the consortium and the following year it was formed as a company Entwicklungsring Süd GmbH. A VJ 101C prototype aircraft was built and flown in 1963 although it crashed on its 132nd flight, on 14 September 1964, during a <b>normal</b> horizontal <b>take-off.</b> The accident {{was found to have}} been caused by a roll-rate gyro which had been installed with reversed polarity. A modified second prototype flew in 1965 and it was planned to put an improved variant VJ 101D into production, but the development was stopped.|$|R

40|$|Fixed-cockpit piloted {{simulator}} {{studies of}} delta-planform and variable-wing-sweep supersonic transport configurations are being {{conducted at the}} Ames Research Center to investigate the handling qualities and certification requirements related to the take-off maneuver.

Evaluation of the simulator was made by NASA pilots as well as company and FAA pilots involved in the actual certification flights of the airplane. The present paper {{is limited to a}} discussion of <b>normal</b> <b>take-off,</b> minimum control speed (ground), rotation characteristics, and initial climbout. Comparisons of the take-off characteristics are made between the supersonic transport and the current class of subsonic jet transports. Results indicate that minimum control speed (ground) characteristics are a function of thrust-weight ratio, the time provided for SST rotation should be at least as long as that for the subsonic jet transports, abused take-offs are more likely to result in tail scrapes, and climbout below the minimum drag speed requires that the pilot carefully monitor airspeed...|$|E
50|$|The Vulcan {{was over}} its <b>normal</b> maximum <b>take-off</b> weight—each carried, {{as well as}} extra {{equipment}} like the DASH 10 and a chemical toilet, a highly experienced Air to Air Refuelling Instructor (AARI) from the Victor tanker force who would fly the Vulcan during refuelling—and fuel usage, was higher than expected. As {{a result of the}} fuel demand and problems in flight with refuelling, two of the Victors had to fly further south than planned, eating into their own reserves. At the Victor's final refuelling bracket, the sortie flew into a violent thunderstorm, during which the receiver aircraft's refuelling probe failed, forcing the provider aircraft to swap places and take back the fuel. XL189 the last Victor to refuel the Vulcan was past the last refuelling bracket before turning home. Tankers had to be sent south to refuel these Victors so they could reach Ascension. A total of 11 Victors were used to support Black Buck One: XH669, XH672, XL162, XL163, XL188, XL189, XL192, XL232, XL511, XL512 and XM717.|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of an investigation to determine the character and importance of the transition phase between the ground run and steady climb in the take-off of an airplane and the effects of various factors on this phase and on the air-borne part of the take-off as a whole. The information was obtained from a series of step-by-step integrations, which defined the motion of the airplane during the transition and which were based on data derived from actual take-off tests of a Verville AT airplane. Both <b>normal</b> and zoom <b>take-offs</b> under several loading and take-off speed conditions were considered. The effects of a moderate wind with a corresponding wind gradient and the effect of proximity of the ground were also investigated...|$|R
5000|$|These {{galliformes}} {{might use}} WAIR instead of normal flight to reach tree branches because WAIR uses less energy than normal flight. Fewer muscles {{are used in}} the process of WAIR than normal flight, specifically pectoral and shoulder muscles which contribute to wing flapping. [...] This provides an additional explanation as to why birds continue to use WAIR: it is faster than <b>normal</b> flight <b>take-off,</b> and running requires less energy than does flying. Therefore; the hindlimbs, in conjunction with the wings, may produce quick bouts of energy which may allow the bird to catch prey. This strategy also allows energy to be stored for use in a fight-or-flight situation such as to escape becoming eaten or caught. [...] WAIR imposes less aerodynamic and physical forces than normal avian flight on the bird, an advantageous trait which may increase fitness. [...] WAIR could have been used for balance purposes.Many theories propose that the manifestation of WAIR in birds is for predatory escape purposes, in that they are able to run up extremely steep and past vertical slopes (such as the trunk of a tree) to escape from a ground-dwelling predator. [...] Another reason for the manifestation of WAIR may be for dispersal or to find food or resources, but this idea is mostly proposed as a survival strategy.Whether it is to evade predation, catch prey, enhance reproductive success, or simply a variation imposed for dispersal, flight among avian creatures has evolved to be a highly successful trait.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and a modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) fit procedure {{has been used}} to study a native oxide layer on a clean Si(100) substrate. Numerical calculations show that with an aperture of 3 ° or 9 ° of the electron analyser, the photoelectron take-off angle should not exceed 80 ° or 70 °, respectively, as compared to <b>normal</b> <b>take-off</b> angles. At larger photoelectron take-off angles, the effect of the aperture on the photoelectron energy distribution may not be neglected. We show how absolute ARXPS measurements in which the same XPS feature is considered at several electron take-off angles are an alternative for relative ARXPS film thickness measurements, avoiding large errors in the quantitative results. Models for the composition and thickness of the oxide layer have been developed. Also, the errors in the parameters of these models have been calculated. It can be concluded that the native oxide layer on silicon is 27 ± 1 (±- 5 %) Å thick and that the ratio of the silicon atom concentration in the substrate to that in the native oxide layer is 3. 7 ±- 0. 3 (±- 8 %), values that agree well with the literature. This report shows that the {{combination of}} ARXPS and a LM fit procedure is well suited to study ultra-thin layers and gives reliable results...|$|E
40|$|Surnmary. [...] An {{investigation}} is described into {{the cause of}} a series of accidents to aircraft taking off at night; it depends {{on the fact that the}} direction of the net reaction on a pilot's body during acceleration is the same as that corresponding to a steady climb. The analysis and a numerical illustration are given in Part I. The results of flight tests designed to check the analysis are summarised in Part II: the results confirm the theoretical findings. It is concluded that the only faculty which can be safely used is that of vision, and this implies the use of instruments throughout the whole of the take-off at night. 1. Istroduction. TThe investigation described in the "present paper began as an attempt to provide a possible explanation for a series of accidents to aircraft immediately after taking off at night. The majority of cases occurred during the period in 1940 - 41 when an intensive training of pilots for night flying was in progress. The accidents were all similar in character: following a <b>normal</b> <b>take-off</b> tile aircraft was flown into the ground under power in a manner which suggested strongly that the pilot was in each case unaware that his aircraft was losing height.
