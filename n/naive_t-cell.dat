40|$|Following immune depletion, it {{is vital}} that the immune system recovers rapidly to avoid severe or {{life-threatening}} infections. In adults, full recovery of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell counts, important cell types of the immune system, may take years. Similar to other lymphocytes, T cells start their development in the bone marrow, but accomplish full maturation in the thymus. When mature T cells exit the thymus, they are antigen-inexperienced and are called 'naive'. Beside thymic <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> generation, proliferation of naive T cells in the periphery is a source of <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> production. The role of both mechanisms in the build-up of the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> compartment during childhood is not completely understood. In addition, the contribution of both mechanisms to <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> recovery following immune deficiency is unclear. In this thesis, the establishment of the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> compartment during childhood was thoroughly assessed. Furthermore, the role of the thymus and peripheral proliferation during recovery of the T-cell compartment was determined: 1) in children who were treated with chemotherapy, 2) in children and adults who were treated with antiretroviral therapy for chronic HIV- 1 infection, and 3) in children of whom the thymus had been completely removed in the first weeks of life. It was found that the thymus and peripheral proliferation both account for the establishment of the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> compartment during childhood. However, production of naive T cells by the thymus was crucial since only recently produced naive T cells by the thymus divide in the periphery. Thymic production was also important for the speed of <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> recovery in children after cessation of chemotherapy. Peripheral proliferation may have contributed to <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> recovery, but was not found elevated. This finding excludes the possibility that <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> recovery is homeostatically regulated. Similar findings were observed in children for T-cell recovery during antiretroviral treatment for HIV- 1 infection. Adults were also able to recover T-cell counts, but this took substantially longer (at least seven years of successful treatment) than in children (within one year). Beside these studies on T-cell dynamics in health and disease, a new method was created to identify naive T cells which have recently left the thymus, since these cells still bear thymic developmental features. By applying this method, the difficulty was resolved of discriminating between naive T cells that have recently been produced by the thymus and those that have circulated for years in the periphery. Collectively, the data presented in this thesis shed a new light on the mechanism of <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> generation in health and disease. Therefore, in concert with the new method that was developed to identify recently produced naive T cells, physicians now have the opportunity to devise strategies that ameliorate <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> recovery following immune depletion...|$|E
40|$|Naive T {{cells in}} {{untreated}} HIV- 1 infected individuals have a reduced T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) content. Previous mathematical models {{have suggested that}} {{this is due to}} increased <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> division. It remains unclear, however, how reduced naive TREC contents can be reconciled with a gradual loss of naive T cells in HIV- 1 infection. We performed longitudinal analyses in humans before and after HIV- 1 seroconversion, and used a mathematical model to investigate which processes could explain the observed changes in <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> numbers and TRECs during untreated HIV- 1 disease progression. Both CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> TREC contents declined biphasically, with a rapid loss during the first year and a much slower loss during the chronic phase of infection. While naive CD 8 + T-cell numbers hardly changed during follow-up, naive CD 4 + T-cell counts continually declined. We show that a fine balance between increased T-cell division and loss in the peripheral <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> pool can explain the observed short- and long-term changes in TRECs and <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> numbers, especially if T-cell turnover during the acute phase is more increased than during the chronic phase of infection. Loss of thymic output, on the other hand, does not help to explain the biphasic loss of TRECs in HIV infection.

40|$|Current {{understanding}} of how the T-cell pool is established in children and how this is affected by HIV infection is limited. It is widely believed that the thymus is the main source for T cells during childhood. Here we show, however, that healthy children had an age-related increase in total body numbers of naive and memory T cells, whereas absolute numbers of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) did not increase. This suggests that expansion of the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> pool after birth is more dependent on T-cell proliferation than was previously recognized. Indeed, the proportion of dividing naive T cells was high, especially in younger children, which is consistent With expansion through proliferation, in addition to antigen-mediated <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> activation leading to formation of the memory T-cell pool. In untreated children infected with HIV- 1, total body numbers of T cells and TRECs were low and stable, whereas T-cell division levels were significantly higher than in healthy children.

There is mounting evidence that inappropriate immune programming may involve disruption of specific epigenetic modifications (switches) at immune-related genes. This novel area of research has great potential, as epigenetic changes are known to be sensitive to environmental factors and may therefore provide a mechanistic link for the observed association between specific environmental cues, faulty immune development, and the risk of allergic disease. In addition, the dynamic and potentially reversible nature of epigenetic modifications offers potentially novel targets for therapeutic and/or preventative interventions. We review the evidence that (1) failure to up-regulate the interferon gamma (IFNγ) response during infancy is an important determinant of the risk of allergic disease, (2) expression of the IFNγ gene in <b>naïve</b> <b>T-cells</b> is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, and (3) failure to up-regulate IFNγ gene expression of <b>naïve</b> <b>T-cells</b> associated with low early life microbial exposure.

50|$|The {{ability of}} the immune system to mount a strong {{protective}} response depends on the receptor diversity of <b>naive</b> <b>T-cells</b> (TCR).

Loss of thymic function and TCR diversity is thought to contribute to weaker immunosurveillance of the elderly, including increasing instances of diseases such as cancers, autoimmunity, and opportunistic infections.|$|R

Newly generated naïve T cells derived from aged stem cells had a shorter lifespan, like that of young naïve T cells. Conversely, naïve CD 4 T cells derived from middle-aged thymectomized mice were longer-lived in vivo, and their development of functional defects was accelerated. These observations suggest that naïve T cells develop their longer lifespan during their sojourn in the periphery.

40|$|Our limited {{knowledge}} of the expected life spans of granulocytes and T cells during health and disease hampers {{our understanding of the}} functioning of the immune system. Using stable isotope labeling we estimated the average life spans of human circulating granulocytes to be 6 days. This estimate was 10 -fold higher than suggested in previous reports, supporting the emerging concept that neutrophils participate in complex long-term processes, such as immune regulation and recirculation. Since life span estimates of kinetically heterogeneous cell populations is labeling-time dependent, a new modeling strategy was introduced to fit average life spans independent of the labeling period. Deuterium labeling in human adults revealed a low daily production of naive T cells. Whereas naive T cells lived on average 6. 0 (naive CD 4 +) and 9. 4 years (naive CD 8 +), the few naive T cells that were recently produced had an even longer life expectancy. These data are incompatible with the existence of a substantial short-lived population of recent thymic emigrants in human adults. In contrast, a considerable thymic output was observed in mice. In addition, thymic emigrants lived as long as the average murine naive T cell in the periphery (48 and 83 days for naive CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, respectively), suggesting that the murine <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> pool is kinetically homogeneous, which is incompatible with the co-existence of short-lived thymic emigrants and long-lived truly naive T cells. The different life expectancy of recently produced naive T cells in adult mice and men suggests different homeostatic mechanisms of naive T cells in the two species. Indeed, thymectomy experiments and TREC analyses in ageing mice revealed that almost all murine naive T cells represent thymic emigrants, whereas TREC analysis in ageing humans strongly suggests that the majority of newly produced human naive T cells is derived from peripheral proliferation. Since the mechanism of <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> maintenance is fundamentally different in mice and men, this will influence the diversity of the TCR repertoire of the species. The difference in <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> dynamics suggests that laboratory mice, which are worldwide used as a model to study T-cell dynamics in men, are not a good model to study <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> homeostasis in humans.

Using CD 70 Tg mice, we showed that even in the context of substantial thymic output, like in young children, chronic immune activation can lead to severe <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> depletion.

40|$|By {{a balance}} of cell {{production}} and cell loss, B-cell and T-cell populations are generally maintained at a relatively stable size throughout life. Following lymphocyte-depleting therapies however, for example {{for the treatment of}} hematological malignancies, reconstitution of some lymphocyte subsets typically takes months to years. Such long-term immunodeficiency results in an increased susceptibility to infectious and malignant diseases and is associated with an increased mortality. Why recovery of these lymphocyte subsets takes so long is poorly understood. To be able to understand the process of immune reconstitution, and how for example advanced aging, and chronic infections affect the lymphocyte compartment, it is essential to first understand how lymphocyte populations are maintained in healthy conditions. The studies in this thesis were focused on investigation of B-cell and T-cell dynamics in healthy conditions and in conditions in which lymphocyte numbers are reduced. By performing in vivo stable isotope labeling studies in healthy volunteers and in lymphopenic stem-cell transplanted and kidney-transplanted patients, we studied how healthy aging, therapeutic lymphocyte depletion, and immunosuppressive therapy affect lymphocyte production and survival rates. In combination with T-cell receptor excision circle analyses and mathematical modeling, we also investigated the relative contributions of thymic output and peripheral cell division to maintenance of the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> population. The main findings of these studies are that (i) thymic output contributes very little to T-cell production from young adulthood onward, and declines approximately tenfold between the third and seventh decade of life, (ii) the turnover rate of B-cell and T-cell subsets is not substantially altered during healthy aging and despite declining thymic output and <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> numbers with age, the level of peripheral <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> division is not increased in elderly, (iii) in severely lymphocyte-depleted stem-cell transplanted individuals, the cell production rates of deficient B-cell and T-cell subsets are significantly increased, (iv) thymic output and peripheral cell division both contribute substantially to T-cell reconstitution, and (v) in kidney transplantation patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy, low lymphocyte counts do not result in increased cell production rates. These results suggest that in conditions of severe lymphopenia, a homeostatic response enhances the production rate of deficient lymphocyte subsets. At the same time, lymphocyte maintenance during healthy aging does not require substantial alterations in cellular turnover rates. In addition to the human studies, we also performed thymus transplantation and stable-isotope labeling studies in mice to investigate the composition and dynamics of the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> population in more detail. Our findings suggest that T cells that have recently been produced by the thymus, the recent thymic emigrants, form a subpopulation with distinct kinetics, and are relatively short-lived cells in the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> pool. Altogether, our fundamental insights into the dynamics of lymphocyte populations will aid the interpretation of past, current, and future investigations in a variety of interventions and diseases, and may form the basis for the development of improved therapeutic strategies that either limit the damage to the lymphocyte compartment, or accelerate immune reconstitution following lymphocyte depletion...|$|E

In the present study, we analyzed the impact of different quantities of IL- 7 produced by MSCs on the survival and proliferation of a negative immunoselected naive (CD 3 +/CD 45 RA+) T-cell population. Co-cultivation of peripheral naive T cells with MSCs producing low (16 pg/mL) or high (1000 pg/mL) IL- 7 levels or in the presence of exogenous IL- 7 (0. 01 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL) maintained the CD 3 +/CD 45 RA+ <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> phenotype.

Methods: Drug-specific T-cells were cloned from blood and inflamed skin and cellular phenotype and function was explored.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} this subversion of the innate immune system, the body must increase the scale and strength of its immune response. This is done through {{increasing the number of}} immune cells recruited to the site of infection (Wager and Wormley 2014) and the triggering of an adaptive immune response, a function which is performed by the DCs. These cells come into contact with bacteria and absorb antigens. Doing so cause the DCs to change from an immature state to a mature state, and these mature cells then migrate from the lungs to the lymphatic system (Alvarez et al. 2008; Bousso 2008; Mihret 2012).

The <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> compartment involves a balance between thymic production of naive T-cells, homeostatic proliferation and the delivery of death and survival signals. <b>Naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> production was quantified by measuring signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (sj-TRECs); episomal byproducts formed during V(D) J T-cell receptor rearrangement.

RRMS patients had fewer sj-TRECs than healthy controls but this difference was not significant (p = 0. 4652). Similarly, in PPMS, naive CD 4 + T-cells had significantly lower CD 31 expression than healthy controls (p = 0. 0017) and RRMS patients (p = 0. 0032). This finding indicates increased homeostatic proliferation in naive CD 4 + T-cells in PPMS, most probably a response to decreased thymic export as marked by the decreased naive CD 4 + T-cell sj-TRECs. % CD 31 expression in naive CD 4 + T-cells did not differ significantly in RRMS compared to healthy controls (p = 0. 7455) which is consistent with their naive CD 4 + sj-TREC levels. Naive CD 8 + T-cell sj-TRECs were significantly reduced in PPMS patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0. 0212) but not compared to RRMS patients (p = 0. 2379). RRMS patients had fewer naive CD 8 + T-cell sj-TRECs compared to healthy controls but this difference was not significant (p = 0. 1517). PPMS patients expressed increased Bcl- 2 levels in their naive CD 8 + T-cells. This finding indicates upregulation of survival signals, most probably a consequence of reduced thymic export of naive CD 8 + T-cells. The data from this study indicate that PPMS is different from RRMS in their naive CD 4 + T-cell sj-TRECs and naive CD 4 + T-cell % CD 31 expression but is similar to RRMS in their naive CD 8 + T-cell sj-TRECs. This study concludes, therefore, that both PPMS and RRMS patients have altered <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> homeostasis...|$|E

They {{are the focus of}} a range of novel strategies for the immunotherapy of cancer, a proportion of which include treating DC with ionising radiation to high dose. The effects of radiation on DC have not, however, been fully characterised. We therefore cultured human myeloid DC from CD 14 + precursors, and studied the effects of ionising radiation on their phenotype and function. Dendritic cells were remarkably resistant against radiation-induced apoptosis, showed limited changes in surface phenotype, and mostly maintained their endocytic, phagocytic and migratory capacity. However, irradiated DC were less effective in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, and on maturation produced significantly less IL- 12 than unirradiated controls, while IL- 10 secretion was maintained. Furthermore, peptide-pulsed irradiated mature DC were less effective at <b>naïve</b> <b>T-cell</b> priming, stimulating fewer effector cells with lower cytotoxicity against antigen-specific targets. Hence irradiation of DC in vitro, and potentially in vivo, has a significant impact on their function, and may shift the balance between T-cell activation and tolerisation in DC-mediated immune responses...|$|E
40|$|Early in life, thymic export {{establishes}} {{the size and}} {{the diversity of the}} human <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> pool. Yet, on puberty thymic activity drastically decreases. Because the over-all size of the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> pool decreases only marginally during ageing, peripheral postthymic expansion of naive T cells has been postulated to account partly for the maintenance of T-cell immunity in adults. So far, the analysis of these pro-cesses had been hampered by the inabil-ity to distinguish recent thymic emigrants from proliferated, peripheral, naive T cells. However, recently, CD 31 has been intro-duced as a marker to distinguish 2 subsets of naive CD 4 T cells with distinct T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) content in the peripheral blood of healthy humans. Here, we review studies that have character-ized TREChi CD 31 thymicnaive CD 4 T cells and have accordingly used the assess-ment of this distinct subset of naive CD 4 T cells as a correlate of thymic activity. We will discuss further potential clinical applications and how more research on CD 31 thymicnaive and CD 31 centralnaive CD 4 T cells may foster our knowledge of the impact of thymic involution on im-mune competence.

40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} structures providing chromosome integrity during cellular division {{along with}} protection against premature senescence and apoptosis. Accelerated telomere attrition {{in patients with}} Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) occurs by an undefined mechanism. Although the MDS clone originates within the myeloid compartment, T-lymphocytes display repertoire contraction and loss of <b>naïve</b> <b>T-cells.</b> The replicative lifespan of T-cells is stringently regulated by telomerase activity. In MDS cases, we show that purified CD 3 + T-cells have significantly shorter telomere length and reduced proliferative capacity upon stimulation compared to controls. To understand the mechanism, telomerase enzymatic activity and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene expression were compared in MDS cases (n= 35) and healthy controls (n= 42) within different T-cell compartments. Telomerase activity is greatest in <b>naïve</b> <b>T-cells</b> illustrating the importance of telomere repair in homeostatic repertoire regulation. Compared to healthy controls, MDS cases had lower telomerase induction (p< 0. 0001) that correlated with significantly lower hTERT mRNA (p< 0. 0001), independent of age and disease stratification. hTERT mRNA deficiency affected naïve but not memory T-cells, and telomere erosion in MDS occurred withou...|$|R

Isotretinoin (acne therapy) has been inconsistently associated with IBD onset and flares but prior treatment with antibiotics, also associated with IBD development, complicates the confirmation of this association. Here we studied in mice whether doxycycline, metronidazole or isotretinoin induce epigenetic modifications, and consequently change T-cell mRNA expression and/or function directly after treatment and after a 4 week recovery period. Isotretinoin induced IL- 10 signaling in Tregs and <b>naive</b> <b>T-cells</b> directly after treatment and reduced effector T-cell proliferation alone and in co-culture with Tregs. Metronidazole activated processes associated with anti-inflammatory pathways in both T-cell subsets directly after the treatment period whereas doxycycline induced an immediate pro-inflammatory expression profile that resolved after the recovery period. Long-term changes indicated an inhibition of proliferation by doxycycline and induction of beneficial immune and metabolic pathways by metronidazole. Persistent alterations in microRNA and mRNA expression profiles after the recovery period indicate that all three medications may induce long-term epigenetic modifications in both T-cell subsets. Yet, our data {{do not support the}} induction of a long-term pro-inflammatory phenotype in murine Tregs and <b>naive</b> <b>T-cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{suggested}} that human memory and naive T-cells {{can be distinguished}} based on the differential expression of two CD 45 isoforms. It was believed that CD 45 RA is expressed only on naive cells and that CD 45 RO is expressed only on memory cells. The separation of cell subsets based on the differential expression of CD 45 isoforms was fundamental to the experimental design {{used to test the}} hypotheses presented in this thesis. [...] The first hypothesis was that the memory T-cell TCRBJ and TCRBV repertoires are significantly different from those of naive T-cells within the same individual. Using a quantitative RT-PCR technique, {{it was found that the}} TCRBJ, and to a lesser extent, TCRBV repertoires of CD 45 RA+ (naive) and CD 45 RO+ (memory) T-cells differ. [...] The second hypothesis was that genetics and, more precisely, HLA affect the TCRBJ repertoire of CD 4 +CD 45 RO- (naive) T-cells. By comparing the <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> TCRBJ repertoires of identical twins and unrelated individuals and by employing a novel method of statistical analysis, statistical evidence was found for a genetic effect on the TCRBJ repertoire of CD 4 +CD 45 RO- (naive) T-cells. Similarly, family studies provided statistical evidence for an HLA effect on the CD 4 +CD 45 RO- (<b>naive)</b> <b>T-cell</b> TCRBJ repertoire in comparisons of HLA identical and HLA non-identical siblings. [...] Statistical evidence was obtained in support of the third hypothesis which was that twin pairs discordant for multiple sclerosis (MS) have less similar CD 4 +CD 45 RO- (<b>naive)</b> <b>T-cell</b> TCRBJ repertoires than do healthy twin pairs. [...] It appears some CD 45 RO+ (memory) T-cells may revert to the expression of the CD 45 RA (naive) isoform and retain their immunological memory. These results, however, do not affect the interpretation of results for the first hypothesis, and results obtained for HLA identical vs. HLA non-identical siblings suggest that the effect of "revertant" cells was minimal...|$|E
40|$|What are {{the rules}} that govern a naive T cell’s {{prospects}} for survival or division after export from the thymus into the periphery? To help address these ques-tions, we combine data from existing stud-ies with robust mathematical models to estimate the absolute contributions of thymopoiesis, peripheral division, and loss or differentiation to the human naive CD 4 T-cell pool {{between the ages of}} 0 and 20 years. Despite their decline in fre-quency in the blood, total body numbers of naive CD 4 T cells increase through-out childhood and early adulthood. Our analysis shows that postthymic prolifera-tion contributes more than double the number of cells entering the pool each day from the thymus. This ratio is pre-served with age; as the thymus involutes, the average time between <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> divisions in the periphery lengthens. We also show that the expected residence time of naive T cells increases with time. The naive CD 4 T-cell population thus becomes progressively less dynamic with age. Together with other studies, our re-sults suggest a complex picture of <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> homeostasis in which population size, time since export from the thymus, or time since the last division can influ-ence a cell’s prospects for survival or further divisions.

40|$|Although an immunoregulatory role of aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (Ahr) has been demonstrated in T cells and macrophages, {{little is known about}} its function in dendritic cells (DC). Here, we show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG stimulate Ahr expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC). Furthermore, we found that Ahr is required to induce indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) expression, an immunosuppressive enzyme that catabolizes tryptophan into kynurenine (Kyn) and other metabolites in DC. In the presence of LPS or CpG, Ahr-deficient (Ahr−/−) mature BMDC induced immune responses characterized by reduced Kyn and IL- 10 production compared with results observed with tolerogenic mature WT BMDC. In a coculture system with LPS- or CpG-stimulated BMDC and naive T cells, Ahr−/− BMDC inhibited <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> differentiation into regulatory T (Treg) cells, which likely facilitated Th 17 cell development and promoted <b>naive</b> <b>T-cell</b> proliferation. Addition of synthetic L-Kyn to the coculture system skewed the differentiation of naive T cells to Treg cells rather than Th 17 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a previously unknown negatively regulatory role for Ahr in DC-mediated immunogenesis in the presence of LPS or CpG, which, in turn, alters the Kyn-dependent generation of Treg cells and Th 17 cells from naive T cells...|$|E

Methods: Freshly purified MDC and PDC obtained from HIV+ subjects and healthy controls were cultured in the presence and absence of TLR ligands (poly I:C or R- 848). We evaluated indices of maturation/activation (CD 83, CD 86, and HLA-DR expression), cytokine secretion (IFN-alpha and IL- 6), and ability to activate allogeneic <b>naïve</b> CD 4 <b>T-cells</b> to secrete IFNgamma and IL- 2. Results: MDC from HIV+ subjects had increased spontaneous IL- 6 production and increased CD 83 and CD 86 expression when compared to MDC of controls.
