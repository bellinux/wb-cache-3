50|$|Ephedrine, a {{sympathomimetic}} amine, acts {{on part of}} {{the sympathetic}} nervous system (SNS). The principal mechanism of action relies on its indirect stimulation of the adrenergic receptor system by increasing the activity of norepinephrine at the postsynaptic α and β receptors. The presence of direct interactions with α receptors is unlikely, but still controversial. L-ephedrine, and particularly its stereoisomer <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> (which is also present in Catha edulis) has indirect sympathomimetic effects and due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it is a CNS stimulant similar to amphetamines, but less pronounced, as it releases noradrenaline and dopamine in the substantia nigra.|$|E
50|$|L-Norpseudoephedrine, or (−)-norpseudoephedrine, is a {{psychostimulant}} drug of the amphetamine family. It {{is one of}} {{the four}} optical isomers of phenylpropanolamine, the other three being cathine ((+)-norpseudoephedrine), (−)-norephedrine, and (+)-norephedrine; as well as one of the two enantiomers of <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> (the other, of course, being cathine). Similarly to cathine, L-norpseudoephedrine acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine (EC50 = 30 nM) {{and to a lesser extent}} of dopamine (EC50 = 294 nM). Due to the 10-fold difference in its potency for inducing the release of the two neurotransmitters however, L-norpseudoephedrine could be called a modestly selective or preferential norepinephrine releasing agent, similarly to related compounds like ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.|$|E

50|$|Earliest uses of Ephedra spp. (mahuang) for {{specific}} illnesses {{date back to}} 5000 BC. Ephedrine and isomers were already isolated in 1881 from Ephedra dystachia and characterized by the Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi of the 19th century. His work to access Ephedra drug materials to isolate a pure pharmaceutical substance, and the systematic production of semi-synthetic derivatives thereof is relevant still today as the three species Ephedra sinica, Ephedra vulgaris {{and to a lesser}} extent Ephedra equisetina are commercially grown in Mainland China as a source for natural ephedrines and isomers for use in pharmacy. E. sinica and E. vulgaris usually carry six optically active phenylethylamines, mostly ephedrine and pseudoephedrine with minor amounts of norephedrine, <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> as well as the three methylated analogs. Reliable information on the total alkaloid content of the crude drug is difficult to obtain.

The (±)-cis isomers are the form used recreationally.The (±)-cis isomers (1:1-mixture) of the (4R,5S)-isomer generally synthesized from dl-phenylpropanolamine in one step by cyclization with cyanogen bromide (sometimes prepared in situ by reacting sodium cyanide with bromine). Alternate synthesis routes generally involve more steps, such as replacing cyanogen bromide with sodium or potassium cyanate {{to form an}} intermediate and then reacting it with concentrated hydrochloric acid.

The (±)-trans isomers (1:1-mixture) of the (4S,5S)-isomer are synthesized in the same manner above but dl-norephedrine is used as the starting material instead. The cyanate reaction proceeds differently from the cyanogen bromide and transforms norephedrine into trans-4-methylaminorex instead, as noted in the DEA micrograph.

40|$|Kakkon-to {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Traditional Chinese Medicine {{preparations}} for the attenuation of colds. Ephedrae Herba {{is one of the}} prescriptions of Kakkon-to. The major ingredients of Ephedrae Herba, ephedrines, are banned substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list. The purpose of this study was to investigate the elimination of urinary ephedrines after administering Kakkon-to and to determine the possibility of urinary positive ephedrine test results. Six healthy volunteers took one single dose of 2. 5 g Kakkon-to extract granules. The concentrations of urinary ephedrines were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The result showed that ephedrine and <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> were excreted in the urine after taking one single dose of Kakkon-to. However, the highest amount of ephedrines in urine was ephedrine and the peak concentration was 4. 35 ± 1. 82 µg/mL (mean ± standard deviation), which was lower than the WADA permitted value (10 µg/mL). The estimated elimination half-lives of ephedrine, norephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> following administration of this preparation were: 5. 2 ± 1. 2, 4. 2 ± 1. 3, 4. 2 ± 0. 9, and 6. 5 ± 2. 8 h, respectively. This study concluded that the urine would not violate the rule of doping after administering a single dose of Kakkon-to.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a simple and robust LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of ephedrine type substances in urine. Sample preparation consisted of a 10 -fold dilution step of the samples into the internal standard solution (ephedrine-d(3), 4 mu g/mL in water). Baseline separation of the diastereoisomers norpseudoephedrine-norephedrine and ephedrine-pseudoephedrine was performed On a C 8 -column using isocratic conditions followed by positive electrospray ionisation and tandem mass spectrometric detection. The mobile phase consisted of 98 / 2 (H 2 O/ACN) containing 0. 1 % HAc and 0. 01 % TFA. Calibration curves were constructed between 2. 5 and 10 mu g/mL for norephedrine and <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> and 5 and 20 mu g/mL for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and methylephedrine. The bias ranged from - 5. 5 to 12 % for norephedrine, - 4. 1 to 8. 0 % for <b>norpseudoephedrine,</b> 0. 3 to 2. 1 % for ephedrine, 1. 6 to 2. 6 % for pseudoephedrine and 2. 9 to 5. 0 % for methylephedrine. Precision of the method varied between 2. 8 and 10. 4 % for all compounds and the matrix effect was less than 15 %. The applicability of the method has been checked by the analysis of 40 urine samples. The results were compared with those obtained with the common GC-NPD method.

The apparent Ki values of the enantiomers/diastereomers of ephedrine and norephedrine and the stereoisomers of deprenyl, tranylcypromine, disopyramide, verapamil, pindolol and quinine/quinidine were determined against the contraluminal organic cation transporter, the luminal H+/organic cation exchanger and the luminal choline+ transporter, using the stop-flow luminal or contraluminal capillary microperfusion method. The ephedrine/norephedrine enantiomers/diastereomers had apparent Ki values against the contraluminal organic cation transporter {{in the range of}} 0. 8 to 2. 4 mM, and only <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> showed significant enantioselectivity. The same substrates had apparent Ki values against the luminal H+/organic cation exchanger between 3. 0 and 15. 0 mM, and ephedrine, norephedrine and <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> showed enantioselectivity. The Ki values against the luminal choline+ transporter were even higher (7. 2 - 19. 1 mM) and demonstrated no enantioselectivity. The verapamil and deprenyl enantiomers showed selectivity against the luminal choline+ transporter, as did quinine and quinidine against the contraluminal organic cation transporter. In all other instances enantioselectivity was not observed. In no case was the difference in the Ki values of the enantiomers/isomers greater than a factor of 3. The data confirm the high degree of nonspecificity of the renal organic cation transporters. Evaluation of three-dimensional molecular models of the ephedrine enantiomers/diastereomers suggests that the spatial orientations of the amino group and, to a lesser extent, the OH group and possibly the terminal CH 3 group are of importance for different interactions with the transporters...|$|E
40|$|Ephedrine is {{classified}} as a sympathomimetic drug and central nervous system stimulant. Its ability {{to act as a}} sympathetic agonist and increase thermogenesis (fat burning) has led to its use in weight loss/fat loss. 1 Ephedrine has also been coupled with both caffeine and aspirin to further enhance its effectiveness (i. e., ECA). Ephedrine stimulates release of norepinephrine, which stimulates the synthesis of prostaglandins by the activated tissues. 1 Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and serves as a prostaglandin blocker, and thereby may prevent inhibition of norepinepherine release. 1 Further, as a central nervous system stimulant, it’s used to reduce fatigue and increase alertness. In most dietary supplements, ephedrine appears as an extract from one of two herbs: ephedra or Ma Huang. Ephedra species have a long tradition of use (more than 5, 000 years) for respiratory ailments. 2 Unlike other herbs, active ingredients are well characterized and consist of ephedrine and related alkaloids (mostly ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and <b>norpseudoephedrine).</b> ...|$|E

The determination of the six alkaloids requires the separation of diastereomic pairs of E 2 ̆ 212 PE, NE 2 ̆ 212 NPE, and ME 2 ̆ 212 MPE. FAIMS was able to resolve/separate these isomeric pairs based on their gas-phase ion mobility differences. The FAIMS-based separation and detection approach has been tested on over-the-counter diet pills. Following the extraction of the tablets, either by pressurized fluid extraction developed in-house or with sonication, the ephedra alkaloids were quantified using a modified isotope dilution approach. Detection limits for the alkaloids ranged from 0. 1 to 3 ng/mL, and a linear range of at least 2 orders of magnitude was observed for the six analytes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} {{molecular}} imprinting technology {{was employed to}} prepare a specific affinity sorbent for the resolution of Cathine, a chiral drug product. The molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared by non-covalent molecular imprinting with either (+) or (−) -Cathine (threo- 2 -amino- 1 -hydroxy- 1 -phenyl propane; <b>norpseudoephedrine)</b> as the template. Methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol di-methacrylate were copolymerized {{in the presence of}} the template molecule. The bulk polymerization was carried out in chloroform with 2, 2 ′-azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator, at 5 °C and under UV radiation. The resulting MIP was ground into powders, which were slurry packed into analytical columns. After removal of template molecules, the MIP-packed columns were found to be effective for the resolution of (±) -Cathine racemates. The separation factor for the enantiomers ranged between 1. 5 and 2. 4 when the column was packed with MIP prepared with (+) -Cathine as the template. A separation factor ranging from 1. 6 to 2. 9 could be achieved from the column packed with MIP, prepared with (−) -Cathine as the template. Although the separation factor was higher with that previously obtained from reversed-phase column chromatography following derivatization with a chiral agent, elution peaks were broader due to the heterogeneity of binding sites on MIP particles and the possible non-specific interaction...|$|E

Acetic acid (pH 2. 5 and 2. 8) {{was found to be}} the optimal background electrolyte for the CE-C 4 D system. The chiral selectors, carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CMBCD), heptakis(2, 6 -di-O-methyl) -beta-cyclodextrin (DMBCD) and chiral crown ether (+) -(18 -crown- 6) - 2, 3, 11, 12 -tetracarboxylic acid (18 C 6 H 4), were investigated for their enantioseparation properties in the BGE. The use of either a single or a combination of two chiral selectors was chosen to obtain optimal condition of enantiomeric selectivity. Enantiomeric separation of AP and MA was achieved using the single chiral selector CMBCD and (hydroxypropyl) methyl cellulose (HPMC) as the modifier. A combination of the two chiral selectors, CMBCD and DMBCD and HPMC as the modifier, was required for enantiomeric separation of EP and PE. In addition, a combination of DMBCD and 18 C 6 H 4 was successfully applied for the enantiomeric separation of NE and NPE. The detection limits of the enantiomers were found to be in the range of 2. 35. 7 mu mol/L. Good precisions of migration time and peak area were obtained.

40|$|A {{new method}} for threo-selective {{synthesis}} of β-amino alcohols is described. This method employs N-diphenylmethylene-protected α-amino esters as starting materials. The α-amino ester {{is reduced to}} the oxidation state of an aldehyde with DIBAL or DIBAL:TRIBAL (1 : 1) followed by sequential addition of various Grignards and alkenyllithiums. The method is highly threo-selective (stereoselectivities ranged from 8 : 1 to > 20 : 1) and provides <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> and threo-sphingosine analogs in enantiomerically enriched form (> 97 % ee). The mechanism of C-C bond formation was examined. A stable aluminoxy-acetal intermediate (generated by DIBAL reduction of the ester) was trapped with TMS-imidazole and isolated as the corresponding siloxy-acetal. The stereochemical outcome of the C-C bond forming step was shown to correlate with the steric bulk of the ester moiety. Bulky ester groups showed the greatest degree of threo-selectivity. These {{results suggest that the}} aluminoxy-acetal intermediate may be involved in determining stereoselectivity via either a tight-ion S(N) 1 -like or S(N) 2 -like reaction mechanism. A series of glycosyl acceptors was synthesized from N-diphenylmethylene-protected threo-sphingosine derivatives. These glycosyl acceptors undergo β-specific glycosylation using the method developed in this laboratory. This method capitalizes on a favorable hydrogen-bonding pattern imparted by the N-diphenylmethylene-protection. The favorable hydrogen-bonding enhances the nucleophilicity of the glycosyl acceptor relative to glycosyl acceptors with more conventional N-protection (i. e. Cbz, Boc, acyl etc.). This enhanced nucleophilicity allows the glycosylation to be carried out under mild conditions (AgOTfl, CH₂CI₂, RT overnight) and provides the corresponding β-glycosphingolipids in approximately 70 % chemical yield...|$|E
40|$|A {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis (CZE) method, with UV {{detection and}} {{in the presence of}} dimethyl-beta-CD, was optimized by means of an experimental design for the separation and the simultaneous quantitation of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) and <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> (cathine) in urine without any extraction. In this application, the optimization of the analytical conditions with an experimental design was preferred to a univariate study. Therefore, a central composite design was used and the following factors were investigated and varied simultaneously: buffer concentration, buffer pH and dimethyl-beta-CD concentration. In order to evaluate the influence of each experimental parameter on the analytical separation, the resolutions between the four compounds, as well as the separation time and generated current were observed and established as responses of the experimental design. A model was obtained for each response by linear multiple regression of a second-degree mathematical expression. After acceptance of the mathematical models, the most favorable conditions were determined by maximizing the resolutions between the four compounds and by setting the other responses at threshold values. Successful results were obtained with a 260 mM Tris-phosphate buffer at pH 3. 5 in the presence of 13. 3 mM dimethyl-beta-CD at 25 degreesC and with an applied voltage of 30 W Under these optimized conditions, a baseline separation of the four compounds was achieved in less than 6 min.

40|$|<b>Norpseudoephedrine</b> (NPE), the {{enantiomer}} of cathine and {{a structural}} analog of phenylpropanolamine, shows anorectic and antidipsic effects {{that have been}} referred to its structural analogies with amphetamine. When amphetamine is chronically administered to rats, its anorectic effects fade out, water intake is progressively increased, and the diuretic response to the drug remains stable. Our previous studies show that chronic administration of NPE does not produce the typical amphetamine hyperdipsic response. In the present study, designed to obtain a more detailed picture of the ingestive and diuretic effects of chronic exposure to NPE, we evaluated the effects of 11 daily administrations of three doses of NPE (17, 32, and 56 mg/kg IP) on food and water intake, {{as well as on}} diuresis, in rats maintained in conditions of free access to food and water. Results show that all three doses inhibited food intake at 2 h, whereas only the highest dose inhibited food intake at 5 h. No differences between groups were detected at 24 h. These responses remained unchanged throughout the 11 days of treatment, and substitution of NPE with a solvent injection caused no rebound feeding. NPE treatment did not modify the ingestive response to a challenge injection of amphetamine, 0. 56 and 1. 0 mg/kg IP, given 1 day apart. Although NPE inhibited water intake throughout the experiment, it did so significantly only during the first 2 h postinjection. Urine output in the NPE-treated groups increased significantly on the first day only. These findings make it unlikely that the anorectic effects of NPE depend on an amphetamine-like mechanism of action. In addition, the short-lasting anorectic and antidipsic effects of NPE and the lack of tolerance to them raise the possibility of a therapeutic use of this drug as an adjuvant in the therapy of eating disorders characterized by binge episode...|$|E
40|$|Ephedra, or ma huang, {{refers to}} the above ground portion of the plants that {{comprise}} the genus ephedra. Although the species of ephedra differ in their chemical composition, the content of biologically active compounds in these plants is mainly due to ephedrine (other compounds being pseudoephedrine, <b>norpseudoephedrine</b> cathine, and norephedrine phenylpropanolamine). Ephedrine is similar in chemical structure and biological function to amphetamine, although having a 25 -fold lower biological potency. Nonetheless, ephedrine is a potent central and peripheral nervous system stimulant, causing the stimulation of both Î± and Î² adrenergic receptors, {{and the release of}} dopamine within the brain and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from sympathetic nerves within and external to the CNS. These mechanisms of action cause bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, variable peripheral vasculature constriction and dilation, general feelings of emotional and/or psychological arousal and increased alertness, and an accelerated metabolic rate. The biological responses to ephedrine have lead to its use as a stimulant in efforts to improve exercise performance, and assist in weight loss. It has been estimated that at least 3 billion doses of over-the-counter ephedrine or extracts from ephedra were ingested in the U. S. in 2000 for the purpose of stimulating increased weight loss. In addition, compounds high in ephedrine, such as over-the-counter medications to treat sinus congestion or symptoms of the common cold, can be and are used to synthesize the illegal drug metamphetamine. Intake of ephedrine exposes the user to unacceptable negative side effects, including mood disturbances, abnormal heart function, hypertension, gastrointestinal dysfunction and headache, while providing small amounts of added weight loss and/or central nervous system stimulation. Furthermore, individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease or other illnesses may be at more serious health risk when taking ephedrine. Individuals who need to lose weight (body fat) should rely on modifications to diet and increased daily physical activity and exercise. The need for body fat loss rather than gross weight loss should also be recommended and understood. Where additional assistance is needed in body fat reduction, individuals should consult a registered dietitian or their physician...|$|E
