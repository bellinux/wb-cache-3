40|$|The {{mutagenicity}} test methodology in vitro {{has been extensively}} used during recent years {{in the identification of}} potential carcinogenic agents. Mutagenic analyses have been applied to the study of chemical reaction products for the demonstration of the formation of mutagenic agents. Recent studies have indicated that secondary and tertiary amines, when reacted with nitrite in acidic conditions, yield N-nitroso compounds, including the potent carcinogen <b>N-dimethylnitrosamine</b> (NDMA). This finding raises the problem of risk evaluation of several food components of human diets for the presence of potential carcinogenic compounds. By combining a {{mutagenicity test}} procedure with yeast cells inoculated into the blood system of mice and incubated in the liver for various times (minutes or hours) we have devised a model methodology which allows the detection of the formation of <b>N-dimethylnitrosamine</b> (NDMA) at a level lower than 1 mg/kg. The methodology has been examined for its use in the study of activators of the nitrosation, such as thiocyanate, and of inhibitors of the nitrosation, such as ascorbic acid and tannic acid. Other food components of the human diet, such as red wine, have also been investigated by this methodology...|$|E
40|$|Mitotic {{recombination}} {{induced by}} six alkylating agents {{has been studied}} in the wing-spot test of Drosophila melanogaster. The model mutagens chosen have different modes of action at the DNA level. These are: the direct-acting small alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), the small promutagens <b>N-dimethylnitrosamine</b> (DMN), and N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN), the bifunctional cross-linking alkylating agents mitomycin C (MMC), chlorambucil (CLA) and monocrotaline (MCT). Flies of the standard cross (flr(3) /TM 3, Bd(S) females and mwh males) were used to produce the larvae to be treated. Three-day-old Drosophila larvae were exposed by chronic feeding for 48 h to three different concentrations of all six alkylating agents. Acute feeding for only 2 h was used in addition with DEN and MMC. Wings of the marker-heterozygous (mvh+/+flr(3)) {{as well as of}} the balancer-heterozygous (mwh+/TM 3, Bd(S)) progeny were analysed. The ranking of the compounds with respect to their genotoxic potency, based on mwh clone formation frequency in marker-heterozygous wings, was: MMS > MMC > DMN > CLA similar to MCT > DEN. The ranking with respect to the induction of twin spots, which are produced by mitotic recombination exclusively, was: MMS > DMN > MMC > MCT > CLA > DEN. The quantitative determination of recombinagenic activity, based on mwh clone formation frequencies obtained in both types of wings, gave the following values: MMS, 93...|$|E
