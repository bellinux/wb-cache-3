During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, after {{a highly}} publicized feud between Finkelstein and an {{academic}} opponent, Alan Dershowitz, Finkelstein's tenure bid at DePaul was denied. Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision. In 2008, he was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May 1850, Joaquim Inácio was {{appointed}} inspector {{of the naval}} shipyard at Rio de Janeiro.

He spent that period in the capital overseeing the construction and repair of several sailing vessels and steamships for the Brazilian armada. He was promoted to chief of division (modern-day rear admiral) on 3 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to make contact with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E
5|$|HMS Levant was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate of the , {{which saw}} Royal Navy service against France in the Seven Years' War, and against France, Spain and the American colonies during the American Revolutionary War. Principally a hunter of privateers, {{she was also}} {{designed}} to be a match for small French frigates, but with a broader hull and sturdier build at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability. Launched in 1758, Levant was assigned to the Royal Navy's Jamaica station from 1759 and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.|$|E

5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with the}} Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E
5|$|Officially having <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{provisional}} government, Castro exercised a {{great deal}} of influence, largely because of his popularity and control of the rebel army. Ensuring the government implemented policies to cut corruption and fight illiteracy, he did not initially force through any radical proposals. Attempting to rid Cuba's government of Batistanos, the Congress elected under Batista was abolished, and all those elected in the rigged elections of 1954 and 1958 were banned from politics. The government now ruling by decree, Castro pushed the president to issue a temporary ban on all political parties, but repeatedly stated that they would get around to organizing multiparty elections; this never occurred. He began meeting members of the Popular Socialist Party, believing they had the intellectual capacity to form a socialist government, but repeatedly denied being a communist himself.|$|E

The attorney admitted inquiring of White House aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client.

5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|The first ironclads {{to enter}} {{service in the}} Regia Marina of the newly-unified Kingdom of Italy, Formidabile and Terribile served as {{the core of the}} fleet that was later fleshed out by the , , and es that would see action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy. The war broke out in June 1866, as Italy, which had allied with Prussia, sought to take {{advantage}} of the Austro-Prussian War to seize Austrian-controlled Venice. After initially remaining in port, the Italian fleet under Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano launched an attack on the island of Lissa in mid-July; the Austrian fleet under Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff sortied to mount a counterattack, which resulted in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidable, which had been badly damaged during an engagement with Austrian coastal fortifications on Lissa the day before, had withdrawn by the time Tegetthoff arrived and took no part in the battle. Terribile also played <b>no</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> action, as she had been stationed too far to the south in preparation for another attack on the island, and she arrived on the scene of the battle only after the two fleets had disengaged.|$|E
