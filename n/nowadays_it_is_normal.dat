At first, it was frowned upon due to blue laws, but then cities like Chicago, St. Louis, and Cincinnati decided to legalize them. Other cities such as New York City and Philadelphia had intense political and court battles to legalize the games. <b>Nowadays,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>normal</b> for baseball to be played on Sundays in the United States.|$|E
40|$|The world attracts {{more and}} more {{students}} and <b>nowadays</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>normal</b> to travel abroad for an internship. Exciting adventures and international work experience are obvious positive effects, {{but the fact is}} that culture related issues arise. The European Commission for Education and Learning funds SKILL 2 E, a project that among all strives to minimize problems related to cultural misunderstandings and one of the main goals of the project is to create a cultural mentoring program for students in universities. The key word is international cooperation and the target is to build a program beneficial for all stakeholders: students, universities and enterprises providing internship possibilities. By interviewing three students with international work experience and investigating previous mentoring researches will this thesis seek answers to what students see as an ideal mentor, what the tasks of a mentor should be and what kind of mentoring relationships leads to the best outcome. The research is supported by a theoretical framework, addressing cultures, working abroad and mentoring. The results of this research show that a mentor’s gender and age are irrelevant for students and the focus should rather be on the mentor’s qualities. Based on the interviews and previous research, students want...|$|E
40|$|Commuting is regular {{travelling}} between one?s {{place of}} residence and the place of work. A lot of us surely remember our grandmothers and grandfathers talking keenly how they {{used to go to}} work to a farm, weaving factory, distillery and further facilities. <b>It</b> used to <b>be</b> usual that people had jobs at distances they could walk. On the other hand <b>nowadays</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite <b>normal</b> that some people have their places of work tens of kilometres from their homes and they have to commute by various means of transport, get up {{early in the morning and}} return late in the evening. Technical evolution has made transport faster but it also brought longer distances to travel to work. Commuting is particularly necessary at places with imbalance between supply of and demand for jobs. About one third of inhabitants commute in the Czech Republic and the travel costs represent approximately ten per cent of family budgets. People that spend more time travelling to work are wrong tempered, they are tired and stressed by commuting and occupational accidents occur as a subsequence of these factors. The aim of the Thesis ??Commuting time and workplace accidents?q was to discover what the average commuting time was and whether commuting affected the health condition of a human. Another aim was to find out how frequent workplace accidents were and how consistent employees were in reporting workplace accidents. 5 hypotheses were set to reach the aim. A quantitative method of questionnaire survey was applied on the research; the data were collected from commuting employees of a health facility, a school and a manufacturing company and compared. The data analyses did not prove that commuting caused health problems, so the hypothesis No. 1 was refuted. The second hypothesis suggesting that people from villages spend more time commuting than those living in towns was confirmed. Another hypothesis that each employee has suffered from a workplace accident was on the other hand refuted. The fourth hypothesis suggesting that fatigue, bad concentration, insomnia as a subsequence of commutation cause workplace accidents was also refuted. The last hypothesis suggesting that employees often do not inform their employers on their workplace accidents was also refuted. The Bachelor Thesis may improve knowledge of the time spent by commuting to work and subsequent occurrence of workplace accidents. The manual designed proposes preventive measures against workplace accidents and brings information in this field...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I provide a {{critical}} discourse {{analysis of the}} critique to factory farming as articulated by the animal welfare organization Wakker Dier that is based in The Netherlands. The research is conducted by the means of a discursive comparison between dominant rhetoric that ideologically normalizes and validates the factory farming industry, {{in relation to the}} counter-discourse used in their campaigns. The main question that structures this research is: To what extent can the counter-discourse used by Walker Dier be considered a discursive turn from ideological assumptions that normalize and validate the factory farming industry? In order to come to a conclusion, I discuss the following sub questions: Why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> important to analyze what kind of ideology the discourse offered by WD counters? Which ideological assumptions constitute the current discourse? What kind of counter- discourse does Wakker Dier offer in their campaigns? In order to explore these questions, I discuss the construction of discursive struggles and transformations from the theoretical framework of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). I argue that the key societal norms that construct the dominant discourse are centered on ideas of an assumed sellability, killability, edibility and ownability of farmed animals. I briefly elaborate on such a definition in economic terms by illustrating how these norms show in practice. <b>Nowadays,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> considered <b>normal</b> that farmed animals exist to be sources of products for human consumption, such as meat, dairy and eggs that can be sold. They are lawfully recognized to be the property of industrials, who systematically breed and slaughter them. Moreover, the norm of a pre-natural death caused by a human is assumed to be unavoidable. Upon providing this analysis, I argue that these norms are shaped by essentialist thought and power mechanisms of hierarchy and domination. I support these arguments by building on an eco-feminist theoretical framework, and state that dividing the world in binary dualisms, such as the human/non-human binary, forms an important part {{in the construction of the}} discourse concerning farmed animals. By hierarchizing such a binary, the non-human is made inferior to the human and therefore less deserving of freedom from violence. Afterwards, I investigate to what extent the ideology that validates the factory farming industry is being countered and/or reproduced. This happens by the means of a discourse analysis of data that are characteristic for the organization, selected from their website and social media channels. Upon analysis of this imagery, I conclude by stating that the counter-discourse employed by Wakker Dier forms a possible start of a discursive change. My main argument to support this statement is that in my findings it becomes clear that they counter alienation from the suffering of farmed animals who are merely considered to be products. Showing the consequences contributes to counter the dominant idea that the factory farming industry is a valid economic practice without any ethical implications. In the second part of my conclusion I stress that even though countering alienation might increase awareness on the treatment of farmed animals, the norms of killability, edibility, sellability and ownability are still being articulated. This shows in the many examples in which the use of non-human bodies to serve as an extraction of economic resources is not explicitly rejected. Still, the edibility of the bodies of species who are considered to be food is being reproduced. The framing of the assumed function of their bodies are still shaped by mechanisms of essentialism: species such as cows, chickens and pigs are deemed ‘to be farmed’ by humans. By doing so, the organization often normalizes a discourse that validates the exploitation of farmed animals. In sum, I argue for a move beyond these societal norms. I propose to achieve this by persuading a continuous reflection and evaluation of discursive transformations by those who are active in creating them, as well as more academic analysis furthering the development of anti-speciesist counter-discourse. In my perspective, this should happen with the aim to deconstruct the ideological forces that currently allow for the validity of the factory farming industry...|$|R
