30|$|From a {{developmental}} perspective, scholars classified human <b>needs</b> into survival <b>needs,</b> development <b>needs,</b> and transcendence <b>needs</b> (Marx, 1961; Mo, 2013; Zhang, 2016). Survival <b>needs</b> refer primarily to <b>needs</b> {{related to the}} satisfaction of basic material conditions; personal development <b>needs</b> refer to the <b>needs</b> for spiritual development and enjoyment after basic material <b>needs</b> have been satisfied; and transcendence <b>needs</b> are derived <b>needs,</b> meaning, similar to self-actualization in Maslow’s hierarchy, the pursuit of ideal human preferences such as truth, beauty, and kindness.|$|R
5000|$|According to Maslow, {{the concept}} of <b>need</b> can be defined {{primarily}} by an individual's goals. (Larsen & Buss, 2008) Maslow was a firm believer of self-actualization, {{the process of becoming}} [...] "more and more what one idiosyncratically is, becoming everything that one is capable of becoming." [...] (Larson & Buss, 2008) Maslow believed that <b>needs</b> were hierarchically organized, with more basic <b>needs</b> found toward the bottom of the hierarchy and the self-actualization <b>need</b> at the top. The <b>needs</b> defined by Murray and Maslow (physiological <b>needs,</b> safety <b>needs,</b> belongingness <b>needs,</b> esteem <b>needs,</b> self-actualization <b>needs)</b> seem to correspond with the vital <b>needs</b> encompassed in {{the concept of}} dependency <b>need.</b>|$|R

50|$|While each <b>need</b> is {{important}} in and of itself, he also believed that <b>needs</b> can support other <b>needs,</b> conflict with one another, and can be interrelated. He coined the term subsidation of <b>needs</b> when two or more <b>needs</b> are combined {{in order to satisfy}} a more powerful <b>need</b> and fusion of <b>needs</b> when a single action satisfies more than one <b>need</b> (Flett, 2008). For example, the <b>need</b> for dominance may conflict the <b>need</b> with affiliation when overly controlling behavior drives away family, romantic partners, and friends. Environmental factors play a role in how these psychogenic <b>needs</b> are displayed in behavior.|$|R

After the Tech kickoff and a touchback, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell scrambled for six more on a rushing play. Facing third down and <b>needing</b> four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender James Anderson jumped and caught the ball, intercepting it. Still on his feet, Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, unimpeded, ran 39yards {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point lead—35–24—with 4:45 remaining in the game.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that assessments of <b>need</b> thwarting better predict diminished functioning and ill-being compared to low <b>need</b> satisfaction, which better predict optimal functioning and well-being. In this study we aimed to further explore the important theoretical distinction between psychological <b>need</b> thwarting and <b>need</b> satisfaction in the domain of interpersonal relationships. We examined whether the distinction between <b>need</b> satisfaction and thwarting is due to method effects resulting from positive and negative item wording, however, multitrait multi-method analyses indicated no substantial method effects. Further, we showed that a lack of <b>need</b> satisfaction (i. e., <b>need</b> dissatisfaction) is not equivalent to experiences of <b>need</b> thwarting. In fact, <b>need</b> thwarting better predicted compromised relational functioning compared to <b>need</b> dissatisfaction. <b>Need</b> satisfaction was a stronger predictor of interpersonal competence compared to <b>need</b> thwarting and <b>need</b> dissatisfaction. The current findings underline the importance of assessing <b>need</b> thwarting when examining compromised functioning in interpersonal relationships...|$|R

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Abraham Maslow {{was a key}} {{contributor to}} the establishment of a dependency <b>need</b> theory. His <b>need</b> theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of <b>Needs,</b> is thought to help a person achieve the unsatisfied <b>needs</b> of one's self. In his hierarchy, he outlined five <b>needs</b> crucial to human development and happiness across the lifespan; they are thought to occur in stages. The five stages include, physiological <b>needs,</b> safety <b>needs,</b> social <b>needs,</b> self-esteem <b>needs,</b> and self-actualization. Physiological <b>needs</b> are <b>needs</b> that everyone has to have in order to survive, such as air, food, water, and sleep. After a person has attained these physiological <b>needs,</b> he or she then focuses his or her attention to safety <b>needs.</b> Safety <b>needs</b> help an individual feel secure in order to make him or her feel safe, physically and emotionally. An example of this can be seen in people's choices of where they choose to live and work, and attaining medical insurance. After safety <b>needs</b> are met, social <b>needs</b> are the focus of attention. Social <b>needs</b> have to do with interactions with others (friends, family, romantic partners) and receiving love. After these <b>needs</b> have been met, one's self-esteem <b>needs</b> begin to arise. Esteem <b>needs</b> can be both internal and external. Having and achieving self-respect, receiving attention, and accomplishing achievements are examples of self-esteem <b>needs.</b> After one succeeds in the area of self-esteem, self-actualization <b>needs</b> are to be met. One's full potential as a person, his or her self-actualization, helps him or her keep developing as a person throughout the lifespan. (Maslow, 2002) ...|$|R

50|$|Changes {{regarding}} {{the importance and}} satisfaction of <b>needs</b> from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, {{there was only one}} level of <b>needs</b> since all <b>needs</b> were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of <b>needs</b> during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological <b>needs,</b> safety <b>needs,</b> and psychological <b>needs</b> (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological <b>needs</b> and safety <b>needs</b> were separated into two independent <b>needs</b> while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of <b>needs</b> changed from three levels to two during wartime.|$|R
