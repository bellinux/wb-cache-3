25|$|The {{quantity}} and quality of jobs in the cigar industry would continue to fall as Tampa's manufacturers underwent a near-universal shift to mechanization. Replacing traditional hand-rolled cigars with machine-made varieties allowed cigar firms to employ fewer workers and pay them less. Even when demand quickly increased to record levels during American's post-war boom, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>employed</b> in Ybor City's factories continued to decrease due to more efficient machines. By then, Tampa's economy was buoyed by other industries such as shipping and tourism. However, little new activity had replaced cigar manufacturing in Ybor City, and job seekers often had to look elsewhere for employment.|$|E
500|$|The Congo {{had become}} {{increasingly}} centralised economically during the Great Depression of the 1930s, as the Belgian government encouraged the production there of cotton, which had {{value on the}} international market. The greatest economic demands on the Congo were related to raw materials.

In order to increase production for the war effort, the colonial authorities increased the hours and the speed at which workers, both European and African, were expected to work. This led to increasing labour unrest across the colony. Discontent among the white population was also increased by the raising of a 40 percent [...] "war tax". High taxes and price controls were enforced from 1941, limiting the amount of profit that could be made and curbing profiteering.|$|E

This machine-readable version of John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics {{is the result of}} a collaboration between the Statistical Directorate of the National Assembly for Wales, the History Data Service and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis at Queen's University Belfast. John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B. R. and Deane, P. (1962) Abstract of British historical statistics and Mitchell, B. R. and Jones, H. G. (1971) Second abstract of British historical statistics. Main Topics : The main tables are: Crops. Acreage 1867 - 1974 Acreage by county, 1867 - 1972 <b>Numbers</b> <b>of</b> livestock, 1913 - 1974 <b>Numbers</b> <b>of</b> livestock by county, 1867 - 1972 Estimated production of principal crops, 1885 - 1974 Estimated yields of principal crops, 1885 - 1974 Size of agricultural holdings 1875 - 1974 and percentage of holding and acreage owned by occupiers, by county, 1887 - 19 70 Size of agricultural holdings, by county, 1875 - 1974 <b>Numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>employed</b> on agricultural holdings, 1921 - 1974 <b>Numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>employed</b> on agricultural holdings, by county, 1921 - 1974 Prices.

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to analyse the process of proletarianisation in Swazi society with {{particular}} reference to the sugar industry in that country. We have also tried to explain why women's labour tends to be located in both subsistence and commodity agriculture, and what the implications of this are for the social, economic and political status of women in Swazi society. Through an analysis of the historical processes which led to colonisation and the consequent land alienation, labour migration, taxation and exploitation of the Swazi people, the study has tried to show the socio-economic and political consequences of capitalist development within Swaziland over the last century. We have also discussed the emergence and decline of white settler agriculture and shown how, together with the collaboration of the colonial state, white commodity agriculture laid the basis for the development of agribusiness in the economy, especially in relation to the sugar industry. Within the sugar industry itself, which has dominated the Swazi economy for the last thirty years in terms <b>of</b> land use, <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>employed,</b> and the size of national revenue generated, there is an ongoing struggle between labour and capital, which manifests itself in various forms, both overt and covert. The history of working class resistance in the industry vis-a-vis capital and the colonial and neo-colonial state, is discussed with a view to better understanding this section of the Swazi proletariat in anticipation of the revolutionary changes which are sweeping across the Southern African sub-continent...|$|R
