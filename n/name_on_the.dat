5|$|Argentine {{football}} finally inscribed their <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> winner's list in 1964 when Independiente {{became the}} champions after disposing of reigning champions Santos and Uruguayan side Nacional in the finals. Independiente successfully defended the title in 1965; Peñarol would defeat River Plate {{in a playoff}} to win their third title, and Racing {{would go on to}} claim the spoils in 1967. One of the most important moments in the tournament's early history occurred in 1968 which saw Estudiantes participate for the first time.|$|E

The highway runs through the community of the same <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side of the river. M-13 and Huron Road continue north across mixed agricultural and forest land as they pass through the communities of Linwood and Pinconning. South of Standish in Arenac County, M-13 meets the northern end of the US23 freeway and terminates.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{proceeds}} to the enclave, {{where he is}} met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist. Bond meets Solomon Adeka and realises that the leader will shortly die of cancer: his mission to kill Adeka is needless. Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment coming into the country, all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck; the aeroplanes all show the AfriKIN <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries {{to leave the country}} on one of the supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{service members}} {{continued}} the hoax, with Burdell's name appearing on various fronts. For example, he was {{listed on the}} flight crew of a B-17 bomber, flying twelve missions over Europe with the 8th Air Force in England, until a Georgia Tech graduate became the new operations officer, recognized the <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flight log, and ended the charade.|$|E

5|$|Frederick rewarded {{him with}} Order of the Black Eagle {{on the field}} after the Battle of Rossbach; he had already {{received}} the Pour le Mérite for his action at the Battle of Kolin. Although estranged from Frederick for several years, the two were reconciled during Seydlitz's final illness. Seydlitz died in 1773, and Frederick's heirs included his <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, {{in a place of}} honor.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother {{of the late}} president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, 2011, Gumby Comics/Wildcard Ink {{published}} a single volume collecting Adams' previous two specials featuring Gumby. The book was initially called Gumby's Arthur Adams Specials, but was eventually published with a sticker covering Adams' <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cover, effectively renaming the book Gumby's Spring Specials. According to Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool, {{this was done}} on Adams' request, who {{wanted nothing to do}} with the publisher, and took action to keep his name off the book's cover. The book is nonetheless sold by merchants such as Mile High Comics under its originally intended name.|$|E

50|$|The {{logic of}} {{opposition}} puts conscious awareness {{in opposition to}} being influenced. One {{way to do this}} is simply to correctly inform subjects (in the case of this fame procedure) that all of <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study list were non-famous. Thus if a subjects recollects that a <b>name</b> was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study list, s/he can confidently identify it as non-famous. Jacoby, Woloshyn, and Kelley (1989) found that when subjects had studied the list with full attention, these opposition instructions led them to be less likely to endorse studied names as famous than to endorse non-studied names as famous. That shows (a) that they sometimes recognized <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fame test as <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study list and (b) that they understood that <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study list were nonfamous. The cool finding was that subjects who studied the list of names under divided attention more often called studied names famous than non-studied names. Presumably dividing attention at study impaired subject ability to consciously recollect which <b>names</b> had been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list, but left intact more automatic, unconscious influences of familiarity.|$|R

5|$|On November 8, 2010, The Greencards {{announced}} that they would self-finance the production on their next album, set for May 2011, rather than taking an advance from a record company. The Buy A Brick campaign is selling a package of an advance copy of the final CD, a digital image of the album artwork, video updates of the recording of the album and the subscriber's name (up to twenty characters) on the album artwork. Subscriptions are either $100 or $200 US with the more expensive package getting the album one week earlier and the subscriber's <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the CD package.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s decade {{ended with}} Murphy doing three westerns. He co-starred with 14-year-old Sandra Dee in the 1959 film The Wild and the Innocent. The film's cast was rounded out with {{respected}} talent {{of the era}} in Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. His collaboration with Walter Mirisch on {{the black and white}} Cast a Long Shadow included an uncredited stint as co-producer. The film co-starred Terry Moore. His performance in No <b>Name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bullet was well received. The storyline follows the cool, jaded hired gun as the townspeople are gripped with fear by his presence.|$|E

5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. It explored {{what is now called}} the Ross Sea and discovered the Ross Ice Shelf. On the expedition, Ross discovered the Transantarctic Mountains and the volcanoes Erebus and Terror, named after his ships. The young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker made his <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{football}} team followed by many East End people is West Ham United, founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks. The 'other' East London clubs are Leyton Orient, {{and to a}} lesser extent Dagenham and Redbridge, but rather than rivalry, there is some overlap of support. Millwall F.C. originally played in the area of that <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Dogs, but moved south of the Thames in 1910.|$|E
5|$|While {{training}} for the World Championships in Tokyo, Sacramone tore her Achilles tendon. She returned to the U.S. immediately for surgery. However, the team kept her <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roster, and she was given a gold medal despite not competing. This gave her the most World Championships medals of any female American gymnast, with ten. Simone Biles would break that record in 2015.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, {{for reasons}} unknown, the Wanderers, despite having turned aside four challengers, did not record their <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cup. The next year, the Ottawa Senators added a second band onto the Cup. Despite the new room, the 1910 Wanderers and the 1911 Senators {{did not put}} their <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cup. The 1915 Vancouver Millionaires became the second team to engrave players' names, this time inside the bowl along its sides.|$|R
5|$|Writer Mike Schur made a cameo {{appearance}} in the episode, appearing in a photograph as Dwight's Amish cousin Mose.

Mose {{was based on an}} actual participant, with the same <b>name,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> UPN reality show Amish in the City.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dollar, {{and the design}} was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E
5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with his <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states {{that there has been}} no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
