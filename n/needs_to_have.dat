5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

5|$|The Master himself may remain, as may one ecclesiastic {{designated}} by the Congregations prior to the commencement of the election. The ecclesiastic makes a speech concerning the problems facing the Church and on the qualities the new pope <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have.</b> After the speech concludes, the ecclesiastic leaves. Following the recitation of prayers, the Cardinal Dean asks if any doubts relating to procedure remain. After the clarification of the doubts, the election may commence. Cardinals who arrive after the conclave has begun are admitted nevertheless. An ill cardinal may leave the conclave and later be readmitted; a cardinal who leaves for any reason other than illness may {{not return to the}} conclave.|$|E

25|$|One more {{issue is}} that some complex {{instructions}} are difficult to restart, e.g. following a page fault. In some cases, restarting from the beginning will work (although wasteful), {{but in many cases}} this would give incorrect results. Therefore, the machine <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some hidden state to remember which parts went through and what remains to be done. With a load/store machine, the program counter is sufficient to describe the state of the machine.|$|E
25|$|The fishery of Antarctic krill is on {{the order}} of 100,000tonnes per year. The major {{catching}} nations are South Korea, Norway, Japan and Poland. The products are used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> very fine meshes, producing a very high drag, which generates a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend to clog very fast.|$|E
25|$|Before {{becoming}} a member party, an organization <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been an {{observer of the}} EFA {{for at least one}} year. Only one member party per region is allowed. If a second party from a region wants to join the EFA, the first party needs to agree, at which point these two parties will then form a common delegation with one vote. The EFA also recognises friends of the EFA, a special status for regionalist parties outside of the European Union.|$|E

25|$|A severe {{drought in}} the United Kingdom <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the high {{pressure}} {{in charge of}} the weather for an extended period, commonly for weeks or even months at a time. Most often sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and intensification of the mid latitude westerlies in the Pacific can bring a stable anticyclone, meaning that the pressure can remain above average for weeks, or even months at a time, allowing the heat to build and dry weather to continue during the anticyclonic system.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} the text and {{conversation}} exchange is reciprocal: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using punctuation, bracketing or framing. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs. Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of text to conversation and the translation of conversation into text.|$|E

It also has the responsibility to stop and start devices on demand—this can happen when a bus (such as USB or IEEE 1394 FireWire) gains a new device and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a device driver loaded to support it. Its bulk is actually implemented in user mode, in the Plug and Play Service, which handles the often complex tasks of installing the appropriate drivers, notifying services and applications of the arrival of new devices, and displaying GUI to the user.|$|E

25|$|Powerball uses two barrels to {{determine}} its winning numbers: six numbers are drawn at random from a barrel of 40 (standard winning numbers), then one number, the namesake Powerball, is drawn at random from a separate barrel of 20. To win first division the player <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> all six numbers in their game as well as select the correct Powerball. For coupon entries; the Powerball is selected in a separate box to the winning numbers. In an automated pick a computer randomly allocates the player six numbers {{as well as a}} Powerball for each game line.|$|E
25|$|Priority Ducking is used {{to lower}} {{the level of a}} microphone(s) and/or program {{material}} based on a source signal from another microphone, {{for the duration of the}} signal present at the source microphone. It restores the original level once the source signal has ceased. This is useful when a) program material needs to attenuate in order to accentuate the voice of a narrator, b) one microphone is used by a chairman or master of ceremonies, and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> priority over other mics and/or program material, or c) a paging mic must attenuate all other signals.|$|E
25|$|In Simple Electromagnetic Analysis (SEMA) attacks, the {{attacker}} deduces the key directly by observing the trace. It is very effective against asymmetric cryptography implementations. Typically, {{only a few}} traces are needed, though {{the attacker}} <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a strong understanding of the cryptographic device and of {{the implementation of the}} cryptographic algorithm. An implementation vulnerable to SEMA attacks will perform a different operation depending on whether the bit of the key is 0 or 1, which will use different amounts of power and/or different chip components. This method is prevalent in many different types of side-channel attacks, in particular, power analysis attacks. Thus, the attacker can observe the entire computation of encryption and can deduce the key.|$|E

25|$|This sort of scheme <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a far broader base than is {{currently}} the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One {{of the problems is}} once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a “waste” but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the former East Germany, organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Implementing {{appropriate}} proxemic cues {{has been}} shown to improve success in monitored behavioral situations like psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see active listening). Instructional situations have likewise seen increased success in student performance by lessening the actual or perceived distance between the student and the educator (perceived distance is manipulated in the case of instructional videoconferencing, using technological tricks such as angling the frame and adjusting the zoom). Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with stigmatized minorities within a population. For example, those who do not have experience dealing with disabled persons tend to create more distance during encounters because they are uncomfortable. Others may judge that the disabled person <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.|$|E
25|$|Historically, in many countries, a {{contract}} <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a stamp affixed {{to make it}} valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or {{a percentage of the}} value of the transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but stamp duty remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments, and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty land tax, are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity. In the United States, transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and (in the case of real property transfers) can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents.|$|E
