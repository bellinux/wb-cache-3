40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{prevalent}} neurodegenerative disorder with multifactorial {{causes that}} requires multitargeted treatment. Inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) improve cholinergic signaling {{in the central}} nervous system and thus AChE inhibitors are well established in the therapy of AD to improve memory disturbances and other cognitive symptoms. On the other hand, AD patients benefit from redn. of pathol. glutamate-induced, Ca 2 +-mediated excitotoxicity by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR) antagonist memantine. New drugs that simultaneously affect both cholinergic transmission and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity may further improve AD treatment. While connecting beta -carboline units by alkylene spacers in two different series of compds. and subsequent evaluation of their AChE/BChE-inhibitory potential, we found that several of these bivalent beta -carbolines were potent NR blockers. The most promising compd. was a N 9 -homobivalent beta -carboline with a <b>nonylene</b> spacer, which displayed IC 50 values of 0. 5 nM for AChE, 5. 7 nM for BChE, and 1. 4 micro M for NR, resp...|$|E
