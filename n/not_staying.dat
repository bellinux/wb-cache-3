25|$|Homeless shelters {{often provide}} other {{services}} to the community at large. The classic example is the soup kitchen for persons who are <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> at the shelter. Others include support groups, and/or substance abuse treatment. If they do not offer any of these services, they can usually refer their clients to agencies that do. Supportive housing integrates services in a more assertive fashion. The typical pathway through the interlocking system is that a person may start in a shelter and move through transitional housing into supportive housing and finally independent housing.|$|E

25|$|On July 18, in {{the evening}} some of the buffalo hunter's {{supplies}} consisting of alcohol were shared {{with some of the}} soldiers for a small price. Some of the sergeants <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> in the supply camp apparently partook. Later next day 40 of the 60 men of A Company set out for Cedar Lake, the sergeants failed to check that every soldier had filled their canteens. In the heat of the day, those that had been drinking the evening before were terribly parched and did not ration their water. Their example led many recruits to drain their canteens. The buffalo hunters carried more water than the soldiers knowing that the heat and weather would impact finding water. They also were conditioned to the heat and maintained a high level of water discipline.|$|E
25|$|James Lyons {{was born}} in Manhattan's old Ninth Ward. His {{father was in the}} Produce {{business}} and the family decided to move to the Bronx when Lyons was 3. He once reminisced {{in an interview that he}} used to drive a pony and a cart under High Bridge and sell fruit to the locals. When he graduated from Public School 11 at age 13, he went to go work as an office boy in the office of the Surpass Leather Company. He would later regret <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> in school and graduating from High School. He eventually moved his way up in the ranks of the company and became a Salesman. Lyons told his men that with the right approach, anything could be sold to anyone. To drive his point home, in his career he sold enough leather to cover four million pairs of women's feet.|$|E
25|$|New England {{began its}} next {{possession}} {{on its own}} 26 with 29seconds remaining and three timeouts, but the Giants' defense didn't allow a single yard—forcing an incompletion on first down, a 10-yard sack by rookie lineman Jay Alford on second down, and then two deep incomplete attempts to Moss, the first that was broken up by Webster, and the second of which, on 4th-and-20, was broken up by Giants' safety Gibril Wilson and caused a turnover on downs with one second remaining. After the incompletion, the game clock briefly read zero (one second was re-added), and coaches, players, reporters, and fans crowded the field as if the game had ended. Belichick hugged Giants' Coach Tom Coughlin at midfield, then an official explained to both coaches that the final second had to be run. The Patriots' defense took the field, and Belichick left for the locker room, <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> for the final play. This early departure was later criticized by some sportswriters who felt Belichick was being a sore loser, while others noted that he had properly congratulated Coughlin (they also noted Coughlin {{was one of the}} few opposing coaches he didn't loathe) and that the game was over once the Patriots failed to convert on 4th down.|$|E

25|$|To {{reach the}} park, guests either use the Walt Disney World Monorail System, the ferryboats, or Disney Transport buses, {{depending}} on the location of their hotel or parking lot. The three hotels closest to Magic Kingdom, Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, use either the ferry or monorail system to travel to Magic Kingdom. Guests staying at Disney's Wilderness Lodge and Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground can also ride a dedicated ferry boat to the Magic Kingdom docks. Guests of other hotels take buses {{to travel to the}} park, while guests who are <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> at any of the resort's hotels must use the monorail system or ferryboats to travel to the park from the Transportation and Ticket Center. The three ferries are clad in different trim colors and are named for past Disney executives: the General Joe Potter (blue), the Richard F. Irvine (red) and the Admiral Joe Fowler (green). The main monorail loop has two lanes. The outer lane is a direct nonstop loop between the TTC and Magic Kingdom, while the inner loop has additional stops at Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. Epcot is accessible by a spur monorail line that was added upon that park's opening in 1982.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the blame}} for the defeat {{probably}} lies in the events of the battle. William was the more experienced military leader, and in addition the lack of cavalry on the English side allowed Harold fewer tactical options. Some writers have criticised Harold for not exploiting the opportunity offered by the rumoured death of William early in the battle. The English appear to have erred in <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> strictly on the defensive, for when they pursued the retreating Normans they exposed their flanks to attack. Whether this was due to the inexperience of the English commanders or the indiscipline of the English soldiers is unclear. In the end, Harold's death appears to have been decisive, as it signalled the break-up of the English forces in disarray. The historian David Nicolle said of the battle that William's army [...] "demonstrated– not without difficulty– the superiority of Norman-French mixed cavalry and infantry tactics over the Germanic-Scandinavian infantry traditions of the Anglo-Saxons." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, MGM and Lakeshore Entertainment {{produced}} {{a remake of}} Fame directed by Kevin Tancharoen, and written by Allison Burnett. The remake followed {{the premise of the}} original film, depicting the lives of several students as they attend the New York City High School of Performing Arts. Debbie Allen was the only cast member from the 1980 film to have a supporting role, appearing as the school's principal. The film was notable for its lighter tone, in contrast to the earlier film's gritty subject matter. Released on September 25, 2009, Fame received generally unfavorable reviews from mainstream film critics. It was a modest box office success upon release in the United States, though it fared better internationally, grossing $54.7 million worldwide. Parker voiced his disapproval of the remake and described it as an [...] "awful" [...] film. Maureen Teefy also criticized the film, stating, [...] "They're using the same formula, but it doesn't have the same substance. It's <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> true to the grittiness and authenticity of the original." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pam's Replacement" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall complimented the episode for staying true to the characters {{compared to the}} rest of the season, which he had criticized in an earlier review. He called the episode a [...] "significant step up" [...] albeit just [...] "decent" [...] in absolute terms. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt criticized the Andy–Kevin–Darryl subplot for its lack of continuity or any sort of punchlines. He was also critical of the Pam–Dwight plot for <b>not</b> <b>staying</b> true to the characters, and suggested that the writers needed to write the show as less of [...] "a bland copy of itself". He called it one of the laziest half-hours of the show and gave it a C−. Cindy White of IGN said that the episode needed a stronger A-plot writing that the plots [...] "felt like a meal made up of two tasty side dishes". She gave it a 7 out of 10. Hanna Lawrence of Hollywood.com praised the episode for being believable and for showing things that happen in real life. She also praised the Jim–Pam plot for showcasing the couple as not completely [...] "perfect". She called the band subplot [...] "weak".|$|E
