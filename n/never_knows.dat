5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow <b>Never</b> <b>Knows.</b> The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E

25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

500|$|Starr's {{idiosyncratic}} {{turns of}} phrase, or Ringoisms as they became known, {{such as a}} hard day's night and tomorrow <b>never</b> <b>knows,</b> were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: [...] "Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... {{they were sort of}} magic". As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line [...] "darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there" [...] from [...] "Eleanor Rigby".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Jesse Schedeen of IGN {{credited}} Thrawn and the Thrawn trilogy with [...] "kickstarting" [...] the Star Wars expanded universe", and in 2015 Empire {{suggested that}} Thrawn's character helped [...] "revitalize and legitmise" [...] the expanded universe {{when it was}} failing. Eric Goldman wrote for IGN in 2008, [...] "Diabolical, brilliant and ruthless, Thrawn was an excellent Star Wars villain, {{following in the footsteps}} of the likes of Grand Moff Tarkin," [...] adding that [...] "his status as the highest ranking non-human in the Empire was a very interesting aspect". In 2006, Zahn called Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created. Zahn said in July 2016, [...] "A writer <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> which characters are going to click with the readers, and it was highly gratifying to me that Thrawn captured the imaginations of so many people over the past quarter century." ...|$|E

According to IGN editor Doug Perry, [...] "Crashed cars, rubbish and rubble, totally destroyed city streets, and scattered broken glass and debris, all {{are housed in}} a suburban area that truly looks devastated in the worst possible way." [...] GameSpot felt that the 3D modeling of Jill Valentine was greatly improved {{when compared to the}} [...] "blocky" [...] models in the original game. The music and sound effects received similar praise, with GamePro remarking that the game [...] "keeps the action hot by hiding what you shouldn't see, but telling you about it through the audio." [...] The introduction of the Nemesis creature was highly praised. Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the first encounter as shocking, while CVG said that the creature increases the tension level [...] "to an insane degree" [...] because the player <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> when he will show up.|$|E
500|$|... "The End" [...] {{features}} Starr's only drum solo in the Beatles' catalogue (the drums {{are mixed}} across two tracks in [...] "true stereo", unlike most releases {{at that time}} where they were hard panned left or right). Fifty-four seconds into the song are 18 bars of lead guitar: the first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, and the third two by Lennon, with the sequence repeating. Harrison suggested {{the idea of a}} guitar solo in the track, Lennon decided they should trade solos and McCartney elected to go first. The solos were cut live against the existing backing track in one take. Immediately after Lennon's third and final solo, the piano chords of the final part of the song begin. The song ends with the memorable final line, [...] "And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make". This section was taped separately to the first, and required the piano to be re-recorded by McCartney, which was done on 18 August. An alternative version of the song, with Harrison's lead guitar solo played against McCartney's (with Starr's drum solo heard in the background), appears on the Anthology 3 album and the 2012 digital-only compilation album Tomorrow <b>Never</b> <b>Knows.</b>|$|E

[...] She was mostly impressed with Madonna's vocal and emotional power on the track [...] "You'll See" [...] which became [...] "the clearest proof that the ambitious blonde is more singer than celebrity." [...] J. Randy Taraborrelli in his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography picked the David Foster produced tracks as standouts, saying [...] "It was interesting that, {{with all of his}} [...] exciting musical ability from which to draw, he and Madonna would come up with two of the most sombre songs she has ever recorded—but such is the excitement of collaboration; one <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> what will come of it." [...] Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post said the arrangements on the new songs [...] "show a great leap in sophistication" [...] and felt that Madonna [...] "has invested much in improving her vocal technique."

Gordon described Martha's persona stating: [...] "Martha's pretty feisty {{all of the time}} but in the sense of always fighting for what's right and keeping up a strong perspective on where I want to go, things like that." [...] Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> what she wants. Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side. Gordon later said that [...] "There will always {{be a little bit of}} trouble attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous". On the character's appearance, RTÉ said [...] "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical. Now she has grown into a stylish woman with great taste in clothes which range from shorts and strappy tops to gorgeous summer dresses." ...|$|E
500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E

2500|$|As a seer, [...] "Tiresias" [...] was [...] "a {{common title}} for soothsayers {{throughout}} Greek legendary history" [...] (Graves 1960, 105.5). In Greek literature, Tiresias' pronouncements are always given in short maxims {{which are often}} cryptic (gnomic), but never wrong. Often when his name {{is attached to a}} mythic prophecy, it is introduced simply to supply a personality to the generic example of a seer, not by any inherent connection of Tiresias with the myth: thus it is Tiresias who tells Amphytrion of Zeus and Alcmena and warns the mother of Narcissus that the boy will thrive as long as he <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> himself. This is his emblematic role in tragedy (see below). Like most oracles, he is generally extremely reluctant to offer the whole of what he sees in his visions.|$|E
2500|$|Death is that {{possibility}} {{which is the}} absolute impossibility of Dasein. As such, it cannot be compared to {{any other kind of}} ending or [...] "running out" [...] of something. For example, one's death is not an empirical event. For Heidegger, death is Daseins ownmost (it is what makes Dasein individual), it is non-relational (nobody can take one's death away from one, or die in one's place, and we can not understand our own death through the death of other Dasein), and it is not to be outstripped. The [...] "not-yet" [...] of life is always already a part of Dasein: [...] "as soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die." [...] The threefold condition of death is thus simultaneously one's [...] "ownmost potentiality-for-being, non-relational, and not to be out-stripped". Death is determinate in its inevitability, but an authentic Being-toward-death understands the indeterminate nature of one's own inevitable death — one <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> when or how it is going to come. However, this indeterminacy does not put death in some distant, futural [...] "not-yet"; authentic Being-toward-death understands one's individual death as always already a part of one.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, WHFS would {{broadcast}} {{music that}} other FM Rock stations normally overlooked, including cuts {{as long as}} 20 minutes. Artists like Frank Zappa, Yes, Genesis, Roxy Music and other non-commercial artists of the time were the normal format. If The Beatles were ever played, their more obscure tracks like Tomorrow <b>Never</b> <b>Knows</b> or Blue Jay Way were used instead of familiar tracks like Hey Jude or Lady Madonna. Once the station played all of Revolution 9. The station made a policy of never playing a [...] "hit" [...] and broke with precedent by leaving the playlists strictly up to the DJs. Once in a while the DJs would, as a joke, throw in a Top 40 hit just to throw the listeners off. Sometimes, late at night, the DJ might announce [...] "and now we'll repeat that {{for those of you}} on drugs," [...] and immediately replay the last song. It furthered the careers of then-undiscovered stars Bruce Springsteen, George Thorogood and Emmylou Harris, who sometimes showed up at the studio. WHFS played the records of many local groups as well, including The Nighthawks, The Slickee Boys, Black Market Baby, The Diversions, Tru Fax & the Insaniacs, Bad Brains and Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band." ...|$|E
