There is, however, no significant differences in other fiscal and monetary policies.

40|$|How {{political}} parties select their candidates {{for public office}} profoundly affects the types of peo-ple who are elected {{as well as how}} these people behave in office. This selection process also pro-vides important insights on how parties function internally and on where political power is located within a country. Only a few comparative studies of <b>nomination</b> <b>procedures</b> exist, and none explain why some parties at some points in time select candidates via direct primaries and others do not. The authors analyze an original data set of 610 district-level nomination processes for the biennial Argentine Chamber of Deputies elections held between 1983 and 2001. They conclude that several specific institutional and partisan features have a prominent effect on the probability that a political party will choose its candidates at the ballot box (direct primary) rather than in a smoke-filled back room (elite arrangement) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nomination</b> <b>procedures</b> for {{assessing}} peer behaviors are in wide use, and mixed-sex peer nominations are often utilized {{under the assumption}} that combined same-and opposite-sex nominations yield a representative picture of children's behaviors and relationships to other variables. Analyses of nominations made by 457 Turkish third and fifth graders for 14 peer behaviors and for liked-/disliked-a-lot illustrate the productiveness of separately assessing same-sex and opposite-sex nominations, showing that: (a) a bias toward more nominations for same-sex peers is not consistent over all behaviors; and (b) although same-sex and combined same-/opposite-sex nominations are strongly related, the agreement between same-and opposite-sex nominations is substantially Lower. The outcome is that (a) sociometric status classification depends on the nominating population and (b) the relationship between-peer-assessed behaviors and peer acceptance/peer sociometric status can differ; depending upon whether the reference group is same-or opposite-sex peers. Findings bring into question the routine use of mixed-sex nominations. Publisher's Versio...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} {{the stability of}} three methods for two-dimensional sociometric status determination, including (1) the recently developed SSrat technique (Maassen, Akkermans, & Van der Linden, 1996), as well as (2) the procedure of Howes (1988), {{which is based on}} the algorithm and classification criteria of Coie and Dodge (1983), and (3) a procedure applied by Cillessen, van IJzendoorn, Van Lieshout, and Hartup (1992) based on the algorithm and criteria of Newcomb and Bukowski (1983). The latter two techniques can be regarded as nomination methods eliciting unlimited numbers of nominations from the participants. In the present study, 83 pupils (ages ranging from 5. 8 to 8. 8 years) participated in the 3 -point rating procedure of Asher, Singleton, Tinsley, and Hymel (1979). They were asked to rate how much they liked to play with each of their classmates. The ratings data were processed in three ways according to the methods mentioned above. The techniques of Howes and of Cillessen et al. showed higher stability than previously ever reported using the <b>nomination</b> <b>procedures</b> of Coie and Dodge or Newcomb and Bukowski.

40|$|The role of peer acceptance, {{number of}} mutual friends, and {{friendship}} quality in predicting adjustment across {{the transition from}} elementary to middle school was examined. Participants were 146 students (68 boys, 78 girls) {{who participated in the}} Time 1 (spring of fifth grade) and Time 2 (fall of sixth grade) assessments. Peer acceptance and number of friends were assessed using sociometric rating scale and limited <b>nomination</b> <b>procedures.</b> Participants also completed measures that assessed feelings of loneliness, extent of involvement in school, and the quality of a specific mutual friendship. Results of repeated measures MANOVAs revealed a significant decrease in the average number of mutual friendships across time. Regression analyses indicated that peer acceptance and friendship quality and quantity play significant yet somewhat different roles in predicting loneliness and school involvement across the middle school transition. Implications for including a peer component in programs that prepare students for the middle school transition are discussed. During a developmental period characterized by rapid physical,cognitive and social changes, most early adolescents also face the challenge of navigating the transition to the middle school environment. Several studies have reported that this transition coincides with declines in academic achievement, self-esteem, interest in school, and level of motivation, and increases in psychologica...|$|E
40|$|Sociometric status classifications of 205 youths (average age 11. 3 years) were {{assessed}} on three occasions with 1 -year intervals, using the current nomination methods and a two-dimensional rating-based procedure (SSrat). The {{goal of the}} study was to compare the stability of the methods involved. Preliminarily, it is shown that (a) the data allowed the stabilities of the different systems to be interpreted as test-retest reliabilities, and (b) usual practice of implementing a uniform cutoff limit for all sociometric categories without further justification was inadvisable. Consequently, the reliability of the various methods was established with varying cutoff limits. The rating-based systems were shown to yield classifications with test-retest reliability over 0. 50, considerably higher than the nomination methods. We also demonstrated that the rating scale system provides the opportunity to monitor the choice of more appropriate cutoff criteria. As for theoretical implications, the present study provides support for Coie's theory [Coie, J. D., 1990. Toward a theory of peer rejection. In S. R. Asher, J. D. Coie. Peer rejection in childhood. New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 365 - 401] of acquiring peer status as a stabilizing process. It also shows that the relatively low test-retest reliability of the <b>nomination</b> <b>procedures</b> employed may, in part, be responsible for the lack of empirical support for Coie's view in previous studies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background Bullying victimization may {{be linked}} to {{psychosis}} but only self-report measures of victimization have been used so far. This study aimed (a) to investigate the differential associations of peer-nominated versus self-reported victim status with non-clinical psychotic experiences in a sample of young adolescents, and (b) to examine whether different types of self-reported victimization predict non-clinical psychotic experiences in these adolescents. Method A combination of standard self-report and peer <b>nomination</b> <b>procedures</b> was used to assess victimization. The sample (nÂ =Â 724) was divided into four groups (exclusively self-reported victims, self- and peer-reported victims, exclusively peer-reported victims, and non-victims) to test for a group effect on non-clinical psychotic experiences. The relationship between types of victimization and non-clinical psychotic experiences was examined by a regression analysis. Results Self-reported victims, along with self- and peer-reported victims, scored higher than peer-reported victims and non-victims on non-clinical psychotic experiences. Self-reports of direct relational, indirect relational and physical victimization significantly improved the prediction of non-clinical psychotic experiences whereas verbal and possession-directed victimization had no significant predictive value. Conclusions The relationship between victimization and non-clinical psychotic experiences is only present for self-reported victimization, possibly indicative of an interpretation bias. The observed discrepancy between self-report and peer-report highlights the importance of implementing a combination of both measures for future research.
