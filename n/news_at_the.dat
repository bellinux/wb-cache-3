5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, {{around the}} time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to bring the charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated Press on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's allegation at the time, and Hastert denied the accusation to ABC <b>News</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, so the claim was not published.|$|E
5|$|By 1985, Bobby and Pam {{realize that}} they want to be together. Bobby proposes, Pam accepts and they spend the night together. The next day, Bobby is tragically cut down by a car driven by her half-sister, Katherine Wentworth, and dies hours later, leaving Pam heartbroken. Pam goes on to make {{television}} history by dreaming Bobby's death. Pam awakes and finds Bobby in the shower, alive and well. Pam receives good <b>news</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 1986–1987 season finale: she is finally able to conceive a baby, after confirming {{that there would be no}} health risks involved. However, she never gets that chance. While calling her husband to tell him the good news, she is in a massive auto accident where she hits an oil tanker and is severely burned in a subsequent fire. While recovering from her burns, she decides to get away from the Ewings and everyone else, including her son, disappear and divorce Bobby for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Following a major {{refurbishment}} of the Bridge Street {{base in the}} mid-1960s, the next milestones for the paper came in 1973. The first was Sunderland A.F.C.'s 1–0 win over Leeds United in the FA Cup Final. Ian Porterfield's winning goal was headline <b>news</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, giving the Echo its all-time record circulation figure of 95,000copies of the Sports Echo. The second important event of 1973 was the 100th anniversary of the paper. Celebrations included a birthday party, with dignitaries such as Sunderland A.F.C. manager Bob Stokoe among the guests. Lord Buckton, the chairman of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, announced his retirement at the event, and was succeeded by his son, The Honourable Richard Storey. News of a move from Bridge Street to Pennywell, Sunderland, was also announced during the anniversary celebrations. The old newspaper building has since {{been replaced by a}} modern apartment block. The Echo name still lives on, however, as the project as been named Echo24.|$|E

Phelps made several changes to take the show in a more youthful direction. Both cast members over 55, Barbara Berjer (Bridget Connell) and David Hedison (Spencer Harrison), were fired. Even though Matthew and Donna were a popular couple, Phelps insisted the characters be paired with others their own age so they were broken up when Donna cheated with her ex-husband, Michael.|$|E
25|$|On September 2, 2009, ABC {{announced}} that Sawyer would replace Gibson as anchor of ABC World <b>News</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of that}} year. Speculation had abounded that either George Stephanopoulos, news anchor Chris Cuomo, weekend anchor Bill Weir, or World News Saturday anchor David Muir would replace Sawyer on the program. Representatives for ABC News stated that it wanted to return the show to the original male-female anchor format. On December 10, 2009, Stephanopoulos was announced as Sawyer's replacement, with Juju Chang replacing Cuomo as newsreader; the changes took effect four days later on December 14.|$|E
25|$|Fluctuations in {{exchange}} rates are usually caused by actual monetary flows {{as well as}} by expectations of changes in monetary flows. These are caused by changes in gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation (purchasing power parity theory), interest rates (interest rate parity, Domestic Fisher effect, International Fisher effect), budget and trade deficits or surpluses, large cross-border M deals and other macroeconomic conditions. Major news is released publicly, often on scheduled dates, so many people have access to the same <b>news</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time.

25|$|Shortly after Johnson's death, {{his press}} {{secretary}} Tom Johnson (no relation) telephoned Walter Cronkite at CBS; Cronkite was {{live on the}} air with the CBS Evening <b>News</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and a report on Vietnam was cut abruptly while Cronkite was still on the line, so he could break the news. Johnson's death came two days after Richard Nixon's second inauguration, which followed Nixon's landslide victory in the 1972 election. His death meant {{that for the first time}} since 1933, when Calvin Coolidge died during Herbert Hoover's final months in office, that there were no former Presidents still living; Johnson had been the only living ex-President since December 26, 1972, following the death of Harry S. Truman.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} part of his tenure {{anchoring}} the CBS Evening News, Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored the Huntley-Brinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, the Huntley-Brinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy {{to the top of the}} ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC <b>News</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the CBS Evening News began to surpass The Huntley-Brinkley Report in viewership during the summer months.|$|E
25|$|At around 7.00 pm, Barratt's {{son-in-law}} Christopher Mitchell {{noticed that}} Darlwyne had not {{returned to its}} Penryn moorings. Having ascertained that the vessel was not at Greatwood House, Mitchell enquired for <b>news</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Falmouth coastguard station shortly before 7.30. The duty coastguard, Seagar, informed him {{that there was no}} record of Darlwynes departure that morning, and no indication of her present whereabouts. Seager later said that Mitchell told him that Darlwyne had gone to Fowey, which Mitchell disputed on the grounds that he did not then know the vessel's destination. At this time there was no particular cause for alarm; Seager did not record the enquiry, and Mitchell assumed the boat might be sheltering in a harbour or estuary. He made enquiries among local acquaintances, without result.|$|E

25|$|Attended by {{numerous}} federal dignitaries, {{and serving as}} the launch point for the Great White Fleet, the Jamestown Exposition also spurred interest in the military potential of the area. The site of the exposition would later become, in 1917, {{the location of the}} Norfolk Naval Station. The proximity to Washington, D.C., the moderate climate, and strategic location of a large harbor {{at the center of the}} Atlantic seaboard made Virginia a key location during World War I for new military installations. These included Fort Story, the Army Signal Corps station at Langley, Quantico Marine Base in Prince William County, Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, Fort Lee near Petersburg and Fort Eustis, in Warwick County (now Newport <b>News).</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, heavy shipping traffic made the area a target for U-boats, and a number of merchant vessels were attacked or sunk off the Virginia coast.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, ESPN's 30 for 30 {{documentary}} series profiled the SMU football scandal {{in one of}} its productions. Pony Exce$$ (purposely spelled with dollar signs) was the thirtieth and last of the original series, airing on December 11, 2010. Among those who were interviewed for the program were Verne Lundquist, a Texas native who grew up during the Doak Walker era at SMU; Ron Meyer, who was the team's head coach through {{the first five years of}} its run, and his assistant coach Steve Endicott; then-KRLD radio reporters Chuck Cooperstein and Brad Sham, who also was the station's sports director; Skip Bayless, who covered SMU during this era for both The Dallas Morning News and Dallas Times Herald; Richard Justice, who wrote for the Times Herald during the early years of SMU's run of success and spent some time covering the team; Dallas radio hosts Norm Hitzges and Randy Galloway, the latter of whom was writing for the Morning <b>News</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time; and Dale Hansen, who, as noted above, broke the story of David Stanley's allegations. The documentary was narrated by Patrick Duffy, who had starred in the television series Dallas during this time. The program also included interviews with several former SMU boosters.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, McCotter had {{not reached}} the one percent polling {{threshold}} necessary {{to participate in}} the event's August 11 debate on Fox <b>News.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, McCotter had little support, even at home. Public Policy Polling showed him with only five percent from Michigan Republicans, a figure pollsters described as rare coming from a candidate's homestate. With news of his standing, McCotter cancelled a scheduled stop in New Hampshire, and returned to his headquarters in Michigan to coordinate a debate inclusion effort. As part of the effort, the campaign filmed a YouTube video in a kitchen, featuring McCotter making puns about food, and concluding with [...] "Thanks, dude." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "unfortunate". Despite the effort, McCotter did not meet the polling threshold and was excluded.
