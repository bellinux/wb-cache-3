Young men had greater muscle thickness for all muscle groups (p,. 01), except elbow extensors, which were similar to older men. Young men had greater torque and power at both velocities for all muscle groups (p,. 01), and greater <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> at both velocities for the elbow extensors and knee flexors and at the fast velocity for knee extensors. Relative to young mean values, muscle thickness, and torque, <b>normalized</b> <b>torque,</b> and power in the older group were most affected for lower-body measurements, especially at the fast velocity.

In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} uniform {{magnetic}} field on a viscous, incompressible fluid past a spherical and permeable aggregate has been discussed using Brinkman’s equation in the porous region and the Stokes equation in the external region. A uniform magnetic field is applied transverse to the fluid flow. At the interface of the porous region and the clear fluid stress jump boundary condition for tangential stresses, continuity of normal stress and continuity of velocity components are used. Normalized drag and <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> are calculated for different flows using Faxen’s law.

Many martial arts forms have been studied, but a relatively new form of martial arts competition, San Shou, has not been analyzed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine key attributes necessary in the development of the San Shou athlete, particularly in female participants. Six elite and six novice competitors performed 30 continuous repetitions of cyclic extension and flexion of the trunk segment, knee joints, and elbows joints at two velocities, 60 °/second and 180 °/second, using an isokinetic dynamometer. Variables of interest were maximum torque production, <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> (Nm/kg), fatigue indexes (average of three maximal forces in the first three cycles/average of maximal forces in the last three cycles), and rate of torque development (Nm/s). Results indicate significant differences between groups only during trunk flexion for maximum torque, <b>normalized</b> <b>torque,</b> and rate of force development, whereas differences between movement velocities were apparent for multiple variables at each anatomic region. These analyses assist in providing further information regarding the possible key factors in developing the San Shou female athlete.

KinTape claims to increase cutaneous stimulation, which facilitates motor unit firing, and consequently improves functional performance; however these, benefits {{could be due to}} placebo effects. This study investigated the true effects of KinTape by a deceptive, randomized, and controlled trial. Thirty healthy participants performed isokinetic testing of three taping conditions: true facilitative KinTape, sham KinTape, and no KinTape. The participants were blindfolded during the evaluation. Under the pretense of applying adhesive muscle sensors, KinTape was applied to their quadriceps in the first two conditions. <b>Normalized</b> peak <b>torque,</b> <b>normalized</b> total work, and time to peak torque were measured at two angular speeds (60 ?X/s and 180 ?X/s) and analyzed with one-way repeated measures ANOVA.

The results showed that KinTape did not facilitate muscle performance in generating higher peak torque. These findings suggest that previously reported muscle facilitatory effects using KinTape may be attributed to placebo effects. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} weakness across elbow range of motion (ROM) in subjects with hemiparesis. Design: A detailed analysis of elbow torque and associated electromyographic signals of 5 prime elbow muscles generated during maximum isometric voluntary flexion (MIVF) and extension (MIVE) at 8 different elbow positions. Setting: Rehabilitation center research laboratory. Participants: Convenience samples of 5 controls and 10 subjects with hemiparesis with sufficient passive (> 90 °) and active (> 60 °) ROM on their paretic side. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Measured and normalized MIVF and MIVE <b>torques</b> and <b>normalized</b> moving average electromyographic signals of each muscle at each testing position. Results: Measured MIVF and MIVE torques generated by the hemiparetic group were marginally and significantly smaller {{than those of the}} control group (2 -factor repeated-measures analysis of variance [ANOVA]: P=. 053 for MIVF, P=. 011 for MIVE). Distribution of weakness was nonuniform across elbow positions, as shown by normalized torque-position curves. <b>Normalized</b> MIVE <b>torque</b> of the hemiparetic group was significantly and marginally smaller than that of the control group at 15 ° and 30 ° (Student t test: P<. 0001, P=. 054), respectively. Although statistically not significant, the <b>normalized</b> MIVF <b>torque</b> of the hemiparetic group was slightly larger than that of the control group but became smaller than the control group's as the elbow flexed beyond 90 °. Our electromyographic recordings supported the <b>normalized</b> MIVF <b>torque</b> findings, showing a significant increase in brachioradialis activation in the control group at flexed positions during MIVF (1 -factor repeated-measure ANOVA, P=. 003), but not in the hemiparetic group (P=. 392). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that measuring the strength in multiple joint positions is useful for characterizing the basic changes in muscle activation strategies and properties and provides a relevant measure of elbow weakness from a clinical and functional perspective. Various mechanisms of action are discussed to better understand the relation between joint position and weakness. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R
40|$|Fabric-based {{wearable}} {{technology is}} highly desirable in sports, {{as it is}} light, flexible, soft, and comfortable with little interference to normal sport activities. It can provide accurate information on the in situ deformation of muscles in a continuous and wireless manner. During elbow flexion in isometric contraction, upper arm circumference increases with the contraction of elbow flexors, {{and it is possible}} to monitor the muscles' contraction by limb circumferential strains. This paper presents a new wireless wearable anthropometric monitoring device made from fabric strain sensors for the human upper arm. The materials, structural design and calibration of the device are presented. Using an isokinetic testing system (Biodex 3 ®) and the fabric monitoring device simultaneously, in situ measurements were carried out on elbow flexors in isometric contraction mode with ten subjects for a set of positions. Correlations between the measured values of limb circumferential strain and <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> were examined, and a linear relationship was found during isometric contraction. The average correlation coefficient between them is 0. 938 ± 0. 050.

40|$|Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) {{has been}} {{considered}} as {{the best choice for}} numerous applications. To make PMSM a high performance drive, effective control system is required. Vector control is accepted widely due to its decoupling effect {{but it is not the}} only performance requirement. Additional control methods such as constant torque angle control (CTAC), optimum torque per ampere control (OTPAC), unity power factor control (UPFC), constant mutual flux linkages control (CMFLC), and angle control of air gap flux and current phasor (ACAGF) can also be implemented. This paper therefore presents some important control strategies for PMSM along with merits and limitations which provide a wide variety of control choices in many applications. The performance characteristics for each strategy under steady state are modelled and simulated in MATLAB environment. Based on the simulation results, a conclusion is drawn that OTPAC is superior in <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> per unit normalized stator current (Ten/isn) ratio whereas UPFC yields very low Ten/isn ratio. In addition, performances of these control strategies are compared, which is a key to select optimum strategy depending on requirements. Based on the comparative study, it can be concluded that CMFLC is superior to CTAC, ACAGF, OTPAC, and UPFC. Hence, it can be a good control strategy to consider...|$|E

The right biceps brachii muscles of seven normal young adult subjects were tested. We observed that exponential functions could well represent the relationships between the normalized EMG root-mean-square (RMS) and the torque, the RMS and the muscle deformation SMG, and the RMS and the pennation angle SMG for the data of the contraction phase, with exponent coefficients of 0. 0341 ± 0. 0148 (Mean±SD), 0. 0619 ± 0. 0273, and 0. 0266 ± 0. 0076, respectively. In addition, the preliminary results also demonstrated linear relationships between the <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> and the muscle deformation as well as the pennation angle with the ratios of and, respectively. The overall mean for the regressions was approximately 0. 9 and the overall mean relative root mean square error (RRMSE) smaller than 15 %.

40|$|Recognizing the {{importance}} of both the torque-angle and torque-velocity relations, three-dimensional (3 D) human strength capabilities (i. e., peak torque {{as a function of}} both joint angle and movement velocity) have been increasingly reported. It is not clear, however, the degree to which these surfaces vary between joints, particularly between joints with similar biomechanical configurations. Thus, our goal was to compare 3 D strength surfaces between the muscles about the elbow and knee hinge joints in men and women. Peak iso-metric and isokinetic strength was assessed in 54 participants (30 men) using the Biodex System 3 isokinetic dynamometer. <b>Normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> surfaces varied significantly between flexion and extension (within each joint) and between joints; however, the <b>normalized</b> 3 D <b>torque</b> surfaces did not differ between men and women. These findings suggest the underlying joint biomechanics are the primary influences on these strength surface profiles.

This study thus {{investigated the}} effects of wrist deviation combined with extension and movement velocity on the dynamic performances of the wrist muscles during the coupling posture via a custom-made bi-planar isokinetic dynamometer. Thirty subjects were recruited to perform the isokinetic testing. We measured the muscle strengths and activities for the wrist extensors and flexors during concentric and eccentric contractions at three movement velocities, 30 °s- 1, 90 °s- 1, and 180 °s- 1, combined with three wrist postures, neutral position (NP), radial deviation (RD), and ulnar deviation (UD). The root mean square (RMS) of the electromyographic signal in the extensor digitorum communis (EDC), <b>normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> of extensors, and ratio of <b>normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> between wrist extensors and flexors, were all greater in the NP than RD and UD in both contractions. The ratio of RMS between EDC and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) had a significantly greater value in RD than UD during the concentric contraction. The EDC showed significantly higher activity at the fast velocity in both contractions. Nevertheless, a significantly higher RMS of the electromyographic signal between EDC and FDS and the ratio of strength between wrist extensors and flexors were found at slow velocity in both contractions. The wrist deviation combined with extension and movement velocity of the wrist joint should thus be considered as influential factors which might alter the dynamic performances, and may result in further injury of the elbow joint...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) is {{the most}} common lower limb {{condition}} encountered in clinical practice. It recently emerged as the third highest ranked topic out of 185 in the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy Musculoskeletal Research Priority Project. For a valid assessment of knee strength during rehabilitation, the isometric test using the isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex) and the hand-held dynamometer (HHD) is not well received with clinical practice. An alternative way is through functional hop tests which clinicians have used to assess their patients' lower extremity muscular strength. This study investigates the validity of knee strength assessments conducted with the HHD and the hoptest compared to the isokinetic dynamometer and also explores differences between genders of the three assessments. Design: Each assessment included one submaximal and three recorded maximal efforts of the dominant leg. Quadriceps muscle strength was displayed in <b>normalized</b> <b>torques.</b> Correlation coefficients and box-and-whisker plots was used to analyze the data. Setting: Movement analysis laboratory Participants: Sixteen males (age 23. 5 ± 4. 23 years, height 1. 79 ± 0. 08 m and body mass 76. 21 ± 10. 58 kg, BMI 23. 82 ± 2. 38 kg/m²) and 16 females (age 25. 38 ± 5. 49 years, height 1. 67 ± 0. 08 m and body mass 71. 99 ± 16. 05 kg, BMI 25. 83 ± 4. 74 kg/m²) between 18 and 40 years old without any musculoskeletal injuries participated. Main outcome measures: Knee moments normalized for bodyweight (Nm/kg) for dynamometers and distance jumped for single legged hoptest. Results: The strongest significant correlation was found for the comparison between the HHD and Cybex (r= 0. 71, r²= 0. 504, p= 0. 001). Correlation between the HHD and hoptest (r= 0. 4, r²= 0. 19, p= 0. 013), and Cybex and hoptest (r= 0. 53, r²= 0. 295, p= 0. 001) were poor. Comparing genders, the normalized knee extension moment on the Cybex was 28. 8 % lower and with the HHD 22. 3 % lower for females. Conclusions: Single legged hop test appears not to provide a suitable alternative for strength measurement in a clinical setting. Differences in hop performances, especially the use of the arms, seem to be important. Gender differences exist in knee strength assessments. The use of EMG-Analysis in further research might identify differences in muscle recruiting during all three tests...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} microbubbles on Taylor-Couette flow by means of direct numerical simulations. We employ an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach with a gas-fluid coupling based on the point-force approximation. Added mass, drag, lift, and gravity {{are taken into account}} in the modeling of the motion of the individual bubble. We find that very dilute suspensions of small non-deformable bubbles (volume void fraction below 1 %, zero Weber number and bubble Reynolds number < 10) induce a robust statistically steady drag reduction (up to 20 %) in the so called wavy vortex flow regime (Re = 600 - 2500). The Reynolds number dependence of the <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> (the so-called Torque Reduction Ratio (TRR) which corresponds to the drag reduction) is consistent with a recent series of experimental measurements performed by Murai et al. (J. Phys. 14, 143 (2005)). Our analysis suggests that the physical mechanism for the torque reduction in this regime is due to the local axial forcing, induced by rising bubbles, that is able to break the highly dissipative Taylor wavy vortices in the system. We finally show that the lift force acting on the bubble is crucial in this process. When neglecting it, the bubbles preferentially accumulate near the inner cylinder and the bulk flow is less efficiently modified. Comment: 21 pages, 13 figures, extended and revised versio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a study of interference effects and excitation mechanisms on wind-excited centric and eccentric tall buildings through wind tunnel test on a Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC) standard building model by using base balance and pressure measurement techniques. Some of the excitation mechanism that were thought to be motion dependent were investigated by comparing the result obtained by using base balance technique and aeroelastic modelling technique. Interference effects were provided by an identical rigid building model located at different positions upstream of downstream of the principal building. Wind tunnel tests were conducted in an open terrain wind model. A torsional/translational frequency ratio of 1. 5 was adopted for rigid model testing techniques. At the reduced wind velocity of 6, the centric building responses could be enhanced by as high as 80 %. However, the enhancement was not always the result of interference for all building arrangements. The building responses could be decreased by almost 50 % in some cases depending on the interfering building location. Under the same approaching flow condition, the <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> spectra of the isolated CAARC Building model, with different locations for the center of mass and center of stiffness can be altered significantly. Information gathered from pressure measurements indicated that the differences in the spectral characteristics of the <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> spectra are due to the pressure distribution around the building model and the correlations between certain frequency components of the torque of particular part of the building. Interference effects on the centric and eccentric CAARC Building model were studied by using base balance techniques. The results show that, for a particular building arrangement, relocating the center of mass and center of stiffness of the building changed the standard deviation twist angle responses. The changes depended on the combination of building arrangement and location of center of mass and center of stiffness. The study also found that the combined effects of the flow and the wind-induced loads on the building, determined by base balance tests, may mask the dominant excitation mechanism on the building. By using wind pressure measurement technique, {{a better understanding of the}} flow characteristics and the corresponding wind-induced loads for tall building under interference can be achieved, facilitating a better structural design of tall building. Interference effects on the CAARC Building model were studied by using base balance technique and aeroelastic modelling technique. Comparison of the buffeting factor contours of the building responses obtained by both modelling technique found that the magnitude of the buffeting factors and the pattern of the buffeting factor contour of building responses obtained by both modelling technique are very close to each others. The critical locations identified from the buffeting factor contours of building responses occurred in proximate locations. The percentage difference between the buffeting factors of the building responses at the critical locations are usually within 16 %. Moreover, the dependency on motion of the downstream interference excitation mechanism is investigated by comparing the excitation spectra obtained by using base balance technique and aeroelastic modelling technique. It has been concluded that the energy distribution and the magnitude of the spectral density of the force spectrum is independent of the modelling techniques that were adopted. This means that the downstream interference excitation mechanism is not dependent on the motion of the building...|$|E

Objective: To evaluate the joint-angle-dependent neuromuscular functions at the affected wrist in hemiplegic subjects after stroke while doing isometric maximal voluntary wrist {{flexion and extension}} across different wrist angles. Design: We investigated torques during isometric maximal voluntary wrist flexions and extensions at 8 different wrist angles, ranging from - 45 ° to 60 °. We used the associated electromyographic activities of 2 agonist and antagonist muscle pairs related to wrist and elbow joints {{for the analysis of}} muscular coactivations. We compared the data obtained from poststroke subjects' affected and unaffected sides. Setting: A research laboratory in a rehabilitation center. Participants: Eleven subjects with hemiplegia after stroke with passive range of motion (ROM) in the wrist from - 45 ° to 60 °. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Directly measured torques, torques after normalization during maximal isometric wrist contractions, and normalized moving average electromyographic signals of each muscle at the tested positions. Results: The measured torques of the affected wrists were significantly lower than those of the unaffected wrists at all tested angles during wrist flexion and extension (P<. 05). The angle-dependent patterns of the <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> across the tested wrist angles varied from those of the unaffected wrists (2 -way analysis of variance, P<. 05). There were decreases in normalized torques during both flexion and extension at the extended positions in the affected group (P<. 05). Abnormal cocontractions were found in agonist and antagonist muscle pairs related to wrist and elbow joints, and between the elbow flexor and wrist extensor when subjects did the wrist contractions on the paretic side, especially at the wrist extended positions. Conclusions: Wrist muscle weakness was distributed unevenly across the selected wrist ROM on the affected side, as represented by the varied patterns of the normalized torque-angle relationship, compared with the unaffected wrists. There were reductions in the selective control of muscle coactivating synergies both single-jointly and cross-jointly in the impaired nervous system during wrist contractions; the extent of these reductions was also related to the wrist angle configuration.

Methods: In patients (bilaterally) and able-bodied controls torque and activation was measured during maximal volun-tary isometric contractions of knee extensors and flexors at 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° knee flexion. Results: The paretic knee extensors showed lower normal-ized maximal torques (73 %) and lower normalized activa-tion (71 %) compared with control at 30 °.

This method uses electrically evoked twitch superimposed on the voluntary activi- ty and its comparison with the twitch in rested muscle i. e. control twitch, to evaluate completeness of muscle activation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the ef- fect of interval in paired stimulation on control twitch in young and elderly individuals with bent and flexed knee positions.

Although all parameters were slightly different in young adults compared to elder ones, the difference reached significance only in shorter TPT and HRT for the former, a phenomenon attributed to the slowing of muscle contractile me- chanics with ageing.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed experimental programme on understanding {{the mechanics of}} drilling in porous brittle solids. Gypsum {{was used as a}} model material for this experimental study, in which the mechanics of drilling was decoupled into equivalent problems of indentation and cutting. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanics of indentation and cutting was gained by performing experiments in 2 -D conditions. A camera and microscope assembly was used to capture images at high temporal and spatial resolution to measure the in situ deformation. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) algorithm was used to measure the deformation parameters such as velocity, strain-rate, strain and volume change. In the last part of this research, drilling experiments were performed in 3 -D conditions and an attempt was made for understanding the mechanics of drilling by relating the drilling experiment results to that of indentation and cutting. A series of wedge indentation experiments were performed under 2 -D plane-strain conditions. Development of a parabolic zone of deformation, surrounding the indenter, was observed, wherein this size of the deformation zone and the strain accumulation in the deformation zone was a function of the geometry of the indenter. The maximum effective strain decreased and the overall strain field was more diffuse with increase in the wedge angle. Significant volume change was also observed in this deformation zone and the amount of volume change increased with increase in the porosity of the material. The zones of high volume change (compaction bands) were stacked in the form of layers oriented perpendicular to the direction of indentation. These compaction bands were more localized for the case of lower angles of wedge indenter. The extent of the compaction bands was also a function of porosity and spread over a larger area for the case of low porosity samples. A change in the material response was also observed with change in porosity and geometry of the indenter. The appearance of the crack was delayed with increase in porosity and reduction of wedge angle. The experimental results were also used to validate an analytical cavity expansion model. A better prediction of indentation pressure {{and the size of the}} deformation zone was possible after volume change corrections were incorporated into the cavity expansion formulation. A series of orthogonal cutting experiments were performed in 2 -D plane-strain conditions. The e ect of tool geometry and the depth of cut on the mechanics of cutting was studied with the help of image based measurements and cutting force signatures. Different types of cutting mechanisms were observed for the case of positive and negative rake angle tool. A cyclic increase and decrease in the cutting force was observed in case of positive rake angle cutting tool. The decrease in the cutting force corresponded to the initiation of crack from the tip of the tool. The crack traversed towards the surface of the material and resulted in the removal of a material chip. With progress of cutting, the tool scratched the material surface, giving rise to the gradual increase in the cutting force as it again reached local maxima when the tool completely re-engaged with the material. For the case of negative rake angle, apart from cyclic increase and decrease of the cutting force, there was a development of a triangular dead zone at the tip of the cutting tool. The size of the dead zone varied cyclically with the progress of cutting. The length of crack, which resulted in the removal of the chip from the material, was found to be a function of the rake angle and the depth of cut. Drilling experiments were performed on gypsum samples in 3 -D conditions. Two types of twist drills with different helix angles were used for this research work. Experiments were performed on the samples with two different porosities. Thrust force and torque signatures were recorded for five values of depth of cut per revolution. Since these experiments were performed in 3 -D, image analysis was not performed. However, in order to ascertain a qualitative understanding of the drilling process, few experiments were performed on the edge of the material surface so that a cylindrical groove with semicircular cross section is made and the exposed surface of the material and the drill were imaged. The normalized thrust force and <b>normalized</b> <b>torque</b> were compared with indentation pressure and cutting force signatures and remarkable similarities between them was found. A transition from ductile to brittle type of response was observed with increase in the depth of cut per revolution, which was similar to what was observed in case of indentation. The magnitude of torque was found to be higher for high helix angle drills, which was counter to what was observed in cutting, which was due to the deposition of the material in helix for high helix angle drills, resulting in the reduction of the effective helix angle. An approximate estimate of the effective helix angle was made with the help of analytical solutions as well as from the qualitative analysis of the images...|$|E

Concentric/eccentric isokinetic strength of the quadriceps was tested, and peak torque and total work were recorded. Kinematic data from the knee during the Fente motion were collected. The first analysis period (P 1) was after heel contact to the maximal flexion of the knee, and the second (P 2) was right after P 1 to heel-off. <b>Normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> and work of concentric/eccentric contractions were not significantly different. Affected fencers demonstrated significantly reduced angular velocities at P 2 (p = 0. 042). The male fencers did not demonstrate any differences. The affected female fencers demonstrated significantly weaker concentric peak torque at 60 °·s- 1 (p = 0. 009) and 180 °·s- 1 (p = 0. 047) and less concentric work at 60 °·s- 1 (p = 0. 020). They also demonstrated significantly reduced average angular velocities at P 2 (p = 0. 001). Therefore, mild symptomatic PT seems {{to have an effect}} on the isokinetic concentric contraction of the quadriceps and the angular velocity of the knee during the backward Fente motion in elite female fencers who are participating fully in training and competition...|$|R
40|$|The {{burden of}} hip muscles {{weakness}} {{and its relation}} to other impairments has been well documented. It is therefore a pre-requisite to have a reliable method for clinical assessment of hip muscles function allowing the design and implementation of a proper strengthening program. Motor-driven dynamometry has been widely accepted as the gold-standard for lower limb muscle strength assessment but is mainly related to the knee joint. Studies focusing on the hip joint are less exhaustive and somewhat discrepant with regard to optimal participants position, consequently influencing outcome measures. Thus, we aimed to develop a standardized test setup for the assessment of hip muscles strength, i. e. flexors/extensors and abductors/adductors, with improved participant stability and to define its psychometric characteristics. Eighteen participants performed unilateral isokinetic and isometric contractions of the hip muscles in the sagittal and coronal plane at two separate occasions. Peak <b>torque</b> and <b>normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> were measured for each contraction. Relative and absolute measures of reliability were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient and standard error of measurement, respectively. Results from this study revealed higher levels of between-day reliability of isokinetic/isometric hip abduction/flexion peak torque compared to existing literature. The least reliable measures were found for hip extension and adduction, which could be explained by a less efficient stabilization technique. Our study additionally provided a first set of reference normalized data which can be used in future research. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: In post-menopausal {{women with}} osteoporosis, {{insufficient}} vitamin D levels decrease calcium fixation in {{the bones and}} calcium transport in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which impairs muscle strength, possibly leading to detrimental consequences {{for the preservation of}} functional capacity and postural balance, fall prevention, and fracture risk. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and knee muscle strength, postural balance and functional mobility among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 63 osteoporotic older women (aged 60. 6 ± 3. 1 years). The subjects completed the Timed Up and Go Test to measure functional mobility, and postural balance was assessed on the AccuSway Plus portable force platform. Maximal strength was tested using an isokinetic dynamometer for knee flexion and extension. The subjects were assessed as a group and were divided into quartiles according to their vitamin D levels. Clinicaltrials. gov: NCT 02771834. RESULTS: Vitamin D status was independently associated with the <b>normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> of the knee extensors (&# 946;= 0. 59; p= 0. 04) and Timed Up and Go Test (&# 946;=- 0. 07; p< 0. 001). No between-group differences were observed in the demographic and clinical variables or postural balance; however, significant differences were observed in the Timed Up and Go Test, and the group with the highest vitamin D levels exhibited better performance than the group with the lowest vitamin D levels (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The serum vitamin D levels were independently associated with normalized knee extension strength and functional mobility in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the thumb to hand function, {{little is known about the}} origins of thumb impairment poststroke. Accordingly, the primary purpose of this study was to assess whether thumb flexors have heightened stretch reflexes (SRs) following stroke-induced hand impairment. The secondary purpose was to compare SR characteristics of thumb flexors in relation to those of finger flexors since it is unclear whether SR properties of both muscle groups are similarly affected poststroke. Stretch reflexes in thumb and finger flexors were assessed at rest on the paretic side in each of 12 individuals with chronic, severe, stroke-induced hand impairment and in the dominant thumb in each of eight control subjects also at rest. Muscle activity and passive joint flexion torques were measured during imposed slow (SS) and fast stretches (FS) of the flexors that span the metacarpophalangeal joints. Putative spasticity was then quantified in terms of the peak difference between FS and SS joint torques and electromyographic changes. For both the hemiparetic and control groups, the mean <b>normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> differences (PTDs) measured in thumb flexors were statistically indistinguishable (P = 0. 57). In both groups, flexor muscles were primarily unresponsive to rapid stretching. For 10 of 12 hemiparetic subjects, PTDs in thumb flexors were less than those in finger flexors (P = 0. 03). Paretic finger flexor muscle reflex activity was consistently elicited during rapid stretching. These results may reflect an important difference between thumb and finger flexors relating to properties of the involved muscle afferents and spinal motoneurons...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo use an {{established}} biomechanical approach to quantify reflex and non-reflex responses from spastic–paretic elbow flexors {{in response to}} controlled cold and heat stimulation. MethodsThirteen spastic–hemiplegic stroke subjects were tested in the experiment. The spastic elbow joint was stretched into extension for 50 ° at two speeds (5 °/s and 100 °/s) in a customized apparatus. Thermal stimulation (HEAT at heat pain threshold, COLD at 0 °C, or BASELINE at room temperature) {{was applied to the}} thenar eminence of the contralateral hand immediately prior to stretching for at least 30 [*]s. ResultsTotal torque was greater at 100 °/s than at 5 °/s. Total torque was significantly increased after COLD, but not HEAT as compared to BASELINE. When <b>normalized</b> to total <b>torque</b> at baseline, HEAT decreased total torque by 6. 3 %, while COLD increased total torque by 11. 0 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} the reflex torque among three thermal conditions. ConclusionThe findings demonstrate differentiated effects of cold stimulation on the total resistance from spastic muscles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to compare the isokinetic strength characteristics of visually impaired with sighted individuals. Thirty age-matched participants who met the criteria for blind and partially sighted were matched according to age, height, and sex. Participants were evaluated on a Cybex Isokinetic dynamometer at speeds of 90 and 180 deg/sec. The main outcome measures were peak <b>torque</b> <b>normalized</b> by body weight; and power adjusted by body weight. Data was analyzed by using separate 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (group x gender x muscle x velocity) repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Separate ANOVAs were performed because of the relatively low number of subjects used in the investigation. Results demonstrated significant group, velocity and muscle main effects; sighted individuals had significantly greater values for peak torque and power than individuals with visual impairments. In conclusion, it appears that individuals with visual impairments are deficient in strength and power compared to sighted individuals.

First published August 18, 2011; doi: 10. 1152 /japplphysiol. 00291. 2011. -We {{examined the}} hypothesis that metabolic surgery-induced massive weight loss causes mass-driven and behavioral adaptations in the kinematics and kinetics of obese gait. Gait analyses were performed at three time points over similar to 1 yr in initially morbidly obese (mass: 125. 7 kg; body mass index: 43. 2 kg/m(2)) but otherwise healthy adults. Ten obese adults lost 27. 1 % +/- 5. 1 (34. 0 +/- 9. 4 kg) weight by the first follow-up at 7. 0 mo (+/- 0. 7) and 6. 5 +/- 4. 2 % (8. 2 +/- 6. 0 kg) more by the second follow-up at 12. 8 mo (+/- 0. 9), with a total weight loss of 33. 6 +/- 8. 1 % (42. 2 +/- 14. 1 kg; P = 0. 001). Subjects walked at a self-selected and a standard 1. 5 m/s speed at the three time points and were also compared with an age- and gender-matched comparison group at the second follow-up. Weight loss increased swing time, stride length, gait speed, hip range of motion, maximal knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion. Weight loss of 27 % led to 3. 9 % increase in gait speed. An additional 6. 5 % weight loss led to an additional 7. 3 % increase in gait speed. Sagittal plane <b>normalized</b> knee <b>torque</b> increased and absolute ankle and frontal plane knee torques decreased after weight loss. We conclude that large weight loss produced mechanical plasticity by modifying ankle and knee torques and gait behavior. There may be a weight loss threshold of 30 kg limiting changes in gait kinematics. Implications for exercise prescription are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} clarify the acute effects of static {{stretching}} (SS) and cyclic stretching (CS) on muscle stiffness and hardness of the medial gastrocnemius muscle (MG) by using ultrasonography, range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint and ankle plantar flexor. Twenty healthy men participated in this study. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} SS, CS and control conditions. Each session consisted of a standard 5 -minute cycle warm-up, accompanied by one of the subsequent conditions in another day: (a) 2 minutes static stretching, (b) 2 minutes cyclic stretching, (c) control. Maximum ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM max) and <b>normalized</b> peak <b>torque</b> (NPT) of ankle plantar flexor were measured in the pre- and post-stretching. To assess muscle stiffness, muscle-tendon junction (MTJ) displacement (the length changes in tendon and muscle) and MTJ angle (the angle made by the tendon of insertion and muscle fascicle) of MG were measured using ultrasonography at an ankle dorsiflexion angle of − 10 °, 0 °, 10 ° and 20 ° before and after SS and CS for 2 minutes in the pre- and post-stretching. MG hardness was measured using ultrasound real-time tissue elastography (RTE). The results of this study indicate a significant effect of SS for ROM maximum, MTJ angle (0 °, 10 °, 20 °) and RTE (10 °, 20 °) compared with CS (p < 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} MTJ displacement between SS and CS. CS was associated with significantly higher NPT values than SS. This study suggests that SS of 2 minutes’ hold duration significantly affected muscle stiffness and hardness compared with CS. In addition, CS may contribute to the elongation of muscle tissue and increased muscle strength...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{flow field}} around a solid {{particle}} {{moving in a}} shear flow along a porous slab is obtained by solving the coupled Stokes-Darcy problem with the Beavers and Joseph slip boundary condition on the slab interfaces. The solution involves the Green's function of this coupled problem, which is given here. It is shown that the classical boundary integral method using this Green's function is inappropriate because of supplementary contributions due to the slip on the slab interfaces. An 'indirect boundary integral method' is therefore proposed, in which the unknown density on the particle surface is not the actual stress, but yet allows calculation of the force and torque on the particle. Various results are provided for the <b>normalized</b> force and <b>torque,</b> namely friction factors, on the particle. The cases of a sphere and an ellipsoid are considered. It is shown that the relationships between friction coefficients (torque due to rotation and force due to translation) that are classical for a no-slip plane do not apply here. This difference is exhibited Finally, results for the velocity of a freely moving particle in a linear and a quadratic shear flow are presented, for both a sphere and an ellipsoid...|$|R

Results: Internal-rotation torque was greatest at 90 ° of hip flexion, followed by 40 ° of hip flexion and finally 10 ° of hip flexion. External-rotation torque was not different based on hip flexion. The nondominant leg’s external rotators were stronger than the dominant leg’s, but the reverse was true for internal rotators. Finally, the men had more overall rotator torque. Conclusions: Hip-rotation torque production varies between flexion angle, leg, and sex.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents experimental {{measurements of}} torque, wall shear stress, pressure, and velocity in the boundary-driven turbulent {{flow of water}} between concentric, independently rotating spheres, commonly known as spherical Couette flow. The spheres' radius ratio is 0. 35, geometrically {{similar to that of}} Earth's core. The measurements are performed at unprecedented Reynolds number for this geometry, as high as fifty-six million. The role of rapid overall rotation on the turbulence is investigated. A number of different turbulent flow states are possible, selected by the Rossby number, a dimensionless measure of the differential rotation. In certain ranges of the Rossby number near state borders, bistable co-existence of states is possible. In these ranges the flow undergoes intermittent transitions between neighboring states. At fixed Rossby number, the flow properties vary with Reynolds number in a way similar to that of other turbulent flows. At most parameters investigated, the large scales of the turbulent flow are characterized by system-wide spatial and temporal correlations that co-exist with intense broadband velocity fluctuations. Some of these wave-like motions are identifiable as inertial modes. All waves are consistent with slowly drifting large scale patterns of vorticity, which include Rossby waves and inertial modes as a subset. The observed waves are generally very energetic, and imply significant inhomogeneity in the turbulent flow. Increasing rapidity of rotation as the Ekman number is lowered intensifies those waves identified as inertial modes with respect to other velocity fluctuations. The turbulent scaling of the torque on inner sphere is a focus of this dissertation. The Rossby-number dependence of the torque is complicated. We <b>normalize</b> the <b>torque</b> at a given Reynolds number in the rotating states by that when the outer sphere is stationary. We find that this normalized quantity can be considered a Rossby-dependent friction factor that expresses the effect of the self-organized flow geometry on the turbulent drag. We predict that this Rossby-dependence will change considerably in different physical geometries, but should be an important quantity in expressing the parameter dependence of other rapidly rotating shear flows...|$|R

Focusing on synchronous reluctance and ferrite permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous reluctance machines, it provides a broad perspective on three-phase machines for variable speed applications, a field currently dominated by asynchronous machines and rare-earth PM synchronous machines. It also describes synchronous reluctance machines and PM machines without rare-earth materials, comparing them to state-of-the-art solutions. The book provides readers with extensive information on and finite element models of PM synchronous machines, including all relevant equations and {{with an emphasis on}} synchronous-reluctance and PM-assisted synchronous-reluctance machines. It covers ferrite-assisted machines, modeled as a subcase of PM-assistance, fractional slot combinations solutions, and a quantitative, <b>normalized</b> comparison of <b>torque</b> capability with benchmark PM machines. The book discusses a wealth of techniques for identifying machine parameters, with an emphasis on self-commissioning algorithms, and presents methods for automated machine design and optimization, including a software tool developed for this purpose. Addressing an important gap in the field of PM-less and less-PM electrical machines, it is intended as a self-contained reference guide for both graduate students and professional machine designers, and as a useful text for university courses on automated and/or optimized design of electrical machines and drives...|$|R

To compare {{lower limb}} joint torques during sit-to-stand in normal elderly {{subjects}} {{and people with}} Parkinson’s disease, using a developed biomechanical model simulating all phases of sit-to-stand. Design. A cross-sectional study utilizing a Parkinsonian and a control group. Background. Subjects with Parkinson’s disease were observed to experience difficulty in performing sit-to-stand. The developed model was {{used to calculate the}} lower limb joint torques in normal elderly subjects and subjects with Parkinson’s disease, to delineate possible causes underlying difficulties in initiating sit-to-stand task. Methods. Six normal elderly subjects and seven age-matched subjects with Parkinson’s disease performed five sit-to-stand trials at their self-selected speed. Anthropometric data, two-dimensional kinematic and foot-ground and thigh-chair reactive forces were used to calculate, via inverse dynamics, the joint torques during sit-to-stand in both before and after seat-off phases. The difference between the control and Parkinson’s disease group was analysed using independent t-tests. Results. Both control and Parkinson’s disease groups had a similar joint kinematic pattern, although the Parkinson’s disease group demonstrated a slower angular displacement. The latter subjects produced significantly smaller <b>normalized</b> hip flexion <b>torque</b> and presented a slower torque build-up rate than the able-bodied subjects (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. Slowness of sit-to-stand in people with Parkinson’s disease could be due to a reduced hip flexion joint torque and a prolonged rate of torque production. status: publishe...|$|R

We intended to analyze the association between isokinetic internal rotator and external rotator muscle strength and glenohumeral joint instability in patients with recurrent anterior instability that was not previously treated surgically. Methods: We enrolled thirty-seven patients with unilateral recurrent anterior posttraumatic shoulder dislocation and eleven healthy nonathletic subjects in this controlled study. The association between internal rotator and external rotator strength and shoulder instability was analyzed by side-to-side comparisons and comparisons with a control group. Isokinetic internal rotator and external rotator strength was evaluated with a Con-Trex dynamometer, with the subject seated and the shoulder abducted 45 in the scapular plane. Tests were performed at 180 /s, 120 /s, and 60 /s in concentric mode for both sides.

The aim {{of this study is to}} quantify the intervertebral efforts along the spine during walking, in order to compare the dynamical behaviours between a healthy and a scoliotic subject. Practically, one healthy subject, one scoliotic patient before an instrumentation surgery (Cobb 41 degrees) and after this instrumentation (Cobb 7. 5 degrees) walked on a treadmill at 4 km/h. The acquisition system included optokinetic sensors, recording the 3 D-joint coordinates, a treadmill equipped with strain gauges, measuring the external forces independently applied to both feet, and bi-planar radiographs, enabling the 3 D reconstruction of the spine from C 7 to L 5, using a free form interpolation technique. The intervertebral efforts were computed using an inverse dynamical model of the human body in 3 D. As results, significant differences of the spine kinematics were recorded which lead to different internal effort behaviour in magnitude, shift, coordination and pattern when normalized to the subject mass.
