First, a wideband circular slot antenna fed by a coplanar waveguide {{is designed to}} operate in the frequency range between 2. 3 and 11 GHz, which covers WLAN, WiBro, WiMAX, and UWB frequency bands. Next, resonant frequency variations of rejection bands are examined with respect to different slot locations and lengths when slots are inserted on the ground conductor and the circular patch of the antenna.

The proposed antenna {{consists of a}} wideband crossed semi-ring monopole and four L-shaped slots, producing band-notched characteristic. Effects of the various parameters for antenna performances are discussed. The central frequency and bandwidth of the <b>notched</b> <b>band</b> can be controlled easily by adjusting three key design parameters. A prototype is constructed and measured finally...|$|E
40|$|A {{new design}} of ultra-wideband (UWB) micro strip patch antenna with <b>notch</b> <b>band</b> {{characteristic}} for wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) application is presented in this paper. The proposed antenna consists of a rectangular patch with a partial ground plane that is fed by 50 Ω micro strip line. A <b>notch</b> <b>band</b> function is created by inserting overlapped one U-shape and one C-shape slot on the radiator patch, added additional patch to the ground plane side and slit in truncated ground plane. The proposed antenna potentially minimized frequency interference between WLAN and UWB system. This antenna with the size of 26 mm × 32 mm (W×L) and the simulated results show that the antenna can operate over the frequency band between 3. 1 and 10. 45 GHz for voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) > 2 with <b>band</b> <b>notch</b> 5. 06 - 5. 825 GHz. Besides in the working band, the antenna shows good radiation pattern in the H-plane and the E-plane and has good time domain characteristic...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{flexible}} ultrawideband (UWB) planar monopole antenna with dual-notched band characteristic printed on a polyimide substrate. The antenna is fed by a step coplanar waveguide (CPW) that provides smooth transitional impedance for improved matching. It operates from 2. 76 to 10. 6 [*]GHz with return loss greater than 10 [*]dB {{except for the}} <b>notch</b> <b>band</b> to reduce the interference with existing 3. 5 [*]GHz WiMAX band and 5. 5 [*]GHz WLAN band. With a combination of rectangular and circle patches in which the U-shaped slot is carved, the overall size of antenna is 30 [*]mm[*]×[*] 20 [*]mm. Moreover, a pair of arc-shaped stubs located at {{both sides of the}} feed line is utilized to create the <b>notch</b> <b>band</b> for WiMAX band. The results also show that the antenna has omnidirectional radiation pattern and smooth gain over the entire operational band...|$|R

The results are {{compared with that}} of a similar antenna where the slot is designed using conventional approach.
