40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between uncorrected residual wavefront error and visual performance (VP) in rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens-wearing keratoconic eyes. Methods. Seven eyes from six subjects (six moderate, one severe) were studied (mean SD age: 42. 71 11. 38 years). Significant corneal scarring was an exclusion criterion. Measurements were taken with RGP lenses in place. After pupil dilation, the VP measures of high contrast logMAR visual acuity (VA) and Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity (PRCS) were measured through a 5 -mm artificial pupil. Wavefront error was measured using a Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor and calculated over 5 mm. For both VP and wavefront error, comparisons were made to previously collected normal values by calculating the interval encompassing 95 % of normals, then reporting how many of the seven keratoconic eyes fell outside the <b>normal</b> <b>interval.</b> Additionally, second to sixth order aberrations were processed into four previously reported image quality metrics: root mean square of the wavefront (RMSw), root mean square of the slope (RMSs), average blur strength (Bave) and diameter containing 50 % light energy (D 50) and regressed against VP measures. Results. Five of seven keratoconic eyes fell outside the <b>normal</b> <b>interval</b> (0. 23 to 0. 09) for VA and two of seven fell outside the <b>normal</b> <b>interval</b> (1. 59 to 2. 03) for PRCS.

Some studies have shown decreased heart rate but have not been conclusive regarding other cardiac effects of sympathectomy. We studied the cardiac autonomic effects of endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy {{in a group of}} patients with primary hyperhidrosis. Heart rate variability is a simple, noninvasive electrocardiographic marker reflecting the activity and balance of the sympathetic and vagal components of the autonomous nervous system. MethodsWe performed a prospective study in 38 patients with primary hyperhidrosis with 24 -hour Holter recordings obtained before endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy and 6 months later. ResultsWe found statistically significant differences (P <. 05) in both time and frequency domains. Parameters that evaluate global cardiac autonomic activity (total power, SD of <b>normal</b> R-R <b>intervals,</b> SD of average <b>normal</b> R-R <b>intervals)</b> and vagal activity (rhythm corresponding to percentage of <b>normal</b> R-R <b>intervals</b> with cycle greater than 50 ms relative to previous interval, square root of mean squared differences of successive <b>normal</b> R-R <b>intervals,</b> high-frequency power, high-frequency power in normalized units) were statistically significantly increased after sympathectomy.

Seventeen swimmers were divided in two groups, performing a traditional periodization (TPG) or a reverse periodization (RPG) during a period of 10 weeks. Heart rate variability and 50 m swimming performance were analyzed before and after the training programs. After training, the TPG decreased the values of the high frequency band (HF), the number of differences between adjacent <b>normal</b> R-R <b>intervals</b> longer than 50 ms (NN 50) and the percentage of differences between adjacent <b>normal</b> R-R <b>intervals</b> more than 50 ms (pNN 50), and the RPG increased the values of HF and square root of the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent <b>normal</b> R-R <b>intervals</b> (RMSSD).

40|$|AbstractIn animals, baroreflex {{sensitivity}} is {{inversely related}} to the likelihood of ventricular fibrillation during myocardial ischemia. After myocardial infarction in human patients, reduced baroreflex sensitivity is associated with increased mortality. A reduced standard deviation of <b>normal</b> RR <b>intervals</b> over a 24 h period is also associated with reduced survival after myocardial infarction. Therefore, 32 normotensive men who had survived their first myocardial infarction were studied to define the relation between baroreflex sensitivity assessed with phenylephrine injection and three Hotter electrocardiographic measures of tonic vagal activity: the percent of successive <b>normal</b> RR <b>intervals</b> > 50 ms, the root mean square successive difference of <b>normal</b> RR <b>intervals</b> and the power in the high frequency energy of the <b>normal</b> RR <b>interval</b> power spectrum. Correlations among the Holter measures of heart period variability were ≥ 0. 94, indicating that these measures are so strongly correlated that {{any one of them}} can be used to represent the others. Baroreflex sensitivity showed weaker correlations with the three Holter variables (0. 57 to 0. 63), indicating that the Holter measures did not accurately predict baroreflex sensitivity. Baroreflex sensitivity showed a stronger correlation with the three Hotter variables during the night than during the day. Baroreflex sensitivity and tonic vagal activity reflected by Holter variables were reduced more in patients with inferior myocardial infarction than in those with anterior infarction. The relative utility of baroreflex sensitivity and Holter measures of tonic vagal activity in predicting sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction needs to be evaluated in a large prospective study...|$|R
