Using a former emperor's personal name (or even using a Chinese character from the name) was a punishable offense under traditional Chinese law. However, after Puyi lost his imperial title in 1924, he was officially styled [...] "Mr. Puyi" [...] (Mr. Pu-yi; [...] ) in Chinese. His clan name [...] "Aisin Gioro" [...] (...) was seldom used.|$|R

5000|$|Manchu <b>given</b> <b>names</b> {{were used}} solely or with titles {{but not with}} clan names. For example, Fiyanggū, who was from the Donggo clan, belonged to the Manchu Plain White Banner and {{distinguished}} himself in the campaigns against the Dzungars, was usually called [...] "Fiyanggū be" [...] (Lord Fiyanggū) since Fiyanggū (youngest) was a relatively major <b>given</b> <b>name.</b> Unlike Chinese <b>and</b> Europeans, he {{was not to be}} called by combination of family <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> i.e. Donggo Fiyanggū or Fiyanggū Donggo. Although we can find Aisin-Gioro Ulhicun and other figures, but it is a very modern practice. To specify the clan name, Manchus would have said something like [...] "Donggo hala-i Fiyanggū" [...] (Fiyanggū of the Donggo clan).|$|R
2500|$|After the war, the Dutch {{became less}} religious. Thus the Christian <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>name</b> started to diverge, as {{personal}} names of foreign origin were adopted. In some cases these names are written {{more or less}} phonetically, for example Sjaak (French Jacques, English Jack) and Sjaan (French Jeanne). (See also Sjors & Sjimmie.) Working-class <b>names</b> Jan, Piet <b>and</b> Klaas (the Dutch proverbial equivalent to [...] "Tom, Dick and Harry") were often replaced by middle-class Hans, Peter and Nico. Also, the urge to name children after their grandparents lessened dramatically. The change in naming also led to a new law on naming in 1970, replacing the old one, which had been in force since 1803.|$|R

5000|$|Bassam is an Arabic <b>name</b> <b>and</b> a <b>given</b> <b>name</b> roughly meaning [...] "one who smiles". More accurately, {{it is the}} Arabic name [...] "Basem" [...] (often {{incorrectly}} {{written in}} English as Bassem) that translates to [...] "one who smiles". Basem is the agent noun of the Arabic verb with the root ba-sa-ma, which means to smile. The name [...] "Bassam" [...] is the exaggerated form of the agent noun (Arabic: صيغه مبالغه), and would therefore roughly translates to [...] "one who smiles profusely".|$|R

50|$|Some Tamils {{also use}} an {{inverted}} patronym. For example, Swati Krishna might write her name as Krishna Swati, making her patronym the first <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>given</b> <b>name</b> the last name. More common among women, the inverted patronym is also adopted by people migrating to the West {{who want to}} be called by their <b>given</b> <b>names</b> without having to explain Indian naming conventions. In earlier times a caste name or village name was used by the Tamils as their surname, but the present day generation is wary to do so. However, people influenced by northern India or western civilization frequently adopt their father's or husband's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> take it for successive generations.The various Tamil caste names include Paraiyar, Vishwakarma, Aachari, Konar, Idaiyar, Yadhavar, Iyer, Pillai, Mudaliar, Thevar, Nadar, Chettiar, Gounder.The naming is therefore done in the fashion: Sunitha Ram Kumar Iyer. Hindus in Tamil Nadu view the practice of adding the full family name to an individuals name to be a heretic practice, as according to their beliefs, the individuals heritage does not trump his or her own identity. And hence they are known to only use initials besides their name except for when caste <b>names</b> are <b>given</b> more preference by certain families rather than the family name itself.|$|R
