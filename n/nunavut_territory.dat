5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the <b>Nunavut</b> <b>territory</b> in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E

25|$|Axel Heiberg Island {{has been}} {{inhabited}} {{in the past}} by Inuit people, but was uninhabited {{by the time it}} was named by Otto Sverdrup, who explored it in 1900-01. He named it after Axel Heiberg, financial director of the Norwegian Ringnes brewery which sponsored the expedition. Other explorers visited the island during the early 20th century, during which time it was claimed by Norway until 1930. It is now part of <b>Nunavut</b> <b>Territory,</b> Canada. It wasn't until the late 1940s that the island was aerially photographed by the United States Army Air Forces' Operation Polaris. In 1955 two geologists of the Geological Survey of Canada, N.J. McMillan and Souther, traversed the interior as part of Operation Franklin. McMillan's observations of Bunde Glacier, in northwest Axel Heiberg Island, are the earliest glaciological observations on the ground to have found their way into a scientific publication.|$|E
500|$|The name Tiktaalik is an Inuktitut {{word meaning}} [...] "burbot", a {{freshwater}} fish related to true cod. The [...] "fishapod" [...] genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada's <b>Nunavut</b> <b>Territory,</b> where the fossil was discovered. The specific name roseae cryptically honours an anonymous donor. Taking a detailed {{look at the}} internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae, in the October 16, 2008, issue of Nature, researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air, a key intermediate step in {{the transformation of the}} skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors.|$|E
