50|$|The most {{important}} objectives that are frequently found in <b>nanobiology</b> involve applying nanotools to relevant medical/biological problems and refining these applications. Developing new tools, such as peptoid nanosheets, for medical and biological purposes is another primary objective in nanotechnology. New nanotools are often made by refining the {{applications of the}} nanotools that are already being used. The imaging of native biomolecules, biological membranes, and tissues is also a major topic for the <b>nanobiology</b> researchers. Other topics concerning <b>nanobiology</b> {{include the use of}} cantilever array sensors and the application of nanophotonics for manipulating molecular processes in living cells.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>nanobiology</b> {{is in its}} infancy, {{there are}} a lot of {{promising}} methods that will rely on <b>nanobiology</b> in the future. Biological systems are inherently nano in scale; nanoscience must merge with biology in order to deliver biomacromolecules and molecular machines that are similar to nature. Controlling and mimicking the devices and processes that are constructed from molecules is a tremendous challenge to face the converging disciplines of nanotechnology. All living things, including humans, can be considered to be nanofoundries. Natural evolution has optimized the [...] "natural" [...] form of <b>nanobiology</b> over millions of years. In the 21st century, humans have developed the technology to artificially tap into <b>nanobiology.</b> This process is best described as [...] "organic merging with synthetic." [...] Colonies of live neurons can live together on a biochip device; according to research from Dr. Gunther Gross at the University of North Texas. Self-assembling nanotubes have the ability to be used as a structural system. They would be composed together with rhodopsins; which would facilitate the optical computing process and help with the storage of biological materials. DNA (as the software for all living things) can be used as a structural proteomic system - a logical component for molecular computing. Ned Seeman - a researcher at New York University - along with other researchers are currently researching concepts that are similar to each other.|$|E
50|$|Nanobiotechnology, bionanotechnology, and <b>nanobiology</b> are {{terms that}} {{refer to the}} {{intersection}} of nanotechnology and biology. Given that the subject {{is one that has}} only emerged very recently, bionanotechnology and nanobiotechnology serve as blanket terms for various related technologies.|$|E

50|$|Nanobiotechnology (sometimes {{referred}} to as <b>nanobiology)</b> is best described as helping modern medicine progress from treating symptoms to generating cures and regenerating biological tissues. Three American patients have received whole cultured bladders {{with the help of}} doctors who use <b>nanobiology</b> techniques in their practice. Also, it has been demonstrated in animal studies that a uterus can be grown outside the body and then placed in the body in order to produce a baby. Stem cell treatments have been used to fix diseases that are found in the human heart and are in clinical trials in the United States. There is also funding for research into allowing people to have new limbs without having to resort to prosthesis. Artificial proteins might also become available to manufacture without the need for harsh chemicals and expensive machines. It has even been surmised that by the year 2055, computers may be made out of biochemicals and organic salts.|$|E
50|$|Lim studied {{physics at}} the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2003 he {{obtained}} his PhD from the National University of Singapore for research carried out at the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering.

50|$|This {{discipline}} {{helps to}} indicate the merger of biological research with various fields of nanotechnology. Concepts that are enhanced through <b>nanobiology</b> include: nanodevices (such as biological machines), nanoparticles, and nanoscale phenomena that occurs within the discipline of nanotechnology. This technical approach to biology allows scientists to imagine and create systems {{that can be used}} for biological research. Biologically inspired nanotechnology uses biological systems as the inspirations for technologies not yet created. However, as with nanotechnology and biotechnology, bionanotechnology does have many potential ethical issues associated with it.|$|E

40|$|Background: Students {{starting}} {{off on a}} tertiary education program but then dropping out again before obtaining their degree {{is a big problem}} worldwide. One of the most important reasons mentioned for this is “making the wrong study choice”. Proper information can help high school students to make a “right” choice. The Delft University of Technology, together with the Erasmus University Rotterdam, recently started up a new joint bachelor program “Nanobiology”. This program is used as background for a case study to research what information strategy could be used to lower dropout rates, using the following question. Research Question: “In order to contribute towards preventing dropout in the future <b>Nanobiology</b> student population, by a) encouraging prospective students with a high probability to be successful in the program, to consider enrolment, while b) discouraging prospective students who have a low probability to be successful in the program, from enrolment: which information elements about the <b>Nanobiology</b> program should be emphasized in communication with high school students?” Methods: Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used, including: a literature study to uncover “choice” and “success” factors; a qualitative analysis of what core elements constitute the <b>Nanobiology</b> program and a quantitative analysis of the outcome of a questionnaire sampling the target population. Indicators of 1) interest and 2) success probabilities with respect to the <b>Nanobiology</b> program were measured amongst 5 VWO students with NT and/or NG profiles using the survey. The respondent population was segmented according to these two dimensions, using cluster analysis in SPSS. The 38 elements found to describe the <b>Nanobiology</b> bachelor were reduced to a few theme’s using factor analysis in SPSS. Outcome: The cluster analysis revealed four segments, two of which scored high on indicators of interest in the program. The first of these, the “dream” segment, also scored positive on indicators of success probability while the second, the “risky” segment, scored negative on the success indicators. The factor analysis produced five grand theme’s describing the <b>Nanobiology</b> program: Biomedical-/Molecular Biology, Exact/STEM, Fundamental/Science, Innovative/Specialist and International, Of these the “Exact/STEM” theme received a positive score from the “dream” cluster and a negative score from the “risky” cluster. Conslusion: Emphasizing this theme in informative communication with the target group is therefore expected to contribute towards the goal of lowering dropout rates, benefitting both the program and the students.
