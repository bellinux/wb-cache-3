Today when the supply air {{in the operating room}} is HEPA-filtered, the main source of airborne microorganisms is people (patient and personnel). The filtration efficacy of the fabric in operating clothing systems plays an important role. The design of the clothing system also affects the number of particles emitted from people to the air of the operating room. In operating rooms for surgery susceptible to infections, the selection of clothing systems for the operating personnel should no longer only be considered in terms of comfort but also in terms of patient safety. Today clothing and clothing systems for cleanrooms and associated controlled rooms such as ultraclean operating rooms are mainly tested with regard to material properties, such as particle generation, particle filtration, resistance to wear and comfort.

40|$|Bonded {{non-woven}} fabrics are porous engineering materials in which disordered fibers are consolidated by a polymeric binder. The bonded <b>non-woven</b> <b>material</b> under investigation {{is used for}} thermal and acoustical insulation purposes. The microstructure of such materials is tailored to minimize thermal conductivity. As external mechanical loadings disturb the microstructure, the mechanics of thermal insulation materials are of relevance to ensure the long-term effectiveness of insulation. ^ The deformation of non-woven materials {{is known to be}} non-affine. Classic continuum mechanics theory is often not applicable. The difficulty in predicting the mechanical behavior of such materials arises from the heterogeneous microstructure and convoluted deformation mechanisms. It results in a lack of fundamental understanding in the mechanics of such a material. There are also industrial needs of quality control measures. This thesis focuses on 3 D modeling and characterization with automated material phase separation, deformation and damage micromechanism in compression and notch effect in tensile failure of the bonded <b>non-woven</b> <b>material.</b> ^ Major contributions have been achieved through experimentation and modeling. Firstly, 3 D microstructure models with the binder phase effectively separated from the finder and porosity were established. With the realistic microstructural representation, characteristics of the microstructure are accurately measured. The mechanical response in monotonic and cyclic compression was investigated. Computations based on realistic 3 D models reveal formations of fiber chains and fiber-fiber contact to accommodate compression. Therefore, both the compressive modulus and the degradation of the modulus due to cyclic loading were found to be dependent on the modulus of the binder phase. Acoustic emission analysis further enables to quantitatively relate fiber fracture events in the microstructure to the specimen damage state. In uniaxial tension, failure of notched and unnotched specimens of the bonded non-woven exhibits a notch effect, in which the net section strength increases with the depth depth. It results from the long-range interaction of fiber chains throughout the whole specimen domain. ^ From a practical standpoint, this thesis successfully demonstrates the application of synchrotron CT system to multi-phase material systems and the acoustic emission technique to monitor the internal damage in the material system. In addition, two key mechanical characteristics are proposed to characterize mechanical performance. Specifically, the role of the binder phase in this bonded <b>non-woven</b> <b>material</b> is highlighted. Investigations on the failure of notched specimens provide insights in the context of material design with non-affinity. ...|$|E
40|$|Non–woven {{materials}} {{consist of}} {{many thousands of}} fibres laid down on a conveyor belt {{under the influence of}} a turbulent air stream. To improve industrial processes for the production of non–woven materials, we develop and explore novel mathematical fibre and material models. In Part I of this thesis we improve existing mathematical models describing the fibres on the belt in the meltspinning process. In contrast to existing models, we include the fibre–fibre interaction caused by the fibres’ thickness which prevents the intersection of the fibres and, hence, results in a more accurate mathematical description. We start from a microscopic characterisation, where each fibre is described by a stochastic functional differential equation and include the interaction along the whole fibre path, which is described by a delay term. As many fibres are required for the production of a <b>non–woven</b> <b>material,</b> we consider the corresponding mean–field equation, which describes the evolution of the fibre distribution with respect to fibre position and orientation. To analyse the particular case of large turbulences in the air stream, we develop the diffusion approximation which yields a distribution describing the fibre position. Considering the convergence to equilibrium on an analytical level, as well as performing numerical experiments, gives an insight into the influence of the novel interaction term in the equations. In Part II of this thesis we model the industrial airlay process, which is a production method whereby many short fibres build a three–dimensional <b>non–woven</b> <b>material.</b> We focus on the development of a material model based on original fibre properties, machine data and micro computer tomography. A possible linking of these models to other simulation tools, for example virtual tensile tests, is discussed.

PCL was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone in bulk using stannous octoate as the catalyst under nitrogen atmosphere. PCL was then processed into non-woven matrices composed of nanofibers by electrospinning of the polymer from its solution using a high voltage power supply. The effects of PCL concentration, composition of the solvent (a mixture of chloroform and DMF with different DMF content), applied voltage and tip–collector distance on fiber diameter and morphology were investigated. The diameter of fibers increased with the increase in the polymer concentration and decrease in the DMF content significantly. Applied voltage and tip–collector distance were found critical to control 'bead' formation. Elongation-at-break, ultimate strength and Young's modulus were obtained from the mechanical tests, which were all increased by increasing fiber diameter. The fiber diameter significantly influenced both in vitro degradation (performed in Ringer solution) and in vivo biodegradation (conducted in rats) rates. In vivo degradation was found to be faster than in vitro. Electrospun membranes were more hydrophobic than PCL solvent-casted ones; therefore, their degradation was a much slower process...|$|R
