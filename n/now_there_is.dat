5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area <b>now.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E

The Hungarian censuses ignored the Polish nationality, all ethnic Poles were registered as Slovaks. There {{was also a}} very strong process of Slovakization of Polish people throughout 18th–20th centuries, mostly done by Roman Catholic Church, in which institution the local aboriginal Polish priests were replaced with Slovak ones. Also the institution of schooling was replacing the polish language with slovak language during classes.|$|E

25|$|These {{important}} scientific {{findings may}} begin to shift the neuron-specific perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. The glia's importance is becoming ever more clear {{as time goes on}} and new research is conducted. For the vast part of the last century, scientists have written off glial cells to be nothing more than the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place. But <b>now,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.|$|E

25|$|From Malta {{the knights}} resumed their seaborne attacks of Ottoman shipping, {{and before long}} the Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent ordered a final attack on the Order. By this time the Knights had {{occupied}} the city of Birgu, which had excellent harbours to house their fleet. Birgu {{was one of the}} two major urban places at that time, the other most urban place being Mdina the old capital city of Malta. The defences around Birgu were enhanced and new fortifications built on the other point where <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> Senglea. A small fort was built {{at the tip of the}} peninsula where the city of Valletta now stands and was named Fort Saint Elmo.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{were the}} first colonists to settle in Colombo; {{establishing}} a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort in the island. The Dutch expanded the fort thus creating a well old fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s and by the late 19th century the seeing no threat to the Colombo Harbour, began demolishing the ramparts {{to make way for}} the development of the city. Although <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing left of the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area outside is Pettah or පිටකොටුව in Sinhalese which means outer fort.|$|E
