5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and <b>not</b> <b>around</b> the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Grosmont's early years, {{but that he was}} born at Grosmont Castle in Grosmont, Monmouthshire, Wales, and that he was born c. 1310, <b>not</b> <b>around</b> {{the turn of the century}} as {{previously}} held. According to his own memoirs, he was better at martial arts than at academic subjects, and did not learn to read until later in life. In 1330 he was knighted, and represented his father in parliament. The next year he is recorded as participating in a royal tournament at Cheapside.|$|E
5|$|Manuel's career under Leo's successor, Michael II the Amorian (r. 820–829), is unclear, {{as he is}} not {{mentioned}} in the sources during this period. Certainly {{at the time of the}} outbreak of the great rebellion of Thomas the Slav, the strategos of the Armeniacs was Olbianos, while the Anatolics joined the rebellion. Manuel himself, however, evidently remained loyal to Michael, and it was probably the latter who raised him to the rank of magistros. The editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit suggest that Manuel may have been recalled by Michael to Constantinople, especially if the marriage of Michael's son and heir Theophilos (r. 829–842) and Manuel's niece Theodora took place around 821, as suggested by E.W. Brooks, and <b>not</b> <b>around</b> 830, as suggested by Treadgold.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{cinematography}} {{was shot}} at night, because Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less believable. Bakshi recounts that during {{the first day of}} shooting, the actors were unable to play their roles naturally, but began casually talking and acting the way he wanted their characters to act when the cameras were off, including flirting with an actress. However, the camera man was <b>not</b> <b>around</b> to capture these events, so Bakshi filmed them himself. When Bakshi excitedly told William A. Fraker about this, Fraker quit the production, and was replaced by a young cinematographer who had never worked in film before.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was <b>not</b> <b>around.</b> Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E

Within a short time they became lovers, but even after their physical affair diminished a few years later, they continued to work together whenever O'Keeffe was <b>not</b> <b>around</b> until Stieglitz died in 1946.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this process that Brian pursued an {{alternative}} means of consolidating his control, not merely over the province of Ulster, but over Ireland as a whole. In contrast to its structure elsewhere, the Church in Ireland was centred, <b>not</b> <b>around</b> the bishops of dioceses and archbishops of archdioceses, but rather around monasteries headed by powerful abbots {{who were members of}} the royal dynasties of the lands in which their monasteries resided. Among the most important monasteries was Armagh, located in the Province of Ulster.|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{moved to}} Calgary in 1897. A lifelong {{bachelor}} and teetotaler (although Bennett was known by select associates to occasionally drink alcohol when {{the press was}} <b>not</b> <b>around</b> to observe this), he led a rather lonely life in a hotel and later, in a boarding house. For a while a younger brother roomed with him. He ate his noon meal on workdays at the Alberta Hotel. Social life, such as it was, centred on church. There was, however, no scandal attached to his personal life. Bennett worked hard and gradually built up his legal practice. In 1908 {{he was one of}} five people appointed to the first Library Board for the city of Calgary and was instrumental in establishing the Calgary Public Library.|$|E

He usually serves as the aviation in the TNT group and to carry messages from Number One to the TNT group or his allies when he is <b>not</b> <b>around,</b> and often ends up saving them in dangerous missions. He enjoys beef steaks and is a former alcoholic; his drinking habits are occasionally shown throughout the issues. He was absent throughout {{the part of the}} series due to his temporary relocation to Los Angeles when he lived with The Great Caesar; the two constantly clashed and both were relieved when Clodoveo returned to New York.|$|E
25|$|The sand {{tiger shark}} {{can be found in}} the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas.

It is also found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea to the Canary Islands, at the Cape Verde Islands, along the coasts of Senegal and Ghana, and from southern Nigeria to Cameroon. In the western Indian Ocean, the shark ranges from South Africa to southern Mozambique, but excluding Madagascar. The {{sand tiger shark}} has also been sighted in the Red Sea and may be found as far east as India. In the western Pacific, it has been sighted in the waters around the coasts of Japan and Australia, but <b>not</b> <b>around</b> New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The Boss (real name Gervasius De Statuis, {{also known}} as Big Boss) is Number One's {{right-hand}} man and his second-in-command.

He is at odds with Number One, who despises him for his laziness and inability to perform missions. He usually sleeps in the back of the flower shop, but occasionally joins the other TNT members on large-scale missions. After Bob, he is the most vocal about his salary, but is constantly rebuffed by Number One. His best friend is Jeremiah, but almost constantly bickers with him. He has a hamster named Squitty, and he is very devoted to him and protects him at all costs. He wears old ruptured pants, a bowler hat, a coat and a cardigan stripped shirt.|$|E
