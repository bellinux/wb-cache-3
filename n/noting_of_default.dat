40|$|I propose {{creation}} of a venture bank, able to multiply the capital of a venture capital firm by up to 47 times, without requiring access to the Federal Reserve or other central bank apart from settlement. This concept rests on insuring loans to expand Tier 1 and 2 capital. Profitability depends on overall portfolio performance, availability <b>of</b> <b>default</b> insurance <b>notes,</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>default</b> insurance, and the multiple of original capital (MOC) adopted by the venture bank. If the form that uses interbank funds is used, then it also depends on the interbank funds rates. I propose a new derivative financial instrument, the Default Insurance Note (DIN), to insure loans to venture investments. A DIN {{is similar to a}} credit default swap (CDS) but with a host of unique features. The features and operation of these new derivative instruments are outlined along with audit requirements. This instrument would be traded on open-outcry exchanges with special rules to ensure orderly operation of the market. It is the {{creation of}} public markets for DINs that makes possible the use of public market pricing to indirectly establish a market capitalization for the underlying venture-bank investment, which is the key to achieving regulatory acceptance of the fully-insured version of this proposal. That fully-insured version insulates the venture-bank from losses in most situations, and multiplies profitability quite dramatically in all scenarios. Ten year returns above 10 are attainable. I show that both where the DIN is a minor fraction of investment, and where the DIN insures 100 % of invested funds for the duration, in the normal range of returns the DIN underwriting business is profitable.

40|$|The {{importance}} of estimation of a firm's probability <b>of</b> <b>default</b> increased significantly during {{the economic and}} financial crisis for financial institutions, which {{can be explained by}} the fact that the share of nonperforming loans increased in this period.

The aim of this study is to estimate the probability <b>of</b> <b>default</b> <b>of</b> companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange using this methodology.

Leung, Sircar and Zariphopoulou (2008) recently introduced a structural model, in which <b>default</b> <b>of</b> the reference entity is triggered by a (non-traded) credit worthiness index, and utilized indifference pricing to value defaultable bonds. We build on this base structural model and add a new distressed regime which allows for unpredictable defaults, thus creating a hybrid model <b>of</b> <b>default.</b> Furthermore, in an unrelated paper, Uppal and Wang (2003) study portfolio optimization when model parameters are unknown. By combining the hybrid default model with the uncertain parameter portfolio optimization problem, we succeed in determining corporate bond spreads and CDS spreads using indifference valuation.

40|$|Two models <b>of</b> <b>default</b> risk are {{prominent}} in the financial literature: Merton’s structural model and Altman’s reduced-form model. The former has the benefit of being responsive, since the probabilities <b>of</b> <b>default</b> can continually be updated with the evolution of firms’ asset values. Its main flaw {{lies in the fact}} that it may over- or underestimate the probabilities <b>of</b> <b>default,</b> since asset values are unobservable and must be extrapolated from the share prices. The latter, on the other hand, is more precise, since it uses firms’ accounting data—but it is less flexible. In this paper, we investigate the hybrid contingent claim approach with publicly traded Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

40|$|Abstract. Financial {{innovation}} {{in the form of}} credit derivatives, changingregulatory capital requirements and competitive pressuresin distressed debt investing have fuelled recent interest in modeling the payoffs to corporate debt in the event <b>of</b> <b>default.</b> We propose a relatively simple, accurate and flexible approach to forecasting the distribution <b>of</b> <b>defaulted</b> debt recovery outcomes. Our approach is based on mixtures of Gaussian distributions, explicitly conditioned on borrower characteristics, debt instrument characteristics and credit conditions at the time <b>of</b> <b>default.</b> Using Moody’s Ultimate Recovery Database, we show that our mixture specification yields more accurate forecasts of ultimate recoveries on portfolios <b>of</b> <b>defaulted</b> loans and bonds on an out-of-sample basis than popular parametric regression-based estimates. Further, the economically interpretable outputs of our model provide a richer characterization of how conditioning variables affect recovery outcomes than competing approaches. The latter benefit is of particular importance in understanding shifts in the relative likelihood of extreme recoveryoutcomes that tend to be realized morefrequently than observations near the distributional mean. The economic value of debt in the event <b>of</b> <b>default</b> is a key determinant <b>of</b> the <b>default</b> risk premium required by a lender and the regulatory capital charged to limit exposure to losses.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>default,</b> PD, is {{a crucial}} problem for banks. In the last years international accords (Basel, Basel 2 and Basel 3) have incentived banks to adopt objectives systems to evaluating and monitoring risk <b>of</b> <b>default</b> in order to predict PD for new loans based on borrowerâs characteristics. The {{aim of this study}} is to introduce a discrete survival model to study the risk <b>of</b> <b>default</b> and to propose the empirical evidence by the Italian banking system. Approach: Survival analysis is used if we are interested in whether and when an event occurs. In this context the event occurrence represents a borrowerâs transition from one state, loan in bonis that is not in default, to another state, the default. In this study through a survival model (in particular a discrete-time hazard model) it is possible verify when the probability <b>of</b> <b>default</b> is the highest considering, for each group of loans, a set of explanatory variables as risk factors of PD. Results: The empirical application obtained through a discrete time hazard model have provided clear evidence that time when the default occurs is an important element to predict the probability <b>of</b> <b>default</b> in time. Regarding Italian data the hazard model shows that explanatory variables (i. e., territorial area, productive economic sector, size of loan and generation of belonging) have effects both on if and on when loan bankrupts. Conclusion: The hazard model estimated for a population of loans involve different probability <b>of</b> <b>default</b> considering conjointly the explanatory variables and the time when the default occurs. Considering jointly the time and the risk factors a probability <b>of</b> <b>default</b> has been modelled for two main groups of loans: âGood borrowersâ for which the risk <b>of</b> <b>default</b> is the lowest and âbad borrowersâ for which this risk is the highest...|$|R
