A noteworthy exception {{is a recent}} invader of North American lakes and rivers, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha. Consequences of this novel ecological type in these systems are not fully understood. Using computer simulations we modelled the potential consequences of Dreissena abundance for lake planktonic community structure along a <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradient,</b> using Green Bay of Lake Michigan as an example.

Model results indicate that Dreissena have strong negative effects on large phytoplankton, with chlorophyll reduced up to 80 % {{as compared to the}} same community without zebra mussels. Results also indicate that Dreissena have relatively small effects on nanoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton. Effects are qualitatively similar along the <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradient,</b> and are strongest at the most eutrophic site.

The central question we focus on in this study is to find out whether Mud Lake Bog, located near Pellston, Michigan has a <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradient</b> between Mud Lake and the surrounding forest. We then related these nutrient findings to see how the <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradient</b> affects the pigmentation of Sarracenia within the bog. In order to complete this task we sampled for nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, and pH level in order to identify a <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradient</b> and calculated red pixel proportions of pitchers to find the effects the nutrients have on pigmentation. The results showed a nitrate gradient starting low at the lake and raising as we got closer to the surrounding forest. There was no statistical significance related to the other nutrients’ gradients, or a relationship between Sarracenia redness and nutrient availability. This shows that nitrate is affected by some factor at the bog, potentially the makeup of tree communities on either side of our transect. These results also show that other factors besides the visible light spectrum, measured as redness, such as ultraviolet radiation, microhabitat existence, or nectar production may be a more determinant factor related to nutrient availability. Understanding these distinctive habitats can garner information used to implement protection strategies for conservation of these valuable wetlands. Introduction...|$|E

With decreasing depth and consequently lower mean tidal current velocities, phytoplankton removal by benthic suspension feeders and sedimentation of suspended particulate matter (SPM) increase.

During the following 12 weeks respiration activity, microbial (SIR) biomass, nitrogen limitation of respiration activity in soil slurries all indicated that nitrogen was transferred in the soil from the nutrient rich vetch to the nutrient poor barley at least during the first 3 weeks of the experiment. Twelve out of 39 taxonomic groups of nematodes showed different growth in the two plant material-soil mixtures. Only one of these taxonomic groups (long rhabditid larvae) suggested that migration could have contributed to population development; for three other groups (short rhabditid larvae, Aphelenchoides, and Bursilla) nutrient transport through the soil was the likely mechanism for a distance-dependant population development.

The recirculation rate had a significant effect on the oxygen concentration in the external loop, with oxygen being depleted within the cell-retention device at recirculation rates below 6 m 3 /m 3 reactor · d (= 600 L/d).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{regeneration}} of functional, clinically viable, {{tissues from}} acellular ex vivo tissues has been problematic {{largely due to}} poor nutrient transport conditions that limit cell migration and integration. Compounding these issues are subcellular pore sizes that necessarily requires extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in order for cells to migrate and regenerate the tissue. The aim of the present work {{was to create a}} directed growth environment that allows cells to fully populate an ex vivo-derived vascular scaffold and maintain viability over extended periods. Three different culture conditions using single (one nutrient source) or dual perfusion bioreactor systems (two nutrients sources) were designed to assess the effect of pressure and <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradients</b> under either low (50 / 30 mmHg) or high (120 / 80) relative pressure conditions. Human myofibroblasts were seeded to the ablumenal periphery of an ex vivo-derived vascular scaffold using a collagen/hydrogel cell delivery system. After 30 days culture, total cell density was consistent between groups; however, significant variation was noted in cell distribution and construct mechanics as a result of differing perfusion conditions. The most aggressive transport gradient was developed by the single perfusion low-pressure circuits and resulted in a higher proportion of cells migrating across the scaffold toward the vessel lumen (nutrient source). These investigations illustrate the influence of directed <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradients</b> where precisely controlled perfusion conditions significantly affects cell migration, distribution and function, resulting in pronounced effects on construct mechanics during early remodeling events...|$|R

This study investigates the floristic composition and site characteristics of old permanent semi-natural grasslands in North-east Scotland and tests using pot and field experiments the role of soil fertility in determining vascular plant species richness, relative abundance and dynamics of communities. Results from field surveys show that, of the site characteristics quantified, vascular plant species richness is most strongly correlated (negative relationship) with extractable soil phosphorus.   Where species richness is high (> 40 in a study stand and > 17 in a 1 m 2 quadrat) extractable soil phosphorus levels (determined by ammonium acetate-acetic acid/polyacrylamide solution extraction and using inductively coupled radio frequency plasma spectrometry by the atomic emission method) are consistently very low (- 1 soil) by local agricultural standards. In pot experiments using soil from a site where high species richness is maintained, the loss of forb and graminoid species from synthesised communities may be shown to increase along a <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradient</b> created by incorporating increments of phosphorus.   Despite a general increase in the above ground biomass of species which survive, those {{with the ability to}} form nitrogen-fixing nodules grow to dominate the community.   By comparison, a <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradient</b> created by the incorporation of potassium has little effect on the species richness of synthesised communities.

Moreover, the nutrients decreased with an increase in the distance from the shore on the southern side of the bay. Among the candidate indicators, the P content of the tissues closely mirrored the two <b>nutrient</b> loading <b>gradients.</b> The epiphytic algae biomass and the N content in the tissues mirrored one of the two nutrient loading trends. The leaf length, however, exhibited a significant negative correlation with the <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradients.</b> We propose that changes in the P content of T. hemprichii, followed by epiphytic algae biomass and N content of the tissues, may be the useful indicators of nutrient loading to coastal ecosystems.

40|$|Worldwide, {{seagrasses}} {{provide important}} habitats in coastal ecosystems, but seagrass meadows are often degraded or destroyed by cultural eutrophication. Presently, {{there are no}} available tools for early assessment of nutrient over-enrichment; direct measurements of water column nutrients are ineffective since the nutrients typical of early enrichment are rapidly taken up by plants within the ecosystem. We investigated whether, in a <b>gradient</b> of <b>nutrient</b> availability but prior to actual habitat loss, eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) plant morphology and tissue nutrients might reflect environmental nutrient availability. Eelgrass responses to nitrogen along estuarine gradients were assessed; two of these plant responses were combined to create an early indicator of nutrient over-enrichment. Eelgrass plant morphology and leaf tissue nitrogen (N) were measured along <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradients</b> in three New England estuaries: Great Bay Estuary (NH), Narragansett Bay (RI) and Waquoit Bay (MA). Eelgrass leaf N was significantly higher in up-estuary sampling stations than stations down-estuary, reflecting environmental nitrogen gradients. Leaf N content showed high variance, however, limiting its ability to discriminate {{the early stages of}} eutrophication. To find a stronger indicator, plant morphological characteristics such as number of leaves per shoot, blade width, and leaf and sheath length were examined, but they only weakly correlated with leaf tissue N. Area normalized leaf mass (mg dry weight cm− 2), however, exhibited a strong and consistently negative relationship with leaf tissue N and a significant response to the estuarine <b>nutrient</b> <b>gradients.</b> We found the ratio of leaf N to leaf mass to be a more sensitive and consistent indicator of early eutrophication than either characteristic alone. We suggest the use of this ratio as a nutrient pollution indicator (NPI) ...|$|R
