5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage. Malliagh explained that Chinese Nü Yr is based {{a story about}} 'Xiāngjiāo', a gelatinous and amorphous worm who wears a witch hat and is voiced by heavily pitch-shifted and processed recordings {{of his father and}} little sister. Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and <b>nonsensical</b> lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground. Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed at which it travels. In a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated the fate of the worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an {{extended}} play (EP) by producer Seamus Malliagh, known by his stage name Iglooghost, released on the Brainfeeder label on 30 October 2015. Containing elements of footwork, bass, grime and 2-step garage, the EP's sound {{is represented by}} a worm who goes through several <b>nonsensical</b> lands. To make Chinese Nü Yr, Malliagh first designed the cover art and then developed songs with structures and sound to fit the artwork. Upon release, the EP garnered generally favorable reviews from critics, a common praise being its unique style.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or <b>nonsensical</b> names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and <b>nonsensical</b> ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
5|$|Small gold goat statues {{are hidden}} in the game's world. Collecting this allows the goat to restart the game with various {{modifiers}} in play, such as changing the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about the sandbox, such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding <b>nonsensical</b> or obscene signs).|$|E
5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} <b>nonsensical,</b> {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum {{physical}} power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Camperdown was an {{important}} naval action of the French Revolutionary Wars, fought off Camperduin on the North Holland coast on 11 October 1797 between a British fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan and a Dutch fleet under Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter. The French Republic had overrun the Dutch Republic two years earlier, reforming it into the Batavian Republic. In early 1797, the Dutch Navy was ordered to sail to Brest and unite with the French Atlantic Fleet in preparation for an invasion of Ireland. Shortly afterwards, the British fleets were paralysed by the Spithead and Nore mutinies, in which the sailors refused to take their ships to sea until they were awarded better pay and conditions. For two months, the English Channel was undefended, but the Dutch failed to {{take the opportunity to}} sail from their harbour in the Texel: their preparations were not complete, and a small squadron of loyal British ships under Duncan convinced de Winter that the British fleet was at sea by sending <b>nonsensical</b> signals to fictitious ships over the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Though jazz {{had long}} since {{achieved}} some limited popularity, it was Louis Armstrong who {{became one of the}} first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz, along with his friend pianist Earl Hines. Armstrong, Hines, and their colleagues were improvisers, capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody. Armstrong also popularized scat singing, an improvisational vocal technique in which <b>nonsensical</b> syllables (vocables) are sung. Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called swing. Swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of double bass and drums, medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note, which is common to most jazz. Swing is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and Tin Pan Alley. Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz, leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation, previously an integral part of jazz. Swing became a major part of African American dance, and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance.|$|E
25|$|Theater {{also has}} an {{important}} place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on <b>nonsensical</b> humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.|$|E
25|$|Billy Draper, Adam Draper, and Coulter Mulligan {{play the}} roles of Billy, Donnie, and Johnny Timmerman, {{all of whom are}} <b>nonsensical.</b> Together, they formed The Timmerman Brothers, an {{initially}} quite successful musical group whose popularity diminished when their voices deepened during puberty.|$|E
25|$|Kif Kroker (Maurice LaMarche) – Zapp Brannigan's 4th Lieutenant and long-suffering {{personal}} assistant, Kif is {{a member}} of the amphibious species that inhabits the planet Amphibios 9. Although extremely timid, he eventually works up the courage to date Amy. Kif is often shown sighing in disgust at the <b>nonsensical</b> rantings of his commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|Terrorism {{is after}} all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus {{effectively}} <b>nonsensical.</b> As {{there is no}} space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term 'militancy'. This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.|$|E
25|$|The {{displacement}} of a particle undergoing Brownian motion is obtained by solving the diffusion equation under appropriate boundary conditions {{and finding the}} rms of the solution. This shows that the displacement varies as the square root of the time (not linearly), which explains why previous experimental results concerning the velocity of Brownian particles gave <b>nonsensical</b> results. A linear time dependence was incorrectly assumed.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{traditional}} encyclopedias, Wikipedia {{follows the}} procrastination principle regarding {{the security of}} its content. It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even {{those who did not}} have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and <b>nonsensical</b> or irrelevant text.|$|E
25|$|A {{grammatical}} string is {{not necessarily}} meaningful, as exemplified by Chomsky’s famous sentence ‘Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’. However, language speakers can still understand <b>nonsensical</b> string by natural intonation and that speakers are able to recall them more easily than ungrammatical sentences. It is also suggested that speakers {{are supposed to have}} intuitions about grammaticality, which is determined by their competence on that language.|$|E
25|$|Some {{messages}} are {{presented to the}} listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat <b>nonsensical),</b> one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and {{a different set of}} words going backwards). Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.|$|E
25|$|Paranoia is {{a humorous}} {{role-playing}} game {{set in a}} dystopian future similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, Logan's Run, and THX 1138; however, {{the tone of the}} game is rife with black humor, frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy. Most of the game's humor is derived from the players' (usually futile) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to The Computer's arbitrary, contradictory and often <b>nonsensical</b> security directives.|$|E
25|$|John Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley {{propose that}} dreams {{are caused by}} the random firing of neurons in the {{cerebral}} cortex during the REM period. Neatly, this theory helps explain the irrationality of the mind during REM periods, as, according to this theory, the forebrain then creates a story {{in an attempt to}} reconcile and make sense of the <b>nonsensical</b> sensory information presented to it. This would explain the odd nature of many dreams.|$|E
25|$|Peierls {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} Pauli to become his assistant vice Felix Bloch. Lev Landau was there at this time on a scholarship from {{the government of the}} Soviet Union, and Peierls and Landau became friends. They collaborated on deriving a series of wave equations similar to the Schrödinger equation for photons. Unfortunately, their equations, while complicated, were <b>nonsensical.</b> In 1930, Peierls travelled to the Netherlands to meet Hans Kramers, and to Copenhagen to meet Niels Bohr.|$|E
25|$|To {{illustrate}} this point, Chomsky created the <b>nonsensical</b> sentence in (1), {{which does not}} occur in any corpus, is not meaningful, and is not statistically probable. However, the form of this sentence is judged to be grammatical by many native speakers of English. Such grammaticality judgements {{reflect the fact that}} the structure of sentence (1) obeys the rules of English grammar. This can be seen by comparing sentence (1) with sentence (2). Both sentences have the same structure, and both are grammatically well-formed.|$|E
25|$|French Polynesia {{came to the}} {{forefront}} of the world music scene in 1992, with the release of The Tahitian Choir's recordings of unaccompanied vocal Christian music called himene tārava, recorded by French musicologist Pascal Nabet-Meyer. This form of singing is common in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, and is distinguished by a unique drop in pitch {{at the end of the}} phrases, which is a characteristic formed by several different voices; it is also accompanied by steady grunting of staccato, <b>nonsensical</b> syllables.|$|E
25|$|The first Achewood strip ("Philippe is {{standing}} on it") was released on October 1, 2001. Onstad has stated in multiple interviews that he was inspired to launch the strip {{by the events of}} September 11, 2001. The strip sets the tone for future strips with its <b>nonsensical</b> humor and flat visual punchline. In this particular strip, Mr. Bear and Téodor are discussing Téodor's confusion over a drum machine. Mr. Bear informs Téodor that there is an instruction manual. However, Philippe {{is standing}} on it.|$|E
25|$|Coupled with Russell's other doctrines, this {{influenced}} the logical positivists, who formulated {{the theory of}} emotivism or non-cognitivism, which states that ethical propositions (along with those of metaphysics) were essentially meaningless and <b>nonsensical</b> or, at best, little more than expressions of attitudes and preferences. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not construe ethical propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that ethical considerations are not only meaningful, but {{that they are a}} vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the patron saint of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to ethical considerations.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Snowden was {{nominated}} for the IQ Award {{by members of the}} non-profit organization Mensa Germany. Although the official IQ Award commission confirmed his nomination, the managing board of Mensa threatened the commission to subdue Snowden's nomination, and in doing so, they violated the Mensa bylaws. The German Mensa board did this also in reaction to talks with Mensa International. Consequently, it was not possible for Mensa members to vote for Snowden. This caused big controversies among the Mensa members, leading to the effect that opposing Mensa members agreed to all vote in protest for actor Jonny Lee Miller as the most <b>nonsensical</b> nominee, who thus won the election.|$|E
25|$|When the ligand {{is bound}} by FepA, the {{conformation}} of the N-terminal domain is changed {{so as to}} open the pore. There is controversy regarding how space is opened within the barrel to allow the ligand to pass through. Either the N-terminal plug domain remains within the barrel and undergoes conformational changes to create a pore or it temporarily drops out of the barrel. It has been hypothesized that it is energetically <b>nonsensical</b> to remove {{the whole of the}} N-terminal domain for translocation, because this requires the breakage of the salt bridges and numerous hydrogen bonds, however, since the barrel is water-filled, the energy required would be much less than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|Other wartime entries {{have their}} moments, such as They Stooge to Conga ({{considered}} {{the most violent}} Stooge short), Higher Than a Kite, Back From the Front (all 1943), Gents Without Cents (1944) and the anti-Japanese The Yoke's on Me (also 1944). However, taken in bulk, the wartime films are decidedly substandard. No Dough Boys (again 1944) is often considered {{the best of these}} farces. The team, made up as Japanese soldiers for a photo shoot, is mistaken for genuine saboteurs by a Nazi ringleader (Vernon Dent, the Stooges' primary foil). The highlight of the film features the Stooges engaging in <b>nonsensical</b> gymnastics (the real spies are renowned acrobats) for a skeptical group of enemy agents.|$|E
25|$|Smith is also {{responsible}} {{for the majority of}} the band's lyrics, which are written in a cryptic fractured form of English alternately hailed as poetic or <b>nonsensical.</b> He has generally refused to discuss their content, preferring to keep the words and their inspirations shrouded in mystique and allowing for fan interpretations. Smith has also sometimes employed a cut-up lyrical approach drawing on the works of (among others), William Blake, Charles Kingsley, William Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot. Two favourite cut-and-paste sources are Pedro Carolino’s English As She Is Spoke (a failed Victorian English-Portuguese phrasebook once hailed by Mark Twain as a perfect example of absurdity) and the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley. Fans have also spotted references to the films The Night of the Hunter and Eraserhead in Smith's words and music videos.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>nonsensical</b> and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only {{to allow it to}} end after a {{definite}} period of time. A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or to put it in another way, it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. There must be something inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E
25|$|Project Blue Book {{played a}} major role in the second season of the 1990–1991 TV series Twin Peaks. Major Garland Briggs, an Air Force officer who worked on the program, {{approaches}} protagonist Dale Cooper and reveals that Cooper's name turned up in an otherwise <b>nonsensical</b> radio transmission intercepted by the Air Force, which inexplicably originated from the woods surrounding the town of Twin Peaks. As the season progresses, it is revealed that the source of the transmission is the transdimensional realm of the Black Lodge, inhabited by beings which feed on the human emotions of pain and suffering; it eventually comes out that Briggs worked with Cooper's rival, corrupt FBI agent Windom Earle, on Project Blue Book, and that the two men apparently uncovered evidence of the Lodge during the course of their work.|$|E
25|$|Futurism is {{a modernist}} avant-garde {{movement}} {{in literature and}} part of the Futurism art movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism (1909). Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and actual length). Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on <b>nonsensical</b> humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, have no place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{very little}} {{was known about}} Sun Ra's early life, and he contributed to its obscurity. As a self-invented person, he {{routinely}} gave evasive, contradictory or seemingly <b>nonsensical</b> answers to personal questions, and denied his birth name. He speculated, only half in jest, that he was distantly related to Elijah Poole, later famous as Elijah Muhammed, leader of the Nation of Islam. His birthday for years remained unknown, as he claimed it for years ranging from 1910 to 1918. Only {{a few years before}} his death, the date of Sun Ra's birth was still a mystery. Jim Macnie's notes for Blue Delight (1989) said that Sun Ra was believed to be about 75years old. But Szwed was able to uncover a wealth of information about his early life and confirmed a birth date of May 22, 1914.|$|E
25|$|At age forty-six, Digby {{traveled}} to the Middle East, {{and fell in love}} with Sheik Abdul Medjuel el Mezrab (also known as Sheikh Mijwal Al Mezrab in accounts by contemporary Western travellers in Syria). Medjuel was a sheik of the Mezrab section of the Sba'a, a well-known sub-tribe of the great 'Anizzah tribe of Syria'. However, Abdul Medjuel or Abdul Mijwal (Slave of Medjul dates) is a <b>nonsensical</b> name. Arabic sources give the Shaikh's name as Mijwal al-Musrab. He was twenty years her junior, and the two were married under Muslim law and she took the name Jane Elizabeth Digby el Mezrab. Their marriage was a happy one and lasted until her death twenty-eight years later. It has been written that Jane Digby was referred to as Shaikhah Umm al-Laban (literally Shaikhah Mother of Milk, i.e., Milky lady) due to the colour of her skin.|$|E
25|$|His parents, Margaret (née Metcalfe) and Arthur Jefferson, {{were both}} {{active in the}} theatre and always very busy. In his early years, the boy spent much time living with his {{maternal}} grandmother, Sarah Metcalfe. He attended school at King James I Grammar School, Bishop Auckland, County Durham and the King's School, Tynemouth, Northumberland. He moved with his parents to Glasgow, Scotland, where he completed his education at Rutherglen Academy. His father managed Glasgow's Metropole Theatre, where Laurel began work. His boyhood hero was Dan Leno, {{one of the greatest}} English music hall comedians. With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the Panopticon in Glasgow at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. It was the music hall from where he drew his standard comic devices, including his bowler hat and <b>nonsensical</b> understatement.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset), with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters {{know very well that}} they live in a world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with <b>nonsensical</b> results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E
25|$|A crowd mills {{about before}} the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen {{occasionally}} appear. A {{group of men}} enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father's throne, and of the defeat he will deal to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a <b>nonsensical</b> song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the Cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. In a powerful chorus ("Benefactor father... Give us bread!"), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy's cries are heard. Boris asks why he cries. The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys' slaughter, {{just as he did}} {{in the case of the}} Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man's prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") about the fate of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Tempestuous music {{accompanies the}} entry of a crowd of vagabonds who have {{captured}} the boyar Khrushchov. The crowd taunts him, then bows in mock homage ("Not a falcon flying in the heavens"). The yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a <b>nonsensical</b> song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Varlaam and Misail are heard in the distance singing of the crimes of Boris and his henchmen ("The sun and moon have gone dark"). They enter. The crowd gets worked up to a frenzy ("Our bold daring has broken free, gone on a rampage") denouncing Boris. Two Jesuits are heard in the distance chanting in Latin ("Domine, Domine, salvum fac"), praying that God will save Dmitriy. They enter. At the instigation of Varlaam and Misail, the vagabonds prepare to hang the Jesuits, who appeal to the Holy Virgin for aid. Processional music heralds the arrival of Dmitriy and his forces. Varlaam and Misail glorify him ("Glory to thee, Tsarevich!") along with the crowd. The Pretender calls those persecuted by Godunov to his side. He frees Khrushchov, and calls on all to march on Moscow. All exeunt except the yuródivïy, who sings a plaintive song ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") of {{the arrival of the}} enemy and of woe to Russia.|$|E
