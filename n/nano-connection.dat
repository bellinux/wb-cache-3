40|$|We {{report a}} new {{approach}} for the alignment and the electrical <b>nano-connection</b> of isolated carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Through a novel combination of proven technics, {{we have been able}} to align isolated carbon nanotubes and selectively contact those CNTs by high resolution electron beam lithography (HREBL). Resistance versus temperature (R(T)) experiments have been carried out to determine the reliability of the metalâ€“CNTs interface and to probe the electronic conductance of the CNT...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{practical}} {{concept is}} reported based on reproducible fluidic mechanisms coupled with silica nano-particles {{for the development}} of nano-optical-connections directly on organic integrated photonic chips. Silica nano-rib waveguides have been shaped with various widths ranging between 50 and 300 nm and about 100 m in length. An effective nano-photonic coupling mechanism has been demonstrated and a sub-wavelength propagation regime obtained between two organic rib tapers and waveguides with a perpendicular and a parallel configuration, respectively. The specific silica nano-rib-waveguide structures show off optical losses propagation ranging around 37 68 dB/mm at visible and infrared wavelengths. Such flexible devices offer versatile fabrication control by changing, respectively, nano-particles and surfactant concentrations. Thus, they present great potential regarding future applications for shaping <b>nano-connections</b> and high-density network integrations between original optical segmented circuits such as plots, lines or any pre-formed photonic structures...|$|R

Silica nano-ridge waveguides have been shaped with various widths ranging between 50 nm and 200 nm and with about one hundred micrometers length. An effective nano-photonic coupling mechanism has been demonstrated and a sub-wavelength propagation regime obtained between four perpendicular organic rib tapers and two parallel waveguides with respectively curved and straight silica nano-ridges configurations. The specific silica nano-ridge-waveguides structures show off optical propagation losses ranging between 37 and 68 dB/mm at visible and infra-red wavelengths respectively. Such flexible devices offer a versatile fabrication process and present great potential regarding future applications for shaping <b>nano-connections</b> and integrating high-density networks.
