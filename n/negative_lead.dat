2500|$|Three {{important}} developments {{marked the}} 1980s. In 1980 an American chemist, John B. Goodenough, disclosed the LiCoO2 cathode (positive lead) and a Moroccan research scientist, Rachid Yazami, discovered the graphite anode (<b>negative</b> <b>lead)</b> with the solid electrolyte. In 1981, Japanese chemist Tokio Yamabe and late Shjzukuni Yata discovered novel nano-carbonacious-PAS, [...] {{and found that}} it was very effective for the anode in the conventional liquid electrolyte. [...] This led a research team managed by Akira Yoshino of Asahi Chemical, Japan, to build the first lithium-ion battery prototype in 1985, a rechargeable and more stable version of the lithium battery; Sony commercialized the lithium-ion battery in 1991.|$|E
