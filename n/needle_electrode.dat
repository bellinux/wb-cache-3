2500|$|Muscle fibers {{of people}} with MG are easily fatigued, which the {{repetitive}} nerve stimulation test can help diagnose. In single-fiber electromyography, which {{is considered to be}} the most sensitive (although not the most specific) test for MG, a thin <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> is inserted into different areas of a particular muscle to record the action potentials from several samplings of different individual muscle fibers. Two muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit are identified, and the temporal variability in their firing patterns is measured. Frequency and proportion of particular abnormal action potential patterns, called [...] "jitter" [...] and [...] "blocking", are diagnostic. Jitter refers to the abnormal variation in the time interval between action potentials of adjacent muscle fibers in the same motor unit. Blocking refers to the failure of nerve impulses to elicit action potentials in adjacent muscle fibers of the same motor unit.|$|E
50|$|A patient sits comfortably {{with the}} {{treatment}} leg elevated. A fine <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> is {{inserted into the}} lower, inner aspect of the leg, slightly cephalad/rostral to the medial malleolus. As {{the goal is to}} send stimulation through the tibial nerve, {{it is important to have}} the <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> near (but not on) the tibial nerve. A surface electrode (grounding pad) is placed over the medial aspect of the calcaneus on the same leg. The <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> is then connected to an external pulse generator which delivers an adjustable electrical pulse that travels to the sacral plexus via the tibial nerve. Among other functions, the sacral nerve plexus regulates bladder and pelvic floor function.|$|E

30|$|The {{fabricated}} <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{have been}} used to make a 3 -fork needle trap, shown in Fig. 1 (a) for our trapped ion experiments [10]. The trapping life-time is 24 hours averagely for a single trapped ion. In summary, we present a convenient and self-terminated electrochemical etching method to fabricate <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> for ion trap. By studying the surface roughness dependence on the etching parameters using different imaging techniques, we have verified that the optimized etching parameters can reduce the surface roughness of electrodes significantly.|$|R
40|$|The transdiaphragmatic {{pressure}} (Pdi) generated during bilateral supramaximal phrenic {{nerve stimulation}} at 1 Hz from surface stimulating electrodes was compared with pressures obtained from <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> inserted under local anaesthesia. Surface electrodes {{were used to}} obtain diaphragmatic electromyograms and magnetometers to monitor rib cage and abdominal configuration. Twitch Pdi was recorded at functional residual capacity in three normal subjects. Mean (SD) twitch Pdi in the three subjects during stimulation with surface electrodes was 19. 4 (1. 8), 22. 5 (1. 1), and 29. 3 (2. 2) cm H 2 O compared with 12. 9 (1. 5), 17 : 4 (1. 3), and 22. 6 (3. 0) cm H 2 O with <b>needle</b> stimulating <b>electrodes.</b> Thus phrenic nerve stimulation with <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> was more complicated and more invasive than stimulation with surface electrodes and resulted in lower transdiaphragmatic pressures...|$|R

Stimulus-induced bioelectric activity (M-responses) in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles was recorded using a digital EMG-system DISA- 1500 (DANTEC, Denmark). Biopotential leads were monopolar with modified <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The active recording electrode was inserted transcutaneously in the muscle belly and the reference electrode in its tendon.

50|$|With correct {{placement}} of the <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> and level of electrical impulse, there is often an involuntary toe flex or fan, or {{an extension of the}} entire foot.

40|$|Background: Electroporation-based {{gene therapy}} and DNA {{vaccination}} are promising medical applications {{that depend on}} transfer of pDNA into target tissues with use of electric pulses. Gene electrotransfer efficiency depends on electrode configuration and electric pulse parameters, which determine the electric field distribution. Numerical modeling represents a fast and convenient method for optimization of gene electrotransfer parameters. We used numerical modeling, parameterization and numerical optimization to determine the optimum parameters for gene electrotransfer in muscle tissue. Methods: We built a 3 D geometry of muscle tissue with two or six <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> (two rows of three <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes)</b> inserted.

50|$|The {{term and}} concept of {{radiosurgery}} were introduced by Leksell already in 1951 when he {{reasoned that the}} ‘‘center-of-arc’’ principle and his first stereotactic instrument were suitable for replacing a probe (<b>needle</b> <b>electrode)</b> by cross-firing intracerebral structures with narrow beams of radiant energy. X-rays were first tried but both gamma rays and ultrasonics were included as alternatives.|$|E
50|$|If using a <b>needle</b> <b>electrode,</b> {{the bond}} spreads {{radially}} {{to the outside}} which {{makes it impossible to}} trap air between the surfaces.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether acute electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve could suppress detrusor contractions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. METHODS: Two successive slow-fill cystometries (16 ml/min) were carried out in eight MS patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. The first filling served as control without stimulation. In the second filling, electrical stimulation using <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> was applied automatically to the posterior tibial nerve when the detrusor pressure exceeded 10 cm H(2) O. An additional filling in which the <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> were replaced by surface electrodes was carried out in three patients. RESULTS: The control filling showed detrusor overactivity in eight patients, but electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve failed to suppress detrusor contractions in all tested patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although neuromodulative effects may be obtained with therapeutic electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve, no acute effects were demonstrated. For this reason, electrical stimulation of pudendal afferents remains the only option if acute suppression of a detrusor contraction is required...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectrochemotherapy is an {{effective}} local treatment of solid tumors which combines delivery of chemotherapeutic drug and electric pulses. Electric pulses increase permeability of plasma membrane transiently and reversibly, leading to increased transport of the drug into the cell. As all clonogenic cells in the tumor need to be eradicated for effective treatment, all cells have to be permeabilized, i. e. all cells in the tumor have {{to be exposed to}} appropriate electric pulses. Electric pulses are delivered to tissue by electric pulses generator via electrodes. In general {{there are two types of}} electrodes, plate <b>electrodes</b> and <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The target tissue, i. e. tumor, is to be positioned well in-between the electrodes. The electrodes should thus fit the size of the tumor for good electric field distribution. Plate electrodes which are noninvasive are better suited for tumors on the surface on the skin, whereas <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> which are used invasively with appropriate and sufficient depth of their insertion are more appropriate for treating tumors seeded deeper in the skin...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Ball {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} {{a clinical trial}} evaluating IRE in 21 patients treated for metastatic or primary tumors of the liver, kidney, or lung. Two patients developed positional neuropraxia because of the extended arm position requested for CT scanning. Some patients developed self-limiting ventricular tachycardias, which are now minimized by using an electrocardiogram (ECG) synchronizer. Three patients developed pneumothoraces {{as a result of}} <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> insertion. The authors concluded that an ECG synchronizer should be used to minimize the risk of arrhythmias and that attention to the position of the arms is required to maximize CT scan quality but minimize brachial plexus strain.|$|E
50|$|EMG {{findings}} {{vary with}} the type of disorder, the duration of the problem, the age of the patient, {{the degree to which the}} patient can be cooperative, the type of <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> used to study the patient, and sampling error in terms of the number of areas studied within a single muscle and the number of muscles studied overall. Interpreting EMG findings is usually best done by an individual informed by a focused history and physical examination of the patient, and in conjunction with the results of other relevant diagnostic studies performed including most importantly, nerve conduction studies, but also, where appropriate, imaging studies such as MRI and ultrasound, muscle and nerve biopsy, muscle enzymes, and serologic studies.|$|E
50|$|Intramuscular EMG can be {{performed}} {{using a variety of}} different types of recording electrodes. The simplest approach is a monopolar <b>needle</b> <b>electrode.</b> This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other. Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies. Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject. Slightly more complex in design is the concentric <b>needle</b> <b>electrode.</b> These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode. As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable. However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles. Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{superficial}} {{chest wall}} recurrence {{from breast cancer}} can be effectively treated by means of electrochemotherapy, {{with the majority of}} patients achieving response to treatment. Nevertheless, tumor spread along superficial lymphatic vessels makes this peculiar type of tumor recurrence prone to involve large skin areas and difficult to treat. In these cases, electroporation with standard, small size <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes</b> can be time-consuming and produce an inhomogeneous coverage of the target area, ultimately resulting in patient under treatment...|$|R
50|$|The actual {{placement}} of the <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> can be difficult and depends {{on a number of}} factors, such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle. Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the muscle of interest, although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles. Also, the more body fat an individual has, the weaker the EMG signal. When placing the EMG sensor, the ideal location is at the belly of the muscle: the longitudinal midline. The belly of the muscle can also be thought of as in-between the motor point (middle) of the muscle and the tendonus insertion point.|$|E

50|$|To perform {{intramuscular}} EMG, typically {{either a}} monopolar or concentric <b>needle</b> <b>electrode</b> is inserted {{through the skin}} into the muscle tissue. The needle is then moved to multiple spots within a relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity in the muscle. Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement, but this rarely lasts more than 100ms. The two most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are fasciculation and fibrillation potentials. A fasciculation potential is an involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle, sometimes visible {{with the naked eye}} as a muscle twitch or by surface electrodes. Fibrillations, however, are only detected by needle EMG, and represent the isolated activation of individual muscle fibers, usually as the result of nerve or muscle disease. Often, fibrillations are triggered by needle movement (insertional activity) and persist for several seconds or more after the movement ceases.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using myo-electric potentials {{for the control}} of a powered prosthesis was first demonstrated by Battye, Nightingale and Whillis (1955). A working myo-electric control system was demonstrated, under laboratory conditions, by Kobrinski in Moscow (Kobrinski et al. 1961). At present three myo-electrically controlled hand prostheses are commercially available: Viennatone in Austria, INAIL in Italy, and a Russian unit. Myo-potentials can be detected by means of surface <b>electrodes</b> and <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The <b>needle</b> <b>electrodes,</b> routinely used in clinical practice, cannot {{be used in the}} control of prostheses because of pain and the risk of infection. Myo-electric hand prostheses have, until now, been operated by surface electrodes. Many problems associated with surface electrode techniques have recently been studied by Kadefors, Herberts, Hirsch, Kaiser and Petersen (1968). In long-term use surface electrodes often cause skin irritation, which is more pronounced with wet than with dry electrodes. Electrode movements and displacements cause errors in potentials. The ratio of signal to noise and the amount of high frequency power in the signals detected with present surface electrode techniques are inadequate for the proportional control of a myo-electric system...|$|R
