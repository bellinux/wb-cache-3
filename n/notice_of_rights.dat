40|$|The Law 2 ̆ 2 On the State Registration of Rights in Real Property 2 ̆ 2 of July 21, 1997 (the 2 ̆ 2 Registration Law 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 the Law 2 ̆ 2) {{constitutes}} {{a major step}} towards the achievement of an effective national registration system and, concomitantly, a viable real estate market for foreign investors in the Russian Federation (2 ̆ 2 RF 2 ̆ 2). Prior to this law, foreign investors could not rely upon a formal system of state registration to protect their interests in real property. To remedy this problem, the Registration Law creates a system that, at least on paper, is comparable to Western registration systems in its consistency, accessibility and certainty. However, the Russian reform process has consistently shown that plans which appear sensible and practical on paper are not always achievable in practice. Thus, one must view the Registration Law, like all ambitious reform plans in Russia, with a skeptical and cautious eye. The Russian Federation should strive to create a registration system for rights in real property that is simple, consistent, accessible and certain. First, the rules and procedures should {{be as simple as}} possible in order to prevent the emergence of a cumbersome, rent-seeking bureaucracy that could accompany the creation of this new system. Second, these procedures should be administered in a consistent manner so that foreign and domestic real estate investors can plan the certain and expected steps they must take to gain security of title for their properties. Third, the registration system should be accessible and devoid of unnecessary secrecy in order to provide sufficient public <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> in real property. Such notice would serve to discourage competing claims to property that lack evidentiary support. Fourth, this system should provide a certainty of title enforced by the state so that investors in real property — whether from Russia or abroad — can be confident in the security of their investments. The creation of such a system would benefit foreign and domestic investors alike and provide a significant boost to the developing Russian market. In analyzing the Registration Law 2 ̆ 7 s impact on foreign investors, this comment first discusses the U. S. title assurance system. This comment then lays out the features of a model title assurance system that would be appropriate for Russia. Next, this comment discusses the particular features of the Registration Law that will benefit foreign investors in Russian real estate. Finally, this comment highlights the provisions of the Law that may deter foreign investment in the Russian Federation...|$|E

40|$|Are {{individuals}} {{entitled to}} <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> their constitutional <b>rights</b> or assistance in exercising those rights? In most contexts, {{the answer is}} no. Yet, there are some important exceptions, in which the Court has held that special circumstances call for notice and procedural protections designed to facilitate rights invocations. This article refers to these entitlements as “meta rights” — rights that protect rights. The most famous {{of these is the}} Miranda warning, which notifies suspects of their Fifth Amendment rights to silence and an attorney. There are others as well — among them, the First Amendment <b>right</b> <b>of</b> individuals represented by public sector labor unions and bar associations to <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> their <b>right</b> not to subsidize certain union or bar association speech. Certain procedural due process rights also qualify as meta <b>rights,</b> including the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to litigate individually to which many class members are entitled. The reason for the Miranda warning, as well as for similar notice rights in the procedural due process context, is clear: each aids individuals in overcoming high external barriers to protecting their own rights through self-help. But what justifies meta rights that help union members and attorneys exercise their rights against compelled subsidization of political speech, where there are generally no significant barriers to self help? Alternatively, why aren’t there meta rights in other compelled speech and subsidization contexts? And, if meta rights are appropriate, how robust should they be? This article takes up these questions, arguing that the self-help rationale offers a way to determine when meta rights are required in various constitutional contexts, including in the context of compelled speech and subsidization of speech. It then addresses the challenges inherent in structuring meta rights, which are accentuated where meta rights are owed by private associations — such as unions and bar associations — that have their own First Amendment rights. Ultimately, the article argues that courts cannot ignore the competing interests of associational speakers and willing members when they determine the scope of compelled speech and subsidization meta rights. Thus, to the extent that courts conclude that meta rights themselves implicate the First Amendment, they should account for the possibility that some meta rights do more than just allow dissenters to avoid unwanted speech: they actually encourage opt-outs, and correspondingly discourage speech...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{the common}} law {{principle}} of legality has hardened into a strong clear statement rule that is applied when legislation engages common law rights and freedoms. It has transformed a loose collection of rebuttable interpretive presumptions into a quasi-constitutional common law bill <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> However, these developments are not without controversy or issue. The analysis undertaken in this article suggests that the principle of legality as clear statement rule [...] as mandated by the High Court in Coco v The Queen [...] can only work legitimately if Parliament has clear and prior <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> and freedoms that it operates to protect. But it is problematic if what a common law right, such as freedom of speech, requires or guarantees in any given legislative context is unclear and contested, and so must be judicially divined {{at the point of}} application. In these cases, the principle operates to enforce a (post-legislative) judicial approximation of what best protects and promotes an abstract legal value or principle.

40|$|The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) imposes notice {{obligations}} on both {{employers and}} employees.

Employees are not, however, required to use the words “FMLA” when asking for leave. Employees must also tell their employer {{if they wish to}} substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave. Finally, employees must provide their employer with two-days’ <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> their plans to return to work following leave.
