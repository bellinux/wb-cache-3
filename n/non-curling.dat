40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{fabrication}} and characterization of <b>non-curling,</b> free-standing TiO 2 nanotube membranes and their integration in front-side illuminated {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} are reported. Vertically oriented TiO 2 nanotube arrays were fabricated by anodic oxidation of a titanium foil. Nanotube membranes were detached from the metallic foil, transferred and bonded on transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide/glass substrates employing a TiO 2 sol as a binder. Crystalline phase and morphology of the film were investigated, evidencing {{the formation of a}} highly ordered 1 D nanotubes carpet, with a pure anatase crystalline structure. TiO 2 nanotube-based DSCs were fabricated using reversible microfuidic architecture. The cell performances were studied by I-V electrical characterization, incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open circuit voltage decay measurements, showing an increase in electron lifetime compared to nanoparticle-based dye-sensitized solar cells...|$|E
40|$|Cinclidotus vivesii is {{described}} and illustrated {{as a new}} species from NE Spain (Iberian Peninsula). It is well distinguished {{by a combination of}} characters: rigid appearance; <b>non-curled,</b> lanceolate and slightly falcate leaves; leaf margins elliptical in cross section, up to 4 cells thick with the inner cells similar to the superficial ones, and confluent at the leaf apex; nerve excurrent in a mucro; and smooth laminal cells...|$|R
50|$|A Van Dyke (also spelled Vandyke, Vandyck, Van Dyck or Van Dijk) is a {{style of}} facial hair named after 17th-century Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck. A Van Dyke {{specifically}} consists of any growth of both a moustache and goatee with all hair on the cheeks shaven. Even this particular style, though, has many variants, including a curled moustache versus a <b>non-curled</b> one and a soul patch versus none.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A Bernstein-BÃ©zier {{basis is}} {{developed}} for H(div) -conforming finite elements {{that gives a}} clear separation between the curls of the Bernstein basis for the polynomial discretisation of the space H 1, and the <b>non-curls</b> that characterize the specific H(div) finite element space (Raviart-Thomas in our case). The resulting basis has two distinct components reflecting this separation with the basis functions in each component having a natural identification with a domain point, or node, on the element. It is shown that the basis retains the favourable properties of the Bernstein basis {{that were used in}} [1] to develop efficient computational procedures for the application of the elements. 1...|$|R
40|$|We discuss linear and {{nonlinear}} {{optical wave}} propagation in a left-handed medium (LHM) or medium of negative refraction (NRM). We use {{the approach of}} characterizing the medium response totally by a generalized electric polarization (with a dielectric permittivity {tilde {var_epsilon}}(w, {rvec k})) that can be decomposed into a curl and a <b>non-curl</b> part. The description has a one-to-one correspondence with the usual approach characterizing the LHM response with a dielectric permittivity {var_epsilon}< 0 and a magnetic permeability {mu}< 0. The latter approach is less physically transparent in the optical frequency region because the usual definition of magnetization loses its physical meaning. Linear wave propagation in LHM or NRM is characterized by negative refraction and negative group velocity that could be clearly manifested by ultra-short pulse propagation in such a medium. Nonlinear optical effects in LHM can be predicted from the same calculations adopted for ordinary media using our general approach...|$|R
