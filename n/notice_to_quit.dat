5|$|The Hillingdon House Farm {{estate to}} the north of the house {{includes}} the Hillingdon Sports and Leisure Complex (formerly Uxbridge Lido). The farm ceased operations in 1965 after the local council served a <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> on the tenant. The farmhouse on Honeycroft Hill became a council depot, followed by a plant nursery, before it was sold for residential housing.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Anlaby Road {{was damaged}} by enemy bombing, the repair cost {{of which was}} in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> at the same time, and so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor {{condition}} of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road. The new stadium was finally opened under the revised name of Boothferry Park on 31 August 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1825 the {{inhabitants}} of Rùm (then numbering some 450 people) were given a year's <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> The inhabitants of Rùm had simply been tenant farmers, paying rent to the laird; they owned neither the land they worked, nor the houses in which they lived. On 11 July 1826, about 300 of {{the inhabitants}} boarded two overcrowded ships bound for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The laird, and Dr Lachlan, paid for their journey. The remaining population followed in 1827. Similar evictions happened all over the gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, and collectively {{became known as the}} Highland Clearances.|$|E

50|$|Further {{modifications}} {{are made}} where the occupancy arrangements create a Part VII contract. Sections 71 to 76 of the Act of 1984 contain the detailed rules concerning <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in Part VII contract cases, and incorporate the amendments {{made to the}} Rent (Scotland) Act 1971 by the Rent Act 1974 and by the Tenant's Rights Etc.

5|$|Hollis raised {{mortgages}} {{to pay for}} improvements, but receipts {{were down}} to £1,821 in 1839, the last full year of operation before the London and Southampton Railway opened. The receipts were obtained from tolls, as all freight was moved by independent carriers. At this point, Hollis gave control of the navigation to members of his family. His son managed it until 1841, when a banker called W. W. Bulpett, who was a mortgagee, took over. In 1847 he was given <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> by the Hollis family, despite having done a good job, but he refused. F. W. Hollis eventually obtained most of the shares from the other family members, and started legal action to remove Bulpett. Railway competition had caused {{a sharp drop in}} receipts, from £1,012 in 1843 to £430 in 1861, and payments to shareholders and mortgagees ceased in 1850 and 1857. In 1863, Bulpett was replaced by Mr Clarke, formerly the manager of the Andover Canal, but Bulpett returned when he won the action brought by Hollis.|$|E
25|$|Chelsea were {{nonetheless}} served <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> Stamford Bridge, {{upon the}} expiry of the lease in 1989. Cabra Estates, however, which had purchased Marler in 1989, were eventually bankrupted in the property market crash of 1992. This enabled Bates to do {{a deal with}} their creditors, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and reunite the freehold with the club. Bates then created the Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation owned by the fans which in 1997 purchased the freehold of the stadium, the club's naming rights and the pitch to ensure that property developers could never again try to purchase Stamford Bridge. Following this, work was begun to renovate the entire stadium (bar the East Stand), making it all-seater and bringing the stands closer to the pitch and under cover, which was finally completed by the millennium.|$|E
500|$|He {{had joined}} the board of First Division club Birmingham City in January 1976. When Willie Bell was sacked as manager in September 1977, Ramsey refused {{to take his place}} on a {{permanent}} basis, but did agree to act as caretaker until a successor could be found. By early November, he had changed his mind. He resigned his directorship to take on the role of consultant, with a remit that covered not only day-to-day team management but also a wide-ranging responsibility for club affairs, to include the selection of Birmingham's next manager. His tenure lasted just four months. In February 1978, star player Trevor Francis was fined for giving newspaper interviews about his desire to leave a club he saw as lacking ambition, and the board accepted Ramsey's recommendation to place him on the transfer list. Three days later, when the decision was reversed for fear of a backlash from supporters, Ramsey gave two weeks' <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> The club announced his resignation before the notice period ended, and reports attributed his departure to the recent 4–0 defeat by Coventry City. Ramsey was quick to refute any such link, insisting that he had [...] "never walked out on anyone". Francis was sold less than a year later, in {{what became known as the}} first million-pound transfer.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, {{hundreds}} of Africans were served with <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in 1943. In the Blantyre District hundreds {{refused to leave}} {{since there was no}} other land for them. Two years later the same difficulty arose in the densely populated Cholo District, two-thirds of whose land constituted private estates. Eviction notices served on 1,250 tenants were resisted, and the government was forced to intervene to reduce the figure to one-tenth of the total.|$|R
50|$|From 1938, the {{protectorate}} administration {{began to}} purchase {{small amounts of}} under-used estate land for resettlement of those evicted. However, these purchases were insufficient, and in 1942, hundreds of Africans in the Blantyre District who had been served with <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> refused <b>to</b> leave {{since there was no}} other land for them. Two years later the same difficulty arose in the densely populated Cholo District, two-thirds of whose land constituted private estates.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of section 16 of the 1957 Act (<b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit)</b> and Part III of the 1965 Act (illegal eviction and harassment), the Rent Act 1968 consolidated all the earlier Rent Acts; the Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946, the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949, Part II of the Housing Repairs and Rent Act 1954 and other related enactments (some twenty-four in all), without rationalising or simplifying them.|$|R
2500|$|The American Civil War {{ended in}} 1865, and by 1875, with new steam-powered {{railways}} and ships, the United States was exporting a substantial excess of cereals. [...] At the same time, Britain suffered {{a series of}} poor harvests. [...] By 1891 reliable refrigeration technology brought cheap frozen meat from Australia, New Zealand and South America to the British market, and Parliament felt it had to intervene to support British farming. [...] The Agricultural Holdings (England) Act 1875 revamped the law on tenant right such that tenants received consistent levels of compensation {{for the value of}} their improvements to the holding and any crops in the ground. [...] It also gave tenants the right to remove fixtures they had provided, increased the period of a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Quit</b> from six months to twelve, and brought in an agricultural dispute resolution procedure.|$|E
2500|$|The Scottish Maritime Museum {{had agreed}} a {{contract}} with the owner of the slipway on which City of Adelaide was stored, specifying a peppercorn rent of £1 a year. However the contract included a penalty clause requiring payment of £50,000 per year should the owner require the museum to vacate the slipway. [...] SMM were given <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in April 1999, and rental began to accrue. Faced with these potential demands, and unable to find a buyer for the vessel, in May 2000 the trustees of the Scottish Maritime Museum applied to North Ayrshire Council for listed building consent to deconstruct City of Adelaide. The Council received over 100 objections, including representations from nine significant maritime heritage organisations around the world. Members of the UK and Scottish Parliaments objected, as well as the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Australian ex-Senator and diplomat Robert Hill. The Council refused demolition in February 2001.|$|E
2500|$|However several {{qualifications}} exist. First, if {{a representation}} was made during negotiations, which later transpires {{to be no}} longer true, there is a duty to make a correction. So in With v O'Flanagan where Dr O'Flanagan told Mr With that his medical practice earned £40 per week, but when the contract was signed the income had dropped to £5 per week, Dr O'Flanagan was under a duty to correct himself. Representations are continuing. Second, one cannot simply tell half truths, as for instance in Dimmock v Hallett, where a land vendor said two farms were fully let but did not say the tenants had given <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> This was misrepresentation. Third, {{it can be a}} misrepresentation when a person says they are [...] "unaware" [...] of something, but have in fact done no checks. This was the situation in Notts Patent Brick and Tile Co v Butler, where a land purchaser asked the vendor's solicitors whether there were any restrictive covenants and the solicitor (without bothering to find out) said he was unaware of any. It was true that the solicitor was unaware, {{but it was also a}} misrepresentation.|$|E
50|$|The Housing Act 1974 gave {{many private}} tenants {{the right to}} {{additional}} information as to the identity of their landlord, {{and there was also}} a new duty to inform a tenant of a dwelling of the assignment of a landlord’s interest. It extended the right to information about service charges and introduced the right to challenge them. The form and content of certain <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> was <b>to</b> be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Secretary of State and the improvement grant system was re-vamped. Housing action areas, general improvement areas and priority neighbourhoods were introduced.|$|R
50|$|Trouble began late in 1860 {{with the}} {{formation}} of a Miners Protective League, followed by roll-ups (mass meetings) of European diggers evicting Chinese miners from sections of the field. These events involved the quasi-legal posting of <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> and were carried out ceremonially, with a brass band leading the marchers. There was little violence at first. Most of the Chinese moved to new diggings nearby, and some returned soon afterward. This pattern of behaviour was to be repeated on several occasions over the next eight months; there seemed to be an understanding from early in the Burrangong events that the Chinese would be tolerated if they remained in certain areas of the goldfield.|$|R
6000|$|To be {{thrust out}} of the {{discussion}} in this way {{would have been enough}} to complete Mrs. Poyser's exasperation, even without the final threat. Her husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old place where he had been bred and born--for he believed the old squire had small spite enough for anything--was beginning a mild remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having to buy and sell more stock, with, [...] "Well, sir, I think as it's rether hard..." [...] when Mrs. Poyser burst in with the desperate determination to have her say out this once, though it were <b>to</b> rain <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> and the only shelter were the work-house.|$|R

6000|$|Though Keegan {{failed to}} gain {{admission}} into the house, {{and could not}} therefore put himself into absolute possession of the estate, still he could do what he pleased with the lands, {{and he was not}} long in availing himself of the power. In January he served notices on all the tenants that unless the whole arrears were paid on or {{before the end of the}} next month, they would be ejected; and to many of those who held portions of the better part of the land, he sent summary <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> on the first of May next following. These notices were all served by Pat, who assured the tenants that he only performed the duties which he had now undertaken that he might look after Mr. Thady's interests, and as, as he said, [...] "there could be no use in life in his refusing to do it, for av he didn't, another would, and the tenants would be no betther, and he a dale the worse." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{landlord}}-tenant law, a <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> cure or <b>quit</b> {{is issued}} by a landlord when a tenant performs actions {{in violation of}} a lease.

If the tenant continues performing the action(s) and does not move out, {{he or she can}} be evicted.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were several}} {{separate}} {{camps in the}} area identified by Bamett and Edgar Thomas Wood, the Melbourne City Council health inspector from 1910 to 1949. Dudley Flats proper was located south of Footscray Road {{on the banks of}} the Coal Canal - constructed in the 1880s as an outlet for Moonee Ponds Creek, and to allow barges to unload coal at the locomotive depot. The Batchelor Quarters were located on the north side of Dudley Street near a bridge over the canal, while Happy Valley was on the east side of the canal. Residents were given notice of eviction in 1938, but nothing seems to have been done to remove them. The Melbourne City Council hosted a conference of the authorities responsible, which resolved unanimously: that the shacks and their occupants on areas of land at West Melbourne controlled by the Lands Department, Harbour Trust and Railways Dept, constitute a nuisance and should, in the occupants interests, the interests of the community, and for health reasons, be removed therefrom ... the Conference recommends that the Departments concerned be asked to give the occupants <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> vacate the area within one month, and, on vacation, to have the structures entirely demolished. A little later council resolved to instruct the town clerk (Mr. H. S. Wootton) to discuss the matter with the Lands Department with a view ... <b>to</b> serve <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> on the Inhabitants, and to house them in charitable homes.|$|R

50|$|During the Second World War and after, the Nyasaland {{government}} faced increasing African opposition. Many grievances {{came from}} the tenants on European-owned estates who increasingly resented the imposition of thangata, originally a form of labour rent but now often a form of sharecropping. Not only was thangata itself hated, but several estate managers increased tensions by denying the sons-in-law of existing tenants the right to settle, delaying payment of wages, demanding that tenants grow cash crops rather than food or by large-scale evictions. Smallholders living on Native Trust Land often suffered overcrowding, made worse by new conservation practices and the eviction of former estate tenants. The colonial Agricultural Department had advocated new methods of cultivation and soil conservation. As these were not generally accepted, the department decided to use compulsion, Smallholders disliked the imposed rules designed to limit soil erosion which involved them in considerable extra labour, and widely opposed them. In 1942, hundreds of Africans were served with <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in 1943. In the Blantyre District hundreds refused to leave {{since there was no}} other land for them. Two years later the same difficulty arose in the densely populated Cholo District, two-thirds of whose land constituted private estates.

60|$|Throughout the {{remainder}} of the day, Bleeding Heart Yard was in consternation, as the grim Pancks cruised in it; haranguing the inhabitants on their backslidings in respect of payment, demanding his bond, breathing <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> and executions, running down defaulters, sending a swell of terror on before him, and leaving it in his wake. Knots of people, impelled by a fatal attraction, lurked outside any house in which he was known to be, listening for fragments of his discourses to the inmates; and, when he was rumoured to be coming down the stairs, often could not disperse so quickly but that he would be prematurely in among them, demanding their own arrears, and rooting them to the spot. Throughout {{the remainder}} of the day, Mr Pancks's What were they up to? and What did they mean by it? sounded all over the Yard. Mr Pancks wouldn't hear of excuses, wouldn't hear of complaints, wouldn't hear of repairs, wouldn't hear of anything but unconditional money down. Perspiring and puffing and darting about in eccentric directions, and becoming hotter and dingier every moment, he lashed the tide of the yard into a most agitated and turbid state. It had not settled down into calm water again full two hours after he had been seen fuming away on the horizon {{at the top of the}} steps.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of two types of self-identity on {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking: self-identity in terms of smoking and self-identity in terms of quitting. Design: A prospective survey among an initial sample of 3, 411 smokers. Smoking history variables and psychosocial variables from the theory of planned behavior are also measured. Main Outcome Measures: Intention <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking and smoking cessation attempts 4 months later. Results: Both smoking identity and quitting identity matter, but they appear to play different roles in explaining intention <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> and in predicting actual attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Quitting identity is particularly important for intention <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> whereas both quitting identity and smoking identity are important for actually trying <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Recent attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> slightly attenuate the negative effect of smoking identity on attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Conclusion: A broader interpretation of self-identity in terms of both current and aspired behavior offers a better understanding of when people might change health-relevant behavior...|$|R
