40|$|The {{effect of}} laser {{generated}} stress waves on the microstructure, hardness, strength and stress corrosion resistance of 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys was investigated. Pulsed CO 2 and <b>neodymium-glass</b> lasers {{were used to}} determine the effect of wavelength and pulse duration on pressure generation and material property changes. No changes in material properties were observed with CO 2 laser. The strength and hardness of 2024 -T 351 and the strength of 7075 -T 73 aluminum alloys were substantially improved by the stress wave environments generated with the <b>neodymium-glass</b> laser. The mechanical properties of 2024 -T 851 and 7075 -T 651 were unchanged by the laser treatment. The correlation of the laser shock data with published results of flyer plate experiments demonstrated that a threshold pressure needed to be exceeded before strengthening and hardening could occur. Peak pressures generated by the pulsed laser source were less than 7. 0 GPa which was below the threshold pressure required to change the mechanical properties of 2024 -T 851 and 7075 -T 651. Corrosion studies indicated that laser shocking increased the resistance to local attack in 2024 -T 351 and 7075 -T 651...|$|E

40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} into unique methods of converting pulsed laser energy into propulsive thrust across a flat impulse surface under atmospheric conditions. The propulsion experiments were performed with a 1 -micron <b>neodymium-glass</b> laser at the Space Plasma Branch of the Naval Research Laboratory. Laser-induced impulse was measured dynamically by ballistic pendulums and statically using piezoelectric pressure transducers on a stationary impulse surface. The principal {{goal was to}} explore methods for increasing the impulse coupling performance of airbreathing laser-propulsion engines. A magnetohydrodynamic thrust augmentation effect was discovered when a tesla-level magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the impulse surface.

The mechanism of unipolar arcing {{has been shown in}} the literature {{to be the most important}} source of wall erosion and plasma pollution. Arcing is of particular concern in Tokamak and other magnetically confined fusion devices. The experiment was conducted using a <b>neodymium-glass</b> laser in both normal pulse and !-switched modes to generate a hot plasma. This plasma, generated from several different targets, was used to initiate arcing on the surface. From the experimental results, a model of the arcing process was proposed which extended those available in the literature.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn investigation, experimental and theoretical, into the breakdown mechanisms and associated minimum power levels {{required for the}} breakdown and unipolar arcing was conducted for AISI 304 stainless steel and Type 2024 aluminum. The experiment was conducted using a <b>neodymium-glass</b> Q-switched laser. A system of filters was used to attenuate the irradiance on target to {{the point at which}} no damage was discernible following laser-target interaction. Experimental results show that above a certain critical power density, surface breakdown occurs. The primary mechanism of surface damage at the power density threshold is by unipolar arcing. Titanium coasted stainless steels were exposed to energy density levels on the order of 5 GW/CM(2). The titanium coating significantly reduced or eliminated the number of unipolar arcs observed. A model is proposed for the physical processes involved in the first few nanoseconds before breakdown. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} pulsed lasers, laser peening {{has emerged as a}} new and very promising technique to improve the resistance properties of materials to fatigue, wear and corrosion. In this paper, the effect of laser peening on the surface performance of QT 700 - 2 materials was investigated, the parameters of laser peening were optimized by an artificial neural network (ANN) method. A series of experiments was carried out by using a high-power, Q-Switched, pulsed <b>neodymium-glass</b> laser. The microstructure features were analyzed with SEM and the hardness and residual stresses at the surface and in-depth were measured. The results indicate that the depth of hardened layer was about 0. 311. 40 mm for a different shot number of 1 - 4 times and the compressive residual stress at the surface increases with increasing laser pulse energy, from- 165 MPa for the low energy 12 J to- 410 MPa for the higher energy 20 J. Laser peening can restrain nucleation of fatigue cracks and improve the fatigue life of nodular cast iron materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{harmonic}} generation in Laser produced plasmas is presented. Experiments {{were performed on}} Royal Holloway College's carbon-dioxide laser system and on the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's <b>neodymium-glass</b> laser facility. Various targets were irradiated. The backscattered radiation was spectrally analysed {{in the vicinity of}} the incident(w 0) and twice incident frequency(2 w 0). Optical and x-ray diagnostics were also undertaken. Theoretical models for harmonic generation in laser produced plasmas by Cairns, Erokhin, Silin and others are reviewed and compared to the experimental results. It is shown that theories due to Cairns and Silin give reasonable estimates of plasma temperature, from the experimental shift of the second harmonic (2 w), though the former requires the plasma density scale-length to be known to a greater accuracy. However, Cairns explains satisfactorily the observed structure of the second harmonic spectra. Other theories account well for the observed dependence of the intensity of the second harmonic to that incident. Finally, an attempt is made to explain features of the 2 w spectrum in terms of plasma motion, resonance absorption, density profile modification and ponderomotive forces. <p...|$|E
40|$|The National Ignition Facility (NIF), {{currently}} under {{design and construction}} at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), will be the world`s biggest laser. The optics for the multipass, 192 -beam, high-power, <b>neodymium-glass</b> laser will be assembled and aligned in the NIF Optics Assembly Building (OAB), adjacent to the huge Laser and Target Area Building (LTAB), {{where they will be}} installed. To accommodate the aggressive schedule for initial installation and activation, rapid assembly and alignment of large aperture optics into line replaceable units (LRUs) will occur through the use of automated handling, semi-autonomous operations, and strict protocols. The OAB will have to maintain rigorous cleanliness levels, achieve both commonality and versatility to handle the various optic types, and allow for just-in-time processing and delivery of the optics into the LTAB without undoing their strict cleanliness and precise alignment.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{resonant}} multiphoton ionization (RMPI) phenomenon, {{in the case}} of caesium atoms interacting with the intense field of a <b>neodymium-Glass</b> laser. In the first part, we present a recent theory of RMPI, in a simplified form in order to obtain the main informations on the physics of RMPI. Then we present two experiments of RMPI : four-photon ionization of the caesium atom in its ground state, with a three-photon resonance on the 6 F level and three-photon ionization of the caesium atom is its 62 P 3 / 2 state with a two-photon resonance on the 12 F level. In the first experiment, the internal structure of the resonant transition is resolved, enabling us to point out and analyse the important effect of pulse shapes and focusing conditions on our experimental results, which are discussed in detail. We also give some new interpretations of results published previously [1]. In the second experiment, we measure the 12 F fine structure — which is found to be (0. 016 ± 0. 008) cm- 1 — and show that we have reached the limits imposed by the Doppler effect. These experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions suggesting that the physical picture given of RMPI by recent works on this subject is satisfactory...|$|E
