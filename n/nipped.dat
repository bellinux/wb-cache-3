40|$|Abstract Background Nod 26 -like {{intrinsic}} proteins (<b>NIPs)</b> {{that belong}} to the aquaporin superfamily are unique to plants. According to homology modeling and phylogenetic analysis, the <b>NIP</b> subfamily can be further divided into three subgroups with distinct biological functions (<b>NIP</b> I, <b>NIP</b> II, and <b>NIP</b> III). In some grasses, the <b>NIP</b> III subgroup proteins (<b>NIP</b> 2 s) were demonstrated to be permeable to solutes with larger diameter, such as silicic acid and arsenous acids. However, to date there is no data-mining or direct experimental evidences for the permeability of such larger solutes for dicot <b>NIP</b> 2 s, although they exhibit similar three-dimensional structures as those in grasses. It is therefore intriguing to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive the evolution of plant <b>NIP</b> 2 s. Results The <b>NIP</b> III subgroup is more ancient with a divergence time that predates the monocot-dicot split. The proliferation of <b>NIP</b> 2 genes in modern grass species is primarily attributed to whole genome and segmental chromosomal duplication events. The structure of <b>NIP</b> 2 genes is relatively conserved, possessing five exons and four introns. All <b>NIP</b> 2 s possess an ar/R filter consisting of G, S, G, and R, except for the cucumber CsNIP 2; 2, where a small G in the H 2 is substituted with the bulkier C residue. Our maximum likelihood analysis revealed that <b>NIP</b> 2 s, especially the loop A (LA) region, have undergone strong selective pressure for adaptive evolution. The analysis at the amino acid level provided strong statistical evidences for the functional divergence between monocot and dicot <b>NIP</b> III subgroup proteins. In addition, several SDPs (Specificity Determining Positions) responsible for functional specificity were predicted. Conclusions The present study provides the first evidences of functional divergence between dicot and monocot <b>NIP</b> 2 s, and suggests that positive selection, {{as well as a}} radical shift of evolutionary rate at some critical amino acid sites is the primary driver. These findings will expand our understanding to evolutionary mechanisms driving the functional diversification of monocot and dicot <b>NIP</b> III subgroup proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nip</b> 3 (nineteen kD {{interacting}} protein- 3) is an E 1 B 19 K and Bcl- 2 binding protein {{of unknown}} function. <b>Nip</b> 3 is detected {{as both a}} 60 - and 30 -kD protein in vivo and in vitro and exhibits strong homologous interaction in a yeast two-hybrid system indicating that it can homodimerize. <b>Nip</b> 3 is expressed in mitochondria and a mutant (<b>Nip</b> 3 163) lacking the putative transmembrane domain and COOH terminus does not dimerize or localize to mitochondria. Transient transfection of epitope-tagged <b>Nip</b> 3 in Rat- 1 fibroblasts and MCF- 7 breast carcinoma induces apoptosis within 12 h while cells transfected with the <b>Nip</b> 3 163 mutant have a normal phenotype, suggesting that mitochondrial localization is necessary for induction of cell death. <b>Nip</b> 3 overexpression increases the sensitivity to apoptosis induced by granzyme B and topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. After transfection, both <b>Nip</b> 3 and <b>Nip</b> 3 163 protein levels decrease steadily over 48 h indicating that the protein is rapidly degraded and this occurs {{in the absence of}} cell death. Bcl- 2 overexpression initially delays the onset of apoptosis induced by <b>Nip</b> 3 but the resistance is completely overcome in longer periods of incubation. <b>Nip</b> 3 protein levels are much higher and persist longer in Bcl- 2 expressing cells.

Abrasive wear was {{noticed in the}} case of composite <b>NiP</b> coatings containing submicron SiC particles, whereas in <b>NiP</b> coatings oxidational wear was active. The addition of submicron SiC particles not only increases the hardness of these electrolytic coatings but also hinders the formation of an oxide film in the sliding wear track.

During that heat treatment, Ni 3 P precipitates are formed in the <b>NiP</b> matrix and owing to this fact, the hardness of both pure <b>NiP</b> and composite NiP-SiC coatings increases.

When grown on nitrogen-free media {{in the presence of}} the compatible bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, the <b>nip</b> mutant showed nitrogen deficiency symptoms. The mutant failed to form pink nitrogen-fixing nodules that occur in the wild-type symbiosis, but instead developed small bump-like nodules on its roots that were blocked at an early stage of development. Examination of the <b>nip</b> nodules by light microscopy after staining with X-Gal for S. meliloti expressing a constitutive GUS gene, by confocal microscopy following staining with SYTO- 13, and by electron microscopy revealed that <b>nip</b> initiated symbiotic interactions and formed nodule primordia and infection threads. The infection threads in <b>nip</b> proliferated abnormally and very rarely deposited rhizobia into plant host cells; rhizobia failed to differentiate further in these cases. <b>nip</b> nodules contained autofluorescent cells and accumulated a brown pigment. Histochemical staining of <b>nip</b> nodules revealed this pigment to be polyphenolic accumulation.

50|$|Ning {{is unwilling}} {{to give up on}} <b>Nip</b> and insists that Yin help him. Yin manages to open a {{temporary}} portal to the Underworld. Ning and Yin enter the Underworld and attempt to free <b>Nip's</b> soul from suffering. They are unable to find her in the midst of thousands of other spirits. Eventually, Ning and <b>Nip</b> are able to see each other briefly near dawn when they come back from the Underworld after the fight. Sunlight shines on the urn containing <b>Nip's</b> cremated remains, but <b>Nip</b> cannot be exposed to sunlight or her soul will disintegrate. Ning holds on to a curtain to shield the urn from sunlight as he has a final conversation with <b>Nip.</b> <b>Nip</b> tells Ning {{that the only way to}} save her soul is to place her remains to rest at another more auspicious burial site before she returns to the darkness. Ning follows her instructions and with Yin's advice, Ning buries <b>Nip's</b> remains near the crest of a hill. He burns a joss stick for her and prays for her soul while Yin watches solemnly behind him.|$|R
