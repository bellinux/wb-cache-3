As much as 90% of the norepinephrine released will be taken back up in the cell by <b>NET.</b> <b>NET</b> functions by coupling the influx of sodium and chloride (Na+/Cl−) with the transport of norepinephrine. This occurs at a fixed ratio of 1:1:1. Both the NET and the dopamine transporter (DAT) can transport norepinephrine and dopamine. The reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine is essential in regulating the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The transporter also helps maintain homeostatic balances of the presynaptic neuron.|$|E

Firing of high-level transitions may involve firing of object <b>net</b> transitions, transporting object <b>net</b> tokens through the high-level <b>net,</b> and applying <b>net</b> transformation rules to object <b>nets.</b> <b>Net</b> transformations include <b>net</b> modifications such as merging or splitting of object <b>nets,</b> and <b>net</b> refinement.

50|$|In the United States, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) {{serves as}} the nation's main public {{television}} provider. When it launched in October 1970, PBS assumed many of the functions of its predecessor, National Educational Television (<b>NET).</b> <b>NET</b> was shut down by the Ford Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after the network refused to stop airing documentaries on varying social issues that had received critical acclaim for their hard-hitting focus, but alienated many of the network's affiliates. NET's constant need for additional funding led the Ford Foundation to begin withdrawing its financial support of the network in 1966, shouldering much {{of the responsibility for}} providing revenue for NET onto its affiliated stations, prior to the foundation of the CPB, which intended to create its own public television service. PBS' incorporation coincided with the merger of NET's New York City station, Newark, New Jersey-licensed WNDT (which became WNET), into National Educational Television, the impetus of which was to continue receiving funding by Ford and the CPB. PBS also took over the rights to certain programs that originated on NET prior to its disestablishment (such as Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Washington Week in Review and Sesame Street, the latter two of which continue to air on PBS to this day). PBS would later acquire Educational Television Stations, a organization founded by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), in 1973.|$|E

A specification is developed by a problem decomposition into a set of parallel processes.

It is shown that Transnet matches with the characteristics of the intended class of applications. The available specification languages and the internal representation of data which describe the functional as well as nonfunctional requirements are outlined. The advantages of the Petri net-based representation and the possibilities of automatic net analysis and early validation are discussed.

For the latter case we de ne and calculate a ground set of symmetries. Such a set has polynomial size and is su cient for an e cient implementation of the for all symmetries loop and the partition of <b>net</b> elements into equivalence classes. These two constructions are the usual way tointegrate symmetries into an analysis algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|In an ever-changing {{business}} environment, {{business models}} and rules have migrated from compiled source code to external metadata. This paradigm {{better known as}} adaptive object modelling (AOM) empowers domain experts to take control over application implementations, and allows them to change an application’s business model as the business evolves. The problem with the adaptive object modelling approach is that it only caters for an evolving business model and ignores the effects of expanding functional requirements. This paper presents the Expandable Software Infrastructure (ESI), an amalgamation of adaptive object modelling and componentbased software development. Unlike other adaptive object modelling implementations where metadata have only been {{used to describe the}} data and the executing domain, the ESI takes metadata further and utilizes it to describe the data, domain, behaviour and components- providing us with a truly expandable AOM. We highlight how the relatively complex task of adaptive object modelling can be executed simply and elegantly using the Microsoft. NET Framework and further describe how core.

Net is a repressor that {{is expressed in}} sites of vasculogenesis during mouse development. We have made gene-targeted mice that express a hypomorphic mutant of <b>Net,</b> <b>Net</b> delta, which lacks the Ets DNA-binding domain. Strikingly, homozygous mutant mice develop a vascular defect and up-regulate an immediate early gene implicated in vascular disease, egr- 1. They die after birth due to respiratory failure, resulting from the accumulation of chyle in the thoracic cage (chylothorax). The mice have dilated lymphatic vessels (lymphangiectasis) as early as E 16. 5. Interestingly, they express more egr- 1 in heart and pulmonary arteries at E 18. 5. Net negatively regulates the egr- 1 promoter and binds specifically to SRE- 5. Egr- 1 {{has been associated with}} pathologies involving vascular stenosis (e. g. atherosclerosis), and here egr- 1 dysfunction could possibly be associated with obstructions that ultimately affect the lymphatics.
