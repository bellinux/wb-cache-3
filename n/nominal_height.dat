We show that mirror and dome seeing turbulence can be a significant fraction of measured ground-layer turbulence, some cases up to ~ 50 %. We also demonstrate a novel technique to improve the <b>nominal</b> <b>height</b> resolution, {{by a factor of}} 3, called Generalized SLODAR.

To accomplish this, it is essential to assess the relationship and difference between satellite-based land-{{surface temperature}} (LST) retrieval and air temperature obser vation. In this study, we made a comparison between monthly averaged LST from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spec troradiometer (MODIS) and the corresponding air temperature at the <b>nominal</b> <b>heights</b> of 1 m and 2 m from automatic weather stations (AWSs) over the Lambert Glacier basin, East Antarctica. This comparison reveals a statistically sig nificant correlation between the two types of temperature measurements with correlation coefficient (R) above 0. 6. Also, the time difference between satellite overpass and air temperature observation is not critical for the R values. Although MODIS LST evidently deviates from air temperature (Mean difference fluctuates from 2. 87 °C to 8. 08 °C) probably due to the temperature inversion effect, heterogeneity in surface emi s sivity, representative of AWS measurements and satel lite self limitation.

40|$|Field data of {{the wind}} stress over surf zone waves are {{presented}} from an open ocean beach on the East Australian Coast. Two ultrasonic anemometers were deployed at <b>nominal</b> <b>heights</b> of 5 and 10 m above the water surface in the intertidal and inner surf zones, with concurrent measurements of water levels and offshore wave parameters. Following a rigorous quality control procedure, the wind stress {{was determined by the}} eddy correlation technique. A constant stress layer was observed between 5 and 10 m elevation. Considering near-neutral conditions only, the wind drag coefficients were found to systematically change with the wind angle of approach relative to the shoreline and are much smaller for longshore wind than during onshore wind. The concept of an apparent wave steepness changing with wind direction is suggested to explain this behavior. The drag coefficients over the surf zone during onshore wind and near-neutral conditions were determined to be almost twice the values expected at the same wind speed and open ocean conditions. The observed Charnock coefficient was similarly an order of magnitude larger than open ocean values. A wave celerity of the order of that expected in the inner surf zone is required to explain the observed large roughness and drag coefficients using existing wave age-dependent parameterizations. This suggests that the slower wave celerity in the surf zone is an important contributor to the increased wind stress, in addition to the sawtooth wave shape.

40|$|In a {{laboratory}} flume, a comparative {{study on the}} near-bottom performance of the Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) was conducted. Two different ADV systems were tested for different configurations and two flow velocities (9 cm s− 1, 18 cm s− 1). The results were compared with synchronous measurements with a Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA). Near-bottom velocity measurements with the ADV have to be interpreted carefully as the ADV technique underestimates flow velocities in a zone close to the sediment. The height of this zone above the sediment varies with different ADV systems and configurations. The values for <b>nominal</b> sampling volume <b>height</b> (SVH) given by the software often underestimate the true, effective sampling volume <b>heights.</b> Smaller <b>nominal</b> SVH improve the ADV near-bottom performance, but the vertical extent of the zone in which the ADV underestimates flow by more than 20 % may be larger than true SVH/ 2 {{by a factor of}} 2 (=true SVH). When the measurement volume approaches the bottom, ADV data quality parameters (signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and signal amplitude) exceeding the average ‘open water’ level, are clear indicators that the ADV has begun to underestimate the flow velocity. Unfortunately, this is not a safe indicator for the range of reliable measurements as the ADV may begin to underestimate velocities even with unchanged ‘open water’ data quality parameters. Thus, one can only recommend avoiding measurements below a distance from the bottom that was defined empirically comparing the ADV and the LDA velocity profiles.

The analysis begins with Reynolds differential equation for lubrication, in which transversal roughness of the strip is incorporated. In the estimation, the height of lubricant on the strip is taken into account, {{as well as its}} influence on the height of lubricant at the inlet section of the deformation zone. The research has shown that transversal roughness has a twofold influence on the height of lubricant at the inlet section of the deformation zone. If roughness is small of the strip the height of lubricating layer has a tendency of slight decreasing related to the <b>nominal</b> <b>height</b> (when the process is described by smoothness of surfaces) but with an increase of roughness, the thickness of lubricating layer has a tendency to increase.

40|$|The {{world is}} heading towards the IoE (Internet of Everything) where {{everything}} will be connected to each other. New flexible, light-weight and low-cost electronic devices are needed to add intelligence everywhere in our surroundings. Conventional silicon-based manufacturing {{is not the best}} solution because silicon is mechanically rigid and expensive. One way to manufacture these devices cost-effectively in a very large scale is by roll-to-roll screen printing on flexible substrates. However, due to the low calculation performance of current printed electronics, silicon ICs are still needed to act as brains of the devices. Many studies about chip-on-flex or chip-on-film (COF) attachments are available but information about the integration of a silicon chip directly on a screen printed substrate is needed. This thesis investigates bare chip attachment on printed flexible circuitry and evaluates its subsequent level of bendability. The chip was attached on the high-density rotary screen printed circuitry using a flip-chip technique with anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACP and ACF). A selection of chips was stud bumped with gold. Chips without bumps were more challenging to bond due to the surface roughness of the screen printed lines and a small marginal of the suitable bonding pressure. A chip should be exactly parallel with the substrate while bonding so that the pressure is correct on all pads. After finding the suitable bonding parameters, approximately 90 % of the ACP bonded and 96 % of the ACF bonded interconnections worked without bumps. Stud bumping increased the yield almost to 100 % and decreased the contact resistances approximately 75 % making the contacts more reliable. Calendering was tested for printed lines to increase their uniformity and decrease the pad height deviation by heating and pressing them with high force. Calendering reduced the line heights by approximately 1 μm and decreased the surface roughness, but following this process there still existed at least a 2 μm variation in the line <b>heights</b> (<b>nominal</b> line <b>height</b> 5 μm). Bending reliability of the chip attachments on flexible plastic substrates was determined using a self-built bending test set-up which bends the sample between two rigid plates. All chip attachments studied withstood at least a 2. 5 cm bending radius. The main results of this thesis were to demonstrate bare die integration on screen printed circuitry and to show its suitability for flexible hybrid electronic applications. Still further development of the bonding process and materials are needed to achieve more reliable long-term solutions...|$|R
40|$|The authors use large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{to investigate}} entrainment {{and structure of}} the inversion layer of a clear convectively driven planetary boundary layer (PBL) over a range of bulk Richardson numbers, Ri. The LES code uses a nested grid technique to achieve fine resolution in all three directions in the inversion layer. Extensive flow visualization is used to examine the structure of the inversion layer and to illustrate the temporal and spatial interaction of a thermal plume and the overlying inversion. It is found that coherent structures in the convective PBL, that is, thermal plumes, are primary instigators of entrainment in the Ri range 13. 6 # Ri # 43. 8. At Ri 5 13. 6, strong horizontal and downward velocities are generated near the inversion layer because of the plume–interface interaction. This leads to folding of the interface and hence entrainment of warm inversion air at the plume’s edge. At Ri 5 34. 5, the inversion’s strong stability prevents folding of the interface but strong horizontal and downward motions near the plume’s edge pull down pockets of warm air below the <b>nominal</b> inversion <b>height.</b> These pockets of warm air are then scoured off by turbulent motions and entrained into the PBL. The structure of the inversion interface from LES is in good visual agreement with lidar measurements in the PBL obtained during the Lidars in Flat Terrain field experiment...|$|R
