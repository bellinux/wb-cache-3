5|$|On 13 July 1965, the {{specification}} for the AFVG {{feasibility study}} was issued; according to Wood, the specification greatly resembled that {{which had been}} earlier issued for the cancelled TSR-2. The AFVG {{was to have a}} maximum speed of 800 knots at sea level and Mach 2.5 at altitude. It was required to possess a minimum combat radium of 500 <b>nautical</b> miles, a ferry range of 3,500 <b>nautical</b> miles, and the nose-mounted airborne interception radar was to have a minimum range of 60 <b>nautical</b> miles. Armanment was to include a pair of 30 mm cannons and a 2,500lb tactical nuclear bomb. However, the specification would be repeatedly re-drafted, the issuing of a definitive specification by Whitehall was delayed until April 1966.|$|E
5|$|Sea Scouting is {{the program}} for {{young men and women}} ages 14 through 21 focused on <b>nautical</b> activities.|$|E
5|$|Aaron {{joined the}} group at their February 27, 2017 show at Toronto's Air Canada Centre to perform two songs. The band was also joined by Jeremy Widerman from Monster Truck to perform a cover of <b>Nautical</b> Disaster in {{dedication}} to Gord Downie.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 2012, two Iranian Su-25s fired cannon bursts at a USAF MQ-1 Predator drone 16 <b>nautical</b> {{miles off}} the Iranian coast. The Iranian {{government}} has claimed that the drone violated its airspace.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the light}} had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens was {{installed}} in May 1902, just three months into its operation. The light characteristic was a fixed white light with a red flash every 15 seconds. In 1972, the light was automated and the Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern optic. The light continues {{to serve as an}} active aid to navigation. In 1987, a FA-251 was installed before the current lens, a VRB-25 was installed. The current light characteristic is an alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds. The white and red flashes can be seen for 18 <b>nautical</b> miles and 15 <b>nautical</b> miles, respectably.|$|E
5|$|Other non-SI units (Table 8). This list {{catalogues}} {{a number}} of units of measure {{that have been used}} internationally in certain well-defined spheres including the bar for pressure, the ångström for atomic physics, the <b>nautical</b> mile and the knot in navigation.|$|E
5|$|Ships may cross {{numerous}} {{time zones}} on a voyage, so <b>nautical</b> time, {{introduced in the}} 1920s, is used in international waters. Each such zone is uniformly 15 degrees of longitude wide, the ship's clock going forward one hour per zone when travelling eastwards.|$|E
5|$|The Chapel of Portishead National <b>Nautical</b> School (now The Fedden Village) in Nore Road, {{dates from}} 1911. It is {{dedicated}} to St. Nicholas and is also a listed building.|$|E
5|$|UB-10 began August 1915 by {{capturing}} {{and burning}} Alert—another British fishing smack—off Lowestoft on the 1st. The same day, Fulgens, a 2,512-ton collier, was torpedoed one <b>nautical</b> mile (1.8km) from Palling; {{the crew of}} the ship—UB-10s largest victim to-date—were all saved.|$|E
5|$|Apart from railguns, 16 inch {{scramjet}} rounds with {{ranges of}} up to 400 <b>nautical</b> miles that have a 9-minute time of flight are being proposed by Pratt and Whitney working with Dr. Dennis Reilly, a plasma physicist with extensive experience with munitions. Alliant Techniques is also developing a ram-jet projectile for 5-inch and 155mm gun. Unfortunately, the navy had no interested sponsor according to both Pratt and Whitney representatives and Dr. Reilly.|$|E
5|$|Despite Gilbert's disclaimer, audiences, {{critics and}} even the Prime Minister {{identified}} Sir Joseph Porter with W. H. Smith (a politician who had recently been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty despite having neither military nor <b>nautical</b> experience). Sullivan was delighted with the sketch, and Gilbert read a first draft of the plot to Carte in mid-January.|$|E
5|$|Gerardus Mercator (5 March 1512– 2 December 1594) was a 16th-century German-Flemish cartographer, {{geographer}} and cosmographer. He was {{renowned for}} creating the 1569 world map based on a new projection which represented sailing courses of constant bearing (rhumb lines) as straight lines—an innovation that is still employed in <b>nautical</b> charts.|$|E
5|$|German {{astronomer}} Johann Bode {{defined the}} constellation Lochium Funis, the Log and Line—a <b>nautical</b> device once used for measuring speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 star atlas, but the depiction did not survive. In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|HMS St Clement {{became a}} Combined Operations base and evolved into HMS St Clement I, II and III. As HMS St Clement III, the fort's last {{military}} designation, {{it was used}} after 1946 by the Admiralty for training Sea Cadets and <b>nautical</b> youth groups. It was decommissioned in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 a local {{maritime}} historian, Paul Barnett, commenced a privately-funded {{research project}} which saw the site's 86 vessels recorded and recognised {{as the largest}} ships' graveyard in mainland Britain. The <b>Nautical</b> Archaeology Society investigated the site in 2008 {{as part of its}} Diving into History Project, and carried out laser scanning of the remains. In 2010 British Waterways took control of the site in an attempt to protect it.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, was belatedly {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,016 men. Mount Indefatigable in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917. The wreck was identified by <b>nautical</b> archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001, when it was found to have been heavily salvaged sometime in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{light was}} {{automated}} in 1979. Today, the lighthouse displays an occulting red light with a four-second period, having a nominal range of 12 <b>nautical</b> miles. During the navigation season {{that runs from}} April 1 to November 1, the fog signal sounds a two-second blast every fifteen seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{expedition}} was to conduct a hydrographic survey of the coasts of {{the southern part of}} South America. This was a continuation and correction of the work of previous surveys, in order to produce accurate <b>nautical</b> charts showing navigational and sea depth information for the navy and for commerce.|$|E
5|$|The {{red brick}} National <b>Nautical</b> School {{was built by}} Edward Gabriel in 1905, {{at a cost of}} £30,000. Previously it had been based on the {{training}} ship HMS Formidable and operated until 1983. It is now part of a private gated community known as Fedden Village.|$|E
5|$|Born in Windlesham, Surrey in 1976, {{where he}} lived and moved to Sherborne. He first learned to sail aged four or five, while visiting his {{grandparents}} at Christchurch, Dorset, and later sailed in a Seafly dinghy with his father, Keith. His talent {{brought him to the}} notice of Jim Saltonstall, who coached him in the Royal Yachting Association youth squad. Simpson attended Pangbourne College, a mixed boarding school in Berkshire, which originated as a <b>nautical</b> college, coaching students in sailing, seamanship and navigation. He studied at University College London, gaining a degree in economics. In addition to sailing, he was a keen footballer.|$|E
5|$|He {{grew up in}} Nordhausen {{in central}} Germany and was {{orphaned}} at an early age. After embarking on a <b>nautical</b> career {{at the age of}} 16, he served briefly in the Imperial German Navy {{at the start of the}} 20th century. His ill health forced him to abandon a naval career, but he remained in the naval reserve. He joined the Hamburg America Line to work as a tour guide. While escorting a party of tourists, he met and married a German-American woman, but the marriage broke down after only a few months. His wife divorced him and he returned to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to <b>nautical</b> blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{he participated}} in Operation Mount Hope III, during which U.S. forces {{recovered}} a crashed Soviet-made Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter in Chad. Company E of the 160th deployed to N'Djamena, Chad via C-5 Galaxy. Once in Chad the company flew two CH-47 Chinooks 490 <b>nautical</b> miles at night, {{without the use of}} navigational aids, to the crash site. Once at the crash site the crews harnessed the crashed Hind to a Chinook via sling-load. During the returning flight both Chinooks performed an air-to-air refuel with a C-130; and later endured a sandstorm before returning with the Hind.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, the {{fishermen}} {{started to work}} in maritime activities, as pilots or seafarers in {{the crew of the}} Portuguese ships, due to their high <b>nautical</b> knowledge. The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since, at least, 1506. During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon's Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to their high technical skills. The single floored houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture. The seafarers' social class, well-off gentlemen, was associated with this richer architecture around Praça Velha square.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave Bayer designations to ten stars now named Alpha to Lambda Pyxidis, {{skipping}} the Greek letters iota and kappa. Although a <b>nautical</b> element, {{the constellation}} {{was not an}} integral part of the old Argo Navis and hence did not share in the original Bayer designations of that constellation, which were split between Carina, Vela and Puppis. Pyxis is a faint constellation, its three brightest stars—Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis—form a rough line. Overall, there are 41 stars within the constellation's borders with apparent magnitudes brighter than or equal to 6.5.|$|E
5|$|Lakeshore East {{features}} {{several of}} the tallest buildings in Chicago and may include {{a few of the}} tallest buildings in the United States. The overall planned development, the park, and {{several of the}} individual buildings have won awards for architecture and/or urban planning. The buildings are planned for various types of residential use (condominiums, apartments, or hotels). Due to the neighborhood's proximity to both Lake Michigan to the east and the Chicago River to the north, many of the buildings are named with aquatic or <b>nautical</b> themes. As of August 2008, 1,500 condominiums have been sold and 1,200 apartments have been completed.|$|E
5|$|Larrea's {{business}} prospered, and in 1808 the Buenos Aires Cabildo {{appointed him}} to oversee a naval patrol to suppress shipments of contraband. This {{gave him an}} opportunity to put his <b>nautical</b> skills to use. He also participated in the secret meetings of patriots who promoted political change, and joined the 1809 Mutiny of Álzaga, which attempted to depose viceroy Liniers and replace him with a Junta. The mutiny failed, but the patriots continued to plot, and in 1810 the May Revolution succeeded in deposing the new viceroy. Larrea did not {{take part in the}} discussions at the open cabildo, but was appointed as member of the Primera Junta.|$|E
5|$|Mark Edward Kelly {{is the son}} of Richard and Patricia Kelly, two retired police officers. Kelly is of Irish descent. He {{was born}} on February 21, 1964, in Orange, New Jersey, and raised in West Orange, New Jersey. Kelly {{graduated}} from Mountain High School in 1982. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Engineering and <b>Nautical</b> Science from the United States Merchant Marine Academy, graduating with highest honors in 1986. In 1994, he received a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{laws and}} {{regulations}} regarding alcohol are overseen by the Department of Law and Public Safety's Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), which is managed by the state's Attorney General. The current director of the Alcohol Beverage Control division is Dave Rible. State and municipal laws, including those that regulate alcoholic beverages, apply in all territorial waters which includes inland rivers, lakes, and bays, and tidal waters up to three <b>nautical</b> miles from the New Jersey shoreline.|$|E
5|$|Once in the air, the biplane {{was escorted}} to the French coast by four {{military}} aircraft led by French Air Force Captain Venson, and sighted from the coastal town of Étretat. A sighting {{was made by}} the commanding officer of the British submarine , who recorded the note in his log, that he observed a biplane at 300 m altitude, 20 <b>nautical</b> miles southwest of the tip of Needles on the Isle of Wight. In Ireland, an aircraft overhead was reported by a resident of the town of Dungarvan and a Catholic priest reported a sighting over the village of Carrigaholt, then no further verified reports were made.|$|E
5|$|She {{has several}} tattoos, {{including}} {{a black and}} pink <b>nautical</b> star {{on the back of}} both of her elbows; a pink and red dragon surrounding kanji lettering that translates to 'Trust No One' going down the right side of her torso; symbols on the small of her lower back; and a butterfly on her right hip. She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (a piercing near the upper lip that resembles a beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (a piercing {{on each side of the}} lower lip).|$|E
5|$|Skagen Town and Regional Museum (Skagen By- og Egnsmuseum), {{an open-air}} museum, was opened {{by the local}} {{population}} in 1927. In 1938 it {{was moved to the}} sand dunes of Vesterby. The museum brings together examples of fishermen's cottages and the homes of less fortunate inhabitants of Skagen {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. There is an old life-saving station, a smithy, an old Dutch windmill, pictures of ships in distress and related <b>nautical</b> artefacts as well as a collection of items illustrating the town's history over various periods.|$|E
5|$|Some Scout Groups offer special Scouting {{programmes}} called Air Scouts and Sea Scouts. Both programmes {{follow the}} same core programme in all sections but can add more aeronautical or <b>nautical</b> emphasis depending on the programme, with some Groups choosing to be recognised by the Royal Air Force or Royal Navy. In the United Kingdom there are approximately 400 Sea Scout Groups, of which about 25% (101 Groups) are Royal Navy recognised, whilst of 117 Air Scout Groups, 43 are recognised by the RAF.|$|E
5|$|The Act of Parliament {{governing}} the enclosure of Portishead {{was passed in}} 1814, and stipulated {{the right to a}} public wharf, although there is historical evidence of <b>nautical</b> connections dating back to the Patent Rolls of 1331. Around the 1860s, {{at the height of the}} iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built by the Bristol & Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. They brought valuable cargoes from across the globe and exported local products overseas. Ships carrying coal were commonplace in Portishead Docks.|$|E
5|$|The Austronesian {{languages}} are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from Madagascar to maritime Southeast Asia {{all the way}} to Oceania. It includes such languages as Malagasy, Māori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages of Indonesia and Taiwan. The Austronesian {{languages are}} considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced <b>nautical</b> technology. Other populous language families are the Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic languages of Central Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer), and Tai–Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).|$|E
5|$|The German Luftwaffe had Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor {{aircraft}} with a {{range of}} nearly 2,000 <b>nautical</b> miles (3700 km - 2300 miles). After the Fall of France, these aircraft could operate from western France against British merchant ships in the Atlantic. Flying from Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport, Fw 200s of I/KG40 could reach the convoy lanes west of Britain while staying outside the range of British land-based fighters. The Royal Navy had no aircraft carriers available to provide close air cover for the convoys. The Fw 200s could shadow convoys, directing U-boat attacks on them, or drop bombs on convoy ships, without opposition and to deadly effect.|$|E
