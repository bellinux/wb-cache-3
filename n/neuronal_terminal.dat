40|$|Tp 53, {{a stress}} {{response}} gene, {{is involved in}} diverse cell death pathways and its activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. However, whether the neuronal Tp 53 protein plays a direct role in regulating dopaminergic (DA) neuronal cell death or <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminal</b> damage in different neurotoxicant models is unknown. In our recent studies, {{in contrast to the}} global inhibition of Tp 53 function by pharmacological inhibitors and in traditional Tp 53 knock-out mice, we examined the effects of DA-specific Tp 53 gene deletion after 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine and methamphetamine exposure. Our data suggests that the Tp 53 gene might be involved in both neuronal apoptosis and <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminal</b> damage caused by different neurotoxicants. Additional results from other studies also suggest that as a master regulator of many pathways that regulate apoptosis and synaptic terminal damage, it is possible that Tp 53 may function as a signaling hub to integrate different signaling pathways to mediate distinctive target pathways. Tp 53 protein as a signaling hub might be able to evaluate the microenvironment of neurons, assess the forms and severities of injury incurred, and determine whether apoptotic cell death or <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminal</b> degeneration occurs. Identification of the precise mechanisms activated in distinct neuronal damage caused by different forms and severities of injuries might allow for development of specific Tp 53 inhibitors or ways to modulate distinct downstream target pathways involved...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} step of <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation is the permanent {{withdrawal from the}} cell cycle that requires the silencing of genes that drive mitosis. Here, we describe that the α isoform of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1) protein family exerts such silencing on several E 2 F-targeted genes. Among the different isoforms, HP 1 α levels progressively increase throughout differentiation and take over HP 1 γ binding on E 2 F sites in mature neurons. When overexpressed, only HP 1 α is able to ensure a timed repression of E 2 F genes. Specific inhibition of HP 1 α expression drives neuronal progenitors either towards death or cell cycle progression, yet preventing {{the expression of the}} neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this mechanism occurs in cerebellar granule neurons in vivo, during the postnatal development of the cerebellum. Finally, our results suggest that E 2 F-targeted genes are packaged into higher-order chromatin structures in mature neurons relative to neuroblasts, likely reflecting a transition from a ‘repressed' versus ‘silenced' status of these genes. Together, these data present new epigenetic regulations orchestrated by HP 1 isoforms, critical for permanent cell cycle exit during neuronal differentiation...|$|E
40|$|We are {{employing}} {{recent advances}} {{in the understanding of}} the cell cycle to study the inverse relationship between proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Nerve growth factor and aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases, synergistically induce neuronal differentiation of SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells and the expres-sion of p 21 WAF 1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. The differentiated cells continue to express p 21 WAF 1, even after removal of aphidicolin from the culture medium. The p 21 WAF 1 protein coimmunoprecipitates with cyclin E and inhibits cyclin E-associated protein kinase activity. Each of three antisense oligonucleotides complementary to p 21 WAF 1 mRNA partially blocks expression of p 21 WAF 1 and promotes programmed cell death. These data indicate that p 21 WAF 1 expression is required for survival of these differentiating neuroblas-toma cells. Thus, the problem of neuronal differentiation can now be understood in the context of negative regulators of the cell cycle.

To this aim total and acid soluble nuclear proteins were analyzed by different electrophoretic techniques. Our results show that: 1) during maturation in vitro, neuronal nuclei undergo {{a dramatic change in}} the rate at which different classes of histones and high mobility group (HMG) proteins are synthesized; the synthetic activity, measured as incorporation of radioactive precursors into nuclear proteins, slows indeed down with age: especially evident is the decrease in core histones synthesis; at day 15, on the other hand, HMG 14 and 17 and ubiquitinated H 2 A (A 24) are synthesized at a high rate, especially in T 3 -treated neurons; 2) neurons treated with T 3 show, at any age tested, a higher level of lysine incorporation into nuclear proteins; 3) even if during the first days of culture neurons synthesize core histones more actively in the presence of T 3, there is no accumulation of these proteins at later stages, as compared with untreated cells.

40|$|Accumulative {{evidence}} suggests that more than 20 neuron-specific genes are regulated by a transcriptional cis-regulatory element known as the neural restrictive silencer (NRS). A trans-acting repressor that binds the NRS, NRSF [also designated RE 1 -silencing transcription factor (REST) ] has been cloned, but the mechanism by which it represses transcription is unknown. Here we show evidence that NRSF represses transcription of its target genes by recruiting mSin 3 and histone deacetylase. Transfection experiments using a series of NRSF deletion constructs revealed the presence of two repression domains, RD- 1 and RD- 2, within the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the RD- 1 region as a bait identified a short form of mSin 3 B. In vitro pull-down assays and in vivo immunoprecipitation-Western analyses revealed a specific interaction between NRSF-RD 1 and mSin 3 PAH 1 -PAH 2 domains. Furthermore, NRSF and mSin 3 formed a complex with histone deacetylase 1, suggesting that NRSF-mediated repression involves histone deacetylation. When the deacetylation of histones was inhibited by tricostatin A in non-neuronal cells, mRNAs encoding several neuronal-specific genes such as SCG 10, NMDAR 1, and choline acetyltransferase became detectable. These results indicate that NRSF recruits mSin 3 and histone deacetylase 1 to silence neural-specific genes and suggest further that repression of histone deacetylation is crucial for transcriptional activation of neural-specific genes during <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a {{heterogeneous}} disease with many etiologies; both environmental and genetic factors {{are thought to}} play a significant role. Previous ALS research has focused heavily on the potential role of mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1). Studies primarily done in models of SOD 1 -ALS have identified several pathogenic mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets. However, preclinical and clinical trials targeting these mechanisms have by and large failed. The complexity of the disease may play a big factor in these failures; therefore, the premise for this work is to investigate alternative therapeutic targets for ALS based on patient-specific genotypes and/or phenotypes. This thesis characterizes a form of ALS caused by mutations in FUSed in Liposarcoma (FUS) {{in order to identify}} potentially converging and/or unique pathogenic mechanisms among ALS subtypes. Initial studies characterizing mutant FUS in astrocytes revealed that expression of this mutant protein recapitulated key pathology observed in ALS patients, and it did not overtly kill astrocytes. Like mutant SOD 1, mutant FUS exerted non-cell autonomous toxicity on wild type motor neurons. Mutant FUS toxicity was mediated through the inflammatory factor TNF 2 ̆ 6 agr;, and neutralization of this soluble factor rescued toxicity. Although astrocytes did not appear to die {{as a direct result of}} mutant FUS expression, significant transcriptome changes were observed using microarray analysis. These findings prompted analysis of neural/glial antigen 2 (NG 2) positive cells and revealed that in purified populations of astrocytes, counts of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells decreased while NG 2 + cells increased. This was accompanied by an increase in NG 2 levels identified by western blot. In order to then examine cell-intrinsic mechanisms of FUS toxicity, an in vitro model of the mammalian neuromuscular junction was established by co-culturing motor neurons expressing mutant FUS with differentiated myotubes. These studies identified two key targets of mutant FUS at the presynaptic <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminal,</b> SV 2 and synaptophysin. Knock down of wild type FUS led to reductions of mRNA and protein of these synaptic vesicle proteins, while expression of mutant FUS led to reductions of protein levels only. These changes decreased the functional ability of mutant FUS neurons to exocytose, revealing a novel role for wild type FUS, and uncovering potential motor neuron–specific therapeutic targets in FUS-ALS. Intrinsic cellular toxicity was also probed by analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics, which showed a significant decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential in mutant FUS–expressing neuron-like cells. Lastly, studies targeting netrin- 1, a soluble factor shown to induce toxicity in SOD 1 -mediated ALS, showed that rescue of FUS-astrocytic toxicity could not be rescued through netrin- 1 neutralization. Collectively, these data shed light on potential new pathogenic pathways underlying FUS-ALS and contribute to a better understanding of FUS-mediated toxicity in ALS. Future studies will be necessary to further explore these pathways with the ultimate goal of developing improved treatment strategies aimed at these potential new therapeutic targets. ...|$|E

Using radiolabeled and unlabeled inhibitors as ligands, this study was aimed to determine the in situ distribution of �-secretase in the brain. Characterization using PS- 1 knock-out mouse embryos revealed 50 and 80 % reductions of �-secretase inhibitor binding density in the heterozygous (PS- 1 �/ �) and homozygous (PS- 1 �/ �) embryos, respectively, relative to the wild type (PS- 1 �/ �). The pharmacological profile from competition binding assays suggests that the ligands may target at the N- and C-terminal fragments of PS essential for �-secretase activity. In the adult rat brain, the binding sites existed mostly in the forebrain, the cerebellum, and discrete brainstem areas and were particularly abundant in areas rich in <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals,</b> e. g., olfactory glomeruli, CA 3 – hilus area, cerebellar molecular layer, and pars reticulata of the substantia nigra.

Fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin-V labeling increased rapidly in synaptosomes, following a 1 min incubation with staurosporine. However, increased caspase- 3 -like activity was not measured until 30 min with a fluorometric assay. The addition of a peptide inhibitor of caspase- 3 -like activity (Ac-DEVD-CHO) during homogenization was not able to block the initial increase in annexin labeling, but resulted in a partial blockade of annexin labeling after 30 min.

These dyes passively cross the cell membrane and become fluorescent upon zinc binding. We found that the extracellular concentration of zinc and therefore zinc influx into the cell is limited by the presence of phosphate, which induces zinc precipitation by forming insoluble zinc-phosphate salts. Zinc solubility and influx is increased by the application of histidine to the extracellular medium. We also found that exogenously applied zinc {{in the presence of a}} zinc ionophore seems to translocate in vesicles and cytoplasmic compartments. Zinc seems to be very tightly buffered as it enters the cytoplasm, since transient increases in fluorescence (as observed during Ca 2 + influx into the cytoplasm) are not observed.

The experiments described in this paper were designed {{to examine the effects of}} photo-period on DA metabolism and synthesis in the ME to determine if a change in these processes is responsible for the short-photoperiod-induced decrease in ME DA concentrations. In the first experi-ment, the metabolism of DA in tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals</b> was determined by measuring ME concentrations of 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; a major metabolite of DA) and DA in male and female hamsters housed in long and short photoperiods.

In males, but not in females, exposure to the short photoperiod reduced ME DA concentrations; however, DOPAC concentrations were not affected by photoperiod. Thus, the decrease in ME DA seen in males is not the result of an increase in DA metabolism. In the second experiment, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in the ME of males was determined by injecting animals housed in long and short photoperiods with a L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (NSD 1015) and measuring 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA).

We report here that Rac 1 N/Rac 3 KO mice display a progressive loss of immune-competence. Comparative longitudinal analysis of lymphoid organs from control, single Rac 1 N or Rac 3 KO, and double Rac 1 N/Rac 3 KO mutant animals showed that thymus development is preserved up to postnatal day 9 in all animals, but is impaired in Rac 1 N/Rac 3 KO mice at later times. This is evidenced by a drastic reduction in thymic cell numbers. Cell numbers were also reduced in the spleen, leading to splenic tissue disarray.

RAMH-induced decreases in both the uEPSC and uIPSC amplitudes were accompanied by increases in the failure rate and paired-pulse ratio. JNJ 5207852 dihydrochloride or thioperamide, H 3 receptor antagonists, inhibited RAMH-induced suppression of uEPSCs and uIPSCs. Unexpectedly, thioperamide alone increased the uIPSC amplitude, suggesting that thioperamide was likely to act as an inverse agonist. Miniature EPSC or IPSC recordings support the hypothesis that the activation of H 3 receptors suppresses the release of glutamate and GABA from presynaptic terminals. The colocalization of H 3 receptors and glutamate decarboxylase or vesicular glutamate transport protein 1 in presynaptic axon terminals was confirmed through double pre-embedding microscopy, using a combination of pre-embedding immunogold and immunoperoxidase techniques. The suppressive regulation of H 3 heteroreceptors on synaptic transmission might mediate the regulation of sensory information processes, such as gustation and visceral sensation, in the IC...|$|R
30|$|Brain {{ischemia}} {{was shown}} to change significantly the intracellular levels of reduced glutathione. These levels appeared to be low in ischemic core and surprisingly high in penumbra (Bragin et al. 2010). Furthermore, acidification is found to induce glutathione depletion in neurons (Lewerenz et al. 2010). In contrast, our results clearly show that the levels of reduced glutathione do not change in experimental models used in our studies (Figure  5). In addition, depletion of glutathione by CDNB does not intensify the oxidative stress induced by moderate acidification (Figure  6). Therefore, our {{results suggest that the}} reduced glutathione does not contribute significantly to the antioxidant protection of <b>neuronal</b> presynaptic <b>terminals,</b> at least in the acidosis-induced model of oxidative stress.|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{disorders}} are highly prevalent among patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, {{there are also}} reports of PD patients experiencing a beneficial effect of sleep. Upon awaking in the morning they experience an improved mobility {{as if they are}} in an “on” state due to medication, contrary to what would be expected after a night without medication. This intriguing phenomenon is known as sleep benefit (SB). Research on SB is limited and studies report divergent results. Variability in results can be mainly ascribed to differences in definitions and subjective measurements. SB has mostly been attributed to improved dopaminergic function as a result of increased storage of dopamine in nigral <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals</b> during sleep. Contrarily, other authors claim that SB is probably unrelated to sleep, but associated with the time of awakening and pattern of motor fluctuations. In this thesis also a third hypothesis is introduced, that not sleep, but rather sleep deprivation facilitates SB. However, none of the current hypotheses can be sufficiently validated. Therefore, more research on the underlying mechanisms of SB is necessary. In future research on SB the use of clear and standardized definitions is essential and an objective method should be used to measure SB. Furthermore, for a better understanding of SB it is important to explicitly study the underlying mechanisms of SB and determine which hypothesis is most feasible. The beneficial effects of SB might go beyond the improvement of motor symptoms. Therefore, {{it would be interesting to}} study the influence of SB on, for example, cognitive rigidity. Finally, more attention for the clinical implications and therapeutic applicability of SB might improve treatment of PD patients...|$|R
40|$|Explants {{prepared}} from 17 - to 18 -day fetal rat {{spinal cord}} {{were allowed to}} mature in culture; such preparations {{have been shown to}} differentiate and myelinate in vitro (61) and to be capable of complex bioelectric activity (14 - 16). At 23, 35, or 76 days, the cultures were fixed (without removal from the coverslip) in buffered OsO 4, embedded in Epon, sectioned, and stained for light and electron microscopy. These mature explants generally are composed of several strata of neurons with an overlying zone of neuropil. The remarkable cytological similarity between in vivo and in vitro nervous tissues is established by the following observations. Cells and processes in the central culture mass are generally closely packed together with little intervening space. Neurons exhibit well developed Nissl bodies, elaborate Golgi regions, and subsurface cisternae. Axosomatic and axodendritic synapses, including synaptic junctions between axons and dendritic spines, are present. Typical synaptic vesicles and increased membrane densities are seen at the terminals. Variations in synaptic fine structure (Type 1 and Type 2 synapse~s of Gray) are visible. Some characteristics of the cultured spinal cord resemble infrequently observed specializations of in vivo central nervous tissue. Neuronal somas may display minute synapse-bearing projections. Occasionally, synaptic vesicles are grouped in a crystal-like array. A variety of glial cells, many apparently at intermediate stages of differentiation, are found throughout the otherwise mature explant. There is ultrastructural evidence of extensive glycogen deposits in some glial processes and scattered glycogen particles in <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals.</b> This is the first description of the ultrastructure of cultured spinal cord. Where possible, correlation is made between the ultrastructural data and the known physiological properties of these cultures...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian sperm {{contain a}} single large {{secretory}} ves-icle, or acrosome. Exocytosis of this vesicle (the acrosome reaction) occurs {{as an early}} step in the gamete interaction process and is an essential prerequisite for late events, in-cluding sperm-egg fusion [1]. The control of fertilization is, from this perspective, {{a question of the}} regulation of a secretory event. It may be useful to compare sperm to other secretory systems. Typical somatic secretory cells such as mast cells, the <b>neuronal</b> presynaptic <b>terminal,</b> and exocrine cells con-tain large numbers of secretory vesicles whereas sperm pos-sess a single acrosome. Those familiar somatic secretory models tolerate a low level of basal vesicle release that is augmented upon the arrival of an external stimulus.

40|$|ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{classified}} as a neurodegenerative disease which {{accounts for more than}} 60 % of all cases of dementia. AD is characterized by two hallmark lesions: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. According to the amyloid hypothesis, Aâ is the initiator of a cascade of reactions which causes Alzheimer at the end. But there is suggested that soluble oligomers of Aâ may play an early and critical role in neuronal dysfunction prior to overt plaque accumulation in the brain. Autopsy material from cases ranging from clinically non-demented to demented was prepared for electron microscopy to determine the cell association and ultra structural location of various forms of amyloid. Immunogold studies showed oligomeric Aâ over thin filaments extracellularly, representing pre-amyloid fibres, and within the cytoplasm and terminals of a subset of neurons. The observation of oligomeric Aâ within <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals</b> suggests a role for intracellular soluble Aâ oligomers in neuronal dysfunction and plasticity. Recently a transgenic model for AD was derived that is characterized by the development of both plaques and tangles. These mice, referred to as the 3 xTg-AD mice, harbour clinical mutations in the APP, PS 1 and tau genes. In this model, plaques and tangles manifest in a progressive manner in AD-relevant brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala and cortex, with plaque developing prior to the neurofibrillary pathology. In our study we analyzed 3 xTg-AD mice ranging from 6, 12, 18 and 30 months of age. Utilizing immunocytochemistry both at the light and electron microscopic level, we demonstrate various tau aggregates, including paired helical filaments. The tau modifications occur in a hierarchical manner, which first manifests with hyperphosphorylation and then proceed to mature tangles. The ultra structural analysis of these 3 xTg-AD mice should enable us to detail the development of plaque and tangles and the interaction between them in the pathogenesis of this disorder...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, {{resulting from}} the loss of dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) region of the brain. These cells form {{an integral part of the}} basal ganglia, an area responsible for motor coordination in mammals. In humans and subhuman primates, loss of these cells results in akinesia, rigidity, postural instability and tremor, and these symptoms progress as the loss of neurons from this region accelerates. Cell replacement therapy is considered as an obvious option for the recovery of lost motor functions resulting {{from the loss of}} neurons. This is relevant for PD owing to failures of available pharmacological approaches. Moreover, it was thought to be theoretically feasible because of the loss of only a particular segment of the CNS DA-ergic systems, the A 9 DA-ergic neurons, the terminals of which are in each of the striatum. Additionally, the anatomical location of the terminal region is an accessible site for any surgical interventions. A simple technique of placing dopamine secreting cells at the site of the A 9 SNpc <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals</b> would provide the neurotransmitter required for stimulating postsynaptic neurons in the area. The next problem could be engineering the transplanted neurons to release dopamine to specific stimuli. However, in practice, even transplanting dopamine releasing neurons in the striatum met with difficulties. To add to the woes, the varied outcomes of transplantation studies made it difficult to decipher the exact problem(s). Ultimately, what remains as of now are a bunch of speculations in regard to the failures or inconclusive outcomes of this therapeutic option. The major problems associated with cell replacement therapy in PD seem to be (i) the availability of implant material, (ii) its source, (iii) nature of the material, (iv) survivability of the cells in the grafts, and finally (v) fate of the transplants in long term grafts. Last, but not the least, the graft associated abnormalities in the host is a major unresolved issue...|$|R

GnRH <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals</b> located in the infundibulum of rodents have been shown to release GnRH when stimulated with PGE? in vivo and in vitro. The effect of PGE? on the release of GnRH has not been determined in cattle. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that PGE? can induce a release of GnRH from bovine infundibular explant halves incubated in vitro similar to release observed in rats. Infundibular explant halves from steers were incubated for nine thirty-minute periods (a total of 270 minutes) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (KRB) with or without PGE? in 95 % ethanol (2. 4 % of media volume) or 60 mM K? in KRB at 37 ?C and saturated with 95 % O?- 5 % CO?. PGE? was administered at concentrations of 0 []M (control for time period six), 100 []M, and 1000 []M (time period six) and compared to control (time period five). Neither of the PGE? treatments (0 []M, 100 []M, or 1000 []M) affected the release of GnRH. Consequently, a dose dependent effect of PGE? on the GnRH release was not observed. Depolarization (time period eight) (60 mM K?) induced an increase (p <. 001) in GnRH release, when compared to control (time period seven). These depolarization responses are consistent with responses previously observed from rodent and bovine explants, thus providing evidence that the explants in this experiment were capable of releasing GnRH. These results suggest that PGE? is unable to stimulate GnRH release from bovine infundibular explant halves incubated in vitro. Thus, they do not support a role of PGE? in release of GnRH from the infundibulum of cattle...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily-conserved small non-coding RNAs {{that are}} {{important}} posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Genetic Variants may cause microRNA dysregulation and the concomitant aberrant target expression. The dysregulation of {{one or a few}} targets may in turn lead to functional consequences ranging from phenotypic variations to disease conditions. In this thesis, I present our studies of mouse models of two human genetic variants - a rare copy number variant (CNV), 22 q 11. 2 microdeletions, and a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), BDNF Val 66 Met. 22 q 11. 2 microdeletions result in specific cognitive deficits and high risk to develop schizophrenia. Analysis of Df(16) A+/- mice, which model this microdeletion, revealed abnormalities in the formation of neuronal dendrites and spines as well as microRNA dysregulation in brain. We show a drastic reduction of miR- 185, which resides within the 22 q 11. 2 locus, to levels more than expected by a hemizygous deletion and demonstrate that this reduction impairs dendritic and spine development. miR- 185 targets and represses, through an evolutionary conserved target site, a previously unknown inhibitor of these processes that resides in the Golgi apparatus. Sustained derepression of this inhibitor after birth represents the most robust transcriptional disturbance in the brains of Df(16) A+/- mice and could affect the formation and maintenance of neural circuits. Reduction of miR- 185 also has milder effects on the expression of a group of Golgi-related genes. One the other hand, BNDF Val 66 Met results in impaired activity-dependent secretion of BDNF from <b>neuronal</b> <b>terminals</b> and affects episodic memory and affective behaviors. We found a modest reduction of miR- 146 b which causes derepression of mRNA and/or protein levels of a few targets. Our findings add to the growing evidence of the pivotal involvement of miRNAs in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunction. In addition, the identification of key players in miRNA dysregulation has implications for both basic and translational research in psychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunction...|$|R
