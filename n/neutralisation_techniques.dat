40|$|Within rural studies, {{there have}} been few {{attempts}} to critically analyse crimes against nature. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by providing an analysis of farmers’ reasons for illegally culling badgers in the United Kingdom. Drawing on Sykes and Matza’s (1957) concept of <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques,</b> the paper shows how farmers rationalise this activity in a number of ways. Using in-depth interviews with 60 farmers in the England and Wales, the paper shows how they justify badger culling through discursive strategies that claim the activity is necessary, denying victims or the necessity of the law, condemning the condemners, and appealing to higher communitarian loyalties. However, the paper also argues that <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> should be seen as components of a broader argument in support of rural space and identity. In the case of badger culling; <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> combine togethe r to defend a particular rural identity and way of living. As much as they are attempts to rationalise criminal behaviour, <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> should therefore be seen as spatial discourses, demarcating the boundaries of cultural identity and space. In conclusion, the paper discusses potential solutions to the problems of wildlife crime...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores how moral <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> can be {{employed}} by business leaders in their moral reasoning. It presents results from leadership training with participants from a Norwegian financial institution. Each participant faced the challenge of being a reference person for an employee who had created social unrest at work. The option of lying about the problems {{to get rid of}} the employee initially appeared to conflict with the participants ’ moral convictions. Nevertheless, some of them managed to overcome the dissonance by applying moral <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques.</b> Focus on moral reasoning of this kind among business leaders is shown to be part of a more general shift in attention from moral character to circumstances in explan-ations of and countermeasures against moral wrongdoing...|$|E
40|$|Technology has {{supposed}} {{a profound}} paradigm shift in human evolution, following Haraway’s cyborg metaphor we have forged a profound psycho-social rapport machines. This connectivity has also brought changes in crime patterns and fostered {{the development of}} cybercrime. From a criminological perspective, this work aims to explore the role of Per-Olof Wikströms Situational Action Theory in explaining cybercrime by including Syke and Matza’s <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> in its formulation. The SAT-RI (SAT- Revised for the Internet) takes into consideration the interaction between cyber-crime propensity (based essentially in moral perceptions), the internet, <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> (cognitive scripts used as protection against blame) and self-control. The theory was tested by using a mixed methods design that includes an online survey (N= 709) and case studies (N= 20) stemming from interviews with law enforcement agents. Once the data was analysed, it was demonstrated that individuals with low self-control tend to have higher cybercrime propensity and {{are more prone to}} justify their acts by using adequate neutralisations. In addition, there are differences in the perceptions of cybercriminals by law enforcement agents depending on whether they are fraudsters, child sex abusers, sex abusers or hackers. The resulting theory can be useful in terms of prevention, as it can help design programmes that focus on the different stages of the cybercrime process (self-control, propensity or neutralisation). Also, the thesis calls for a more anthropological conception of cybercriminology called cyborg criminology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how tourists justify inappropriate behaviour at contested cultural heritage sites through {{an analysis of}} weblogs of people who climbed Uluru, Australia. The climb is increasingly seen as being inappropriate, culturally insensitive and socially unacceptable. Yet it remains open and up to 150, 000 people participate each year. Park managers and traditional owners are trying to demarket it {{with the hope that}} falling consumer demand will ultimately result in its closure. The study revealed three types of climbers: those who reject the Aboriginality of the place; those with different value sets who see nothing inherently wrong with their actions; and a large group who is aware that its actions may be inappropriate and who, therefore, need to invoke some sort of <b>neutralisation</b> <b>technique</b> to rationalise their decision. This latter group is more likely to respond to behaviour modification messages and should be the main target of future demarketing activities. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R

Application of clean technologies greatly enhances the safety and quality of the product as well as reducing the energy requirements and environmental impact of the food industry. The main environmental impacts of the food sector are aquatic, atmospheric and solid waste emissions. Nowadays, the main treatment method of solid wastes is composting, while recovery and reuse of by-products and wastes as raw materials stand for another effective option ([URL] www. oulu. fi/resopt/wasmin/pap. pdf). Composted olive oil waste can find applications (1) as amendment in agriculture because of its high nitrogen and phosphorus content, (2) as a biofertiliser, with a mixture of compost with Sphagnum peat or commercial substrate finding use for ornamental plants growth and (3) as a biofilter for toxic metal removal. However, {{there are a number of}} disadvantages as well, such as large decline of soil germination capability, necrosis of the leaves and slow emission of secondary stems, and enhanced phytotoxicity, because of pH <b>neutralisation</b> <b>technique,</b> which should be seriously taken into account prior to opting for composting as a promising waste treatment alternative...|$|R
40|$|The {{insider threat}} concern {{is a complex}} issue as the problem domain intersects the social, the {{technical}} and the socio-technical dimensions. Consequently counteracting the insider threat involves influencing the insider’s perceptions and behaviour {{in order to ensure}} compliance. When an individual’s actions and beliefs are incongruent, this induces a phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance. In this state, individuals are self-motivated to change either their behaviours or beliefs or they may rationalise their behaviour to reduce this dissonance. <b>Neutralisation</b> is a <b>technique</b> used by criminals to rationalise maleficence. In terms of the insider threat, it has been proposed that if the justifications for committing an offence are eliminated then the insider is less likely to commit the offence. This process is known as neutralisation mitigation. This research proposes that inducing cognitive dissonance may be a means of mitigating the neutralisations that the insider may use to justify maleficence. To integrate these concepts into an implementable solution − the Insider Threat Neutralisation Mitigation model predicated on Cognitive Dissonance (ITNMCD) is proposed. Computin...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} how and why environmentally conscious consumers rationalise their non-green purchase behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – Seven focus groups were conducted. A total of 51 people, aged 19 - 70 years, participated in the study. Theoretical thematic analysis was used to organise the data as various themes emerged. Findings – Through application of neutralisation theory, this study identified additional barriers to green consumption. Two new <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> emerged, namely protecting (maintaining) one’s sense of self and consumer attachment to the brand. These techniques recognise the impact consumer culture has had on consumers. Research limitations/implications – The study took place in an urban centre hence the views of the participants may be different from those who live in rural centres; low-income consumers were under-represented; and more male participants would have been desirable. Social implications – Despite its limitations, this study reveals that consumers will rationalise their decisions in order to protect their self-esteem and self-identity. Until green becomes a social norm, consumers will continue to place individual goals over collective goals. Understanding this rationalisation process is important if marketers and policy makers want to encourage behavioural change. Originality/value – This study makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of the green attitudebehaviour gap. It provides fresh insights into how environmentally conscious consumers vindicate their non-green consumption behaviours and how marketers and policy makers can overcome these challenges. It also identifies two new <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> and extends the theory to a consumer culture context. 22 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The term “rationality” {{has been}} {{mentioned}} for ages in philosophical discourse, and later in science. No wonder that considerations regarding the reasons behind committing crimes involve the question of rationality of culprits. The article comprises a review of contemporary research on factors which, on a neurobiological, psychological or social level, modify the level of rationality of criminals. In case of the juveniles, factors such as not fully developed brain structures, the influence of hormonal changes resulting in emotional instability and peer pressure, should also be taken into account. Adult criminals often manifest a deficit of activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, combined with increased activity in the subcortex, resulting in an increased propensity for violence. Neurophysiologic disorders may be accompanied by factors reducing the rationality, such as: errors in thinking, habitual use of <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> or being lead by the, typical for street culture, perception of justice. All of the above {{should be taken into}} account {{as a part of a}} multi-aspect analyses of the causes of crime...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} how students neutralise potential feelings of guilt and stigmatisation regarding their alcohol consumption. We report findings from two qualitative studies with students at a UK university. The aim of the research was to uncover the range and ways in which neutralisation and counter-neutralisation techniques are used by drinkers and abstainers/near-abstainers in managing their alcohol position. Study 1 consisted of five focus groups with heavy drinkers and Study 2 comprised nine one-to-one interviews with abstainers and near-abstainers. Analysis highlights the importance of alcohol consumption in students’ lifestyles, but also the potential identity conflicts experienced by all drinkers, regardless of the amount consumed. Heavy drinkers primarily employ <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> as a means to rationalise the negative impacts of their actions, whereas abstainers and near-abstainers mainly use counter-neutralisation techniques as a means to reinforce their commitment to lifestyles which run counter to mainstream student life expectations. However, regardless of the amount of alcohol consumed, all participants employed neutralising and counter-neutralising arguments in some social situations. The paper discusses the usefulness of neutralisation theory to account for the adoption of risky health behaviours, such as excessive alcohol consumption, and the potential implications for public health interventions...|$|E

The retail travel agent sector is {{a major player in the}} tourism distribution system, accounting for about 25 % of travel activity, and is the primary distributor of package tours. In-depth interviews were conducted with senior managers and owners/operators of a sample of travel agencies in Hong Kong, followed by a survey of 485 front line staff. The study revealed senior managers adopted a range of <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> to abrogate themselves from any personal or corporate responsibility in this issue. Front line staff were largely unaware and ill-informed, and mainly see their role as simply pushing products. Cluster analysis revealed five groups with diverse views: Cluster 1, the "Deeply concerned" group (11 %); Cluster 2, the "Deep knowledge" group (6 %); Cluster 3, the "Moderate knowledge and awareness" group (18 %); Cluster 4, the "Concerned but unaware" group (31 %); and Cluster 5, the "Neither concerned nor aware" group (34 %). The combination of lack of leadership among managers and ignorance among front line staff means that neither feels responsible for, nor able to, address this issue.

40|$|In recent years, two Swedish {{companies}} have been a focus of substantial media attention: TeliaSonera and Lundin Petroleum. The defensive strategies employed by these two businesses to deal with allegations of crime will be analysed {{on the basis of}} Stanley Cohen’s theoretical work on processes of denial and <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques.</b> This paper will focus on a particular form of denial, namely the appeal to higher loyalties, whereby the businesses try to explain why they have been doing business despite the risks that this has involved. The paper links together the companies’ communications with the contexts in which they occur and the structures that might be expected to influence how the companies choose to frame their communications. The presence of the corporations in areas where crimes have been committed is not denied, but implicatory denials are employed to justify the corporations’ operations by referring to the societal benefits of their business activities. When the corporations frame their businesses as contributing to development, democracy and peace in the countries in which they operate, the corporations use well-known discourses that underline Swedish or Nordic generosity, helpfulness and decency. Thus, the analysis also draws on post-colonial theory and the image of the Nordic countries as being particularly “good” in relation {{to the rest of the}} world...|$|E
40|$|The use of Carbon Adsorption Technology for the {{development}} of a Prototype Portable Carbon Adsorption Unit was investigated. Carbon adsorption is a well-established treatment process. It is much safer and more economical in comparison with other conventional <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> used for toxic chemical spill clean up. This thesis begins by examining the nature of toxic chemical spills, the effects on the environment and the economy, and the currently available response methods and treatment technologies. The discussion then continues into the use of Carbon Adsorption Technology for the treatment of toxic chemical spills. This is further developed by the conceptual design of a portable adsorption unit. Small scale column experiments were carried out in order to determine the flow configuration to be adopted by the unit. These experiments showed that an upflow configuration had greater potential to increase adsorption efficiency. From the conceptual design stage a full detailed design of the unit was done from which the unit was constructed. The constructed prototype portable adsorption unit was then evaluated by performing a series of adsorption experiments on a single column. The conclusion reached is that Carbon Adsorption Technology can be successfully applied on a small scale for the treatment of toxic chemical spills...|$|E
40|$|The article evaluates {{different}} {{theories of}} action {{in the area of}} crime research. A narrow version of rational choice theory assumes actors to choose in an instrumental, outcome-oriented way. It hypothesises that individuals weight {{the costs and benefits of}} criminal acts with subjective probabilities. In contrast, a wide version of the theory allows individuals to derive utility directly from choosing certain actions. Previous studies either do not directly test these theories or yield inconsistent results. We show that a meaningful test of these rival rational choice explanations can only be conducted if a broader view is adopted that takes into account the interplay of moral norms and instrumental incentives. Such a view can be derived from the Model of Frame Selection (Kroneberg 2005) and the Situational Action Theory of Crime Causation (Wikström 2004). Based on these theories, we analyze the willingness to engage in shoplifting and tax fraud in a sample of 2, 130 adults from Dresden, Germany. In line with our theoretical expectations, we find that only respondents who do not feel bound by moral norms consider instrumental incentives. Where norms have been strongly internalised and in the absence of <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> which legitimise norm-breaking, instrumental incentives are irrelevant. ...|$|E
40|$|Studies have {{revealed}} that positive attitudes towards the environment have not necessarily translated into green consumption practices, despite consumers’ growing concern for the environment. This leads one to question consumers’ motives. Why do environmentally-conscious consumers choose less green options? The purpose of our {{study was to explore}} the attitude-behaviour gap. The key research question was: how do consumers justify their non-green consumption practices? Seven focus groups were conducted with consumers ranging in ages from 19 - 70. Six of the focus groups were two hours long, the seventh focus group was ninety minutes long. Advertisements were placed in the local newspaper, and participants were screened on the basis of purchase behaviour and attitudes towards the environment. Our findings revealed that one of the biggest barriers to being green is the perception that it is too hard to be green; “green” being an action, e. g., buying green products and/or participating in green activities. The theory of neutralisation was used to explain how people justify their norm-violating behaviours, i. e., “non-green behaviour”, {{based on the assumption that}} one is ethically obliged to protect the environment. Three key <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> appeared in our findings: denial of responsibility, denial of injury (or benefit), and appeal to higher loyalties. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The article tackles some {{normative}} {{issues surrounding}} the criminalisation of certain undesirable conduct in cyber space. Despite its proclaimed "virtual" nature, such conduct can become very "real" when the harm arising from it is taken into account. In {{line with the}} Harm Principle, the criminalisation of harmless - albeit unpleasant - conduct is, however, problematic in a modern, liberal criminal legal system. The article also addresses {{the question of the}} innate immorality (mala in se) of certain cybercrime and lack thereof, which may further impede legitimisation of criminalisation. Not only is criminal law always not one but several steps behind and a rather ineffective tool for dealing with such social phenomena, its legitimacy comes partly under question also when more and more crimes are perceived as "mere" mala prohibita, thus having no (negative) moral standing outside the law. It is further examined what happens when the majority is "deviant", when deviance becomes the norm or the rule. Apart from criminalisation-justification problems, it is argued that this situation enables the evolution of various <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques,</b> further promoted by the accessibility and (perceived) anonymity issues relating to the internet. It is observed, moreover, that technology facilitates a generational gap in IT knowledge, {{as well as in the}} value systems, and that the crux of the problem regarding the said crimes lies therein...|$|E
40|$|Bauxite residue (red mud), the {{by-product}} {{produced in}} the alumina industry, is being produced at an estimated global rate of approximately 150 Mt per annum. Due to its highly alkaline nature, many refineries use <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques</b> such as mud farming (atmospheric carbonation), direct carbonation using carbon dioxide or reactions with seawater, to treat the bauxite residue and reduce its alkalinity prior to disposal in the BRDA (bauxite residue disposal area). Applying a treatment can render the bauxite residue non-hazardous and may also prepare the bauxite residue for reuse, particularly as an adsorbent. In this study, gypsum and seawater treatments were applied to the various bauxite residue samples obtained and the effects on its mineral, elemental and physiochemical properties were examined, {{as well as the}} effect on its phosphorus (P) adsorption capacity. It was found that in addition to reducing the alkalinity of all bauxite residue samples used, the P adsorption capacity was also enhanced following amendment with seawater or gypsum, particularly with gypsum. A positive correlation was detected between P adsorption and both Ca and CaO. A negative correlation was detected between the P adsorption and pH of the media. Fitting the data obtained from a batch adsorption experiment to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity was estimated to range from 0. 345 to 2. 73 mg P per g bauxite residue, highlighting the re-use potential for bauxite residue as an adsorbent for P...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{environmental}} concern, sustainability {{and climate}} change have become widespread political and social issues. The prevalence of environmental issues in the social environment has encouraged the majority of consumers to develop concern for environmental issues, pro-environmental attitudes and an intention to purchase green products and practice green behaviour. However, future growth of green consumerism is threatened by an “attitude-behaviour gap”. Sustainable consumption behaviour {{is limited to a}} niche market of “green” consumers, and must expand into more mainstream consumer markets. This study is aimed at exploring how individual perceptions, personal relationships and social experiences shape green consumption behaviour. Its objectives were (1) to achieve a greater understanding of how the social environment influences the green consumption behaviour of individual consumers; and (2) to explore how pro-environmental behaviour change takes place. This study used qualitative methods and adopted an adapted case study methodology. The primary data was collected from semi-structured depth interviews with two participants from seven household cases. Four key insights of this research were: (1) “Green” and “mainstream” (i. e., not-so-green) consumers positively influence the green consumption behaviour of other consumers via social observations, comparisons and “greening strategies”, resulting in pro-environmental behaviour change; (2) “Mainstream” (i. e., not-so-green) consumers view “green” consumers as people who adopt “alternative” green consumption behaviour. A “green syndrome” has developed whereby “green” is viewed as an unattainable goal, limiting mainstream participation in green consumption behaviour; (3) “Green” and “mainstream” (i. e., not-so-green) consumers cope with their non-environmental actions with tradeoff and neutralisation arguments which reinforce the “attitude-behaviour gap” in green consumerism and (4) Personal relationships and household dynamics (i. e., household roles, lifecycle and structure) can affect the adoption and effectiveness of green consumption behaviour practiced within households. Pro-environmental behaviour can be encouraged by explicit green social norms in the social environment, as this reduces the efficacy of <b>neutralisation</b> <b>techniques.</b> Furthermore, the “mainstream” (i. e., not-so-green) population will adopt green products and practices when they are effective, convenient and cost-efficient...|$|E
