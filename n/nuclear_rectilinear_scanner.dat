Low lesion-to-background ratios have been a problem, as well as the normal physiologic uptake in certain organs such as the vertebral column, liver, and bowel. In order to improve the efficacy of Ga- 67 citrate imaging, a double-tracer subtraction technique had been described by Dawson and coworkers using a dual-probe <b>rectilinear</b> <b>scanner</b> (4).

Xn. {{the initial}} studies with a scanner. indium- 113 m DTPA was evaluated {{as a possible}} radionuclide marker for a test meal and {{was found to be}} satisfactory. Tecluietium 99 - 1 t DTPA was subsequently assessed in similar studies with a gamma camera. It also proved satisfactory, although it differed from the indium compound in being substantially adsorbed to the solid component of a mixed solid and liquid meal. To establish the reproducibility of the gamma camera method, repeated measurements were carried out and in studies with saline test meals, comparison was made with measurements based on aspiration of gastric contents. Recognition of the marked differences between gastric emptying of solids and liquids led to the development and validation of a double isotope method for simultaneous study of solid and liquid components of a test meal. This method was then applied to the study of patients who had undergone gastric surgery in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} emptying abnormalities consequent upon gastric surgery. Studies were also undertaken in diabetic patients with suspected gastric stasis due to autonomic neuropathy. The effects of metoclopramide therapy for such patients were examined. Studies of the histamine E^ receptor antagonists, inetiamide and eimetidino were undertaken to determine whether they had any effect on gastric emptying. No clinically significant effect was detected. Gastric emptying was found to be a major regulator of the rate of absorption of orally administered paracetamol. Pharmacological modification of gastric emptying, namely acceleration "by metoclopramide and inhibition by propantheline or by narcotic analgesics was associated with corresponding changes in paracetamol absorption. The absorption of orally administered paracetamol was also delayed by the gel fibres pectin and guar, which delay gastric emptying. Scintigraphic measurements of gastric emptying are not free from experimental error. Measurement of the errors due to count attenuation by tissues demonstrated the superiority of bilateral detection over unilateral detection, especially if relatively low energy gamma emitting radionuclides are being used.

To reap these benefits, the technologist must have a thorough working knowledge of the tomop/anes. This allows him to distribute the planes throughout the organ being scanned in a fashion that best utilizes tomographic imaging and optimizes re. solution. In working with the new breed of <b>rectilinear</b> <b>scanner</b> with tomographic multiplane imaging capabilities, the technologist needs to distribute the tomoplanes (focal planes) accurately and evenly throughout the organ being scanned. This paper discusses ways of best utilizing tomographic planes and optimizing resolution between them. Methods and Materials The Searle Pho / Con tomographic multi plane scanner produces six images per detector on a transparency film. Each image represents a selected tomoplane. These six tomoplanes are evenly spaced, three above and three below the geometric focal plane (Fig. I). Gamma emissions occurring in a given tomoplane are recorded as sharply focused dots. Emissions from all other planes are recorded as blurred points of much lower intensity. The space between tomoplanes, the total spread of the six tomoplanes, and their distance {{from the face of the}} collimator vary depending on format size, collimator used, and setting of the tomographic selector. Ideally, the tomographic planes should be evenly spaced throughout the organ being scanned. Tomoplanes should not be uselessly spaced outside the organ or needlessly overlap in the organ, thereby leaving other areas unexamined (Fig. 2).
