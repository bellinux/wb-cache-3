However, many times heavy programing knowledge and/or a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) or APIs separate a library’s data from making a <b>new</b> <b>titles</b> web page a reality. Without IT staff, a <b>new</b> <b>titles</b> page can become nearly impossible or not worth the effort. Here we will demonstrate how a small liberal arts college took its acquisition data and combined it with a Google Sheet, HTML, and a little JavaScript to create a <b>new</b> <b>titles</b> web page that was dynamic and engaging to its users...|$|R

In 2003, {{it was announced}} that Factor 5 was working on a GameCube incarnation of the Pilotwings series. Development was moved to Nintendo's Wii console shortly thereafter. However, an anonymous blogger claimed in late 2009 that Factor 5 had indeed finished working on it, but that Nintendo was not confident in publishing it. Nintendo finally announced a <b>new</b> <b>title</b> in the series, the Nintendo 3DS title Pilotwings Resort, at E3 2010.

5|$|In ancient China, {{the rulers}} of the Shang (c. 1600 – c. 1050 BC) and Zhou (c. 1050 – 256 BC) dynasties were {{referred}} to as kings (王 wang). By {{the time of the}} Zhou dynasty, they were also referred to as Sons of Heaven (天子 Tianzi). By 221 BC, the King of Qin, Ying Zheng, conquered and united all the Warring States of ancient China. To elevate himself above the Shang and Zhou kings of old, he accepted the <b>new</b> <b>title</b> of emperor (皇帝 huangdi) and is known to posterity as the First Emperor of Qin (Qin Shi Huang). The <b>new</b> <b>title</b> of emperor was created by combining the titles for the Three Sovereigns (Sanhuang) and Five Emperors (Wudi) from Chinese mythology. This title was used by each successive ruler of China until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911.|$|E

5|$|Conker the Squirrel {{also had}} its own game. Originally named Conker's Quest, the title was renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64. However, the <b>new</b> <b>title</b> was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Edward II gave Wallingford Castle {{first to}} his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, {{and then to}} his young wife, Isabella of France, with large sums still being spent on the property. Edward {{continued}} to use the castle as a royal prison for holding his enemies, until his own fall from power in 1326; Isabella, who overthrew her husband, then used it as an early headquarters following her invasion of England. Her son, Edward III, ultimately settled the castle on the <b>new</b> <b>title</b> of the Duke of Cornwall, used by sons of the king.|$|E

The <b>new</b> <b>title</b> for the game was derived from the Emerald Nuts brand owned by the game's primary sponsor, Diamond Foods.

5|$|Following {{in a long}} {{tradition}} of all-American teenager Archie Andrews meeting unusual celebrities and pop culture icons, this comic book shows him meeting the galaxy's deadliest hunter, the Predator. The idea was first suggested in the Archie office and then proposed to Dark Horse, who holds the license to comics featuring the Predator character owned by 20th Century Fox. The companies paired de Campi, a horror writer at Dark Horse, with Ruiz, a regular Archie artist. When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the <b>new</b> <b>title</b> was not a joke.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it {{was decided}} to make Type-0 a PSP exclusive, {{cancelling}} the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed Crisis Core, but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on The 3rd Birthday. Because of these conflicting projects, Type-0 came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was Final Fantasy Live, referring to the game's multiplayer element. The <b>new</b> <b>title,</b> Final Fantasy Type-0, was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the <b>new</b> <b>title</b> at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, Telltale Games {{renamed the}} game from its initial release title of Sam & Max: Season One to Sam & Max Save the World. Telltale's public {{relations}} spokeswoman, Emily Morganti, explained that while Season One was thought to communicate the game's episodic nature to potential consumers, the company {{felt that it was}} nondescript in relation to the game's story. The message accompanied the announcement of an Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which had been subject to media speculation since February 2007. Both Windows and Wii versions of the game are to be republished using the <b>new</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
