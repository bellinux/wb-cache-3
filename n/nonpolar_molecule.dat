40|$|In this work, the {{interactions}} of a well-studied hydrophobin with different types of nonpolar model substances {{and their impact on}} primary gushing is evaluated. The nature, length, and degree of saturation of <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecules</b> are key parameters defining the gushing ability or inhibition. When mixed with hydrophobins, the nonpolar molecule-hydrophobin assembly acts as a less gushing or no gushing system. This effect can be explained in the framework of a competition effect between non-polar systems and CO 2 to interact with the hydrophobic patch of the hydrophobin. Interactions of these molecules with hydrophobins are promoted {{as a result of the}} similar size of the <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecules</b> with the hydrophobic patch of the protein, at the expense of the formation of nanobubbles with CO 2. In order to prove the presence of interactions and to unravel the mechanisms behind them, a complete set of experimental techniques was used. Surface sensitive techniques clearly show the presence of {{the interactions}}, whose nature is not covalent nor hydrogen bonding according to infrared spectroscopy results. Interactions were also reflected by particle size analysis in which mixtures of particles displayed larger size than their pure component counterparts.

5000|$|Sphingomyelin, as well {{as other}} sphingolipids, are {{associated}} with lipid microdomains in the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are characterized by the lipid molecules being in the lipid ordered phase, offering more structure and rigidity compared {{to the rest of the}} plasma membrane. In the rafts, the acyl chains have low chain motion but the molecules have high lateral mobility. This order is in part due to the higher transition temperature of sphingolipids {{as well as}} the interactions of these lipids with cholesterol. Cholesterol is a relatively small, <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> that can fill the space between the sphingolipids that is a result of the large acyl chains. Lipid rafts are thought to be involved in many cell processes, such as membrane sorting and trafficking, signal transduction, and cell polarization. Excessive sphingomyelin in lipid rafts may lead to insulin resistance.|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} polymer electrode membrane {{fuel cells}} that use hydrocarbon as the fuel have many theoretical advantages over those that use hydrogen. For example, nonprecious metal catalysts can replace platinum. In this work, {{two of the}} four propane fuel cell reactions, propane dehydrogenation and water dissociation, were examined using nickel alloy catalysts. The adsorption energies of both propane and water decreased as the Fe content of Ni/Fe alloys increased. In contrast, they both increased as the Cu content of Ni/Cu alloys increased. The activation energy for the dehydrogenation of propane (a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule)</b> changed very little, even though the adsorption energy changed substantially as a function of alloy composition. In contrast, the activation energy for dissociation of water (a molecule that can be polarized) decreased markedly as the energy of adsorption decreased. The different relationship between activation energy and adsorption energy for propane dehydrogenation and water dissociation alloys was attributed to propane being a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> and water being a molecule that can be polarized...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} volume {{fluctuation}} is calculated for two simple geometrical models of globular protein molecules {{subjected to a}} potential that {{is proportional to the}} surface area freshly generated by the thermal breathing motion. The proportionality constant, gamma, has the unit of surface tension. The calculated values are compared with estimates made from the compressibility measurements. After an approximate correction for the hydration effect, the experimental values are found to be between those calculated by using gamma values of 25 and 46 cal/mol/A 2 (1 cal = 4. 184 J). These values bracket previously reported independent estimates of interfacial tension that presumably operates at the interface between a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> and water. This result appears to indicate that the solvent water plays a significant role in determining the extent of volume fluctuation of globular proteins and that the concept, and the actual value of the estimate, of the interfacial tension around a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> in water may, in fact, be useful in some applications...|$|E

40|$|We have {{undertaken}} fundamental studies {{that characterize the}} important interactions of adsorbates on organic solids. Model substrates were prepared by the molecular self-assembly of organosulfur compounds of the general structure [S(CH 2) n-X] 2 (n = 15 - 19, X=CH 3, CONH 2, CO 2 H, etc.) on a Au(111) single crystal surface. The adsorption of both polar and <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecules</b> on top of these model surfaces was studied. The bonding of <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecules</b> is dominated by dispersive forces and is weak in all cases. In contrast to this behavior, polar molecules, which interact weakly with the nonpolar surfaces, bond much more strongly to the polar materials. Our results also suggest an important role for structural transformations in the adsorbed overlayer in these latter cases. The potential relevance of these microscopic observations to important macroscopic properties such as wetting is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} enthalpy or entropy change upon transfer {{of a small}} <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> from a nonaqueous phase into water at a given temperature is generally different for different solute species. However, if the heat capacity change is independent of temperature, there exists a temperature at which the enthalpy or the entropy change becomes {{the same for all}} solute species within a given class. Similarly, the enthalpy or the entropy change of protein denaturation, when extrapolated to high temperature assuming a temperature-independent heat capacity change, shows a temperature at which its value becomes the same for many different globular proteins on a per weight basis. It is shown that the existence of these temperatures can be explained from a common formalism based on a linear relationship between the thermodynamic quantity and a temperature-independent molecular property that characterizes the solute or the protein. For the small <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> transfer processes, this property is the surface area or the number of groups that are brought in contact with water. For protein denaturation, it is suggested that this property measures the polar/nonpolar mix of the internal interaction within the protein interior. Under a certain set of assumptions, this model leads {{to the conclusion that the}} nonpolar and the polar groups of the protein contribute roughly equally to the stability of the folded state of the molecule and that the solvent-accessible surface area of the denatured form of a protein is no more than about two-thirds that of the fully extended form...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to describe the development, construction and use of a new tool for optical coherent transient spectroscopy. The new tool is a frequency-switched CO₂ laser. A highly stable laser design was modified to include an intra cavity electro-optic modulator, which al lows {{the output of the}} laser to be frequency-switched. The frequency modulated output is used in spectroscopic experiments whose goals are the determination of decay rates for infrared moIecuIar transitions. The use of a frequency-switched laser is the most prom i sing means of making such measurements on nonpoIar molecules. The use of an electro-optic crystal inside a laser cavity introduces a number of fundamental problems which must be overcome before the instrument {{can be used to make}} useful spectroscopic measurements. These problems are brought about by the need for a stable laser amplitude and frequency output. The development of a novel stabilization technique to overcome these problems is documented in this thesis. Also included in this thesis is a description of the microcomputer and associated electronics necessary to integrate the laser into an experimental apparatus capable of performing signal averaging and background subtraction on raw time resolved data.

Nonpolar molecules have so far escaped direct experimental investigations because of their poor sensitivity to several external constraints.

Here we show that the sticking probability of ethylene, a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> prototypical of unsaturated hydrocarbons, on an O- 2 -precovered Ag(001) surface is larger for molecules approaching in a helicopterlike motion than for those cartwheeling.

However, CH 4 molecules entering the pore prefer {{to stay in the}} channel with few molecules passing into the offside vacuum box, especially the channel of 0.728  nm, indicating an optimal CH 4 -adsorbed pore of 0.728  nm. As a lightweight <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule,</b> the main interaction of H 2 with graphene sheets is the weak Van der Waals terms. Therefore, H 2 molecules could easily pass through the membrane without accumulation in the channel, and the H 2 permeability is proportional to the width of the channel (active surface area). For CH 4 molecules, the strong electrostatic interaction with graphene sheets results in the packing of methane in the channel.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the temperature {{effect on the}} structural and dynamical properties (translation, rotation) of an urea/water system at 0. 20 mole fraction of urea. We report the radial distribution functions of like and unlike molecules and conclude that, even at large distances, these molecules are spatially correlated (with respect to their centers of mass). This behavior is interpreted as an indication that urea molecules are not uniformly distributed at a microscopic level. However, the orientational distribution shows that, at long distances, the urea molecules are not orientationally correlated. A strong correlation between urea molecules is observed within the first-shells of neighboring molecules. In view of these results, it is postulated that urea behaves slightly like a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule.</b> The dynamical properties were analyzed using the velocity (translation) and angular velocity (rotation) time autocorrelation functions, {{as well as their}} Fourier transforms.

An explicit equation for the Helmholtz free energy of the pore phase binary fluid mixture is derived. The proposed model is used to simulate the selective sorption of ethane from an ethane-methane mixture and water from a methanol-water mixture in the slit-pore. The simulated results are interpreted by studying the relative contributions of fluid-wall and fluid-fluid interactions. Finally, simulation results obtained are compared with the results of existing models and molecular simulations in the literature...|$|R

It is well established that the transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase of a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> is governed by the balance between the work expended to create a suitable cavity in the solvent, ¢Gc, and the work needed to turn on the solute-solvent attractive interactions, ¢Ga. 6 - 11 The first term is a large positive quantity that contrasts the transfer in all solvents.

40|$|The {{solubility}} of gases is {{an important}} issue in the industries. Carbon Dioxide Through gas transmission line exists as sour gas therefore it is eliminated by solvent in industry. Carbone Dioxide is <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> that has lower solubility in liquid solvent.

A laboratory unit was made for this experience and the solubility of CO 2 was reported.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of squalene with liposomes and monolayers of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPL) {{has been studied}} by differential scanning calorimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and surface potential measurements. Mole ratios of squalene to DPL up to 9 to 1 were studied. In contrast to small, nonpolar molecules, which profoundly influence the structure of lipid bilayers as detected by changes in both their thermodynamic phase transition parameters and membrane fluidity, this large, nonpolar, linear hydrocarbon is devoid of such influences. It is clear from our data that a large <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecule</b> such as squalene, having no polar group that might anchor it to the aqueous interface, cannot intercalate between the acyl chains either below or above the phase transition of DPL. This behavior is not compatible with models that treat the bilayer interior as a bulk hydrocarbon, and suggests that great caution should be exercised in extrapolating partition coefficients based on bulk hydrocarbon measurements to lipid bilayers...|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Hofmeister series is not entirely clear, but seems to result mainly from effects on the solvent at higher salt concentrations (> 100 mM). Early members of the series increase solvent surface tension and decrease the solubility of <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecules</b> (salt out); in effect, they strengthen the hydrophobic interaction. By contrast, later salts in the series increase the solubility of <b>nonpolar</b> <b>molecules</b> (salt in) and decrease the order in water; in effect, they weaken the hydrophobic effect. However, these salts also interact directly with proteins (which are charged and have strong dipole moments) and may even bind specifically (e.g., phosphate and sulfate binding to ribonuclease A). Ions that have a strong salting in effect such as I− and SCN− are strong denaturants, because they salt in the peptide group, and thus interact much more strongly with the unfolded form of a protein than with its native form. Consequently, they pull the unfolding reaction. Moreover, they may have direct interactions with some standard hydrophobic molecules, e.g., benzene.|$|R
