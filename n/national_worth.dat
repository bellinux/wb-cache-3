40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{intersection}} of indigeneity and modernity in early-twentieth-century North America by examining Native Americans in competitive running arenas in both domestic and international settings. Historians have analyzed sports to understand central facets of this intersection, including race, gender, nationalism, assimilation, and resistance. But running, specifically, embodies what was both indigenous and modern, a symbol of both racial and <b>national</b> <b>worth</b> {{at a time when}} those categories coexisted uneasily. The narrative follows one main case study: the “Redwood Highway Indian Marathon,” a 480 -mile footrace from San Francisco, California, to Grants Pass, Oregon, contested between Native Americans from Northern California and New Mexico in 1927 and 1928. That race and others reveal how indigenous runners asserted both Native and modern American/Canadian/Mexican identities through sport, how mainstream societies understood modern indigenous people, and to what extent those societies embraced images of “Indianness” in regional and national identities, economies, and cultures...|$|E
40|$|The thesis focuses upon China as {{one example}} of a non-European culture which might merit fuller {{consideration}} in British school curricula. Five principal questions are addressed. First, should Chinese history be taught in schools? Second, has it been neglected hitherto? Third, can the reasons for neglect be identified? Fourth, could Chinese history be taught in schools, and how might it be approached? Fifth, are there adequate resources for teacher and pupil use? All five are answered in the affirmative. Teaching Chinese history is shown to be justified on grounds of intrinsic interest and importance and educational potential. Nonetheless, a study of schoolbooks, history teaching handbooks and reports, theses, journal articles, school inspectoral reports and the recollections of teachers and advisors suggests that Chinese history has suffered serious neglect in schools. The principal reason behind that neglect is shown to be the theory of historical progress, euro- and Anglo-dominated, and concentration in historical education upon the evidence for and narrative detail of that progress, particularly its constitutional and political features, in pursuit of moral and civic education. The influence of major official and semi-official bodies is noted, as is that of the New History movement of recent years. It is suggested, however, that the pattern has also reflected deep-rooted assumptions as to <b>national</b> <b>worth</b> and superiority and acceptance of a range of ethnic, national and racial stereotypes. The role of the popular media is discussed. Foreign influences are considered. With regard to the fourth and fifth questions, it is argued that Chinese history could be introduced to school curricula but that such development demands a broader world-historical framework. In addition, it must capitalise on the move in recent years towards resource-based evidential learning. The importance of the teacher in stressed, and books on Chinese history and civilisation which a non orientalist could draw upon are suggested. Aspects of Chinese history which might be studied in schools, and the relevant adult literature, are considered. Finally, available books and materials suitable for children's use are recommended...|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{regional}} {{languages and}} dialects {{were thought to}} limit the intellectual ability of their speakers.

40|$|Current anti-poverty policy {{proposals}} {{focus on}} welfare reform {{to the exclusion of}} reforming the low-wage labor market. In contrast, we compare two policy proposals aimed at low-wage labor markets: a <b>national</b> comparable <b>worth</b> policy and an {{increase in the minimum wage}}. With both policies we pay specific attention to their impact by gender. Our findings suggest that while both would reduce poverty among working women, the impact of a comparable worth policy on female poverty would be greater under most scenarios presented. It is estimated that an increase of 96 cents per hour in the national minimum wage would be necessary to equal the poverty reduction effect for women workers of a comparable worth policy which excludes small employers. Both policies decrease the incidence of povertylevel wages less among men, since roughly 60 percent of minimum wage workers are women. Additionally, not only would a <b>national</b> comparable <b>worth</b> policy improve the economic status of low-waged women workers, it would also narrow the gap between male and female poverty. While an increase in the minimum wage would also reduce this gap, comparable worth would virtually eliminate it.
