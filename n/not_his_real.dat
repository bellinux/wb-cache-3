On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

Gainey watches every episode of the series, but admits to not knowing what is happening much of the time. In his first appearance, in the season one finale [...] "Exodus: Part 2", Gainey was credited as [...] "bearded man", and was lovingly called [...] "Gay Tom" [...] in season 4. then in his season two appearances as [...] "Mr. Friendly". In the Official Lost Podcast, Damon Lindelof confirmed Mr. Friendly is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> name, but is how the producers refer to him internally, because [...] "he's so friendly"; however, his surname was later suggested to actually be Friendly during Comic-Con 2009.

More recently Darren's storylines have seen him form a relationship with Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) that [...] "came out of nowhere" [...] but was kept long term as the pairing was popular with the serial's audience.
