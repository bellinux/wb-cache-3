40|$|Eleven {{wool and}} silk {{historic}} textiles and two modern artist's canvases were examined {{to determine their}} water vapour adsorption, moisture dimensional response and tensile behaviour. All the textiles showed a similar general pattern of moisture response. A rise in ambient relative humidity (RH) from dry conditions produced expansion of a textile until a certain critical RH level after which a contraction occurred {{to a greater or}} lesser degree depending on the yarn crimp and the weave geometry. The largest expansion recorded between the dry state and 80 % RH was 1. 2 and 0. 9 % for wool and silk textiles, respectively. The largest shrinkage of 0. 8 % at high RH range was experienced by a modern linen canvas. Two potential damage mechanisms related to the moisture response of the textiles-stress building as a result of shrinkage of the textile restrained in its dimensional response and the fretting fatigue when yarns move with friction one against another-were found insignificant in typical <b>textile</b> <b>display</b> environments unless the textiles are severely degraded or excessively strained in their mounting...|$|R

40|$|The {{interconnection}} {{of electronics}} and textile circuits {{is still a}} main challenge for the fabrication of reliable smart textiles. This paper investigates the thermoplastic adhesive bonding technology. Electronic modules are bonded to textile substrates with a thermoplastic nonconductive adhesive (NCA) film. The modules are placed onto textile circuits with an NCA-film inbetween. By applying pressure and heat, the adhesive melts and contact partners touch. Subsequently cooling solidifies the NCA resulting in an electrical and mechanical contact of the electronic module and the textile circuit. This paper shows the suitability of this technology for knitted, woven, non-woven and embroidered fabrics with metal coated yarns {{as well as with}} litzwires as conductors. Besides, it shows that the interconnection process works well with thermoplastically insulated conductors. In addition, the design of interposers has been improved in respect to contact formation and miniaturization compared to previous publications. The pitch of the contact pads is set to 1. 27 mm.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interactive}} {{graphical user interface}} for <b>textile</b> <b>displays.</b> While electronic displays are emerging {{in a variety of}} domains their interfaces have not kept pace with their use. Our work has resulted in an intuitive interface on cloth, a common surface present in numerous user settings, including a wide variety of medical settings. In addition to using cloth as a display mechanism, our interface allows interaction with the interface, by direct manipulation of the cloth. Interaction gestures flow from the cloth metaphor, and include natural actions such as pinching and stretching the cloth surface, as well as more traditional interactions such as touch. We discuss the design and development process behind creating our prototype interface, and treat in significant detail the development of our gestured interactions. We go on to describe applications for our system, which include applications for every-day users, as well as expert users in the medical domain. Finally we include user feedback on our interface, and with this feedback we discuss our conclusions and examine areas for future work. i Acknowledgments This work {{would not have been possible}} without my father, who got me started, and my mother, who kept me going.

50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung {{on a wire rack}} connected to tracks that are suspended from channels on the floor and ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for <b>textile</b> <b>display</b> or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} changing {{attitudes towards}} <b>textiles</b> and their <b>displays</b> in museum collections. As a curator of textiles {{who has worked}} in two major university museums, at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the Yale University Art Gallery, over a stretch of more than twenty years, I document a change in attitude to textile history and collections. Much of it is positive, as textiles have moved from a Cinderella role into a position where they are taken seriously both in art and social history. The two museums mentioned above were recently the subjects of dramatic building projects, and I was involved in both renovations. At the Ashmolean I curated a new Textile Gallery {{that for the first time}} ever had displayed a selection of the Museum’s significant textile collection. At Yale my brief as the inaugural curator of a new Department of Indo-Pacific Art meant that the important collection of Indonesian textiles had to be given a prominent place in the new gallery space. The paper follows two strands of analysis and interpretation. One is chronological, presenting the shift in attitude towards <b>textile</b> <b>displays</b> over the years, both in the choice of context and the suggested ranking of textiles in the overall museum display. The second one looks at the role of textiles in museums that do not primarily focus on the history or ethnographic context of objects, but want to see them first of all as art, as objects with a strong aesthetic value. This can create a tension between factual and perceived interpretation, which should be of concern especially for university museums where teaching from the collections is a declared goal. As this addresses the issue of how to cross cultural barriers of understanding, I consider this to be of particular relevance...|$|R

As the shapes, forms, and functions of the electronic landscape rapidly evolve, fabrication and prototyping methods need {{to keep up with the}} changing needs as well. This dissertation contributes concepts and techniques that answer two research questions: 1. What type of prototyping processes and tools could support the rapidly evolving field of interactive technology? 2. How can these prototyping processes and tools be selected to add value to the broader community - one that includes engineers, designers, and hobbyists? In this thesis, I will demonstrate that by using concepts inspired by various advanced manufacturing fields - such as MEMS, structural electronics, and flexible electronics - novel interaction modalities can be prototyped with commercially accessible materials. Electronics presented in this dissertation include circuit boards with mechanically functional shapes, non-emissive <b>textile</b> <b>displays,</b> and on-skin electronic devices. Moreover, this thesis also describes a web-based digital tool that allows users to free-form sketch basic circuits and also provides step-by-step fabrication and debugging guidance. Using this tool, users will be able to sketch, design, and prototype electronics with materials such as silver/graphite pen, conductive thread, paper, and fabric.

40|$|Development of a {{versatile}} method for incorporating conductive materials into textiles could enable advances in wearable electronics and smart textiles. One area {{of critical importance}} is the detection of chemicals in the environment for security and industrial process monitoring. Here, the fabrication of a flexible, sensor material based on functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) films on a porous electrospun fiber mat for real-time detection of a nerve agent simulant is reported. The material is constructed by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of MWNTs with opposite charges, creating multilayer films of MWNTs without binder. The vacuum-assisted spray-LbL process enables conformal coatings of nanostructured MWNT films on individual electrospun fibers throughout {{the bulk of the}} mat with controlled loading and electrical conductivity. A thiourea-based receptor is covalently attached to the primary amine groups on the MWNT films to enhance the sensing response to dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a simulant for sarin nerve agent. Chemiresistive sensors based on the engineered <b>textiles</b> <b>display</b> reversible responses and detection limits for DMMP as low as 10 ppb in the aqueous phase and 5 ppm in the vapor phase.
