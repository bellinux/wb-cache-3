5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was <b>noticed</b> <b>by</b> some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|Baggio {{began his}} youth career after being <b>noticed</b> <b>by</b> his {{hometown}} youth team, Caldogno, at age nine.

The following year, with the American Revolutionary War underway, Curtis was promoted to commander and given the sloop HMS Senegal.

5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation would likely have been <b>noticed</b> <b>by</b> the pope.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} into a {{military}} landowning family from the south of the Russian Empire, and followed the family tradition by entering the army.

Olga wanted to divorce her first husband, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, and marry Kulikovsky, but neither her husband nor her brother, the Tsar, would allow it.|$|E

5|$|Homology was <b>noticed</b> <b>by</b> Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was {{explicitly}} analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 Book of Birds, {{where he}} systematically compared the skeletons {{of birds and}} humans.

5|$|Jack Verge went to Sydney University in 1900 and for {{the first}} two years played fullback for the University second rugby team.

5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be <b>noticed</b> <b>by</b> women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
