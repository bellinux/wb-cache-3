It {{is a mixture}} of ammonium salts of cresol, phenol and various <b>nitrocresols</b> and nitrophenols principally trinitrocresol and picric acid.

40|$|Three toluene oxides {{reacted with}} {{nitrogen}} dioxide in air to give <b>nitrocresols.</b> 1 -Methylbenzene oxide (1) and 3 -methylbenzene oxide (2) gave the same <b>nitrocresols,</b> including 2 -methyl- 6 -nitrophenol (1 b) and 2 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenol (1 c), while 4 -methylbenzene oxide (3) gave only 4 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol (3 b). Irradiation with a xenon lamp through a Pyrex filter (cut-off below 290 nm) {{did not affect}} the product distribution. Only 1 -methylbenzene oxide (1) generated fog when it was brought into contact with nitrogen dioxide in air...|$|E
40|$|From {{some years}} ahead, the {{automatic}} analyzing system with GC-FID and GC-ECD {{has been studied}} and many air samples relating with hydrocarbons or halocarbons could be analyzed with success. So that，as a next technical step, it was considered that the automatic analyzing system with GC/MS-SIM was devised and {{was applied to the}} measurement of aldehyde, phenol or so on in the atmosphere. In this paper, the equipment, the analytical conditions and some field tests were illustrated. These processes were as follows : the concentration tube was 28 cm x 3 mmφ glass tube filled with Tenax-GC. The pollutants in 4. 6 l air sample were adsorbed, then desorbed by heating to 200 ℃ and introduced to the GC/MS fitting tocapillary column and QMS detector. One cycle of measurement was set up within 60 min and in this condition the detection limit about 0. 01 ppb. By selecting m/z to 94, 105, 108, 146 or 153, the derivatives from aromatics, such as phenol, benzaldehyde, cresols, dichlorobenzene and <b>nitrocresols</b> were automatically analyzed. It will be noticed that this system is a basic analytical technique for the many toxic pollutants of low concentration in the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{nitration}} of m- and p-cresol {{was investigated}} under mild reaction conditions {{in a number}} of solvents; the effects of certain nitration catalysts were also evaluated. These different reaction parameters were evaluated in terms of their effect on a number of important reaction responses. Other important factors that were investigated were the manipulation of the isomer ratios by changing reaction parameters, as well as important process chemistry information, such as product distribution, isolation and purification, identification of side products formed, and evaluation of the heat of reaction. Use was made of an experimental design system to evaluate the effect of reaction parameters on the chosen design responses. It was found that the ratio of para to ortho <b>nitrocresol</b> products could be influenced slightly by using low concentrations of nitric acid and low reaction temperatures. A different mechanism for the formation of 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (from mcresol nitration) was proposed (compared with that previously reported), which could explain a “one mole nitric acid” pathway and the fact that only the pbenzoquinone isomer was observed. Reaction side products were identified and found to consist of dimers of cresol and <b>nitrocresol,</b> which were probably the result of oxidation of the cresol, subsequent formation of a quinomethide intermediate and reaction with either the product or the substrate. The heat of nitration was determined for various reaction systems and found to be governed by two factors, namely the actual nitration process and also an oxidation process, which is responsible for the formation of side products...|$|R
30|$|The {{wastewater}} {{produced from}} Karoon petrochemical plant in Iran contains ortho-toluidine, nitrobenzene, <b>nitrocresol,</b> phenol derivatives and other aromatic compounds. Definite amounts of aromatic components are lost during {{a process which}} holds {{a wide range of}} non-biodegradable chemicals that cause environmental pollution. The phenol derivatives are toxic and bio-refractory pollutant in petrochemical wastewater which can be a source of major harm to the environment and human health [1]. Based on the environmental protection agency, the permissible limit of nitrophenols in aqueous solution is 1  mg/L. The remediation of wastewaters polluted with nitrophenols by traditional methods is really difficult, has high operational costs, secondary contamination and a long reaction time; subsequently, phenol derivatives are resistant according to their high solubility and stability in water [2]. Therefore, employing new methods for the treatment of the wastewater containing these pollutants without these problems is essential.|$|R
40|$|Cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (1 × 106 cells/mL) were {{incubated}} with 5. 0 μg/mL of the insecticide fenitrothion, (FEN), (O,O-dimethyl-O-(3 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenyl) phosphorothioate). The rate of abiotic fenitrothion degradation in Gorman and Levign {{growth medium}} (pH = 6. 8, T = 21 ∘C, Vita Lite 40 w/m 2), was enhanced 9 -fold {{in the light}} relative to the dark under abiotic conditions (T 1 / 2 values of 145 h (light) and 54 days (dark)). Endogenous metabolism by C. reinhardtii produced significant amounts of 3 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenol (<b>nitrocresol),</b> demethyl fenitrothion, formyl fenitrothion, hydroxymethyl fenitrothion, and carboxyfenitrothion within the cells. This biodegradation was slower in the dark than in the light. Studies of algal biodegradation of fenitrothion {{in the presence of}} 5. 0 μg/mL fenitrothion plus 23. 2 μg/mL phenobarbital, (a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase inducer), demonstrated a 10 fold increase in the levels of intracellular hydroxymethyl fenitrothion relative to control algal cultures. It was concluded from this study that degradation of fenitrothion by metabolic activity of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase may be a significant determinant in fenitrothion degradation in C. reinhardtii cultures. The amounts of formyl fenitrothion, carboxy fenitrothion and, carboxyfenitrooxon were demonstrated to depend on the availability of intracellular hydroxymethyl fenitrothion pool produced by algal PSMO activity, while NC and DSM levels were attributable to other cellular enzymes.

40|$|Leachate, ground-, {{and surface}} water from former {{ammunition}} sites and areas which {{are known to}} be contaminated by nitroaromatic compounds in Lower Saxony (Germany) were investigated in order to identify and quantify acidic nitroaromatic compounds (e. g., nitrobenzoic acids, aminonitrobenzoic acids, nitrophenols, and <b>nitrocresols).</b> Acidic and neutral nitroaromatic compounds were enriched by solid-phase extraction (SPE) on a polystyrenedivinylbenzene copolymer and routinely screened for acidic compounds by means of HPLC/photodiode array detection (HPLC/PDA). Qualitative and quantitative results obtained in this way were corroborated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR). Validation data for the quantification procedure using this technique are given. The results show that all samples contaminated with 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and related compounds are also contaminated by acidic nitroaromatic compounds (e. g., 2, 4 -dinitrobenzoic acid, 3, 5 -dinitrophenol, and especially with 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrobenzoic acid) in the g/L range. This current work shows that 1 H-NMR allows the quantitative determination of protoncarrying analytes in mixtures after solid-phase extraction down to the upper ng/L range after addition of an internal standard to the SPE extract. This is even possible when reference compounds are not commercially available...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the summer}} in 1970, when the {{photochemical}} smog took place in Japan, a number of persons concerned have been studying to explain this phenomenon. But {{it is still the}} most important problem that the cause of the heavy damage, such as dizziness, numb, spasm, was not solved by a formal smog theory. The authers thought that a new phenomenon would be caused by a new condition, which was probably caused by the high concentrated existence of aromatics in exhaust gas and in the environment. Then besides the study to discover enviromental toxicants, the photochemical reactions of aromatics were mainly examined. This paper contains the results until now, Some new results are as follows: most aromatics react as fast as olefines do, and concern the ozone formations. Xylenes and Toluene are important. These reactions are the cleavage of aromatic ring, the oxidation of side chain, the nitration and hydroxidation of benzene ring and the displacement of these functional groups. The remarkable compounds due to photochemical reaction were acrolein, acetone, methyl nitrate, nitrophenois, <b>nitrocresols</b> dinitrocresols, etc. It seems interesting that these nitroaromatics have the same physiologlcal effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to provide a}} {{scientific}} evaluation of the atmospheric fate of aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular, 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzenes and nitrophenols, which are important products in the oxidation of BTX. The data obtained within the present work will help to improve the knowledge on the atmospheric degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons.       The rate coefficients of the OH and NO 3 radical initiated oxidation of some nitro/hydroxy substituted monoaromatic hydrocarbons improve the kinetic data base required to model the degradation mechanisms of aromatic compounds and to develop structure reactivity relationships for OH and NO 3 radical with VOCs.       Relative rate coefficients have been measured for the first time for the reactions of NO 3 radicals with 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene, 3 -methyl- 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene and 4 -methyl- 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene. The investigations were performed in two chambers: the 1080 l quartz glass reactor in Wuppertal and in the EUPHORE chambers in Valencia at 1000 mbar total pressure and 298 ± 3 K. The following rate coefficients were obtained:     reactant     k NO 3 (cm 3 s - 1)   1, 2 - dihydroxybenzene     (9. 80 ± 5. 0) × 10 - 11 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylbenzene     (17. 2 ± 5. 6) × 10 - 11 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylbenzene     (14. 7 ± 6. 5) × 10 - 11       This work has provided rate coefficients for the gas phase reactions of the OH radical with a series of methylated 2 -nitrophenols (2 -nitrocresols). The following rate coefficients were obtained at 1000 mbar total pressure and 298 ± 3 K in the 1080 l quartz glass reactor:     reactant     k OH (cm 3 s - 1)   3 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol     (3. 69 ± 0. 16) × 10 - 12 4 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol     (3. 46 ± 0. 18) × 10 - 12 5 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol     (7. 34 ± 0. 52) × 10 - 12 6 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol     (2. 70 ± 0. 17) × 10 - 12       Photolysis rates for the 2 -nitrocresol isomers have also been determined. All the <b>nitrocresols</b> under investigation have a photolysis lifetime of less than 1 h. The results from this work have shown that photolysis will be the dominant gas-phase loss process for the 2 -nitrocresols.       The photolysis of nitrophenols was found to be a new gas-phase source of HONO. Previously, no observations of nitrous acid formation from the gas-phase photolysis of nitrophenols had been reported in the literature. A series of detailed experiments were performed to ensure that the gas phase photolysis of the nitrophenols was the source of HONO, these included: variation of the S/V ratio of the reactors, variation of the light intensity, testing the influence of the buffer gas and tests for a possible mechanism involing reactions of gaseous NO 2. All the results were in line with gas-phase photolytic production of HONO from the nitrophenols.       Since a linear dependence of the HONO yield on the nitrophenol concentration was observed, the results obtained here have been extrapolated linearly to atmospheric concentrations. Based on the experimental data obtained for 3 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol a photolytic HONO formation rate in the atmosphere of 100 pptV h- 1 is estimated for a maximum J (NO 2) value of 10 - 2 s - 1 in the presence of 1 ppbV of nitrophenols. Based on the HONO formation yields, a general photolysis mechanism has been proposed.       The formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the photolysis of a series of nitrophenols was investigated for the first time. The effect of NO x and the presence of an OH radical scavenger on the aerosol formation were also investigated. Significant aerosol formation was observed for the nitrophenols investigated. For 2 -nitrophenol, the aerosol formation yield {{in the absence of an}} OH radical scavenger and NO x varied between 18 - 24 %. The gas-phase/aerosol partitioning was fitted assuming the presence of only one compound in both phases. A possible mechanism to explain the aerosol formation observed in the photolysis of nitrophenols is proposed...|$|E
