Velma is {{interested}} in keeping her daughter Amber in the spotlight and The Corny Collins Show segregated. Hairspray was the first film featuring Pfeiffer {{to be released in}} five years. Stardust, also featuring Pfeiffer, was shot before Hairspray, but released three weeks afterwards. The peculiarity of Pfeiffer and Travolta appearing onscreen together (Travolta starred in Grease, Pfeiffer in Grease 2) was <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> production staff; Travolta requested that Pfeiffer play the part of the villainess.|$|E
5|$|In 533, taking {{advantage}} of the absence of the Vandal fleet, sent to suppress a revolt in Sardinia, an army of 15,000 under Belisarius was transported to Africa by an invasion fleet of 92 dromons and 500 transports, beginning the Vandalic War, the first of the wars of reconquest of Emperor Justinian I (527–565). These were largely amphibious operations, made possible by the control of the Mediterranean waterways, and the fleet played a vital role in carrying supplies and reinforcements to the widely dispersed Byzantine expeditionary forces and garrisons. This fact was <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines' enemies. Already in the 520s, Theodoric had planned to build a massive fleet directed against the Byzantines and the Vandals, but his death in 526 limited {{the extent to which these}} plans were realized. In 535, the Gothic War began with a double-pronged Byzantine offensive, with a fleet again carrying Belisarius' army to Sicily and then Italy, and another army invading Dalmatia. Byzantine control of the sea was of great strategic importance, allowing the smaller Byzantine army to successfully occupy the peninsula by 540.|$|E

25|$|The Act was {{immediately}} recognised by the labourers, {{who for the}} first time held both active and passive electoral franchise, as a means to achieving their interests and facilitating those who desired to help them on local county councils.

25|$|The California Alien Land Law of 1913 did not employ any {{specific}} language targeting Japanese residents in America; nonetheless, {{they were the}} primary target. This was in part to appease the nervous California farmers who feared that the Japanese immigrants’ agricultural techniques (which developed out of the necessity to make as much use of small plots of land as possible) would render them unable to compete economically. The implicit intent of the law was <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Japanese; many American Japanese residents and even the Japanese government voiced their opposition.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1960s onwards, Kapuściński {{published}} books of increasing literary craftsmanship characterized by sophisticated narrative technique, psychological portraits of characters, {{a wealth of}} stylization and metaphor and unusual imagery that serves as means of interpreting the perceived world. Kapuściński's best-known book, The Emperor, concerns itself with the decline of Haile Selassie's anachronistic régime in Ethiopia. The book’s story had a special meaning that was <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> people of Poland, especially as dissent against the PZPR was taking root. The Emperor was also the book that established Kapuściński’s reputation in the West. When it appeared in English translation in 1983 it received an immediate critical success.|$|E

25|$|In 1739, {{conflict}} between Spain and Britain {{led to the}} War of Jenkins' Ear, followed in 1740-41 by the War of the Austrian Succession. The long-serving British Prime Minister Robert Walpole {{was forced to resign}} in February 1742 by an alliance of Tories and pro-war Patriot Whigs. The Whigs promptly did a deal keeping their Tory partners out of government. Fury at this led second-rank Tories like the Duke of Beaufort and Lord Barrymore to ask for French support in restoring the Stuarts to the British throne. The group of Scottish Jacobites known as the Association made a similar request but to put James on the throne of Scotland and dissolve the Union. These differences were <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French Chief Minister Cardinal Fleury who consistently viewed Jacobite claims with scepticism and ignored both requests.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the {{province}}'s public health care program was <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a hospital plan would receive 50 {{cents on the dollar}} from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall—also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice—to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system—the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan's model of public health insurance. In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. So, the adoption of health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals - Tommy Douglas, John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{historian}} Andrew Ralston, the Tron riot {{case was}} used to send a strong message about juvenile delinquency, and to deter other would-be offenders. In addition to the three who were sentenced to death, {{some of the more}} minor offenders of the riot received relatively harsh sentences for their crimes.

25|$|Concerned about Indonesian President Sukarno's {{communist}} leanings, the CIA started Operation Haik in 1958 {{to overthrow}} his Guided Democracy in Indonesia regime. The covert op committed {{at least a}} dozen B-26 Invaders in support of rebel forces. On 18 May 1958, American contract pilot Allen Pope's blacked-out B-26 was initially hit by anti-aircraft ground fire and then brought down by a North American P-51 Mustang flown by Capt. Ignatius Dewanto (the only known air-to-air kill {{in the history of the}} Indonesian Air Force). The capture and trial of Lieutenant Pope brought a quick end to Operation Haik, but the capabilities of the Invader were <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian government. In 1959, the government purchased six aircraft at Davis-Monthan AFB, which were ferried to Indonesia in full military markings during mid-1960. Utilized in a number of actions against rebels in various areas, these aircraft would go on to long follow-up careers. The last operational flights of three final survivors was in 1976, supporting the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. In 1977, the last two flying aircraft were retired.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher instituted {{economic}} policies reminiscent of Chamberlain's as Chancellor—control of inflation (even {{at the expense}} of unemployment), minimisation of budget deficits, and low rates of direct taxation. This was a point <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party, and the Trades Union Congress adopted a slogan of [...] "Forwards to the Eighties not Backwards to the Thirties". Thatcher's critics denigrated both her policies and those of the 1930s in such comparisons, but she did not care to defend those of the 1930s. Thatcher stated that the historical justifications for her economic positions were the policies of the Victorian era.|$|E

Kesselring responded by authorising the [...] "massive employment of artillery, grenade and mine throwers, armoured cars, flamethrowers and other technical combat equipment" [...] against the partisans. He also issued an order promising indemnity to soldiers who [...] "exceed our normal restraint".
