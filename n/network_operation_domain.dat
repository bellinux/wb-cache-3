40|$|At {{present the}} more {{intensive}} integration process of Baltic electrical networks into Scandinavian and European networks {{is going on}} advancing international cooperation {{in the majority of}} power systems diversifying networks service levels under electricity market conditions. Actually this basically relates to cooperation in control of power transmission grid and distribution network and its service rendering by involvement of qualified personnel enhancing motivation of professional skill level introducing innovative methods in training process. This is applicable to distribution <b>networks</b> <b>operation</b> and maintenance <b>domain</b> as personnel qualification promotion is a significant issue in energy sector. The results of Surveys conducted by Baltic companies involved in process revealed the issues similar to Baltic States and Finland in regard to human labour resources specialised on power lines service experience as lack of qualified personnel there. Thus now qualified personnel from Baltic States are highly demanded in Finnish market. Therefore Finland and Baltic States with the support of European Union Programme LeonardoDaVinci initiated DistributionCert project realisation, focused on elaboration of training lifelong learning programme based on multifunctional professional educational system of Finland...|$|R

30|$|The {{successively}} increasing {{scale of}} urban rail transit lines {{gives rise to}} a shift from a quantitative to qualitative focus in operation management. As a result, conventional operation management methods cannot satisfy the needs of <b>network</b> <b>operation</b> management. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and study system management methods and to take action from the viewpoint of urban development. This study systematically proposes the mechanisms of innovative <b>network</b> <b>operation</b> management, the creation of the management foundation of a <b>network</b> <b>operation</b> system and staff training, the planning, and preparation of <b>network</b> <b>operation</b> services with advanced capabilities, the strengthening of risk control and emergency system networks, the establishment of an evaluation system and a refined maintenance system to promote the operation of an equipment quality management network, the creation of a public relation crisis response system within the <b>operation</b> <b>network,</b> and improvements in the efficiency and level of operation management through the construction of an information-based operations system.|$|R

30|$|Urban {{rail transit}} {{operations}} have {{changed from a}} single line to a multiline <b>network.</b> The <b>network</b> <b>operations</b> have undergone quantitative and qualitative changes, and operations management is facing rapid internal and external changes. Using the Guangzhou Metro <b>network</b> <b>operation</b> practices as a case study, this paper first systematically analyzes {{the features of the}} operation scale, the proportion of urban mass transit, the surge in public demand, the security of the operational service capacity, reforms to the operation governance structure, the high-speed expansion of staff, and the development of knowledge and skills in urban mass transit networks. The paper then proposes several responses to the challenges that such networks face; for example, this paper proposes creating an innovative <b>network</b> <b>operations</b> management system, strengthening the management foundation, creating plans to promote operation capacity, enhancing security risk management and equipment quality management, developing a crisis public relations response, and applying information technology. In addition, this paper systematically describes countermeasures for multiline <b>network</b> <b>operations,</b> such as developing a management mechanism for <b>network</b> <b>operations,</b> actively cultivating staff skills, creating innovative transport organization models to enhance operational capacity, establishing a production service assessment system to continuously improve the level of transportation service, establishing a quantifiable safety assessment system and equipment quality index model, strengthening quality controls for security and equipment, extensively using information technology to ensure the health of the urban mass transit <b>network</b> <b>operation,</b> and implementing sustainable development measures.|$|R
