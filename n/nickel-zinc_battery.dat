40|$|A {{series of}} methodologies has been {{researched}} and utilized {{with the intent to}} create functional devices from biologically nanostructured materials. The Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was chosen as a model biological template to investigate a series of approaches for the practical use of biological nanotemplates. Three specific achievements using TMV templates are discussed. ^ First, the deposition of silica on the surface of TMV has been achieved at a higher pH (5 - 7) as a means to enhance its usefulness as a template for the synthesis of nanostructures. Electron energy loss spectroscopy definitively showed the presence of a silica shell {{on the surface of the}} TMV while small angle X-ray scattering differentiated between silica-coated TMV and silica particles in the presence of uncoated TMV. The TMV-templated silica coatings were found to enhance the stability to the virus particle in methanol at conditions that would ordinarily disrupt the assembled particle. Silica-coated TMV virions were shown to be applicable as templates for the deposition of platinum and palladium nanoparticles with particle density comparable to the deposition on the TMV 2 cys. ^ Secondly, additional TMV templates were designed and created through PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to include cysteine point mutations along the inner channel of the coat protein. The templates were then utilized for the spatially controllable growth of nickel and cobalt nanoparticles within the inner channel. Particle density was shown to vary with mutation location and catalyst concentration. ^ Finally, high area nickel and cobalt surfaces were assembled using genetically modified TMV 1 cys templates. TMV templates engineered to encode unique cysteine residues were self-assembled onto gold patterned surfaces in a vertically oriented fashion, producing an order of magnitude increase in surface area. Electroless deposition of metals onto surface assembled virus templates produced uniform coatings up to 40 nm thick. Within a <b>nickel-zinc</b> <b>battery</b> system, the incorporation of virus-assembled electrode surfaces more than doubled the total electrode capacity. ^ Combined these investigations demonstrate the versatility of the TMV template in achieving the successful construction and application of nanomaterials. ...|$|E
40|$|Seventeen {{propulsion}} system concepts for electric vehicles {{were compared to}} determine the differences in components and battery pack to achieve the basic performance level. Design tradeoffs were made for selected configurations to find the optimum component characteristics required to meet all performance goals. The anticipated performance when using <b>nickel-zinc</b> <b>batteries</b> rather than the standard lead-acid batteries was also evaluated. The two systems selected for the final conceptual design studies included a system with a flywheel energy storage unit and a basic system {{that did not have}} a flywheel. The flywheel system meets the range requirement with either lead-acid or <b>nickel-zinc</b> <b>batteries</b> and also the acceleration of zero to 89 km/hr in 15 s. The basic system can also meet the required performance with a fully charged battery, but, when the battery approaches 20 to 30 percent depth of discharge, maximum acceleration capability gradually degrades. The flywheel system has an estimated life-cycle cost of $ 0. 041 /km using lead-acid batteries. The basic system has a life-cycle cost of $ 0. 06 /km.

50|$|<b>Nickel-zinc</b> <b>batteries</b> {{perform well}} in high-drain applications, {{and may have}} the {{potential}} to replace lead-acid batteries because of their higher energy-to-mass ratio and higher power-to-mass ratio — as little as 25% of the mass for the same power. NiZn are cheaper than nickel-cadmium batteries, and are expected to be priced somewhere between NiCd and lead-acid types. NiZn may be used as a substitute for nickel-cadmium. The European Parliament has supported bans on cadmium-based batteries; nickel-zinc is a good alternative for power tools and other applications. A disadvantage is increased self-discharge rate after about 30 cycles, so that batteries do not hold their charge as long as when new. Where this is not a problem NiZn is a good battery choice for applications requiring high-power and high-voltage.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn situ/in operando X-ray {{diffraction}} {{coupled with}} electrochemical cycling of ZnO based electrodes in KOH electrolyte {{has been used}} as a powerful tool in order to investigate the influence of additives. The technique has been performed in order to highlight the role of bismuth based conductive additives on the cycling ability of the electrode. It enables to clearly evidence the conversion of zinc oxide to zinc metal. During the first charge, it also helps to visualize the conversion of Bi 2 O 3 additive into metallic bismuth prior to ZnO reduction which leads to the formation of an electronic pathway at the nanometer scale complementary from the current collector and the TiN percolation conductive network. Additionally, each Bi 2 O 3 grain seems to be converted in a single bismuth grain which is not agglomerated with other bismuth particles even after 50 cycles. This behaviour leads to a steady capacity of the zinc based electrode compared to the same electrode without Bi 2 O 3 additive.

Rietveld method was used to refine various structural parameters and obtain an average crystallite size, on a Hydro-Micromechanical submicronic sample.
