25|$|In April 2017, The New York Times {{reported}} that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O'Reilly {{dating back to}} 2002.

The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million. The New York Times also reported a claim by former O'Reilly Factor guest Wendy Walsh, who declined an offer from O'Reilly {{to go to his}} hotel suite and was subsequently denied a job as a Fox <b>News</b> <b>contributor.</b> Walsh appeared on The O'Reilly Factor for {{a few months after the}} hotel incident, and at one point asked producers for more airtime on the show.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 2014, the NBA issued Sterling a {{lifetime}} ban {{from the organization}} after a league investigation into the recording confirmed {{that he was the}} one conversing with Stiviano. The league also issued a $2.5 million fine against Sterling (the highest allowable by the NBA) and barred him from attending games or practices involving any NBA team; being present in any Clippers office or facility; and from participating in any team business, player personnel decisions or league activity. NBA commissioner Adam Silver stated in a press conference regarding the decision that he will try to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, which would require the consent of ¾ of the league's 29 other team owners. Silver later announced that the NBA would appoint a CEO to run the team. Before the ban was handed down, Sterling said in a phone conversation with Fox <b>News</b> <b>contributor</b> Jim Gray that he had no plans to sell the team.|$|E

40|$|The {{case study}} of this thesis is the {{incident}} with the Russian trawler Elektron in 2005. The trawler was fishing illegally in the Barents Sea, and escaped from Norwegian authorities with two Norwegian fisheries inspectors on board. The event stirred up the military, governments and the news media. The aim of this analysis {{is to look at}} how Russian actors are framed in the Norwegian media. The concept of Peace Journalism has provided the theoretical framework. By doing a media analysis through the lenses of Peace Journalism, as well as interviews with persons of both nationalities, I have examined representations of Russians and {{the relationship between the two}} states. The analysis shows that most news articles frame Russians in a neutral way. This indicates that the media aims for balanced reporting. However, most articles do not fulfill the criteria of Peace Journalism. The sources, editors and <b>news</b> <b>contributors</b> are almost exclusively male elites. There is a lack of investigation into structural causes of the problem with illegal fishing, and almost no evidence of a win-win orientation or creative suggestions to conflict solution. In addition, the interviews show that there is mutual mistrust and conflicting interests between Norwegians and Russians. This suggests that the states have a negative peace rather than a positive peace. But the interviewees also stress the importance of the long lasting, and successful, joint management of the fisheries in the Barents Sea...|$|R

Critics compared the farcical elements of the series, especially in later seasons, to older sitcom Three's Company.

40|$|This book overviews and reconsiders media {{organizations}} - {{the news}} agencies - which report and film {{the news for}} the press and broadcast media.

50|$|In 2002 Midwest Radio Network helped {{establish}} {{and took over}} {{the running of the}} eNewspaper network of online news portals in conjunction with Big News Network. These portals use a newspaper presentation and name and each one is localised to a country, region, U.S. state or industry. A substantial portion of news content on the sites is drawn from Big News Network, a news agency headquartered at Dubai Media City in the United Arab Emirates. Other news content is provided by contracted <b>news</b> wires, <b>contributors,</b> and syndicated <b>news</b> content providers such as Newsmax Media and Financial Content. As part of an arrangement with Q Network the sites also feature movie reviews by James Kendrick who has been publishing reviews for Q Network since 1998. As of 2013 the network consists of over 100 portals. Some examples of the company's eNewspaper titles are Asia Bulletin, New York Telegraph, Australian Herald, San Diego Sun, London Mercury, Boston Star, California Telegraph, Texas Guardian, Florida Statesman, International Travel News and Business Sun. The eNewspaper network operated by Midwest is the second global network of news sites established in conjunction with Big News Network. That company also operates what it calls the News.Net directory of sites in tandem with Mainstream Media, which was established in 1996 and began development of the News.Net sites in 1999, which include such sites as US News.Net, Europe News.Net, China News.Net, Britain News.Net, Boston News.Net, Toronto News.Net, Miami News.Net, and Hong Kong News.Net.
