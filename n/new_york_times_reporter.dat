Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times initial reluctance to fire him.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{interviewed by}} a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> in February 2017 were skeptical that any {{measures}} would {{be successful in}} significantly impacting illegal alcohol sales, given that {{it was such a}} high percentage of the total market for alcohol. Still, Rospotrebnadzor announced at the end of January that the country had seen its first decline in monthly alcohol poisoning deaths in five years.|$|E
5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E

5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times expos√© by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E

25|$|Major {{problems}} with the DCFEMS department emerged on January 6, 2006. Retired <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> David Rosenbaum was assaulted in his home during a robbery.

Rosenbaum subsequently did not receive timely treatment, and died of his injuries. An after-action report severely criticized the DCFEMS personnel for their actions.|$|E
25|$|The Silverman {{trial was}} unusual in many aspects, namely the rare {{combination}} of a mother/son team {{and the fact that}} no body was ever recovered. Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and eavesdropping on their first poll on the subject. The judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been sequestered {{as a result of her}} passing a note to <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> David Rhode in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no cross-examination as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about the previous conviction on slavery charges.|$|E

25|$|A {{phone call}} on October 22, 1969, {{answered}} by freelance investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, and his subsequent independent inquiry, broke {{the wall of}} silence that was surrounding the My Lai massacre. Hersh initially tried to sell the story to Life and Look magazines; both turned it down. Hersh {{then went to the}} small Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty of them accepted it for publication. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> Henry Kamm investigated further and found several My Lai massacre survivors in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of killed civilians as 567. Next, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first started to uncover the truth about the My Lai massacre. Joseph Eszterhas of The Plain Dealer, who was a friend of Ronald Haeberle and knew about the photo evidence of the massacre, published the grisly images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on November 20, 1969. Time magazine's article on November 28, 1969 and in Life magazine on December 5, 1969, finally brought My Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> {{published}} an article on his acupuncture experiences in China, which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture. The US President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. During {{one part of the}} visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than anesthesia. Later {{it was found that the}} patients selected for the surgery had both a high pain tolerance and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving morphine surreptitiously through an intravenous drip that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients. One patient receiving open heart surgery while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a local anesthetic into the wound. After the National Institute of Health expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions, adoption in the US grew further. In 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the US was established in Washington DC and in 1973 the American Internal Revenue Service allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.|$|E

One local newspaper, the Blue Stone Press, speculated that the RTC's 501(c) status would benefit the group financially. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>reporter</b> Peter Applebome, feeling that [...] "ne of the best barometers of whether a small town has a pulse is the [...] old downtown movie house", speculated that the effort to preserve the Theatre bode well for Rosendale.|$|E
