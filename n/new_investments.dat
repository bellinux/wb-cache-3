K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR {{continued to make}} <b>new</b> <b>investments</b> in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity. In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though <b>new</b> <b>investments</b> in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the work}} to {{establish}} a financing package for <b>new</b> <b>investments</b> in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started. It was passed, in 2001, by {{the city and county}} councils, as well as the Norwegian Parliament. Oslo Package 2 allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier was for 33 units (or 99 cars), and was approved by the board on 28 June 2003. The initial order cost NOK1.6 billion, and included options for further orders. Five other manufactures had been rejected during the procurement process. Combined with other investments in the network, the new trains will allow faster travel times on the metro.|$|E

Oslo Package 2 was passed in 2001 and allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier in 2003 from Siemens was for 33 units (99 cars), plus options for further orders. In 2005, the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the quantity by another 30 units. Two test units were delivered in October 2005, with the first serial deliveries in April 2007. With the delivery of the new white and gray trains, Oslo Sporveier received criticism {{that they had been}} disloyal to the old red color of the metro, and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 1980s. Following the 2006 decision to convert the Kolsås Line to metro standard, Akershus County Municipality announced they would order five units.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, the Isles of Scilly were {{ruled by}} the King of England. They were an {{important}} strategic location on the route between mainland Europe, Ireland and Scotland, but threatened {{by the forces of}} France and Spain. Under Henry VIII, a sequence of defensive works called the Device programme had been built to protect the English mainland from French attack, but although a garrison was established at Ennor Castle on the island of St Mary's, no actual construction work was carried out in the islands. After Henry's death in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, assumed the throne, with the government controlled by Edward Seymour, the Duke of Somerset. His brother, Thomas, inspected Scilly, resulting in <b>new</b> <b>investments</b> in their defences, initially focused on the island of Tresco. The Duke fell from power in 1549 and a fresh survey was conducted by Captain William Tyrrell; work then began on protecting the island of St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive <b>new</b> <b>investments</b> just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} as chief {{executive}} officer of Dekalb County, Georgia in 2000, winning 64% of the vote, and was re-elected in 2004 with 54% of the vote. Jones is the first African American to serve as CEO of the county, and the youngest ever elected in the county. In April 2001, shortly after Jones became CEO, he voted, along with five other DeKalb County Commissioners, to offer life and health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of gay and unmarried County employees. DeKalb was the first county in Georgia to offer such benefits. During his administration, Dekalb County established the first local Homeland Security Office in 2001. Under Jones, DeKalb County approved creation of a new senior center, increased funding for roads, libraries, and park improvements while maintaining a balanced budget, and increasing the County's credit rating to AAA. As CEO, Jones promoted and achieved passage of a $125 million bond referendum that allowed for the acquisition of 2,735 acre expansion of the DeKalb County's green space, increasing the county's parks and green space by 70%. He requested and received Congressional designation of Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area. Jones was also primarily responsible for creation of Dekalb County’s first economic development department, which generated $4 billion in <b>new</b> <b>investments.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} investment in which heterogeneous firms choose between <b>new</b> <b>investment</b> and acquisitions. <b>New</b> <b>investment</b> involves purchasing a new plant for an existing variety. Acquisitions involve purchasing a plant from a selling firm along with that firm’s es-tablished variety. In equilibrium, I show that the structure of demand matters for investment decisions. Using a variable-elasticity demand system, I show that if varieties within a differen-tiated industry are imperfect substitutes, mid productivity firms choose to invest. In contrast, I also show that as varieties approach perfect substitutability, high productivity firms choose to invest. For both cases, within the region of investing firms, the most productive choose acqui-sitions over <b>new</b> <b>investment.</b> In analyzing firm-level data from Compustat, I find evidence that supports these predictions. ...|$|R
