Designated the PA-31T-620, it {{was essentially}} a turboprop evolution of the Piper PA-31 Navajo, powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-28 turboprops rated at [...] each. Certification was granted on 3 May 1972. The original Cheyenne, produced from 1974 to 1977, did not carry a Roman numeral suffix designation. Because of difficulties complying with certification standards for longitudinal stability, the Cheyenne and later Cheyenne II are equipped with a Stability Augmentation System (SAS), consisting of a stick-pusher system (actuated by an angle-of-attack sensor) designed to provide the pilot with the appropriate stick force gradient - {{and to keep the}} airplane at its trim airspeed when flying near aft center of gravity loadings, high power settings, low airspeeds and high angles of attack. Without the SAS, the aircraft demonstrated <b>neutral</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> in its flight regime.

These ‘secondary’ cyclones, which grow from frontal waves, are typically small in scale, shallow and deepen rapidly, and pose {{a challenge to}} forecasters and numerical weather prediction models. Frontal-wave development has been studied intensively in the past based on observations (e. g. FASTEX), real-case studies or analytical models. In this study, frontal-wave cyclogenesis is studied from a climatological perspective and is detected {{by a combination of}} two automated identification methods for the period between 1979 and 2014. A climatology of frontal-wave cyclogenesis is presented. Horizontal composites provide an estimate of the climatological mean of conditions during frontal-wave cyclogenesis which may prove useful in the assessment of the realism of proposed idealized models of frontogenesis. The findings are also compared with assumptions made in earlier idealized studies of frontal waves. The composites reveal coherent structures of diabatically generated low-level PV in the lower troposphere, <b>neutral</b> moist <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> at cyclogenesis and an ambient lower troposphere close to saturation. The vertical PV structure in the east NA is more vertically aligned than in the west NA and PV anomalies from the upper and lower levels reach deeper into the mid-troposphere, which indicates an enhanced phase-lock between the two anomalies. Previous studies suggest the existence of an upper limit of along-frontal stretching above which frontal-wave development is strongly suppressed. The presented multi-decadal analysis confirms its existence in a range between 0. 6 and 0. 8 × 10 − 5 s− 1.

Effects of light turbulence were included. Two levels of static stability in each rotational axis (pitch, roll, yaw) were examined for a hingeless rotor configuration. The variations in pitch and roll were: (1) stable and (2) neutral static stability; in yaw there were two stable levels. Four types of stability/control augmentation were also examined for the lower level of static stability in each axis. This latter investigation covered three helicopter rotor types: hingeless, articulated, and teetering.

40|$|The drag {{produced}} by 2 D orographic gravity waves trapped at a temperature inversion and waves propagating in the stably stratified layer existing above are explicitly calculated using linear theory, for a two-layer atmosphere with <b>neutral</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> near the surface, mimicking a well-mixed boundary layer. For realistic {{values of the}} flow parameters, trapped lee wave drag, which is given by a closed analytical expression, is comparable to propagating wave drag, especially in moderately to strongly non-hydrostatic conditions. In resonant flow, both drag components substantially exceed the single-layer hydrostatic drag estimate used in most parametrization schemes. Both drag components are optimally amplified for a relatively low-level inversion and Froude numbers Fr ≈ 1. While propagating wave drag is maximized for approximately hydrostatic flow, trapped lee wave drag is maximized for l_ 2 a = O(1) (where l_ 2 is the Scorer parameter in the stable layer and a is the mountain width). This roughly happens when the horizontal scale of trapped lee waves matches that of the mountain slope. The drag behavior {{as a function of}} Fr for l_ 2 H = 0. 5 (where H is the inversion height) and different values of l 2 a shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Regions of parameter space with high trapped lee wave drag correlate reasonably well with those where lee wave rotors were found to occur in previous nonlinear numerical simulations including frictional effects. This suggests that trapped lee wave drag, besides giving a relevant contribution to low-level drag exerted on the atmosphere, may also be useful to diagnose lee rotor formation...|$|E
40|$|Stability is {{essential}} to flying and is usually assumed to be especially problematic in flapping flight. If so, problems of stability may have presented a particular hurdle {{to the evolution of}} flapping flight. In spite of this, the stability of flapping flight has never been properly analysed. Here we use quasi-static and blade element approaches to analyse the stability provided by a flapping wing. By using reduced order approximations to the natural modes of motion, we show that wing beat frequencies are generally high enough compared to the natural frequencies of motion for a quasi-static approach to be valid as a first approximation. Contrary to expectations, we find that there is noting inherently destabilizing about flapping: beating the wings faster simply amplifies any existing stability or instability, and flapping can even enhance stability compared to gliding at the same air speed. This suggests that aerodynamic stability may not have been a particular hurdle in the evolution of flapping flight. Hovering animals, like hovering helicopters, are predicted to possess <b>neutral</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability.</b> Flapping animals, like fixed wing aircraft, are predicted to be stable in forward flight if the mean flight force acts above and/or behind the centre of gravity. In this case, the downstroke will always be stabilizing. The stabilizing contribution may be diminished by an active upstroke with a low advance ratio and more horizontal stroke plane; other forms of the upstroke may make a small positive contribution to stability. An active upstroke could, therefore, be used to lower stability and enhance manoeuvrability. Translatory mechanisms of unsteady lift production are predicted to amplify the stability predicted by a quasi-static analysis. Non-translatory mechanisms will make little or no contribution to stability. This may be one reason why flies, and other animals which rely upon non-translatory aerodynamic mechanisms, often appear inherently unstable...|$|E

We focus on northern spring and summer, using observations from 4 Martian years at local times of 4 - 5 and 15 - 17 h. We supplement the observations with results obtained from large-eddy simulations and through data assimilation by the UK spectral version of the LMD Mars Global Circulation Model. We previously investigated {{the depth of the}} daytime convective boundary layer (CBL) and its variations with surface elevation and surface properties. We are now examining unusual aspects of the temperature structure observed at night. Most important, predawn profiles in the Tharsis region contain an unexpected layer of <b>neutral</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> at pressures of 200 - 300 Pa with a depth of 4 - 5 km. The mixed layer is bounded above by a midlevel temperature inversion and below by another strong inversion adjacent to the surface. The narrow temperature minimum {{at the base of the}} midlevel inversion suggests the presence of a water ice cloud layer, with the further implication that radiative cooling at cloud level can induce convective activity at lower altitudes. Conversely, nighttime profiles in Amazonis show no sign of a midlevel inversion or a detached mixed layer. These regional variations in the nighttime temperature structure appear to arise in part from large-scale variations in topography, which have several notable effects. First, the CBL is much deeper in the Tharsis region than in Amazonis, owing to a roughly 6 -km difference in surface elevation. Second, large-eddy simulations show that daytime convection is not only deeper above Tharsis but also considerably more intense than it is in Amazonis. Finally, the daytime surface temperatures are comparable in the two regions, so that Tharsis acts as an elevated heat source throughout the CBL. These topographic effects are expected to enhance the vertical mixing of water vapor above elevated terrain, which might lead to the formation and regional confinement of nighttime clouds...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{large-scale}} dynamics {{as represented by}} the residual mean meridional circulation in the transformed Eulerian sense, in particular its stratospheric part, on lower stratospheric <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> and tropopause structure is studied using a comprehensive chemistry–climate model (CCM), reanalysis data, and simple idealized modeling. Dynamical forcing of <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> as associated with the vertical structure of the residual circulation results in a dominant dipole forcing structure with negative <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> forcing just below the tropopause and positive <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> forcing just above the tropopause. This dipole forcing structure effectively sharpens the tropopause, especially during winter. Furthermore, the strong positive lowermost stratospheric <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> forcing causes a layer of strongly enhanced <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> just above the extratropical tropopause—a tropopause inversion layer (TIL) —especially in the winter midlatitudes. The strong positive <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> forcing is shown to be mainly due to the strong vertical gradient of the vertical residual velocity found just above the tropopause in the winter midlatitudes. Stratospheric radiative equilibrium (SRE) solutions are obtained using offline radiative transfer calcula-tions for a given tropospheric climate as simulated by the CCM. The resulting tropopause height in SRE is reduced by several kilometers in the tropics but is increased by 1 – 2 km in the extratropics, strongly reducing the equator-to-pole contrast in tropopause height. Moreover, the TIL in winter midlatitudes disappears in the SRE solution {{in contrast to the}} polar summer TIL, which stays intact. When the SRE solution is modified to include the effect of stratospheric dynamics as represented by the stratospheric residual circulation, the TIL in winter midlatitudes is recovered, suggesting that the <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> forcing associated with the stratospheric residual circulation represents the main cause for the TIL in the winter midlatitudes whereas radiation seems dominant in causing the polar summer TIL. 1...|$|R

But {{it is difficult to}} include latent heat release in dynamical theories because of the associated nonlinearity (precipitation generally occurs where there is upward motion). A new effective <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> is derived that fundamentally captures the effect of latent heat release on moist eddy circulations. It differs from the usual dry <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> by an additive term that depends on temperature and a parameter measuring the up–down asymmetry of vertical velocity statistics. Latent heat release reduces the effective <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> experienced by eddies but cannot reduce it to zero so long as there are nonprecipitating regions of the eddies.

In general, the climate state does not depend very much on whether or not this interaction is included, because the poleward eddy heat transport dominates the eddy forcing of mean temperature and wind fields.
