40|$|Abstract for 12 th {{international}} Symposium on biosafety {{of genetically}} modified organisms The identification of {{similarities and differences between}} GM plants and derived food/feed and their comparators plays a central role in risk assessment strategy. Therefore, selecting the right comparators must be one of the top priorities. The question is which control would allow us to better evaluate the potential unintended effects related directly to the transgene and/or DNA rearrangements, discounting the potential effects caused by in vitro culture procedures; since, these are non-controversial procedures also used in conventional breeding. Aiming to answer the previous question we have used Multiplex fluorescence 2 D gel electrophoresis technology (DyeAGNOSTICS Refraction- 2 D) coupled with MS to characterize the proteome of three different rice lines (Oriza sativa L. ssp. Japonica cv Nipponbare) : A control conventional counterpart. An Agrobacterium transformed transgenic line. A <b>negative</b> <b>segregant</b> (homozygous negative progeny) from a different transgenic line. We have observed that transgenic and <b>negative</b> <b>segregant</b> plant lines grouped together (only 1 differentially regulated spot - fold difference > 1. 5, ANOVA, P 1. 5, ANOVA, P< 0. 05, in both transgenic and <b>negative</b> <b>segregant</b> lines comparing to control line). Additionally, the 35 proteins identified (using MS) in this study, were already associated with stress response by other authors. The only feature in common between the transgenic and <b>negative</b> <b>segregant</b> lines is that they have both suffered in vitro culture procedures. Hence, the results obtained indicate that, in this study, different gene disruption and/or DNA rearrangements and the presence/absence of transgene were factors with less impact on rice proteome than the proteomic promoted differences caused by in vitro culture, and eventually the stress caused by this process. This work highlights the importance of continuous revision and upgrade of the guidance criteria to be followed for the selection of suitable comparators in GMO risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of {{similarities and differences}} between genetically modified plants and derived food/feed and their comparators plays a central role in risk assessment strategy. Our main goal was to better understand the relevance of transgene presence, genetic and epigenetic changes promoted by transgene insertion and in vitro culture in the potential unintended effects/differences between transgenic and conventional counterparts. In order to achieve this goal we have used Multiplex fluorescence 2 D gel electrophoresis technology coupled with MS to characterize the proteome of three different rice lines (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) : a control conventional counterpart, an Agrobacterium-transformed transgenic line (Ta) and a <b>negative</b> <b>segregant</b> (NSb), progeny of a different transgenic line. We have observed that Ta and NSb plant lines grouped together (only 1 differentially regulated spot - fold difference ≥ 1. 5), separated from the control (49 spots with fold difference ≥ 1. 5, in both Ta and NSb lines comparing to control line). Since the only feature in common between the tested transgenic and <b>negative</b> <b>segregant</b> lines is that they have both suffered in vitro culture procedures we hypothesised that stress caused by in vitro culture was, in this case, the most relevant factor contributing for the encountered proteomic differences. MS identifications of differentially regulated spots supported our hypothesis, demonstrating that Ta and NSb rice lines present several adjusted metabolic pathways and several proteins with altered expression that were previously associated with plant stress response.

40|$|Identification of {{differences}} between genetically modified plants and their original counterparts plays {{a central role in}} risk assessment strategy. Our main goal was to better understand the relevance of transgene presence, genetic, and epigenetic changes induced by transgene insertion, and in vitro culture in putative unintended differences between a transgenic and its comparator. Thus, we have used multiplex fluorescence 2 DE coupled with MS to characterize the proteome of three different rice lines (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) : a control conventional line (C), an Agrobacterium-transformed transgenic line (Ta) and a <b>negative</b> <b>segregant</b> (NSb). We observed that Ta and NSb appeared identical (with only one spot differentially abundant [...] fold difference ≥ 1. 5), contrasting with the control (49 spots with fold difference ≥ 1. 5, in both Ta and NSb vs. control). Given that in vitro culture was the only event in common between Ta and NSb, we hypothesize that in vitro culture stress was the most relevant condition contributing for the observed proteomic differences. MS protein identification support our hypothesis, indicating that Ta and NSb lines adjusted their metabolic pathways and altered the abundance of several stress related proteins in order to cope with in vitro culture...|$|E
