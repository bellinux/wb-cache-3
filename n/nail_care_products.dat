40|$|This article {{gives the}} results of contact {{allergic}} reactions to cosmetics seen between 1985 and 1990 (462 patients investigated) and between 1991 and 1996 (486 patients investigated). Perfume components remain the most frequently occurring allergens in cosmetics. They are followed by preservative agents, a class within which important shifts have occurred over time (e. g. as with the isothiazolinone mixture). Excipients and certainly emulsifiers (e. g. cocamidopropylbetaine) are potentially not only irritants but also allergens. Among the "active" or category-specific ingredients, oxidative hair dyes, based on paraphenylenediamine and derivatives, and <b>nail</b> <b>care</b> <b>products,</b> based on (meth) acrylates are particularly apt to cause professional dermatoses. Finally, the share of sunscreens as cosmetic allergens remains limited, which may well be because a contact or photocontactallergy is often not recognized since the differential diagnosis with a primary sun intolerance is not always obvious. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{cosmetic}} {{is legally}} {{defined as a}} product that enhances appearance, aids in personal hygiene, and {{does not affect the}} structure or function of the skin. Therefore, cosmetic products contain no active drug ingredient. Sometimes the division of cosmetics and over-the-counter drugs is not always clear, for example the recent hair regrowth treatment, topical minoxidil (Regaine / Headway), which has been shown to cause allergic contact dermatitis of the scalp (1). Cosmetics can be broadly divided into the following groups: • Decorative products e. g. make-up • <b>Nail</b> <b>care</b> <b>products</b> e. g. varnishes and removers • Skin care products e. g. moisturizers • Soaps & bath additives • Shaving products e. g. foams, aftershave lotions • Oral Hygiene products e. g. toothpaste & mouthwashes • Hair Products e. g. shampoo, dyes & regrowth treatments • Sun Protection products • Feminine Hygiene products • Fragrances e. g. perfumes & colognes • Deodorants & Antiperspirants – Technically because they reduce or decrease sweating, which affect the function of the skin, they should be considered drugs It can be seen, therefore, that cosmetics {{are an important part of}} our daily life. It is estimated that the average adult uses at least 7 different skin care products each day, so it’s not surprising that reactions to these products are very common. Reactions can be seen after the first application or after years of use. In New Zealand, like the rest of the developed world, there is a trend towards using "natural products", with the misconception that natural products are "healthier " and cause fewer reactions than artificial products. This myth is debunked when people are reminded that most allergens are "natural ” proteins...|$|E
