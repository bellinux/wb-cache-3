Each of these factors may be important {{to the ability of}} adults to remain in rural and remote communities as they age. We examined the association of health status and social <b>networks</b> and <b>resilience</b> among older adults dwelling in a rural and remote county in the Western United States. Methods. We selected a random sample of 198 registered voters aged 65 years or older from a frontier Wyoming county. Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of health status as well as social <b>networks</b> and <b>resilience.</b> We also examined health status as a moderator of the relationship between social <b>networks</b> and <b>resilience.</b> Results. Family <b>networks</b> (p= 0. 024) and mental health status (p< 0. 001) significantly predicted resilience. Mental health status moderated the relationship of family (p= 0. 004) and friend (p= 0. 021) <b>networks</b> with <b>resilience.</b> Smaller family and friend networks were associated with greater resilience when mental health status was low, but not when it was high.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{quantify}} scalability of <b>network</b> <b>resilience</b> upon failures. We characterize resilience as {{the percentage of}} lost traffic upon failures [5] and define scalability as the growth rate of the percentage of lost traffic with respect to network size, link failure probability and traffic for given failure protection schemes. We apply probabilistic graphical models to characterize statistical spatial dependence between physical-layer failures and logical network topologies for traffic flows. We then derive the scalability for large networks of different topologies. We first focus on the scalability of resilience for regular topologies under uniform traffic with independent and dependent link failures, with and without protection. For large networks with small probabilities of failures and without protection, we show that the scalability of <b>network</b> <b>resilience</b> grows linearly with the average route length and with the effective link failure probability. For large networks with 1 + 1 protection, we obtain lower and upper bound of the percentage of lost traffic. We derive approximations of the scalability for arbitrary topologies, and attain close-form analytical results for ring, star, and mesh-torus topologies. We then study <b>network</b> <b>resilience</b> under random traffic with Poisson arrivals. We find that when the network is under light load (small traffic arrival rate), the <b>network</b> <b>resilience</b> is reduced to that under uniform deterministic traffic.

40|$|Abstract—An {{important}} question for secure all-optical networks (AONs) {{is how to}} incorporate security against attacks {{in the design and}} engineering of network architectures. In this work, we study the resilience of AON architectures under inband crosstalk attacks. Crosstalk attack propagation depends on both optical devices at the physical layer and wavelength usage at the network layer. This motivates us to apply probabilistic graphical models to model attack propagation. At the physical layer, we use a directed probabilistic graph (Bayesian Belief Network) to model the attack propagation under static network traffic and a given source of attack. At the network layer, we use an undirected probabilistic graph to represent the probability distribution of active connections in the network. The cross-layer model is obtained by combining the physical- and the networklayer models into a factor graph representation. Graphical models provide an explicit representation of interactions between the physical- and the network layer. Furthermore, graphical models facilitate derivations of analytical results on resilience with respect to physical-layer vulnerability, physical topology, and network load. Specifically, we derive bounds on the <b>network</b> <b>resilience</b> for regular topologies. We show that for ring, star, and mesh-torus networks with link-shortest path routing and all-toall traffic, the average <b>network</b> <b>resilience</b> loss grows linearly with respect to the network load when the network load is small, and polynomially with respect to the probability of attack propagation from node to node along the attacker’s route. In addition, numerical results suggest that the sum-product algorithm based on the factor graph representation can be used for computationally efficient evaluation of <b>network</b> <b>resilience</b> for irregular/large topologies.
