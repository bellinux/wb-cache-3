50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{initiatives}} in Europe to create a universal quality standard that could benchmark the quality of the translation services and gain recognition through independent audit certification. This includes the Italian UNI 10574 Standard, the Austrian Önorm D 1200 and Önorm D 1201 Standards, the Dutch Taalmerk Standard and the German DIN 2345 Standard. In 1999 the EUATC (European Union of Associations of Translation Companies) saw the need to develop an industry specific quality standard. This initiative built on previous standards which had been established by some national associations of translation companies. This standard was the first European wide initiative. In 2003 the EUATC took this standard to the next level. They started working with CEN, the European standards body, in April 2003 with the aim of creating a certifiable quality process standard for translation. The public consultation period started in September 2004 and EN 15038 was published by May 2006. The EUATC is made up of national associations of translation companies throughout Europe and these national associations have been translating the standard into their own language and cooperating with their <b>national</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>bodies</b> for publication and certification by independent third party auditors.|$|E
40|$|A Smart City {{integrates}} physical, {{digital and}} human systems {{to deliver a}} sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens. Many of these innovative solutions {{will be based on}} sophisticated information and communication technologies. However, technological complexity, as well as the complexity of the various sectoral services involved within a Smart City, require a system approach to standardisation. Such an approach must promote the greatest possible reuse of existing open standards to accelerate the Smart City deployment. In an effort to leverage the promise of a system approach, the Horizon 2020 -project ESPRESSO (systEmic standardisation apPRoach to Empower Smart citieS and cOmmunities) will focus on the development of a conceptual Smart City Information Framework based on open standards. A further goal of ESPRESSO will be to envisage the impact of those technologies for urban planning and also in societal terms. The partner cities will be engaged to analyse how their services can be streamlined and improved through large-scale use of standards. This will be done by analysing the downstream changes from the new scenarios enabled by large-scale interoperability and what this could bring for a future Smart City. Based on a detailed requirements-engineering campaign executed in close cooperation with cities, standardisation organizations, administrative bodies, and private industry, the project will identify open standards matching the elicited requirements and will establish a baseline for interoperability between the various sectoral data sources and the Smart City enterprise application platform. In a comprehensive set of coordination, support and networking activities, the project will engage {{a very large number of}} stakeholders, such as Smart Cities (both existing and those with aspirations), European Standardisation Organizations (ESOs), <b>National</b> <b>Standardisation</b> <b>Bodies</b> (NSBs), Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), public administrations, industries, SMEs, and other institutions. ESPRESSO’s approach emphasises cost reduction and will foster an open market for many actors, avoiding lock-in to proprietary solutions...|$|E

30|$|ADEs do not {{necessarily}} need {{to be approved by}} a <b>standardisation</b> <b>body</b> nor by OGC, as anyone can develop an ADE and produce datasets conforming to it. Therefore generally speaking {{there is no such thing}} as an ‘official ADE’ in the context of OGC and CityGML. However, besides the ADEs developed by an organisation with an authority (e.g. a <b>national</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>body</b> establishing a <b>national</b> 3 D spatial data infrastructure), some ADEs can be considered ‘de facto official’. These ADEs may be the ones that are widely supported by the OGC community (e.g. developed by multiple research groups participating in the CityGML Standards Working Group). Such efforts have a prospect of being integrated in future version of CityGML.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a pilot project}} (INTERNORM) funded by the University of Lausanne (2010 - 2013) to support the involvement of civil society organisations (CSO) in international standard setting bodies such as the ISO. It analyses how a distinct participatory mechanism can influence the institutional environment of technical diplomacy in which standards are shaped. The project {{is an attempt to}} respond to the democratic deficit attested in the field of international standardisation, formally open to civil society participation, but still largely dominated by expert knowledge and market players. Many international standards have direct implications on society as a whole, but CSOs (consumers and environmental associations, trade unions) are largely under-represented in negotiation arenas. The paper draws upon international relations literature on new institutional forms in global governance and studies of participation in science and technology. It argues that there are significant limitations to the rise of civil society participation in such global governance mechanisms. The INTERNORM project has been designed as a platform of knowledge exchange between CSO and academic experts, with earmarked funding and official membership to a <b>national</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>body.</b> But INTERNORM cannot substitute for a long- established lack of resources in time, money and expertise of CSOs. Despite high entry costs into technical diplomacy, participation thus appears as less a matter of upstream engagement, or of procedure only, than of dedicated means to shift the geometry of actors and the framing of socio-technical change...|$|R
40|$|First made {{available}} online (in HTML) in 1997 This Working Paper forms {{part of a}} series of five volumes dealing with the "Europeanisation" of product safety law. They are the result of a study carried out on behalf of the Commission of the EC which has so far been published only in German*. The publication of this English version has been made possible by a grant from Directorate General XI. The five volumes of this series of Working Papers should thus be read in context. Volume 1 (Chapter I) aims to show why product safety law has given rise to extremely diverse regulation patterns and to provide an overview of the most important instruments for action. Volumes 2 and 3 (Chapter II) are concerned with recent developments in the relevant legislation of the economically most important Community Member States and of the United States. Volume 2 (Chapter II, Parts 1 and 2) contains reports on France and the United Kingdom, Volume 3 (Chapter II parts 3 and 4) deals with the Federal Republic of Germany and the US Consumer Product Safety Act 1972, which is of crucial importance in the international debate. Volume 4 (Chapters III and IV) analyses the development of the "traditional" policy of approximation of law and of efforts at a "horizontal" European product safety policy. In both policy areas it proved impossible to realise the Community's programmatic goals. As far as policy on achieving the internal market is concerned, the Commission itself has pointed out the reasons and called for, and implemented, a fundamental revision of traditional legal approximation policy. This reorientation of Community policy is dealt with in Chapters IV; it describes the most important precursors of the new internal market policy, namely ECJ case law on Articles 30 and 36 EEC since the Cassis de Dijon judgment, and regulatory technique for the Low Voltage Directive and then analyses the new approach to technical harmonisation and standards, whereby the Community will restrict itself in its directives to setting "essential safety requirements", leaving it to European and <b>national</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>bodies</b> to convert these safety requirements into technical specifications. Volume 5 (Chapters V and VI) evaluates the effects of the Community's new approach to technical harmonisation and standards on product safety policy. Chapter V diagnoses a new need for action in the area of product safety policy, including in particular the internal organisation of the standardisation process, and participation by consumer associations in European standardisation. Chapter VI continues a comprehensive discussion of alternatives open for co-ordinating internal market and product safety policy. It argues that a policy of "deregulating" Member States' product safety legislation would not be feasible, and opts for a "positive" supplementation of the new approach by a horizontal Community product safety policy. This option is elaborated in a number of recommendations.
