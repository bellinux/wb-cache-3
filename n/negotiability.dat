Concerns have also been raised that the holder in due course rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.|$|E

5000|$|Negotiable {{instruments}} are unconditional and impose few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment. In the United States, whether a promissory note is a negotiable instrument can have significant legal impacts, as only negotiable {{instruments are}} subject to Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code {{and the application of}} the holder in due course rule. The <b>negotiability</b> of mortgage notes has been debated, particularly due to the obligations and [...] "baggage" [...] associated with mortgages; however, in mortgages notes are often determined to be negotiable instruments.|$|E
5000|$|The latter {{requirement}} {{is referred to}} as the [...] "words of negotiability": a writing which does not contain the words [...] "to the order of" [...] (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in allonge) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of <b>negotiability.</b> The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a bank) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads [...] "pay John Doe") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.|$|E
5000|$|These {{events were}} {{occurring}} {{at a time}} when the Ecclesiastical Courts had great judicial power. There were several philosophical cross currents at play. On the one hand, the Canon Lawyers looked favorably on the products of labor, wages and profit, while holding suspect speculation, banking and finance. The Church discountenanced the fluctuations of wages and prices caused by the law of supply and demand. There was an attempt to maintain fixed standards of value. At the same time, there was a liberal and equitable view toward the old Roman idea of [...] "contract". The Church Courts invented and refined the idea of [...] "consideration" [...] the quid pro quo in modern contract. This was something that was lacking in Roman contract. Insurance, assignability and <b>negotiability</b> were developments in the Church Courts. These areas were largely ignored by the Common Law, or secular law of the day, especially in England (Plucknett p. 302,304).|$|E
5000|$|These {{practices}} {{created a}} new kind of [...] "money" [...] that was actually debt, that is, goldsmiths' debt rather than silver or gold coin, a commodity that had been regulated and controlled by the monarchy. This development required the acceptance in trade of the goldsmiths' promissory notes, payable on demand. Acceptance in turn required a general belief that coin would be available; and a fractional reserve normally served this purpose. Acceptance also required that the holders of debt be able legally to enforce an unconditional right to payment; it required that the notes (as well as drafts) be negotiable instruments. The concept of <b>negotiability</b> had emerged in fits and starts in European money markets, but it was well developed by the 17th century. Nevertheless, an act of Parliament was required in the early 18th century (1704) to overrule court decisions holding that the gold smiths notes, despite the [...] "customs of merchants", were not negotiable.|$|E
50|$|Thus, France {{had to pay}} {{on account}} of this convention, 383,251 francs every day for five years; equal to about 16,000 pounds {{sterling}} at the exchange rate of the day. For this daily quota, the French government had to give assignations on the French treasury, payable to bearer, day by day. In the first instance, however, the Coalition Commissioners were to receive {{the whole of the}} 700 million in fifteen bonds of 46⅔ million each; the first of which was payable on 31 March 1816, the second on 21 July 1816, and so on, every fourth month. In the month preceding the commencement of each of these four monthly periods, France was to redeem successively one of these bonds for 46⅔ millions, by exchanging it against the first-mentioned daily assignations payable to bearer, which assignations, for the purpose of convenience and <b>negotiability,</b> were again subdivided into coupures, or sets of smaller sums. As a guarantee for the regular payment of these assignations, and to provide for deficiencies, France assigned, moreover, to the allies, a fund of interest, to be inscribed in the Grand Livre of her public debt, of seven millions francs on a capital of 140 millions. A liquidation was to take place every six months, when the assignations duly discharged by the French Treasury were to be received as payments to their amount, and the deficiency arising from assignations not honoured would be made good, with interest, at five percent from the fund of interest inscribed in the Grand Livre, in a manner specified in this convention.|$|E

40|$|Creditors {{have long}} {{understood}} that any claims they submit for repayment in a bankruptcy might be valid, but subject to subordination {{in the order}} of payment of the bankruptcy estate’s limited funds if the creditor behaved inequitably as the debtor failed. A groundbreaking opinion in Enron’s on-going bankruptcy has expanded the practice of equitable subordination far beyond its traditional reach. According to the court, buyers of bankruptcy claims are now subject to subordination, not just for their own conduct, but also for conduct of previous owners of the claims, regardless of whether the conduct related to the claims. In a world of active bankruptcy claims trading, Enron raises powerful policy questions about the legal rules governing property transfers that affect the doctrinal development of bankruptcy law and the survival of a secondary market that provides important liquidity to other capital markets. This article shows how Enron was erroneous from both doctrinal and policy perspectives and examines the problems Enron has created for several distinct markets. Enron is a reminder of the continuing value of <b>negotiability</b> in commercial contexts, for if the claims involved had been negotiable, they could not have been subordinated. Thus, this article considers what factors have traditionally determined when the law adopts a <b>negotiability</b> regime for property transfers and whether these factors make sense in today’s financial markets. The article argues that in the bankruptcy claims context, the liquidity benefits of <b>negotiability</b> outweigh its costs. Accordingly, the article proposes a federal law of <b>negotiability</b> for bankruptcy claims to protect the liquidity of this vital market...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe investigate, by {{method of}} {{statistical}} survey, people's attitudes toward privacy, trust and personal information {{sharing in the}} context of price discrimination effects in the mobile telecom market, by asking a selection of 546 individuals, a sample size that is sufficient to be representative for the Norwegian mobile market of consumers. Common wisdom tells that people value their privacy, but not much facts have been collected about how much people value privacy, say, as consumers of specific services in the mobile market. Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that individuals will differ in their <b>negotiability</b> of personal information vs price of service. In this study, we measure a strong privacy <b>negotiability</b> correlated to age and income, thus confirming common intuition about this. We find that technically assuring anonymity of service will significantly affect and facilitate the user's willingness to release personal information to the service provider, in particular with respect to information about specific buying preferences and frequent travel destinations. Somewhat surprising, a practice of targeted advertisement in exchange for lower mobile service price is acceptable to about half the population...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the common notions of negotiable instruments {{as they relate}} to the modern day promissory note in the context of residential mortgage lending. The Article further addresses the destruction of the <b>negotiability</b> of such promissory notes through various undertakings added {{for the benefit of the}} banking industry, often to the detriment of a borrower. The use of negotiable instruments commenced in the 1800 s in England as a way of ensuring a fluid market between trades as there was no fiat currency system in place. The fundamental purpose behind the concept of <b>negotiability</b> was subsequently abrogated by the modernization of the financial industry, and the creation of a global marketplace for the purchase and sale of promissory notes. Furthermore, the Article discusses how the holder in due course doctrine, which limits a borrower’s defenses when a promissory note has been transferred from one note holder to another, has created significant abuse to consumers by the financial industry. The abuse of consumers through the holder in due course doctrine remains a problem unchecked by many courts that continue to apply <b>negotiability</b> law to modern day promissory notes in real estate mortgage transactions despite the fact that modern day promissory notes lack any of the tenets of “negotiability” under article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The Article then calls on the judiciary, as theoretically the least political and most impartial branch of government, to find that such promissory notes are no longer negotiable instruments, and therefore must be transferred via assignment pursuant to article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Such a new construct or approach would provide the transparency necessary to protect consumers and preserve defenses to predatory lending by the financial industry...|$|E
