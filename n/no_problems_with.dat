5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E

American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> this at the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E

In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's East Harlem in order to found a soup kitchen.

Her fellow nuns, including the Mother Superior, also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though they insist that their martial arts training is mostly for sport and that they have had <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the surrounding neighborhoods. Their story was ultimately picked up and reported by The New York Times.|$|E

Artist Shinkiro has expressed he had <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> designing Ryo in contrast to Robert due to Ryo's poor state. For The King of Fighters '94, along with Robert, developers from the game had problems with balancing Ryo with the other characters from the series without removing any of his special moves. However, Ryo was commented {{to be one of}} the strongest characters of the game. They also add that this game was created with the idea of having Ryo fighting against Terry Bogard, the lead character from the Fatal Fury series.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} {{benefit of}} the mid-engine arrangement was that it created a smooth and streamlined nose profile. Much {{was made of the}} fact that this resulted in a configuration “with as trim and clean a fuselage nose as the snout of a high velocity bullet”. Entry to the cockpit was through side doors (mounted {{on both sides of the}} cockpit) rather than a sliding canopy. Its unusual engine location and the long drive shaft caused some concern to pilots at first, but experience showed this was no more of a hazard in a crash landing than with an engine located forward of the cockpit. There were <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> propeller shaft failure.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{mechanical}} problems appeared {{during the}} sea trials. Many of the problems encountered in Collins were quickly repaired, and did not occur again or in the other five submarines. Recurring issues were usually associated with diesel engines, propeller shaft seals, periscopes and masts, hydraulic couplings, and the combat system. At the same time, many of the systems worked with few or <b>no</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>with</b> the submarine meeting or exceeding design specifications for maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and submerged endurance, particularly at low speeds. The ship control system, which had been a major concern during development of the class, functioned beyond positive expectation. The submarine's autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') {{was found to be}} better at depth keeping during snorting than many of the operators.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} it was an active {{veterans}} facility, it provided a hospital, nursing care, food, entertainment, and religious services for up to 350 veterans at a time, providing a home for 700 former Confederate soldiers in its years of operations. The requirements to be {{a resident of the}} home was to not only be a former Confederate soldier, but to have been a resident of Kentucky for the past six months, be mentally stable, and to have <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> alcoholism. Many of the veterans once served under John Hunt Morgan. A fire on March 25, 1920 destroyed the main building, as well as an infirmary ward and laundry. Fortunately, no lives were lost, {{and the rest of the}} facility was enough to house those residents still using the home. Eventually, the number of veterans who could be served dwindled, and by 1934 the hospital was no more, with the remaining five residents being transferred to the nearby Pewee Valley Sanitorium.|$|E
