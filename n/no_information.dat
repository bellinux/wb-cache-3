5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, El Sol was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) {{on behalf of the}} United States Army, who designated her as an animal transport ship. Although there is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> about the specific conversion of El Sol, for other ships this typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E
5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, <b>no</b> <b>information</b> can be sent using this effect.|$|E

Five regulatory regimes are considered: <b>no</b> tolling/imperfect <b>information,</b> <b>no</b> tolling/perfect <b>information,</b> non-fluctuating ('flat') tolling/imperfect information, flat tolling/perfect information, and fluctuating ('fine') tolling, implying perfect information. A simulation model is used to investigate the influence of some key parameters on the relative efficiency of the various regulatory regimes...|$|R

5|$|Despite his rebellion, Salih paid formal {{allegiance}} to the Fatimid Caliphate after conquering Aleppo, and dispatched Ibn Tawq to meet az-Zahir in Cairo; in turn, az-Zahir officially recognized Salih's Mirdasid emirate and sent him numerous honorary robes and presents. There is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> about the Byzantines' relationship with Salih following the conquest of Aleppo, though Emperor Basil II refused to back Salih's rebellion when he appealed for Byzantine support.|$|E

Grover Cleveland Alexander also made five Opening Day starts for the Phillies, equal to Schilling; however, <b>no</b> <b>information</b> on his decisions in those games is available.

5|$|In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old {{music hall}} performer, and {{they married in}} her home town of Halifax in August. Little is known about Salter, {{although}} the 1901 census shows {{that she was still}} living with her parents. The marriage {{does not appear to have}} been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, there is no evidence of a divorce between the couple and <b>no</b> <b>information</b> relating to when the couple separated.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides <b>no</b> <b>information</b> about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently <b>no</b> <b>information</b> was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
5|$|Basta's {{soldiers}} accompanied Sigismund to Tokaj. Before long, {{he went to}} Prague to beg for RudolphII's mercy. He {{received the}} incolatus (or the right to own lands in Bohemia) in 1604. After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, {{but he did not}} accept the offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, saying that he had <b>no</b> <b>information</b> about the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor's offer.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{were the}} first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also realize their {{professional}} life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably lymphadenopathy, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With <b>no</b> <b>information</b> on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E
