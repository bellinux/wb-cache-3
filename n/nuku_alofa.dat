40|$|There is a {{tree with}} a great many uses that grows in the South Pacific called Terminalia catappa; it is more {{commonly}} known as the 'beach almond' or 'natapoa'. It reaches a height of between 25 and 40 metres, its deep roots help to protect beach shores and it resists high winds. Its hardwood timber is used in construction and furniture. Well suited to maritime climates, whether sub-tropical or tropical, it will grow in any coastal soil {{as long as it is}} well-drained. From its third year onwards, the 'natapoa' produces a dark-red fruit whose almond-like nuts are sold in local markets. There are several varieties of nuts, and they have been developed for a long time in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to increase fruit size, and to produce shells which are easier to break open. All in all, Terminalia catappa is a sturdy species, resistant to disease, and with its ease of reproduction and significant output, it could well be considered for cultivation elsewhere on tropical islands and coasts.
