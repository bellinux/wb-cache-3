5|$|While the Sounders {{currently}} play on FieldTurf, CenturyLink Field {{has previously}} had temporary <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> installed for international soccer events. In 2012, an updated FieldTurf surface was installed and certified by FIFA with a 2-star quality rating, {{the highest possible}} rating. If an MLS rule change requires <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> playing surfaces, the field will be permanently replaced with <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|R
50|$|In fall 2012, a FieldTurf infield was {{installed}} at the facility, while the outfield surface remained <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b> Prior to the renovation, the field's surface had been entirely <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hybrid <b>grass</b> or {{reinforced}} <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> is {{a product}} created by combining <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> with synthetic reinforcing fibres. It is used for stadium pitches and training pitches, used for association football, rugby, American football, golf and baseball. Reinforced <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> {{can also be used}} for events and concerts. The synthetic fibres incorporated into the rootzone make the grass stronger and more resistant to damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{checkerboard}} was bordered {{in orange}} from 1989 until <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> replaced the artificial turf in 1994. The return of <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> {{brought with it}} {{the return of the}} green (or grass colored) border that exists today.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the interaction of skin with <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> and artificial turf at clinical, histological and immunohistochemical level. Therefore, 14 male volunteers performed slidings on dry <b>natural</b> <b>grass,</b> wet <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> and artificial turf. Directly and 24 h after the slidings, a clinical picture and a 3 -mm punch biopsy of the lesion were taken. Paraffin sections (6 microm) were hematoxylin-eosin stained. Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD 3, hBD- 2, K 16, K 10, Ki 67 and HSP 70. Clinically, a sliding performed on artificial turf caused less erythema but more abrasion compared to <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b> At histological level, artificial turf or dry <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> damaged the stratum corneum the most. Directly after the sliding, CD 3, hBD- 2, K 16, K 10, Ki 67 and HSP 70 expression was normal. 24 h after a sliding on artificial turf or dry <b>natural</b> <b>grass,</b> an increase of K 16, hBD- 2 and HSP 70 expression was observed. In this pilot study it was not possible to clearly distinguish between skin damage induced by a sliding on artificial turf and <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b> However, small differences at clinical and histological level seem to exist. This demonstrates the potential of the skin as readout system to evaluate artificial turf systems and mechanical skin damage...|$|R

50|$|Falcon Stadium had a <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> {{field for}} its first 44 years, {{although}} the sideline areas where teams stood were artificial turf since the 1980s. Prior to the 2006 season, synthetic FieldTurf was installed {{at a cost of}} $750,000. <b>Natural</b> <b>grass</b> now makes up the perimeter of the FieldTurf surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{football}} stadium consists of 11,000 seats under roof, {{and has a}} <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> playing field grown in place.

50|$|A {{number of}} health and safety {{concerns}} have been raised about artificial turf. Friction between skin and older generations of artificial turf can cause abrasions and/or burns to a much greater extent than <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b> Artificial turf tends to retain heat {{from the sun and}} can be much hotter than <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> with prolonged exposure to the sun. There is some evidence that periodic disinfection of artificial turf is required as pathogens are not broken down by natural processes {{in the same manner as}} <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b> Despite this, a 2006 study suggests certain microbial life is less active in artificial turf.|$|R

40|$|Our {{hypothesis}} {{is that there are}} no difference in the injury incidence on artificial turf and <b>natural</b> <b>grass.</b> During the 2011 / 2012 season, we recorded injuries which occurred to two Italian stadiums equipped with third-generation artificial turf during 36 games (391 players). Data were compared with the injuries which occurred in the same season in two stadiums equipped with <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> (372 players). We recorded 43 injuries during the playing time (16. 7 per 1000  h). About 23 (18. 1 per 1000  h) injuries occurred on artificial turf, while 20 (15. 2 per 1000  h) on the <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> with no statistical differences P >  0. 05. We recorded 10 (7. 87 per 1000  h) contact and 13 (10. 23 per 1000  h) non-contact injuries on artificial turf, while 5 (3. 8 per 1000  h) contact and 15 (11. 4 per 1000  h) non-contact injuries on <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> P >  0. 05. The overall relative risk was 1. 15; 95 % CI: 0. 64 - 2. 07). Our study demonstrates a substantial equivalence in injury risk on <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> and artificial turf in elite professional soccer athletes during official matches...|$|R

50|$|Other notable {{upgrades}} {{include the}} installation of lights in 1990, a Jumbotron in 1997 and {{the replacement of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> turf, which had become increasingly hard to maintain, with an AstroPlay artificial turf surface in 2003. Ironically, the stadium had been among the first in the nation to switch from a <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> playing surface to artificial turf in 1970, and then one of the first of those stadiums to switch back to <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> in 1984. The field surface was again changed in 2009 from AstroPlay to FieldTurf, making Ole Miss the first team in the Southeastern Conference to play their home games on the surface.|$|R
