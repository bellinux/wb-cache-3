5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "end user" [...] first {{surfaced}} in the late 1980s and has since then raised many debates. One challenge is that {{the goal is to}} give the user both more freedom, by adding advanced features and functions (for more advanced users) and adding more constraints (to prevent a <b>neophyte</b> <b>user</b> from accidentally erasing an entire company's database). [...] This phenomenon appeared as a consequence of [...] "consumerization" [...] of computer products and software. In the 1960s and 1970s, computer users were generally programming experts and computer scientists. However, in the 1980s, and especially in the mid-to late 1990s and the early 2000s, everyday, regular people began using computer devices and software for personal and work use. IT specialists need to cope with this trend in various ways. In the 2010s, users now want to have more control over the systems they operate, so they solve their own problems and be able to change, customize and [...] "tweak" [...] the systems to suit their needs. The drawback would be the risk of corruption of the systems and data the user has control of due to his or her lack of knowledge on how to properly operate the computer or software at an advanced level.|$|E
40|$|Virtual worlds—persistent {{virtual reality}} spaces—are {{becoming}} available to users, often for free, via internet connections. Due to the immersive character and malleability of these communities, {{new forms of}} technology-mediated social interaction are emerging. In this paper, ethnographic research conducted in Second Life is used to outline (1) how the reality within these virtual worlds is constructed, (2) what role secondary socialization plays in these groups, and (3) the way the stigmatized identity of the <b>neophyte</b> <b>user</b> (the “newbie”) is conceptualized, confronted and addressed by virtual world residents. This research suggests ways of viewing consumer behavior within virtual worlds and further social research directions...|$|E

40|$|It is now {{possible}} to explore 3 D worlds by using a classical WEB navigator as easily {{as it is to}} view 2 D HTML pages. The capability to use 3 D was previously restricted to powerful machines, it is no more the case. 3 D provides a new interface to communicate. The Definition of realistic virtual humans in those worlds produces more intuitive interface for <b>neophyte</b> <b>users.</b> In this paper, we propose a set of tools to define virtual humans and bring them to life by using a standard 3 D language for the WEB. 1 Introduction Until 1995, information on the WEB was exclusively in two dimensions, using hypertext to organise WEB pages. By {{the emergence of a new}} standard language known as Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), it becomes possible to define a three dimensional world that everybody can examine on the WEB, by using the same navigator as before. The availability of the third dimension opens new doors for the exploitation of the WEB. Numerous disciplines such as architecture o [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Social {{networks}} {{often used}} prefabricated [...] "black box" [...] structures. On one hand, these templates are {{much easier for}} <b>neophyte</b> <b>users</b> to work with, since users simply have to add in information in spaces which indicate the required information. Once the user [...] "saves" [...] or finishes entering the information, the social network website's software system automatically creates a fairly professional-looking layout. [...] "Black box" [...] templates are much simpler to begin using and navigating, but more advanced users may be frustrated that they cannot [...] "tweak" [...] the formatting, amount of content, type of content, etc. For example, most social networks have rules regarding casual users who are uploading (loading files onto the website) audio files to their account. Furthermore, these companies intentionally retain the specific service's look and feel and identity of each user personal account within that corporate social network. For example, all profiles may have the same background color, font and website trademark. The emphasis there is on {{being part of a}} branded [...] "network," [...] not on the [...] "personal," [...] or the individual. Thus, these accounts are not normally thought of as (personal) web sites or home pages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{original}} automatic alignment of definitions taken from different dictionaries {{that could be}} associated to the same concept although they may have different labels. The alignment between a specialized terminology used by the librarians to index concepts and a general vocabulary employed by a <b>neophyte</b> <b>user</b> in order to retrieve documents on Internet, will certainly improve the performances of the information retrieval process. The selected framework is a medical one. We propose a terminology alignment by an SVM classifier trained on a compact, but relevant representation of such definition pair by several similarity measures {{and the length of}} definitions. Three syntactic levels are investigated: Nouns, Nouns-Adjectives, and Nouns-Adjectives-Verbs. Our aim is to show how the combination of similarity measures offers a better semantic access to the document content than only one measure and it improves the performances of the automatic alignment. The results obtained on the test set show the relevance of our approach, as the F-measure reaches 88 %. However, this conclusion should be validated on larger corpora. ...|$|E
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of college students have been reared as researchers {{in an environment where}} boundaries for information have been clearly marked, i. e., that of books and paper text. Increasingly, however, they are called upon to perform tasks in an environment not clearly bounded, that of hyperspace. How do we learn to surf in this unfamiliar medium? What strategies do people use when surfing through the unbounded space of hyperlinks or the World Wide Web (WWW) ? In order to effectively teach students new surfing skills we must be able to understand how <b>neophyte</b> web <b>users</b> form the cognitive neurological networks that result in a mental pathway, or cognitive map, that makes more navigable the route to further information as well as the information they set out to find. A markovian modeling of user's behavior is introduced and compared to a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) that represents the opinions of experts on how users surf the web. Experts are divided on what causes users to fail their queries on the web. This paper shows that a viable FCM model can be developed and some limit-cycle equilibria are uncovered. A FCM limit cycle repeats a sequence of events and actions. Limit cycles can reveal cognitive and behavioral patterns of users on the web. An adaptive FCM is built to reflect its causal behavior in time...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{geographical}} resources (both {{data and}} applications) {{are increasingly being}} accessible via search engines or web services. As a consequence, users must choose among a set of available resources the ones that best fit their needs. However, <b>users</b> <b>neophytes</b> are currently unable to determine a priori (i. e. before acquisition and use), whether a resource is adequate for its intended usage. Although metadata, if available, allow users to obtain information about internal data quality, this metadata is specified {{in terms of the}} data producer, who does not know all the intended uses for the resource. This information is not sufficient for users to evaluate the quality of resources in relation to their needs, i. e. the external quality. In this paper, we propose a method that takes into account the user profile, the application domain, the requirements, and intended use to assess, a priori, the quality of the resources. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.
