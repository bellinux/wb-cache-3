5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although {{the result was a}} defeat, it was <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> means decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to enter on that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly more difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was <b>not,</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> means, an easy safe job.|$|E

5|$|The end {{of silent}} {{film in the}} West and in Japan was imposed by the {{industry}} and the market, <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where {{there was always the}} human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.|$|E
5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the questions the monsters ask feel monotone due to how often they are repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system was fun. In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it to Final Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> means an outstanding game, {{it was one of}} few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E

25|$|The Restoration was {{an age of}} poetry.

It was, to its own people, an age dominated only by the king, and <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> single genius. Throughout the period, the lyric, ariel, historical, and epic poem was being developed.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{maintains}} that the legitimate use of sacramentals in its proper disposition is encouraged only by a firm faith and devotion to the Trinity, and <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> magical or superstitious belief bestowed on the sacramental. In this regard, rosaries, scapulars, medals, and other devotional religious Catholic paraphernalia derive their power, not simply from the symbolism created by the object, but rather from {{the blessing of the}} Catholic Church which comes from the Trinity.|$|E
25|$|But {{from the}} fact that capital posits every such limit as a barrier and hence gets ideally beyond it, it does <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> means follow that it has really {{overcome}} it, and, since every such barrier contradicts its character, its production moves in contradictions which are constantly overcome but just as constantly posited. Furthermore. The universality towards which it irresistibly strives encounters barriers in its own nature, which will, at a certain stage of its development, allow it to be recognized as being itself the greatest barrier to this tendency, and hence will drive towards its own suspension.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, {{it must be}} {{understood}} that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure {{to bring an end}} to Persepolis, Alexander is <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the Sassanid era. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.|$|E
25|$|In 1284, {{war broke}} out between Pisa and Genoa and both Ugolino and Andreotto Saracini were {{appointed}} as captains of two divisions of fleets by Alberto Morosini, the Podestà of Pisa. The two fleets met in August in the Battle of Meloria. The Genoese fought valiantly and destroyed seven Pisan galleys and captured twenty-eight. Among the eleven thousand captives was the Podestà. Ugolino and his division set the sign of surrender and withdrew, deciding the battle in favour of Genoa. This flight was later interpreted as treachery but <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> writer earlier than the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Development {{began in}} early 2016 and was {{publicly}} announced that June, {{with plans to}} have the game ready within a year. Kim served as executive producer for the game. Bluehole started {{with a team of}} about 35 developers supporting Greene's work, but had expanded to 70 by June 2017. Greene stated that many of these developers were voluntarily putting in longer work hours into the game due to their dedication to the project, and <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> mandate from himself or Bluehole's management. In addition to Bluehole, Greene also credits Bohemia Interactive, the developers of ARMA and DayZ, for support with motion capture animations via their Prague studio.|$|E
