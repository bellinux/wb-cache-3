5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E
500|$|Kerry LePage {{wrote in}} his 2004book Some Day Never Comes that he chooses {{to have a nice}} day based on his own choice, not that of another person. J. Broad {{wrote in his}} 2007book Some Day Never Comes that the phrase causes people to feel they have an {{obligation}} to have a nice day. Mike Royko wrote in his 2002 book For the Love of Mike that people may have a bad day, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> one, because they [...] "confront a demanding boss, a nasty customer, a crabby teacher".|$|E
500|$|Benson {{followed}} Gardner's {{pattern of}} setting Bond {{in the contemporary}} timeframe of the 1990s and, according to Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner, he also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK, put him {{behind the wheel of}} a Jaguar XK8 and made him swear more. James Harker noted that [...] "whilst Fleming's Bond had been an Express reader; Benson's is positively red top. He's the first to have group sex... and the first to visit a prostitute", whilst Black notes an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner. In a 1998 interview Benson described his version of Bond as a more ruthless and darker character, stating that [...] "Bond is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy. Bond is a killer... He is an anti-hero." ...|$|E

500|$|Ferguson {{was proud}} of his team's performance, but {{admitted}} their failure throughout the season to convert chances into goals, had cost them once more. Of the game, he continued: [...] "In cup football, you need a break and we didn't get one. We've had luck in the past, so you understand it can happen. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> experience but it's one you have to accept." [...] Ferguson criticised the referee for failing to send Vieira off during extra-time as he fouled Rooney, and labelled Arsenal as [...] "boring" [...] for deploying negative tactics. Keane, like his manager, rued the missed opportunities and said it was a small consolation: [...] "We dominated but I'm sure the Arsenal players won't be too bothered about that – they've got the winners' medals and the cup and we haven't." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E
2500|$|So {{there is}} no {{restriction}} on management's right to dismiss (for instance, giving reasonable notice) if the employee is (a) just bad at his job, (b) <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> person to work with (ba) is retiring (c) is redundant (see below) or (d) the employer is forced to sack someone because of a law (this last one does not come up often). An important detail, however is that an employer may also dismiss, under s.98(1) for [...] "some other substantial reason". For this, see the main page.|$|E

6000|$|MARCH 23. Have {{not seen}} her since that night. Unwell? Sits {{at the fire}} perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But <b>not</b> peevish. <b>A</b> <b>nice</b> bowl of gruel? Won't you now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, mamma," [...] asseverated Peony, {{with much}} gravity in his crimson little phiz; [...] "this is 'ittle snow-child. Is <b>not</b> she <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> one? But, mamma, her hand is, oh, so very cold!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Malfoy {{grew into}} one of the series' most popular {{characters}} due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. [...] "I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> man. It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me a little bit, to see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy." [...] Rowling has also noted that Malfoy [...] "is certainly stylish in the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{you lose}} your {{confidence}} you don't want to bowl again. When I went on the West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When {{you lose your}} confidence it's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption. I appreciated the experience , but after three months with no confidence [...] I was pleased to get back home.|$|E
2500|$|Asked how she {{can write}} so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, [...] "I'm kind of part guy myself." [...] When {{she needs to}} {{understand}} something about how men think, she asks her husband or a male friend. [...] Flynn's autobiographical essay [...] "I Was <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> Little Girl..." [...] invites readers to believe she took inspiration for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like [...] "stunning ants and feeding them to spiders." [...] A favourite indoor game called [...] "Mean Aunt Rosie" [...] allowed Flynn to cast herself as a [...] "witchy caregiver" [...] who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness.|$|E
