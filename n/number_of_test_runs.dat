40|$|Abstract: To {{enable the}} fast {{transition}} to new product variants a modern production plant has to employ flexible manufacturing systems {{which can be}} adopted to new requirements. Modeling and simulation of such adopted configurations is of great help to identify possible system malfunctions already during the manufacturing system design. Therefore the required <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> that <b>runs</b> with the final manufacturing system can be significantly reduced. Besides the cost reduction, also a shorter system setup time is thus achieved. The assumed complete behavioral system model is however not realistic for complex large production systems. Instead, an approach for the modular modeling and simulation of production systems with defined boundaries is required. The underlying problems of modularity in this context are discussed an...|$|R

A response surface model (RSM) can be used to map out a design space using {{a relatively small number of}} experiments. RSM provides an estimate for the value of responses for every possible combination of the factors by varying the values of all factors in parallel, making it possible to comprehend a multi-dimensional surface with non-linear shapes.

40|$|Regression {{testing is}} a testing {{activity}} that is performed to provide confidence that changes do not harm the existing behaviour of the software. Test suites tend to grow in size as software evolve, often making it too costly to execute entire <b>test</b> suites. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> different approaches have been studied to maximise the value <b>of</b> the accrued <b>test</b> suite: minimisation, selection and prioritisation. Test suite minimisation seeks to eliminate redundant test cases {{in order to reduce}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> to <b>run.</b> Test case selection seeks to identify the test cases that are relevant to some set of recent changes. Test case prioritisation seeks to order test cases in such a way that early fault detection is maximised.
