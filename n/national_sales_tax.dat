25|$|National Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) {{was a set}} of {{proposed}} economic reforms suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard. Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bimetallic currency, would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress.|$|E
25|$|Since {{passing the}} FairTax would only require a simple {{majority}} in each house of the United States Congress and the signature of the President, and enactment of a constitutional amendment {{must be approved by}} two thirds of each house of Congress, and three quarters of the individual U.S. states, it is possible that passage of the FairTax bill would simply add another taxation system. If a new income tax bill was passed after the FairTax passage, a combined system could develop. However, there is nothing preventing the addition of a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> or VAT tax, on top of today's income tax system. The Americans For Fair Taxation plan is to first pass the FairTax and then to focus grassroots efforts on HJR 16, sponsored by Congressman Steve King (R-IA), that calls for the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the FairTax on the {{distribution}} of the tax burden is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that it would decrease tax burdens, broaden the tax base, be progressive, increase purchasing power, and tax wealth, while opponents argue that a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. Sales taxes are normally considered regressive; however, the FairTax provides a rebate that supporters argue would create a progressive effective rate on consumption. Under the FairTax, a low-income family may spend $25,000 on goods and services consuming 100% of their income. A higher income family making $100,000 may spend $80,000 on goods and services and save $20,000. The higher income family is consuming only 80% of their income on taxable goods and services. According to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive (using a cross-section time frame). However, when presented with an estimated effective tax rate, the low-income family above would pay a tax rate of 0% on the 100% of consumption and the higher income family would pay a tax rate of 15% on the 80% of consumption. The effective tax rate is progressive on consumption. Using a larger time frame, the other 20% would be consumed and taxed {{at some point in the}} future.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the many {{problems}} perceived with the United States income tax system, four major tax reform proposals are being debated in Congress: the Value-Added Tax, the Flat Tax, the Unlimited Savings Allowance Tax, and the <b>National</b> Retail <b>Sales</b> <b>Tax.</b> Of these, the <b>National</b> Retail <b>Sales</b> <b>Tax</b> is the most different from the existing system. This article summarizes the first three proposals to provide background, and then analyzes the <b>National</b> Retail <b>Sales</b> <b>Tax</b> in detail. To illustrate the impact of the <b>National</b> Retail <b>Sales</b> <b>Tax</b> on individual taxpayers, three model scenarios were developed corresponding to major classes of the people who pay the U. S. personal income tax. Each situation compares the tax liability under the existing U. S. income tax system to the expected tax liability under the <b>National</b> Retail <b>Sales</b> <b>Tax...</b>|$|R

50|$|My name is Ronald Lanham from Mobile, Alabama. And I {{want you}} to tell me, do you support the {{elimination}} of the federal income tax in favor of a <b>national</b> retail <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> also known as the fair tax? Thank you.|$|R
500|$|During his 2008 candidacy, Gravel {{favored a}} {{progressive}} FairTax scheme, which would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, eliminate the {{federal income tax}} (which Gravel referred to as [...] "corrupt"), and impose a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax.</b> To offset the new sales taxes on essential goods, Gravel's plan called for monthly government rebate payments to individuals and families.|$|E
500|$|To become law, {{the bill}} {{will need to be}} {{included}} in a final version of tax legislation from the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, pass both the House and the Senate, and finally be signed by the President. [...] In 2005, President Bush established an advisory panel on tax reform that examined several <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> variants including aspects of the FairTax and noted several concerns. These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this type of tax undesirable to recommend in their final report. [...] The panel did not examine the FairTax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the 2008 presidential election on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill. A poll in 2009 by Rasmussen Reports found that 43% of Americans would support a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds. [...] President Barack Obama did not support the bill, arguing for more progressive changes to the income and payroll tax systems. [...] President Donald Trump has proposed to lower overall income taxation and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.|$|E
500|$|The FairTax's {{effect on}} the {{distribution}} of taxation or tax incidence (the {{effect on the}} distribution of economic welfare) is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that the tax would broaden the tax base, that it would be progressive, and that it would decrease tax burdens and start taxing wealth (reducing the economic gap). Opponents argue that a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. A person earning $2 million a year could live well spending $1 million, and as a result pay a mere 11% of that year's income in taxes. Households {{at the lower end of}} the income scale spend almost all their income, while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving. [...] Therefore, according to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income).|$|E
5000|$|The party {{believes}} that the 16th Amendment was never properly ratified and must be repealed.

500|$|Opponents {{point to}} a study {{commissioned}} by the National Retail Federation in 2000 that found a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> bill filed by Billy Tauzin, the Individual Tax Freedom Act (...) , would bring a three-year decline in the economy, a four-year decline in employment and an eight-year decline in consumer spending. Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto states the FairTax is unsuited {{to take advantage of}} supply-side effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money. [...] John Linder states an estimated $11 trillion is held in foreign accounts (largely for tax purposes), which he states would be repatriated back to U.S. banks if the FairTax were enacted, becoming available to U.S. capital markets, bringing down interest rates, and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States. [...] Attorney Allen Buckley states that a tremendous amount of wealth was already repatriated under law changes in 2004 and 2005. Buckley also argues that if the tax rate was significantly higher, the FairTax would discourage the consumption of new goods and hurt economic growth.|$|E
500|$|The President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform {{cited the}} rebate {{as one of}} their chief {{concerns}} when analyzing their <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> stating that it would be the largest entitlement program in American history, and contending that it would [...] "make most American families dependent on monthly checks from the federal government". Estimated by the advisory panel at approximately $600 billion, [...] "the Prebate program would cost more than all budgeted spending in 2006 on the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior combined." [...] Proponents point out that income tax deductions, tax preferences, loopholes, credits, etc. under the current system was estimated at $945 billion by the Joint Committee on Taxation. They argue this is $456 billion more than the FairTax [...] "entitlement" [...] (tax refund) would spend to cover each person's tax expenses up to the poverty level. In addition, it was estimated for 2005 that the Internal Revenue Service was already sending out $270 billion in refund checks.|$|E
500|$|FairTax opponents {{state that}} {{compliance}} decreases when taxes are not automatically withheld from citizens, and that massive tax evasion could result by collecting at just {{one point in}} the economic system. Compliance rates can also fall when taxed entities, rather than a third party, self-report their tax liability. For example, ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party. Taxes without withholding and with self-reporting, such as the FairTax, can see higher evasion rates. [...] Economist Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service found studies showing that evasion rates of sales taxes are often above 10%, even when the sales tax rate is in the single digits. [...] Tax publications by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), IMF, and Brookings Institution have suggested that the upper limit for a sales tax is about 10% before incentives for evasion become too great to control. According to the GAO, 80% of state tax officials opposed a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> as an intrusion on their tax base. Opponents also raise concerns of legal tax avoidance by spending and consuming outside of the U.S. (imported goods would be subject to collection by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection).|$|E

500|$|Gale {{analyzed}} a <b>national</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> (though {{different from}} the FairTax in several aspects) and reported that the overall tax burden on middle-income Americans would increase while the tax burden on the top 1% would drop. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax may {{have a negative effect}} on the well-being of mid-income earners for several years after implementation. According to the President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform report, which compared the individual and corporate income tax (excluding other taxes the FairTax replaces) to a sales tax with rebate, the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $15,000â€“$50,000 would rise from 3.6% to 6.7%, while the burden on those earning more than $200,000 would fall from 53.5% to 45.9%. [...] The report states that the top 5% of earners would see their burden decrease from 58.6% to 37.4%. FairTax supporters argue that replacing the regressive payroll tax (a 15.3% total tax not included in the Tax Panel study; payroll taxes include a 12.4% Social Security tax on wages up to $97,500 and a 2.9% Medicare tax, a 15.3% total tax that is often split between employee and employer) greatly changes the tax distribution, and that the FairTax would relieve the tax burden on middle-class workers.|$|E

A bitter Senate battle ensued, and many polls showed that as many as 80% of Canadians were opposed to the tax. Mulroney had to use Section 26 (the Deadlock Clause), a little known Constitutional provision, allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint 8 new Senators.

40|$|This study makes a novel {{contribution}} to the ongoing fundamental tax reform debate with its investigation of how proposed reform will affect the international economic position of the United States and especially whether they could be adjusted at the border. It focuses on the business component of the three most popular proposals: the <b>national</b> retail <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> the Nunn- Domenici Unlimited Savings Allowance Tax (USA Tax), and the flat tax. If the taxes are adjusted, as the authors propose, they can be rebated on exports {{of goods and services}} and imposed on imports. To determine whether adjustment is permissible, the study examines the international rules of governing border tax adjustments. The existing rules distinguish between direct and indirect taxes, between goods and services, and between exports and imports. The authors conclude that there is no problem in adjusting a <b>national</b> retail <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> on internationally traded goods and services. While the outcome is not cut-and-dried, the business component of the USA Tax is probably also adjustable, both on goods and services and on exports and imports. The biggest international questions will arise if border adjustments are applied to exports of goods under the flat tax. The authors suggest that changes in the international rules may be needed to permit border adjustments for the flat tax. ...|$|R

The study concludes that consumption will be higher in the fourth year and every year thereafter than it would have been under the income tax. [...] Research in 2006 on the FairTax plan by Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics shows that consumption would increase by 2.4% in the first year of the FairTax. The increase in consumption would be fueled by the 1.7% increase in disposable (after-tax) personal income.
