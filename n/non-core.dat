30|$|The {{research}} takes theoretical thinking forward, {{more than}} empirical investigation, although {{it includes a}} case study of China. In order to take more fully the Chinese innovation situation into account and seek answers to the given questions, a cored model is proposed to compensate the ‘existing <b>non-cored</b> model’. It is argued that institution and function as primary concepts in a triple helix study must be differentiated to improve the existing <b>non-cored</b> model that lacks distinction of institution and function concepts. The Chinese triple helix is thus shown more clearly based on this theoretical exploration, where cores of both institutional and functional spheres overlap. The relations among the spheres result in a government-pulled model that is evolving to an optimum triple helix.|$|R
40|$|Non-mycorrhizal {{seedlings}} ofBetula pendula {{were planted}} around an 11 -year old tree ofB. pubescens in an experimental plot at Bush Estate, south of Edinburgh. Half (23) of the seedlings were in untreated planting positions and half (24) in positions {{that had been}} cored to sever connections of the roots with the parent tree. After 17 weeks, seedlings in the <b>non-cored</b> positions bore mycorrhizas mainly ofLactarius pubescens whereas mycorrhizas of this species were uncommon on seedlings in cored positions. Much smaller and usually non-significant differences were found with respect to other mycorrhizal types in cored and <b>non-cored</b> positions. It is concluded thatL. pubescens infected seedling roots by means of mycelial strands which must remain attached to the parent tree (food base) in order to infect.

40|$|The {{innervation}} of {{the cardiac}} ganglia of rats was investigated by light and electron microscopies. The same specimens were studied by histochemical methods. The cardiac ganglia were distributed densely around the pulmonary veins {{and consisted of}} nerve cells, satellite cells, nerve fibers, Schwann cells and connective tissue containing many fat cells. Most preganglionic nerve fibers ended in the dendrites of nerve cells, which were surrounded by Schwann cells. A few fibers invaginated and ended in the nerve cell body. Most nerve endings contained only <b>non-cored</b> vesicles (50 nm), but a few endings contained large dense core vesicles (100 nm) as well as <b>non-cored</b> vesicles. Under light microscopy, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reaction was strongly positive in all nerve cells of all cardiac ganglia. By electoron microscopy, the reaction site {{was found to be}} the narrow space between axon and nerve ending membranes and Schwann cells. These ganglia were investigated by the Falck-Hillarp method by fluorescence microscopy, and we confirmed that all ganglia did not contain sympathetic nerve endings. However there were small cells (10 microns in diameter) which showed intense fluorescence. These cells contained osmiophillic granules (150 - 300 nm) and showed features similar to small intensely fluorescent cells (SIF cells). Around these cells, fenestrated capillaries were observed. From these results, it was confirmed that the cardiac ganglia of rats were innervated by parasympathetic nerves and that SIF cells were present...|$|R

30|$|To {{summarize}} the sedimentary {{characteristics of the}} four different kinds of petrofacies in the study area, the overall color of the mudstone is mainly gray to black, which reflects conditions of weak oxidation and reduction. The cross-beddings and parallel beddings are smaller scale, reflecting weak hydrodynamic conditions. The distal bar is developing, and the phenomenon of biological disturbance is obvious, which reflects characteristics of shallow-water deposition. Therefore, the sedimentary environment {{of the study area}} is interpreted as a shallow-water delta front. Based on the analysis of the petrofacies types from the well core data, the well logging facies models of the different types were established based on rock electric calibration (Fig.  11). The sedimentary petrofacies types of <b>non-cored</b> wells can be explained according to the logging curves of different types.|$|R

30|$|The {{saturation}} height function presented above {{can be used}} {{to establish}} the water saturation model between wells.

Secondly, a link is set up between rock types and log responses, and then the logs are utilized to predict rock types of <b>non-cored</b> wells according to this link. With the rock types of each well known, a 3 D rock-type model will be established through sequential indicator simulation. The R 30 value of each grid can be calculated by the R 30 formula when a three-dimensional porosity and permeability model is built up with the restraint of the rock-type model. Then the threshold pressure, irreducible water saturation and Corey exponent can be obtained from Eqs. (3)–(5). The water saturation of each grid can be obtained from Eq. (6).|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} strong-lensing {{analysis}} of MACSJ 0717. 5 + 3745 (hereafter MACS J 0717), {{based on the}} full depth of the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) observations, which brings the number of multiply imaged systems to 61, ten {{of which have been}} spectroscopically confirmed. The total number of images comprised in these systems rises to 165, compared to 48 images in 16 systems before the HFF observations. Our analysis uses a parametric mass reconstruction technique, as implemented in the LENSTOOL software, and the subset of the 132 most secure multiple images to constrain a mass distribution composed of four large-scale mass components (spatially aligned with the four main light concentrations) and a multitude of galaxy-scale perturbers. We find a superposition of cored isothermal mass components to provide a good fit to the observational constraints, resulting in a very shallow mass distribution for the smooth (large-scale) component. Given the implications of such a flat mass profile, we investigate whether a model composed of “peaky” <b>non-cored</b> mass components can also reproduce the observational constraints. We find that such a <b>non-cored</b> mass model reproduces the observational constraints equally well, in the sense that both models give comparable total rms. Although the total (smooth dark matter component plus galaxy-scale perturbers) mass distributions of both models are consistent, as are the integrated two-dimensional mass profiles, we find that the smooth and the galaxy-scale components are very different. We conclude that, even in the HFF era, the generic degeneracy between smooth and galaxy-scale components is not broken, in particular in such a complex galaxy cluster. Consequently, insights into the mass distribution of MACS J 0717 remain limited, emphasizing the need for additional probes beyond strong lensing. Our findings also have implications for estimates of the lensing magnification. We show that the amplification difference between the two models is larger than the error associated with either model, and that this additional systematic uncertainty is approximately the difference in magnification obtained by the different groups of modelers using pre-HFF data. This uncertainty decreases the area of the image plane where we can reliably study the high-redshift Universe by 50 to 70 %...|$|R
3000|$|This {{investigation}} utilizes {{a matrix}} observation method to analyze triple helices. Firstly, by analyzing a unique Chinese academic phenomenon, the university-run enterprise (URE), a ‘cored model’ is proposed {{to complement the}} existing <b>non-cored</b> model of a triple helix study. The URE remains within the university administration, {{in contrast to the}} US spin-off firm that exits quickly. This difference raises the issue of how boundaries among the institutional spheres should be defined. Secondly, institutional and functional spheres are differentiated as separate concepts. Based on the theoretical research, a matrix observation method of a triple helix is invented. Finally, as a typical case, we observe Chinese triple helix (CTH), showing how to use the observation method. The most important contribution of this research is that it develops a methodology to analyze a triple helix through a matrix with four dimensions (Table one). Two questions have been explored and they are as follows: (1) Should a URE remain within university administration? (2) How may the Chinese triple helix with a dominant government role be improved?

30|$|The {{saturation}} height functions {{can describe}} the drainage process during the hydrocarbon migration and are {{expressed as a}} relationship among the saturation, the height above the free water level and some model properties (commonly porosity and permeability). It {{can be used for}} the accurate modeling of water saturation, which has an effect on the geological reserve calculation, recoverable oil prediction and the future development planning. For a reservoir, the water saturation height functions are quite various. These variations are significant and difficult to estimate (Cuddy et al. 1993; Paul 2001; Kumar 2011; Seth et al. 2013). If the functions are not suitable for a reservoir, it will lead to inaccurate approximations during the process of the numerical simulation history matching for a field (Obinna et al. 2010; Joseph et al. 2012). Because of the wide range of lateral variations of the physical properties, carbonate reservoirs often have poor or no porosity/permeability correlation which will increase the complication in building capillary pressure models for <b>non-cored</b> wells (Buiting and Aramco 2011; Guo et al. 2007; Ibrahim 2009).|$|R
40|$|First online: 13 January 2016 Rock {{drilling}} Penetration Rate (PR) {{is influenced}} by many parameters including rock properties, machine parameters of the chosen rig and the working process. Five datasets were utilized to quantitatively assess the effect of various rock properties on PR. The datasets consisted of two sets of diamond and percussive drilling and one set of rotary drilling data. A new rating system called Rock Drillability Characterization index (RDCi) is proposed to predict PR for different drilling methods. This drillability model incorporates {{the uniaxial compressive strength}} of intact rock, the P-wave velocity and the density of rock. The RDCi system is further applied to predict PR in the diamond rotary drilling, <b>non-coring</b> rotary drilling and percussive drilling. Strong correlations between PR and RDCi values were observed indicating that the developed drillability rating model is relevant and can be utilized to effectively predict the rock drillability in any operating environment.

Interval A is a positive excursion, where the δ 13 Ccarb values shift from 0.1 to 1.3  ‰ from the top of the Yijianfang Formation to the lower Qiaerbak Formation. Interval B is a negative excursion, where the fluctuation range of δ 13 Ccarb values in the middle of the Qiaerbak Formation is at least − 0.3  ‰. This negative excursion is estimated from the difference between upper and lower values, because of <b>non-coring</b> in this well. But it is confirmed by other wells drilled in the western Tabei Uplift (Bao et al. 2006). Interval C is a positive excursion, and the δ 13 Ccarb values fluctuate up to 1.4  ‰ from the top of the Qiaerbak Formation to the bottom of the Lianglitag Formation. Interval D is a negative excursion, where δ 13 Ccarb values decrease rapidly in the upper part of the Lianglitag Formation and fluctuate up to 2.1  ‰.
