In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%.

We know very little about the factors that influence the willingness and ability of hospitals, clinics, and physicians to provide abortion services over time. Based on state data from 1978 to 1992, the results of this paper suggest that large abortion providers are better able to compete and survive in the market. Also clinics and physicians' offices appear to be gaining market share relative to hospitals.

Similarly, Protestants were given an abortion index of 0.75–0.84, other religions 1.23–1.41, and non-religious women 1.38–1.59. An earlier study by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research determined U.S. Protestants to have an abortion index of 0.69, Catholics 1.01, Jews 1.08, and non-Judeo-Christian religions 0.78.
