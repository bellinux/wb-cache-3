5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary <b>narrative</b> <b>as</b> a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E

40|$|Graphic Narratives (a {{term used}} interchangeably with comic books and graphic novels) {{have been a}} {{traditionally}} maligned medium within literature, especially in regard to professional pedagogy in secondary education. However, many scholars and professional educators have recently spoken out about the richness and possibility for cognitive growth within this medium and its use in the secondary classroom. I use this thesis to analyze their arguments and plead with professional educators everywhere to make curricular adjustments based on the inclusion of such materials.

5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution <b>narrative</b> <b>as</b> evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{focuses on}} Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old {{photography}} student who discovers {{that she has}} the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect.

Fetch quests and making environmental changes represent the forms of puzzle solving in addition to using branching choices for conversation.|$|E
5|$|Nojima {{was charged}} with writing the {{scenario}} and with unifying the team members' ideas into a cohesive <b>narrative,</b> <b>as</b> Kitase was impressed with his earlier work on the mystery-like Heracles no Eikō III: Kamigami no Chinmoku, an entry in the Glory of Heracles series. To make the characters seem more realistic, Nojima wrote them so they would not unanimously agree, with some raising objections instead: while this inevitably slowed down {{the pace of the}} story, it added depth to the characters. The graphical improvements enabled even relatively bland lines of dialogue to be enhanced. As the inclusion of voice acting would have lead to significant load times, it was decided to be omitted. Another writer who contributed was Masato Kato, who wrote several late-game scenes including the Lifestream sequence and Cloud and Tifa's conversation before the final battle. Initially not involved with the project, he was called upon to help flesh out less important story scenes. He wrote his scenes to his own tastes without outside consultation, something he later regretted.|$|E

5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life when he was an active member of the security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his <b>narrative</b> <b>as</b> a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but most of the time he feels more like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} set in Regency England somewhere around 1818, and events are related through third-person <b>narrative.</b> <b>As</b> the story opens, a wealthy, {{beautiful}} and intelligent woman named Annis Wychwood reaches the age of majority. Now having greater control over her personal and financial affairs, Annis decides to move to Bath and live alone, to the displeasure of her brother and his family. Several years later, {{on the way back}} to Bath after a visit to her childhood home, Annis meets Lucilla Carleton and Ninian Elmore. Lucilla is running away to Bath to avoid her marriage to Ninian, a match that her guardian is very much in favour of, and Ninian is escorting her to ensure her safe arrival. Annis volunteers to chaperone Lucilla and notifies the girl's guardian of her plans.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with <b>narrative,</b> <b>as</b> well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E

5|$|Æthelberht was {{succeeded in}} Kent {{by his son}} Eadbald. Bede states that after Æthelberht's death Eadbald refused to be baptised and married his stepmother, an act {{forbidden}} by {{the teachings of the}} Roman Church. Although Bede's account makes Laurence's miraculous flogging the trigger for Eadbald's baptism, this completely ignores the political and diplomatic problems facing Eadbald. There are also chronological problems with Bede's <b>narrative,</b> <b>as</b> surviving papal letters contradict Bede's account. Historians differ on the exact date of Eadbald's conversion. D. P. Kirby argues that papal letters imply that Eadbald was converted during the time that Justus was Archbishop of Canterbury, which was after Laurence's death, and long after the death of Æthelberht. Henry Mayr-Harting accepts the Bedan chronology as correct, and feels that Eadbald was baptised soon after his father's death. Higham agrees with Kirby that Eadbald did not convert immediately, contending that the king supported Christianity but did not convert for at least eight years after his father's death.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study was to}} {{describe}} the lived stories of four Metis women {{in the form of}} collective <b>narratives.</b> And, <b>as</b> a Metis woman, I have reflected on the collective <b>narratives</b> <b>as</b> a way of interpreting and making meaning out of our lived stories in order to gain knowledge. The literature which I reviewed as I came to understand the parameters of my study included the stories of Metis women which have been published in literary forms. As well, I reviewed literature pertaining to stories as an expression of human existence, the study of meaning in stories, and stories, meaning and knowledge. The research was conducted using a qualitative research design. The participants and I engaged in conversations, and the stories which emerged formed the content of my data. After I was given approval from my participants to use their lived stories, I created the collective <b>narratives</b> <b>as</b> an expression of how I understand our stories. The stories were presented as three collective narratives: identity, family and soul murder. Then, I reflected on each of the collective <b>narratives</b> <b>as</b> an example of how I make meaning and gain knowledge. The findings from my study suggest that the stories emerged in a collective manner and that I, as a Metis woman, view our stories collectively and not as singular entities. As well, my reflections present a written account of how I make meaning from the collective <b>narratives</b> <b>as</b> a way to gain knowledge. As a cultural insider, I may be presenting a perspective in understanding our lived stories which has not been articulated in the past.
