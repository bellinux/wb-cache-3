Best estimates are often, out of necessity, from a context of less than quality evidence or needing more evidence to provide accuracy. Purpose: The {{purpose of this article}} is to understand the <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> behavior, so that clinicians and patients may have confidence in its quantification and validation. Methods: To discover <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> and quantify uncertainty, critical appraisals of the literature, gray literature and its resources, or both are accomplished. Best {{estimates of}} pairwise comparisons are calculated using meta-analytic methods; multiple comparisons use network meta-analysis. Manufacturers provide margins of performance of proprietary material(s). Lower margin performance thresholds or requirements (functional failure) of materials are determined by a distribution of tests to quantify performance or clinical competency. The same is done for the high margin performance thresholds (estimated true value of success) and clinician-derived critical values (material failure to function clinically). This quantification of margins and uncertainties assists clinicians in determining if reported <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are progressing toward true value as new knowledge is reported. Analysis: The <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> of outcomes focuses on evidence-centered care. In stochastic environments, we are not able to observe all events in all situations to know without uncertainty the <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> of predictable outcomes. Point-in-time analyses of <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> using quantification of margins and uncertainties do this. Conclusion: While study design and methodology are variables known to validate the quality of evidence from which <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are acquired, missing are tolerance margins, or upper and lower performance requirements and clinician critical values, within which <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> behave and are validated. Understanding the <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> behavior toward true value may provide clinicians and patients confidence in decision making under uncertainty.

40|$|As reserving actuaries {{focus more}} on reserve ranges and less on point estimates, the {{question}} of how to develop a reasonable reserve range in the aggregate becomes more and more relevant. When working with a single set of "best estimates", the answer is simple- assuming all the <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are the mean values for each block of business being analyzed, the <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> for the total is equal to the sum of the parts. However, if the by line <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are other than the mean values, the sum of the parts is not the same as the <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> for the aggregate. This paper presents two possible approaches to developing aggregate reserve indications when looking at results other than the mean value. The approaches both rely on a simulation model. One takes in the actuary's judgment as to the correlations between the different underlying blocks of business and the second uses bootstrapping to eliminate the need for the actuary to make judgment calls about the nature of the correlations.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of surveys of specialists in labor {{economics}} and public economics at 40 leading research universities in the United States. Respondents provided opinions of policy proposals; quantitative <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> and 95 % confidence intervals for economic parameters; answers to values questions regarding income redistribution, efficiency versus equity, and individual versus social responsibility; and their political party identification. We find considerable disagreement among economists about policy proposals. Their positions on policy are {{more closely related to}} their values than to their estimates of relevant economic parameters or to their political party identification. Average <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> of the economic parameters agree well with the ranges summarized in surveys of relevant literature, but the individual <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are usually widely dispersed. Moreover, economists, like experts in many fields, appear more confident of their estimates than the substantial cross-respondent variation in estimates would warrant. Finally although the confidence intervals in general appear to be too narrow, respondents whose <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are farther from the median tend to give wider confidence intervals for those estimates. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} describes some {{specifics of}} the algorithm for <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> evaluation of radiation fluxes at Southern Great Plains (SGP) Central Facility (CF). It uses the data available from the three co-located surface radiometer platforms at the SGP CF to automatically determine the <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> of the irradiance measurements available. The Best Estimate Flux (BEFlux) value-added procedure (VAP) was previously named Best Estimate ShortWave (BESW) VAP, which included all of the broadband and spectral shortwave (SW) measurements for the SGP CF. In BESW, multiple measurements of the same quantities were handled simply by designating one as the primary measurement and using all others to merely fill in any gaps. Thus, this “BESW” is better termed “most continuous,” since no additional quality assessment was applied. We modified the algorithm in BESW to use {{the average of the}} closest two measurements as the <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> when possible, if these measurements pass all quality assessment criteria. Furthermore, we included longwave (LW) fields in the <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> evaluation to include all major components of the surface radiative energy budget, and renamed the VAP to Best Estimate Flux (BEFLUX 1 LONG) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to engender}} an {{awareness}} of the psychological, technological, and operational obstacles which confront actuaries throughout the reserving process, preventing them from developing appropriate <b>best</b> <b>estimates.</b> Although reserving issues are a regular subject in actuarial literature, nowhere is the term “best estimate ” defined. In response to this absence, the authors consider criteria for actuaries to target in developing a <b>best</b> <b>estimate,</b> settling on two ideals: precision and lack of bias. This paper examines issues related to limits on human intelligence, performance, and judgment, and considers the impact of external constraints, business agendas, and methodological issues. The individual actuary’s response to these issues [...] in addition to any reaction to specific statistical patterns and sensitivity to the work environment [...] all significantly impact the reserving process. In fact, each actuary may be viewed as a reserve estimator-whose “parameters ” have been set by a combination of ability, personality, and experience-which produces <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> in response to specific sets of data, reserving models, and business realities. This paper also explores practical reserving considerations and concludes with several recommendations for reserving actuaries to implement {{in order to reduce the}} bias, and improve the precision, of their <b>best</b> <b>estimates...</b>|$|R
