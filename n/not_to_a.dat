5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} long facade with its two wings of {{contrasting}} architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval {{windows of the}} left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean balustrade was repeated above the Gothic right-hand wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use castellations instead of a balustrade on the right-hand side. Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The {{focal point of the}} facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting to the ceiling of the passage leading, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).|$|E

25|$|Finally, the Suebic {{conversion}} is ascribed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Suebe, {{but to a}} Visigoth, by the chronicler John of Biclarum. He {{put their}} conversion alongside that of the Goths, occurring under Reccared I in 587–589, but, as such, this corresponds to a later time, when the kingdom was undergoing its integration to the Visigoths' one.|$|E
25|$|The {{appeals court}} {{reversed}} {{the lower court}} and reinstated the suit against Zicari and Romano, ruling that the lower court had erred in setting aside the federal obscenity statutes, which had been repeatedly upheld in Supreme Court decisions. The appeals court pointed to previous Supreme Court opinions stating {{that the right to}} decide whether a subsequent Supreme Court ruling invalidates an earlier one belongs to the Supreme Court alone, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lower court.|$|E

25|$|Reviewing the case, {{members of}} Holyrood's justice {{committee}} stated that Scottish Prison Service guidelines were not {{followed in the}} decision to release Megrahi, that the medical evidence presented was flimsy, and that four cancer specialists had refused to back up the opinion of the prison doctor that Megrahi would be dead within three months. However the prison doctors and numerous experts brought in had said that Megrahi met the Scottish standards for release. The release of prisoners on compassionate grounds is up to the Minister of Justice and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> committee.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} process takes considerable time and planning since it involves multiple steps, with choices {{to be made}} and deadlines to be met. Students file separate applications to each school, although the Common Application expedites the process in many instances. Most undergraduate institutions admit students to the entire college and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular department or major, unlike many European universities and American graduate schools, although some undergraduate programs such as architecture or engineering may require a separate application at some universities. As a general rule, applying to two-year county and community colleges is much easier than to a four-year school, often requiring only a high school transcript or minimum test score.|$|E
25|$|The federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit (income {{tax credit}} on IRS Form 5695) for {{residential}} PV and solar thermal was extended in December 2015 {{to remain at}} 30% of system cost (parts and installation) for systems put into service {{by the end of}} 2019, then 26% until the end of 2020, and then 22% until the end of 2021. It applies to a taxpayer's principal and/or second residences, but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> property that is rented out. There is no maximum cap on the credit, and the credit can be applied toward the Alternative Minimum Tax, and any excess credit (greater than that year's tax liability) can be rolled into the following year.|$|E

25|$|Althusser's {{influence}} is also {{seen in the}} work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick, who have interpreted that Marx's mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones. For them, in Marx class refers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> group of people (for example, those that own the means of production versus those that do not), but to a process involving the production, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor. Their emphasis on class as a process is consistent with their reading and use of Althusser's concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.|$|E
25|$|On 18 January 2002, President Kabbah {{declared}} the eleven-year-long Sierra Leone Civil War officially over. By most estimates, over 50,000 people {{had lost their}} lives during the war. Countless more fell victim to the reprehensible and perverse behavior of the combatants. In May 2002 President Kabbah and his party, the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), won landslide victories in the presidential and legislative elections. Kabbah was re-elected for a five-year term. The RUF's political wing, the Revolutionary United Front Party (RUFP), failed to win a single seat in parliament. The elections were marked by irregularities and allegations of fraud, but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> degree that significantly affected the outcome.|$|E
25|$|On February 10, 2015, a {{streetcar}} {{connecting the}} Milwaukee Intermodal Station with the city's {{lower east side}} {{was approved by the}} Common Council, bringing if <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt then at least to a pause, decades of sometimes acrimonious debate. On a 9–6 vote, the council approved a measure that established the project's $124 million capital budget, its estimated $3.2 million operating and maintenance budget and its 2.5-mile route, which includes a lakefront spur connecting the line to the proposed $122 million, 44-story Couture. Construction on the Milwaukee Streetcar will start March 2017, with initial operation by mid-2018. The Lakefront service is expected to start operation by 2019.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Guatemala President Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes {{ordered his}} P-51 Mustangs to attack five Mexican fishing vessels in contested waters. Soon after that incident, Roberto Fierro and Luis Farell were {{appointed}} Chief and Sub-Chief of the Mexican Air Force, respectively. At this time, Mexico had no natural enemies and {{was dedicated to}} industrial growth, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> military buildup. The conflict was resolved with diplomacy. Farell and Fierro concluded that the Mexican Air Force could not confront the powerful P-51 Mustang aircraft if required again, so they purchased a fleet of Vampire MK-3 jets made available by Canada, and Lockheed T-33 jets from the USA. Farell applied himself at establishing a system that would never leave Mexico in such vulnerable position again — a difficult task given the limited budget available.|$|E
25|$|Murals were {{a common}} form of wall {{decoration}} in ancient Rome. The earliest Christian mural paintings come from the catacombs of Rome. They include many representations of Christ as the Good Shepherd, generally as a standardised image of a young, beardless man with a sheep on his shoulders. Other popular subjects include the Madonna and Child, Jonah being thrown into the sea, the three young men in the furnace and the Last Supper. In one remarkable mural, in the Catacomb of the Aurelii, is the earliest image of Jesus, as he came to be commonly depicted, as a bearded, Jewish man in long robes. In this particular image he is preaching, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> group of people but to a flock of sheep and goats, representing the faithful and the wayward.|$|E
25|$|Piccadilly is the {{transport}} interchange {{of the city}} centre with rail, tram and bus services all within a five-minute walk. The area is typically busy with pedestrians commuting {{to and from the}} city centre. The area is dominated by Piccadilly Gardens. It is the largest public square in the centre which was redeveloped in the early 2000s but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> universally positive reception. For over 150 years Manchester Royal Infirmary was located on the site but closed in 1914. A few years after closure the hospital was demolished and public space was created with a landscaped garden set into the ground – hence the name. The area has a dedicated tram station and bus station which has over 20 stands. Most of the stands are located on the south-west side of the square with the rest on the north side.|$|E
