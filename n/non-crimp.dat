5000|$|Stitch-Bonding is {{a special}} form of warp {{knitting}} [...] and is commonly used {{for the production of}} composite materials and technical textiles. As a method of production, stitch-bonding is efficient, {{and is one of the}} most modern ways to create reinforced textiles and composite materials [...] for industrial use. The advantages of the stitch-bonding process includes its high productivity rate and the scope it offers for functional design of textiles, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. [...] Stitch-bonding involves layers of threads and fabric being joined together with a knitting thread, which creates a layered structure called a multi-ply. [...] This is created through a warp-knitting thread system, which is fixed on the reverse side of the fabric with a sinker loop, and a weft thread layer. [...] A needle with the warp thread passes through the material, which requires the warp and knitting threads to be moving both parallel and perpendicular to the vertical/warp direction of the stitch-bonding machine. [...] Stitch-bonded fabrics are currently being used in such fields as wind energy generation and aviation. [...] Research is currently being conducted into the usage and benefits of stitch-bonded fabrics as a way to reinforce concrete. Fabrics produced with this process offer the potential of using “sensitive fiber materials such as glass and carbon with only little damage, <b>non-crimp</b> fiber orientation and variable distance between threads”.|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} resistance and mechanisms of biaxial and triaxial <b>non-crimp</b> fabrics under bias extension loading is experimentally investigated. The bias {{deformation resistance}} of multiaxial <b>non-crimp</b> fabrics {{is found to}} be substantially lower than conventional single layer woven fabric due to the unique deformation mechanisms of rotation, sliding and compaction of the fibre tows. It is shown that the amount, line-tension and location of the warp-knitted stitches used to bind <b>non-crimp</b> fabrics have a major influence on the bias deformation resistance. It is found that lowering the amount and line-tension of the stitches facilities the tow sliding mechanism that reduces the deformation resistance of <b>non-crimp</b> fabrics. Fabric deformation is also affected by the location of the stitches, with stitches that pass between, rather than through, the tows reducing the resistance to bias deformation, again due to increasing ease of the tow sliding process.

40|$|Larssen piles are U-shaped in {{cross-section}} and are connected together by sliding joints to form quay walls, cofferdams {{and other types}} of retaining walls. Since the sliding joints are located along the centreline of the pile wall, slippage of one pile relative to another can lead to a 70 % reduction in elastic bending strength. This slippage can be partially prevented by installing the piles in pairs, with the interlocks ‘crimped’ to prevent inter-pile movement. However, like <b>non-crimped</b> piles, the bending strength is difficult to predict since slip still can occur between the crimped pile pairs. This paper presents a numerical model for predicting the bending stresses and crimp forces in crimped pairs of Larssen piles. Tests are also reported on one-sixth scale pile walls constructed from extruded aluminium Larssen piles, with the results compared with those from the numerical model. Stress predictions from the numerical model are shown to be in close agreement with the experimental results, and can be used to economise on the crimping necessary to achieve the full composite bending strength. <br/...|$|R

The response of tufted and untufted carbon/epoxy non crimped fabric composites produced using resin infusion is investigated in axial tension and compression and cyclic [± 45] loading. The out-of-plane response is studied in mode I and mode II delamination tests. Tufted material has significantly higher delamination resistance and lower in plane properties in tension and compression. Tufted and untufted non crimp fab-ric composites have similar response in shear {{in terms of both}} plastic strain and strength. Op-tical strain measurements allowed monitoring of the two dimensional damage field in cyclic experiments. Damage tends to be localised in untufted specimens, whereas it becomes more uniform across the width of specimens with tufts. Material models for untufted and tufted <b>non-crimped</b> fabric composites simulating both non-linear in-plane behaviour and delamina-tion damage were developed.

40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry {{is committed to}} improving the performance of aircraft whilst reducing emissions and weight. Part of this goal can be achieved {{with the use of}} new types of composite materials, such as <b>non-crimp</b> fabric composites. These new composites, still under development, are made from dry fabrics and combine in theory the excellent in-plane behaviour of the unidirectional pre-impregnated tape composites with better out-of-plane behaviour and lower cost of the woven fabric composites. In practice, however, due to several parameters associated with the different stages of manufacturing of the <b>non-crimp</b> fabric laminates, some in-plane and out-of-plane waviness at the mesoscopic scale is introduced. This waviness (typically called crimp) is responsible for lowering the in-plane behaviour and causing specific failure models. A new method to efficiently model the fibre crimp of the tows in mesoscopic scale 3 D finite element models of <b>non-crimp</b> fabric laminates is presented in this study. This method consists of modelling the fibre crimp using straight meshes and “rotating” the mechanical properties according to the actual direction of the fibres. In order to ensure the validity of this method, it has been compared with previously developed methods in which the mesh is curved along the fibres direction.

Between 4. 9 % and 5. 8 % of patients had graft deterioration-nearly the same incidence in all four types of grafts. Deterioration consisted of thinning and breakage of yarn filaments, causing development of holes and, in some cases, graft dilatation. Dilatation did not always precede filament breakage. Broken filament ends were either tapered or square-ended, suggesting that modes of breakage. Tensile strength tests howed that fibers sometimes weakened nonuniformly within a specimen. Fiber breakage was associated with crimp ridges. The findings suggest that manufacturing variations probably reduce fiber resistance to mechanical fatigue.

Sixty-three patients had a stapedotomy with a K-piston Titanium (No. 1006107) type and 63 patients received a CliP-piston àWengen Titanium (No. 1006807) type after stapedotomy.

Compared to labor intensive hand layup prepreg technologies, Light RTM offers some substantial advantages by reducing infrastructure requirements such as hydraulic presses or autoclaves. Compared to Prepreg, Light RTM tooling creates two finished surfaces, which is an advantage during installation due to improved dimensional accuracy. The focus of this work was to develop means of achieving high fiber volume fraction structural frames using low cost tooling and a low volume manufacturing strategy.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} few years were {{developed}} some manufacturing processes involving resin impregnation in dry preforms prior to cure, and more specically resin infusion across the fabric thickness in the so-called Resin Infusion Processes. Therefore, in these growingly used processes the transverse permeability of the fabrics will control both manufacturing cycles and dimensions, and consequently the mechanical properties of the nal composites. A big eort has been realized to obtain reliable experimental techniques for measuring the transverse permeability. Since the dierentiation between saturated and eective permeabilities is still discussed, and the flow front is hardly dened in such small dimensions (order of 1 mm), our measurements on some so-called <b>Non-Crimped</b> New Concept (NC 2) are carried out for saturated flow, i. e. the ber network is completely impregnated from the onset of the experiment. In our case [1], these measures rely on the measurements of the pressure drop induced by the flow of a controlled liqui across the fabrics, easily converted into transverse permeability through the Darcy's law. One of the main results of these measurements is that the low NC 2 transverse permeability depends {{on the face of the}} fabric receiving the liquid. This original behaviour may, in turn, be translated into manufacturing guidelines to achieve optimal processing conguration. An attempt to relate this dierential to the stitching hole surface is proposed which turns to explain minor phenomena. On the contrary, the 3 D shape of the stitching hole reconstruction from polishings could yield some proper explanations...|$|R

Ensuring proper proximal fixation of the stent-graft {{to the host}} artery without the short-or long-term risks of endoleak or migration represents a particular technical challenge for these anatomical circumstances. An innovative balloon expandable stent combined with a weft-knitted prosthesis was specifically designed for these situations by modelling the stent to the neck anatomy without overdistension or potential barotrauma allowing better incorporation of the device. The Latecba stent-graft consists of a 2 parts modular design.

The second Module B is a <b>non-crimped</b> weft-knitted graft attached to 2 stainless steel stents. The first stent is entirely contained in the proximal textile tube, allowing fixation to module A.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{automated}} processes increases {{due to the}} high volume implementation of fiber reinforced polymer materials into car body mass production processes. That {{is the reason why}} the technology of laser remote cutting has successfully been adapted to fiber or fiber-reinforced fabrics. The remote technology rapidly moves a laser beam along the cutting contour using an optical scanner. The speed of the focused laser spot can reach several meters per second depending on the path length of the beam projection. As a result the complete cut of several meters of contour length is accomplished in only a few seconds. Due to the extreme dynamics of beam scanning, there is no significant reduction of the effective cutting speed even in the case of difficult contour details such as corners or smal l radii. It can also be very quickly moved from one cutting contour to the next. An extremely powerful and compact solution is achieved by combining the cutting process with a continuous transport of the web ("on the fly"). The novel machine concept has been implemented in collaboration with the company Held Systems Germany. The continuous "on the fly" feed of the web is realized by an endless transporting conveyor. To enable the processing of up to 3 m in width, the scanner operates in an oscillating motion perpendicular to the direction of the web transport. A specially adopted software controls the process timing, positioning and the synchronization of laser beam, material and scanner movements. A cutting accuracy for the textile fabrics of 0. 5 mm at web transport speeds of up to 20 m per minute can be reliably guaranteed without any difficulties. The technology works with different kinds of fabrics: <b>non-crimped</b> carbon fiber fabrics can be processed as well as glass fiber webs.

Some of our previous works focused on the through-thickness permeability measured in saturated regime for some so-called Non Crimped New Concept (NC 2) multiaxial fabrics [Drapier S, Pagot A, Vautrin A, Henrat P. Influence of the stitching density on the transverse permeability of <b>non-crimped</b> new concept (NC 2) multiaxial reinforcements: measurements and predictions.

But since in the real processes, both saturated and transient permeabilities are encountered, experimental assessments of these two permeabilities has to be achieved. If in saturated regime the through-thickness permeability is relatively easy to assess, in transient regime, however, the flow front is hardly defined in such small dimensions (order of 1 mm). Relying on optical fibre sensors to detect the flow front, transient through-thickness permeabilities are assessed here for various fibre volume fractions. using a Darcy's law to deduce the permeability from the fluid pressure and velocity. These measurements exhibit a satisfying reproducibility and appear to be consistent with the saturated permeabilities, in the sense that here again the permeability measured depends on the face receiving the fluid [Elbouazzaoui O, Drapier S, Henrat P.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the effects of one-sided access z-direction reinforcement, ‘tufting’, on the morphology and mechanical performance of the resulting MVR- 444 epoxy matrix/carbon fibre fabric composites. The dry fabric architectures used are pseudo-UD, twill woven fabric and <b>non-crimped</b> fabric (NCF). They are tufted with a range of commercial tufting threads, using KSL KL 150 tufting head mounted on a 6 -axis robot arm. The main focus is on the use of a twisted carbon fibre thread, at areal tufting densities of 0. 5 % and 2 %. The composite plates are prepared via Resin-Transfer- Moulding (RTM) route, making it possible to control the plate thicknesses. The morphological features characteristic of tufted, cured composites are described and categorised. The global and local fibre volume fractions are measured and simple models proposed that connect local increase with local fibre deviation and presence of resin rich surface loop layers. It is shown that the balance of in-plane and out-of-plane properties in tufted composites is highly dependent on the tufting parameters, but also on the fabric architecture, with the NCF option seeming the most attractive. Overall, the stiffness of tufted materials is not affected and the drop in in-plane strength of any realistic geometry combinations is below 20 %. ‘Thread-less’ tufting experiments prove that the drop is not caused by fibre breakage from the passage of the needle alone. Digital image correlation (DIC) techniques is used to map out the strain field distributions during mechanical testing, increasing the accuracy of crack tip location in Mode II delamination cracking studies and confirming the mode mixity changes during deformation of tufted structures. Single-tuft experiments provide the experimental data that are required for the development and validation of analytical models. A finite element unit cell model is developed to predict in-plane elastic and failure behaviour of tufted UD and NCF composites incorporating the critical meso-structural features of fibre deviation and increased fibre volume fraction. The thesis also contains an overview of the tufting technology and some detailed information on recent manufacturing developments that were required to obtain the controlled quality specimens used in the study.

Finally, hemisphere tests are performed to observe the forming behaviour of UD-NCF in a realistic forming process and to evaluate the proposed material characterisation methods regarding its suitability for UD-NCFs...|$|E

40|$|Assessing and {{controlling}} the complex deformation behavior of textile reinforcements fabrics {{remains one of}} the major challenges in the production of fiber-reinforced plastics. In this paper, the draping of + 45 °/- 45 ° biaxial <b>non-crimp</b> fabrics to a hemispherical shape is investigated with an eddy current imaging technique. After an automated draping process, the textiles are scanned with a robot-guided eddy current measurement system. From the resulting conductivity maps of the samples, the local yarn directions are extracted by image analysis and the paths of individual yarns are reconstructed for both the upper and the lower layer. Experiments are carried out for different forming speeds, blank holder forces and different <b>non-crimp</b> fabric parameters (stitch length, stitch type, stitch tension and yarn count). The influences of these parameters are compared and discussed, with the conclusion that blank holder forces have by far the most significant influence on the draping result. Sample experimental results are compared to results from an FEM draping simulation...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{test and}} {{analytical}} methods (theoretical and numerical) are normally restricted to thin laminate components, which cannot accurately represent the 3 D stress state behaviour of {{the so called}} Ultra Thick Laminates (UTL) structures. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} expand the scope of application of the current numerical methods to accurately predict the out-of-plane delamination failure associated with these types of structures (mainly due to the transverse shear stresses and interlaminar stresses). The overall objective of this work is to address the following research objectives: • To assess the functionality, advantages and limitations of different solid element formulations, including layered solid elements that are available in commercial Finite Element codes, applied to the mechanical response prediction of UTL composite components (thicknesses up to 30 mm are considered). • To perform a design exploration and optimisation of constant thickness UTL composite component in terms of the orientation of a varying and repeatable stacking sequence of an eight ply <b>Non-Crimped</b> Fabric, in order to assess the design implications on performance. In order to achieve the above stated objectives a standard, flexible and expandable FE based design exploration methodology (at a ply level) for UTL composite components is proposed, which considers a commercial FE tool (ANSYS), and a data management system and optimisation tool (ISIGHT), through the use of layered solid elements (SOLID 186 and SOLID 191, 20 -node layered solid elements). Application of manufacturing design rules (for reducing the number of feasible stacking sequences to be evaluated) is also considered, {{in order to reduce the}} computational cost of such a study, as well as to present a practical solution from the manufacturing point of view. Initially, in-plane and out-of-plane capabilities of various layered element formulations and modelling strategies where evaluated for thin and thick laminate applications against known analytic solutions (CLT, etc), in order to understand the key parameters and the accuracy limitations of each formulation. This led to practical recommendations for pre and post processing of thick laminate FE models, such as for the number of layered solid elements required as a function of the thickness of the UTL component to effectively predict the magnitude and variation in transverse shear stress across the thickness. The application of this research was demonstrated on the design exploration and performance optimisation of a UTL composite specimen (with constant thickness) under a 3 -point bending test (linear static analysis), for which experimental results were available. The individual ply orientations are the design variables considered, and the performance was assessed through the vertical displacement of the component and the maximum transverse shear stress value. This exploration of the design space did identify other possible configurations that may have a better performance than the baseline (Biax), considering only the maximum transverse shear stress values as directly responsible for the delamination failure. However, these improved designs may present a higher number of plies failed or a higher failure index (Tsai-Wu failure criteria). Further experimental studies are required to further explore the design space, but this work represents the starting point and possible approaches for development of robustness and weight optimisation of UTL composites are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The textile preforms play a {{key role}} in {{providing}} the mechanical properties and gives the idea about selection parameter of preforms to improve the quality and performance of laminates. The main objectives of this work are to study the effect of <b>non-crimp</b> fabric preform structure in final properties of laminates. It has been observed that the multi-axial preform give better mechanical properties of laminates as compared to woven and biaxial fabrics. This study investigated the effect of different <b>non-crimp</b> glass preform structure on tensile strength, bending and compression properties of glass laminates. The different woven, bi-axial and multi-axial fabrics with similar GSM used to manufacture the laminates using polyester resin.

It has been observed that the glass fabric geometry, including type of weaves, warps and filling density and number of layer plays significant role in deciding mechanical properties of laminates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the potential of}} low-cost thermoplastic fibres in improving the impact damage resistance and damage tolerance of thermoset (glass-epoxy) composites. Polypropylene (PP) fibres, commodity fibres without any surface modifications, have been incorporated at tow-scale {{with the aid of}} air jet commingling process. Glass-PP hybrid yarns with varying proportion of PP fibres (0 – 35 %) are converted into several <b>non-crimp</b> cross-ply laminates and a plain-woven laminate. Damage resistance in terms of damage area and depth are assessed for low energy (20 – 50  J) as well as high energy (500  J) drop-weight impacts; damage tolerance is assessed through Compression after Impact (CAI) tests. Overall density of the composite laminate has reduced by 16 % due to the introduction of PP fibres; at the same time total absorbed energy has increased by 22 % during a high velocity impact test due to a toughing mechanism by PP fibres. <b>Non-crimp</b> laminates absorbed more energy at low velocity impacts in comparison to woven laminates, possibly due to extensive tow-level delaminations. On the other hand, a much larger dent depth was observed in the woven laminate after low energy impact. Compression after Impact (CAI) tests indicated that woven laminates retained 83 % of compressive strength while <b>non-crimp</b> laminates retained 50 – 60 %, depending on proportion of thermoplastic fibres, and standard glass fibre laminates retain around 45 %. Fibre damage has been significantly reduced during impact loading in case of hybrid laminates due to the cushioning effect offered by lower modulus PP fibres...|$|E
