In 1929, 1930 and 1934, anti-pass demonstrations were held by the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) on that day.

5|$|Published {{partially}} {{in response}} to Dissenting clergyman Richard Price's sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and primogeniture. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections, he argues that citizens do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, {{are the result of}} social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E

5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{announcement}} that Toyota was moving to Georgetown, Martha Lane Collins, within her capacity as Governor condemned a portion of land belonging to real estate developer Gordon Taub. Taub owned 60 acres within the Toyota plant site and 4.2 acres were condemned to build a four-lane highway to the Toyota plant entrance. Taub challenged the condemnation stating that the Commonwealth did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to condemn private property {{for the use of}} a for profit, public corporation. At trial, Martha Lane Collins became the first sitting governor of Kentucky to testify in court.She was represented by former governor, Bert T. Combs, Taub was represented by former governor Louis B. Nunn; this was also {{the first time in the}} history of Kentucky that two former governors represented opposing parties in a legal action.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He said they did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, {{all that was left}} was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E

5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted it did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to do so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported {{that he did not}} expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Æthelheard died in 805 and was {{succeeded by}} Wulfred. Wulfred was given freedom to mint coins {{that did not}} name Coenwulf on the reverse, {{probably}} indicating that Wulfred was on good terms with the Mercian king. In 808 there was evidently a rift of some kind: a letter from Pope Leo to Charlemagne mentioned that Coenwulf had not yet made peace with Wulfred. After this no further discord is mentioned until 816, when Wulfred presided over a council which attacked lay control of religious houses. The council, held at Chelsea, asserted that Coenwulf did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to make appointments to nunneries and monasteries, although both Leo and his predecessor, Pope Hadrian I, had granted Offa and Coenwulf {{the right to do}} so. Coenwulf had recently appointed his daughter, Cwoenthryth, to the position of abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. Leo died in 816, and his successor, Stephen IV, died the following January; the new pope, Paschal I confirmed Coenwulf's privileges but this did not end the dispute. In 817 Wulfred witnessed two charters in which Coenwulf granted land to Deneberht, bishop of Worcester, but there is no further record of Wulfred acting as archbishop for the rest of Coenwulf's reign. One account records that the quarrel between Wulfred and Coenwulf led to Wulfred being deprived of his office for six years, with no baptisms taking place during that time, but this may have been an exaggeration, with four years being the more likely term of the suspension.|$|E

5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons {{with three or}} more Jewish {{grandparents}} would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (Mischlinge of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} persons with two Jewish grandparents (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree. For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E
5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
