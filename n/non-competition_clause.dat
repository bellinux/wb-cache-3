50|$|Pre-existing duties {{relating}} to at-will employment depend largely on state law. Generally, at-will employment allows the employer {{to terminate the}} employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason.

Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working. Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, {{there is also no}} contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker. However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, <b>non-competition</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the key legal {{characteristics}} of 375 employment contracts between {{some of the largest}} 1500 public corporations and their Chief Executive Officers. We look at the actual language of these contracts, asking whether and in what ways CEO contracts differ from what are thought of as standard employment contract features for other workers. Our data provide some empirical answers to several common assertions or speculations about CEO contracts, and shed light on whether these contracts are negotiated solely to suit the preferences of CEOs or have provisions that insure that the employers' interests are also safeguarded. After giving an overview of the general characteristics of a CEO employment contract, and the process by which they are negotiated, we focus on five contracting issues: (1) the term just cause that defines when an executive can be terminated involuntarily with penalties; (2) the good reason termination clauses in the contract that permit an executive to leave voluntarily without financial penalties; (3) the <b>non-competition</b> <b>clauses</b> in the contract; (4) the use of arbitration clauses as a method of resolving contractual disputes; and (5) the contractual restrictions, if any, on the CEO selling stock options. We also discuss some of the less-well known economic terms of these contracts, including their length and the level of perquisites given to CEOs...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} interface between the restraint of trade doctrine (hereinafter ROTD) and competition law in England and Wales (comprising the UK Competition Act 1998 and Articles 101 - 102 TFEU). The ROTD and competition law overlap in cases where both laws appear to be applicable to certain restrictions on professionals (e. g. <b>non-competition</b> <b>clauses).</b> It will {{be argued that the}} ROTD and competition are different legal regimes whose prima facie concurrent applicability creates an interface problem for some professionals who are precluded from relying on the ROTD to resist a particular restriction. The most acute problem, in cases of overlap, arises where a restriction does not infringe competition law but falls foul of the ROTD. By examining developments in UK law and in EU law this study analyses how the interface problem evolved incrementally. UK competition legislation may be interpreted so that the ROTD applies only in a residual fashion. Moreover, Art 3 of EU Reg. 1 / 2003 delineates {{the interface between}} EU competition law and national competition law. The High Court has interpreted Art. 3 so that once EU competition law is applied to a restriction the court cannot reach a different conclusion under the ROTD. For reasons of consistency, this conclusion may also hold true for the interface between the ROTD and UK competition law. The scale of persons affected by this problem becomes greater if some professionals in employment are classified as “undertakings” because such classification would increase the overlap and interface between competition law and ROTD. This thesis proposes fresh solutions for courts when applying the ROTD. The solutions aim to ensure the availability of the ROTD’s unique protection to professionals who are subject to restrictions to which competition law also applies...|$|R

First, the district court had already determined that the <b>non-competition</b> <b>clause</b> in Gagnon's employment agreements was unenforceable under California law, any evidence showing solicitation was irrelevant. Second, since Gagnon had already acknowledged that the source code was located on AMS's computers, providing conclusive evidence proving the location of the source code was unnecessary. Finally, the {{ex parte application}} was untimely because Gagnon did not submit it until after the motion for summary judgment was fully briefed by both parties, and the district court declared the case submitted.|$|E
5000|$|In the US, {{the first}} {{significant}} discussion occurred in the Sixth Circuit's opinion by Chief Judge (later US President and still later Supreme Court Chief Justice) William Howard Taft in United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. Judge Taft explained the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 as a statutory codification of the English common-law doctrine of restraint of trade, as explicated in such cases as Mitchel v Reynolds. The court distinguished between naked restraints of trade and those ancillary to the legitimate main purpose of a lawful contract and reasonably necessary to effectuation of that purpose. An example of the latter would be a <b>non-competition</b> <b>clause</b> associated with the lease or sale of a bakeshop, as in the Mitchel case. Such a contract should be tested by a [...] "rule of reason," [...] meaning {{that it should be}} deemed legitimate if [...] "necessary and ancillary." [...] An example of the naked type of restraint would be the price-fixing and bid-allocation agreements involved in the Addyston case. Taft said that [...] "we do not think there is any question of reasonableness open to the courts to such a contract." [...] The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. During the following century, the Addyston Pipe opinion of Judge Taft has remained foundational in antitrust analysis.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is {{to explain the}} meaning of the {{expression}} "non- competition clause" and to analyse its legal regulation in Czech labour law. The reason why I chose this topic is that <b>non-competition</b> <b>clause</b> is a very dynamic subject with a lot of changes in a historical point of view as you can see above. First of all, <b>non-competition</b> <b>clause</b> is an instrument of labour law which protects an employer against the abuse of the company's confidential information, knowledge and other know-how by the employee. According to the Czech legislation, non- competition clause means a voluntary agreement between employer and employee whose purpose is to protect employer's interests by reducing employee's job opportunities which would have a competitive character to the employer after the determination of an employment with the employee. There are several conditions need to be achieved in order to conclude a valid non- competition clause. For example, this contract needs to be agreed in writing. Secondly, the <b>non-competition</b> <b>clause</b> may be valid for only a certain period of time, not exceeding one year. Moreover, an employer is obliged to pay the employee some kind of a financial compensation every month. The amount of this compensation needs to be at least one average monthly salary of the employee. This [...] ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Non-competition</b> <b>clause</b> in the Czech Republic and in chosen {{states of}} the European Union Resumé The {{employee}} has a duty of faithful service and is obliged not to compete with his employer {{in the course of}} their labour relationship. Once the relationship has come to an end, the employer could have interest to protect his business and his proprietary rights, such as a trade secret, a secret process, confidential information or customer connections, since the disclosure of them by his ex-employee could damage his business and his position in the labour market. That is the reason why the contractual parties conclude the <b>non-competition</b> <b>clause</b> (or restrictive covenant) within a contract of employment (or within a special contract) whereby the employee undertakes that he will accept a restraint about where he works and for whom, for a period of time after he has left the employment relationship. Generally the employer has a duty to pay monetary compensation in order to compensate such a restraint of the employee. The purpose of my thesis is primarily to provide readers with the legal background of basic principles related to the employee's duty of loyalty and prohibition of a concurrence in the course of the labour relation with his employer. Furthermore, to outline and describe the legal regulation of the [...] ...|$|E
