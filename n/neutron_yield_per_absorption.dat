Due to the 10 50 times bigger size of the spray droplets compared to usual cluster sizes, deuterons are accelerated to considerably higher kinetic energies of up to 1 MeV.

Materials and Methods: An epithermal neutron spectrum generator was simulated with 30 MeV proton energy for BNCT purposes. A low current of 300 μA of the proton beam in spallation target concept via 9 Be target was accomplished to model neutron spectrum using 208 Pb moderator around the target.

Several research groups are now working on this topic {{all over the world and}} this has already led to the proposal of accelerator driven systems (ADS) concepts. The main objective of these systems is the incineration of long-lived isotopes from the spent fuel of actual and future reactors. At the Institut fuer Reaktorsicherheit (IRS) of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, some of the actual activities are focussed on the near future developments of ADS. In this scope, IRS is participating within the 5 "t"h European Community Framework Program to MEGAPIE, MUSE and XADS projects. Development and experimental qualification of theoretical tools for core design and safety evaluations of accelerator driven sub-critical systems are important current topics investigated at IRS. In particular, for the analysis of accelerator driven systems (ADS), the coupling of a proton source with a sub-critical reactor system may be investigated with the current version of MCNPX, a code developed at LANL and for which IRS is beta-tester. The present work was done in the scope of this beta-testing activity.

The evaporation neutron detection efficiency of a modified I 6 Y - type monitor is measured using a novel technique which uses stopping negative muons as a source of neutrons, and the result is compared with that expected from previous measurements of other monitors. Use is made of this result in an experimental study of neutron production by unaccompanied cosmic ray protons, pions and muons in the momentum range 1 - 30 GeV/c. The experiment has, employed an air-gap magnet spectrograph in conjunction with the monitor, and {{the results of this study}} are compared with previous work. They confirm previous findings that the <b>yield</b> of evaporation <b>neutrons</b> in monitors from protons and pions is significantly overestimated by the only available theoretical model, and suggestions, are made to account for this discrepancy. Within fairly large statistical errors, the measured neutron production by fast muons agrees with the theoretical predictions. An examination is made of the possibility of using a neutron monitor in conjunction with an air shower detection array to measure the changes in slope of the nuclear active particle (NAP) energy spectrum in extensive air showers (HAS) of energy l 0 (^ 17) eV at sea level which may arise due to primary particles of different atomic mass number and fluctuations in the longitudinal development of proton induced showers.

A study was performed to determine the delayed neutron emission properties from fast fission of several actinide waste isotopes. The specific isotopes evaluated were U- 235, Np- 237, and Am- 243. A calculational technique based on the microscopic method was used to predict initial guesses for the delayed neutron parameters (group decay constants and yields). Based on these calculations, an alternate "seven-group" structure, in contrast to the traditional "six-group" structure used previously, was suggested which would yield a superior fit to the measured data. A series of measurements were performed to test the hypothesis suggested by this alternate group structure. Using a set of highly purified actinide samples (provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory), the delayed neutron emission decay constants and yields for six groups of the "seven-group" structure were measured for U- 235, Np- 237, and Am- 243. These experiments were performed using the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor, a quick pneumatic transfer system, an integrated computer control and counting system, and a specially designed in-core irradiation device.

40|$|In the {{proposed}} facility with 24 GeV PS beam on a Lead target, {{the number of}} produced neutrons exceeds 760 per proton. In comparison, with a LINAC (GELINA) one currently obtains only about 0. 05 neutrons per electron of about 100 MeV. An additional factor of 2. 5 for the CERN facility {{is due to the}} strong, forward peaking of the neutron flux, arising from the high proton energy and corresponding longitudinal boost. This huge factor in <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> incident particle, namely 2. 5 x 760 / 0. 05 = 3. 8 x 10 ^ 4, is only partially off-set by the higher, time averaged current of the LINAC e. g. 100 mA vs. 2 mA of the CERN-PS. Therefore the useful, initial neutron rate at the CERN facility is about three orders of magnitude larger than in the most performing electron LINACs, GELINA in Belgium and ORELLA in the US. The time duration of the PS pulse is presently Deltat|_r. m. s. = 13. 5 ns and we believe it could be reduced to Deltat|_r. m. s. = 6. 75 ns. The electron LINAC has much shorter pulses Deltat| _r. m. s. = 1 ns, to which however the resolution of the counters has to be added. But for neutron energy 1 MeV, is not affecting the actual TOF energy resolution, dominated by the fluctuations of moderation. Since these time fluctuations are largely independent of the chosen mechanism to produce the initial neutrons, the initial flux difference between the two methods, e. g. electrons vs. protons, reflects directly in the counting rate for a given TOF resolution at the measuring station. Furthermore the CERN PS (< 1 / 2. 4 sec^- 1) has a much smaller repetition rate than the LINAC (1 / 800 sec- 1) and it presents no problems of time overlaps at the measuring station due to successive bunches. The accidental background due to radio-active targets is also much better suppressed.

Approximately 60, 000 tons of spent fuel (33, 000 MW-days / MTU burnup) currently await shipment to the repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. 1, 2 In addition, the amount of spent fuel in storage is likely to double before the opening of the repository. However, the proposed transmutation of long-lived fission-products and burning of higher actinides would lessen the volume and time the waste must be stored in its present state, while concurrently extending the U.

The target provides the neutrons responsible for transmuting fission-products and burning or breeding fertile higher actinides into fissile fuel. The idea is to smash high-energy protons or deuterons into a target material that will yield a high number of neutrons per incident particle. While numerous studies have been done determining the average <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> incident particle, less effort has been spent to determine the radioactive isotopes produced in the target as a function of target materials. An experiment conducted at the Texas A&M University (TAMU) Cyclotron consisted of two foils, copper and gold, being irradiated by 120 MeV deuterons. The foils were transported to the TAMU Nuclear Science Center (NSC), where they were placed on a high-purity germanium gamma-ray detector. The subsequent analysis of the spectra revealed several radionuclides were produced as a result of irradiation. In an effort to predict the types and amounts of radionuclides produced in the targets as a result of such an irradiation, a computer program known as LAHET was obtained from Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The results from LAHET were compared to the results of the irradiation for the purpose of estimating the accuracy of the calculated results.

(1), if the tritium observed were due to D-D fusion, it {{would need to be}} accompanied by a similar <b>neutron</b> <b>yield.</b> However, the reported <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> (4 104 to 7 104 neutron/s) was a factor of 10 to 20 lower than the reported tritium yield (7 105 atoms/s) (1), a discrepancy that contra...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this thesis the generation of neutrons using ultrashort laser pulses with moderate pulse energy was investigated. On the one hand, the aim was directed towards {{the development of a}} neutron source, whose optimization naturally calls for a detailed understanding of the underlying neutron production processes. Since the highest <b>neutron</b> <b>yields</b> are achieved by nuclear reactions of laser-accelerated ions, the characterization of these ions is necessary, which was done mainly by neutron spectroscopy. Using this strategy, <b>neutron</b> <b>yields</b> of up to 10 " 8 neutrons/ laser shot were demonstrated in the experiments presented here. This is equivalent to a specific <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> of 10 " 7 per Joule of pulse energy. The scaling laws found in this context anticipate a further increase of the specific <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> with laser energy, which has recently been proven by a number of groups. (orig.)

A measurement of the <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> in the three different experimental halls of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment at varying depth is reported. The <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> in Daya Bay's liquid scintillator is measured to be Y_n=(10. 26 ± 0. 86) × 10 ^- 5, (10. 22 ± 0. 87) × 10 ^- 5, and (17. 03 ± 1. 22) × 10 ^- 5 μ^- 1 g^- 1 cm^ 2 at depths of 250, 265, and 860 meters-water-equivalent. These results are compared to other measurements and the simulated <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> in Fluka and Geant 4.

From the neutron spectrum measured with the MRS, many critical implosion parameters are determined including the primary DT <b>neutron</b> <b>yield,</b> the ion temperature, and the down-scattered <b>neutron</b> <b>yield.</b> As the MRS detection efficiency is determined from first principles, the absolute DT <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> is obtained without cross-calibration to other techniques.

40|$|Fusion plasmas produce {{neutrons}} and {{by measuring}} the neutron emission the fusion power can be inferred. Accurate <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> measurements are paramount for the safe and efficient operation of fusion experiments and, eventually, fusion power plants. Neutron measurements are {{an essential part of}} the diagnostic system at large fusion machines such as JET and ITER. At JET, a system of activation foils provides the absolute calibration for the <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> determination.   The activation system uses the property of certain nuclei to emit radiation after being excited by neutron reactions. A sample of suitable nuclei is placed in the neutron flux close to the plasma and after irradiation the induced radiation is measured.   Knowing the neutron activation cross section one can calculate the time-integrated neutron flux at the sample position. To relate the local flux to the total <b>neutron</b> <b>yield,</b> the spatial flux response has to be identified. This describes how the local neutron emission affects the flux at the detector.   The required spatial flux response is commonly determined using neutron transport codes, e. g., MCNP. Nuclear data is used as input both in the calculation of the spatial flux response and when the flux at the irradiation site is inferred. Consequently, high quality nuclear data is essential for the proper determination of the <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> and fusion power.  However, uncertainties due to nuclear data are generally not fully taken into account in today’s uncertainty analysis for <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> calibrations using activation foils.    In this paper, the <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> uncertainty due to nuclear data is investigated using the so-called Total Monte Carlo Method. The work is performed using a detailed MCNP model of JET fusion machine.   In this work the uncertainties due to the cross sections and angular distributions in JET structural materials, as well as the activation cross sections, are analyzed. It is shown that a significant contribution to the <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> uncertainty can come from uncertainties in the nuclear data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Kansas State University (KSU) dense plasma focus (DPF) is a 2. 5 -kJ DPF machine newly {{commissioned}} at the Plasma Radiation Physics Laboratory at KSU. The {{machine was}} designed {{to be used as a}} multiradiation source for applications in nuclear science and engineering. Neutrons are emitted from deuterium–deuterium (D–D) fusion reactions during high-power electric discharges at 17 kV, 140 kA, and 5 mbar. The machine circuit parameters were calculated using the short-circuit test. The emitted neutrons were measured using several radiation detection techniques. The 2. 45 -MeV characteristic D–D neutron energy was confirmed using the time-of-flight technique using a BC- 418 plas-tic scintillator. The maximum <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> was roughly measured to be 2. 8 × 108 neutrons per shot using a set of BTI BD-PND bubble detectors. Moreover, the <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> variation with pres-sure was measured and compared with the computed <b>neutron</b> <b>yield</b> using Lee model. Finally, the measured current showed good agreement with Lee six-phase model. Index Terms—Dense plasma focus (DPF), Lee model, multira-diation source, <b>neutron</b> <b>yield.</b> I...|$|R
