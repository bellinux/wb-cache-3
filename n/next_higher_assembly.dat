40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the benefits and challenges of using gallium nitride (GaN) based components in next generation transmit/receive (T/R) modules for active electronically scanned arrays (AESAs). GaN is particularly well-suited for high power amplifiers (HPAs) in transmit and may be considered for limiters and low noise amplifiers (LNAs) in the receive path. Higher radiated power per element increases the range while the cost per radiated watt can be lower. Higher radiated power per element can also reduce antenna size (area/module count) for fixed range performance. GaN’s higher drain voltage results in improved efficiencies at the <b>next</b> <b>higher</b> level <b>assembly</b> in the array by reducing the amount of copper conductors in the <b>assembly.</b> <b>Higher</b> voltage operation also reduces current requirements on dc/dc converters that are used throughout the array. Challenges in using GaN include its perceived lack of maturity and cost...|$|R
