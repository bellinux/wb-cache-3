500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. [...] In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from {{the federal government}} as compensation. [...] In 1910, however, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called [...] "Alberta's first separatist" [...] by the Edmonton Journal) moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to [...] "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". [...] Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. [...] He asserted [...] "I have always believed... that we should administer our mines and timber. [...] The question is not <b>now</b> <b>whether</b> we would like to control our natural resources, but {{what is the best way}} to get them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "and {{they sent}} the coat of many colors, {{and they brought}} it to their father; and said: ‘This have we found. Know <b>now</b> <b>whether</b> it is your son's coat or not,'" [...] Rabbi Johanan taught that God ordained that since Judah said this to his father, he too would hear (from Tamar in [...] ) the challenge: Know now, whose are these? Similarly, reading the words of [...] "Discern, please," [...] Rabbi Hama ben Hanina noted that with the same word, Judah made an {{announcement}} to his father, and Judah's daughter-in-law made an announcement to him. With the word [...] "discern," [...] Judah said to Jacob in [...] "Discern <b>now</b> <b>whether</b> it be your son's coat or not." [...] And with the word [...] "discern," [...] Tamar said to Judah in [...] "Discern, please, whose are these.". Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000[...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision <b>now</b> <b>whether</b> you're going to pick us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E
