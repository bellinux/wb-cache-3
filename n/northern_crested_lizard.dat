5|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} was {{described}} as a variety of the <b>northern</b> <b>crested</b> newt (Triturus cristatus) by C. Kiritzescu in 1903. Later, it was considered a subspecies until genetic analysis supported its recognition as a separate species in the crested newt species complex. The <b>northern</b> <b>crested</b> newt is its likely sister species according to a molecular phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA; analysis of nuclear DNA gives however some conflicting results regarding this sister relationship.|$|R
50|$|Bronchocela marmorata, marbled <b>crested</b> <b>lizard,</b> marbled bloodsucker or marbled agamid lizard is {{a species}} of lizard. It is endemic to the Philippines, where it inhabits lowland dipterocarp and montane forests at {{elevations}} 400 to 800 m above mean sea level. It is typically found on branches and leaves of trees. It feeds on insects and is oviparous, digging the soil to lay its eggs {{at the base of}} trees.|$|R

When threatened, Green <b>Crested</b> <b>Lizards</b> leap from one tree to next, splay out their limbs, and expand their rib cages during flight.|$|R

Common species in the area include large predators like the common reticulated python reticulates, the monitor lizard (Varanus salvator) and the green <b>crested</b> <b>lizard</b> (Bronchocoela cristatella). Amphibian fauna include ten species. The Philippine woodland frog (Rana acanthi) is the most dominant and frequently encountered. One species, Barbourula busuangensis, endemic to Palawan was also observed in the area.|$|R

40|$|In western Bretagne, {{the central}} Montagne Noire is {{composed}} of two pretty near parallel crests. The southern Crest is massive (Armorican Sandstone of Lower Ordovician age); the <b>northern</b> <b>crest</b> is ragged (Plougaslel Shales and quartzites of Lower Devonian age). The southern crest presents a greater hardness than the northern one : indeed, these sandstones are almost quartzites and the <b>northern</b> <b>crest</b> only shows slaty shales. However, the culminating points belong to the <b>northern</b> <b>crest.</b> In reality, {{it is not a}} phenomenon of differential erosion, but of tectonic origin, which is in question. The Montagne Noire is cut up in a set of blocks, tilted towards south, which raise up the lower Devonian shales. The age of these cruslal movements are supposed to be recent enough, dating perhaps from Pliocene. Marescaux G. Les crêtes de la Montagne noire centrale (Massif Armoricain).

5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, and the <b>northern</b> <b>crested</b> newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, {{especially in the}} crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the <b>northern</b> <b>crested</b> newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{fieldwork}} in southern Tanintharyi revealed {{the presence of}} a small Green <b>Crested</b> <b>Lizard</b> in the wet evergreen forest. We generated mtDNA sequence data (ND 2) that demonstrates that this population’s nearest relative is Bronchocela rayaensis Grismer et al., 2015 of Pulau Langkawi, northwestern Peninsular Malaysia and Phuket Island. Morphologically the Burmese Bronchocela shares many features with B. rayaensis, which potentially would make this recently described Thai-Malay species a synonym of Bronchocela burmana Blanford, 1878; however, we interpret the genetic and morphological differences to reflect evolutionary divergence and recommend the recognition of both species...|$|R
