In sheep, homoplasmy is maintained since mtDNA {{is transmitted from}} the oocyte (recipient) only.

The mitochondrial triplasmy following M. mulatta NT reported here forces concerns regarding the parental origins of mtDNA in clinically reconstructed eggs.

The Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society (CROES) prospectively collected data from consecutive patients treated with PCNL over a 1 -year period at 96 participating centers worldwide. This report focuses on the 3, 968 patients who received a NT of known size. Preoperative, surgical procedure and outcome data were analyzed according to NT size, dividing patients into two groups, namely small-bore (SB; nephrostomy size ≤ 18 Fr) and large-bore (LB; nephrostomy size > 18 Fr) NT. Patients who received a LB <b>NT</b> <b>had</b> a significantly lower rate of hemoglobin reduction (3. 0 vs. 4. 3 g/dL; P < 0. 001), overall complications (15. 8 vs. 21. 4 %; P < 0. 001) and a trend toward a lower rate of fever (9. 1 vs. 10. 7 %).

Due to a large band gap, both the TiO 2 NTs and TiO 2 (N 2) <b>NTs</b> <b>had</b> low efficiencies below 400  nm, although the TiO 2 (N 2) NTs exhibited better performances. The IPCE of BiVO 4 was comparatively at ~ 20  % at 410  nm, whereas heterojunction BiVO 4 /TiO 2 <b>NTs</b> <b>had</b> a higher IPCE at nearly 28  % at 410  nm. Comparably, the IPCE of BiVO 4 /TiO 2 (N 2) NTs further increased to 44  % at 410  nm, which was more than 100  % higher than the IPCE of bare BiVO 4. This again suggests that the rectifying electron transfer from BiVO 4 to TiO 2 likely inhibits the fast recombination and increases the solar energy conversion efficiency of the junction. The IPCE was nearly zero at 550  nm, {{which is consistent with}} the optical absorption of the samples.|$|R
