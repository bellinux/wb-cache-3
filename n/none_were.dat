50|$|The last D31 was {{withdrawn}} in December 1952 and <b>none</b> <b>was</b> preserved. The Abbotsford locomotives had been withdrawn earlier (the last D27 in 1924, the last D28 in 1926), and <b>none</b> <b>was</b> preserved.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1941â€“42 the Soviets {{transferred}} all of the remaining MiG-3s to the Navy and PVO so that on 1 May 1942 <b>none</b> <b>were</b> left on strength with the VVS. By 1 May 1942, Naval Aviation had 37 MiGs on strength, while the PVO had 323 on hand on 10 May. By 1 June 1944, the Navy had transferred all its aircraft to the PVO, which reported only 17 on its own strength, {{and all of those}} were gone by 1 January 1945. Undoubtedly more remained in training units and the like, but <b>none</b> <b>were</b> assigned to combat units by then.|$|E
5|$|So {{far from}} {{insulting}} {{the bodies of}} the dead and wounded, they permitted them to lie untouched, till carried away; and <b>none</b> <b>were</b> stripped, as is too universally the case.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral's architect, Frederick Gibberd, was {{the winner}} of a {{worldwide}} design competition. Construction began in 1962 and was completed in 1967. Earlier designs for a cathedral were proposed in 1853, 1933, and 1953, but <b>none</b> <b>were</b> completed.|$|E

5|$|While GE had {{initially}} hoped {{to deliver a}} prototype steam turbine locomotive to UP in 1937, <b>none</b> <b>were</b> completed until December 1938, which were then delivered for testing in spring 1939. In total, the two prototype locomotives had taken almost two years to complete.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>none</b> <b>were</b> ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow {{were also}} proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{specimen}} has {{a poorly}} healed fracture {{of the right}} fibula, which left a large callus on the bone. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 54 foot bones referred to Gorgosaurus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but <b>none</b> <b>were</b> found.|$|E

5|$|Further {{flights were}} made by high {{altitude}} Ju 88s. One photographed RAF Sealand, RAF Pembrey and RAF Woodward. It also managed to reach Manchester, Liverpool and Birkenhead without interception. Another managed to photograph the Thames Haven, RAF Netheravon, RAF Benson and the Royal Navy base at Chatham Dockyard. Interception of these high altitude aircraft was difficult, and <b>none</b> <b>were</b> lost on 15 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to D-Day, {{full-scale}} rehearsals of Operation Peppermint were carried out in order to test the plan and the equipment. Ground and aerial surveys were also carried out to detect the presence of radioactive substances in troop concentration areas, and at sites in the United Kingdom that had been bombed, but <b>none</b> <b>were</b> detected.|$|E
5|$|Night of January 16th was {{the last}} {{theatrical}} success for either Rand or Woods. Rand's next play, Ideal, went unsold, and a 1940 stage adaptation of We the Living flopped. Rand achieved lasting success and financial stability with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. Woods produced several more plays; <b>none</b> <b>were</b> hits and {{when he died in}} 1951, he was bankrupt and living in a hotel.|$|E

5|$|The 1804 dollar or Bowed Liberty Dollar was {{a dollar}} coin {{struck by the}} Mint of the United States, of which fifteen {{specimens}} are currently known to exist. Though dated 1804, <b>none</b> <b>were</b> struck in that year; all were minted in the 1830s or later. They were first created for use in special proof coin sets used as diplomatic gifts during Edmund Roberts' trips to Siam and Muscat.|$|E
5|$|The Vought F6U Pirate was the Vought company's first jet fighter, {{designed}} for US Navy during the mid-1940s. Although pioneering {{the use of}} turbojet power as the first naval fighter with an afterburner and composite material construction, the aircraft proved to be underpowered and was judged unsuitable for combat. <b>None</b> <b>were</b> ever issued to operational squadrons and they were relegated to development, training and test roles before they were withdrawn from service in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The flight-deck cruiser was a {{proposed}} {{type of aircraft}} cruiser, warships combining features of aircraft carriers and light cruisers designed by the United States Navy during the period between World War I and World War II. Several designs were proposed for the type, but <b>none</b> <b>were</b> approved for construction. The final design was developed just before World War II, and the entry of the United States into the war saw the project come to an end.|$|E
50|$|There was no {{occasion}} {{on which}} police resorted to firing on this day. There was one case of stabbing {{resulting in the}} killing of one Muslim, three minor cases of mob violence in which <b>none</b> <b>was</b> injured; five stray minor cases of arson were reported in which <b>none</b> <b>was</b> injured.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} other schemes for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, <b>none</b> <b>were</b> considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fishing}} {{industry}} thrived in Christchurch, {{the importance of the}} harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught. The harbour entrance was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he attempted to resolve the problems with the harbour entrance by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. However, upon completion the new entrance repeatedly silted up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a groyne which blocked the entrance entirely. Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but <b>none</b> <b>were</b> ever taken up.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but <b>none</b> <b>were</b> ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
