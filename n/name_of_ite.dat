40|$|Background: In-training {{examination}} (ITE) is {{a cognitive}} examination {{similar to the}} written test, but it {{is different from the}} Clinical Practice Examination of the Korean Academy of Family Medicine (KAFM) Certifi cation Examination (CE). The objective of this is to estimate the positive predictive value of the KAFM-ITE for identifying residents at risk for poor performance on the three types of KAFM-CE. Methods: 372 residents who completed the KAFM-CE in 2011 were included. We compared the mean KAFM-CE scores with ITE experience. We evaluated the correlation and the positive predictive value (PPV) <b>of</b> <b>ITE</b> for the multiple choice question (MCQ) scores of 1 st written test & 2 nd slide examination, the total clinical practice examination scores, and the total sum of 2 nd test. Results: 275 out of 372 residents completed ITE. Those who completed ITE had signifi cantly higher MCQ scores of 1 st written test than those who did not. The correlation <b>of</b> <b>ITE</b> scores with 1 st written MCQ (0. 627) was found to be the highest among the other kinds of CE. The PPV <b>of</b> the <b>ITE</b> score for 1 st written MCQ scores was 0. 672. The PPV <b>of</b> the <b>ITE</b> score ranged from 0. 376 to 0. 502.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} a study that {{investigated}} the process and outcomes of using Appreciative Inquiry (AI) in an Australian initial teacher education (ITE) program review. The aim of the study, which drew on a sample of teaching staff involved in this Master of Teaching program, was to {{gain an understanding of}} the extent to which the application of the AI framework can be used effectively in the review <b>of</b> <b>ITE</b> programs. AI promotes collegial reflective practice and the generation of positive resolutions and thus aligned with the purposes of the review that were to foster collaboration, strengthen staff morale and, subsequently, build a stronger program for students. This paper provides a perceptual account of the AI review process as reported by the facilitators and a sample of review participants, and contributes to international literature in the areas <b>of</b> <b>ITE</b> program appraisal, organisational reform and Appreciative Inquiry...|$|R

40|$|Metaphor {{provides}} a potentially powerful rhetorical device {{to help me}} to tell informed and persuasive stories about mathematics education. In this ethnographic study I consider key episodes that serve to exemplify the complex experience of Initial Teacher Education (<b>ITE)</b> students <b>of</b> secondary mathematics education. I use a narrative analysis to shine a spotlight on the experiences of six beginning teachers so that the metaphors in their stories expose the impact that separately situated sites of teacher education have upon their beliefs and behaviour as teachers. Tensions between school and university contributors to teacher education have been well documented over many decades, but recent policy changes in the nature <b>of</b> post-graduate <b>ITE</b> in England bring these issues to the fore. In this study, I consider the influences of school-based and university-based teacher educators upon the beliefs of student secondary mathematics teachers and interpret the students’ perceptions of these influences on their actions as novice teachers. My analysis is framed by a model of experience and education articulated by Dewey {{as well as a}} framework of representations of knowledge in a culture of education articulated by theorists concerned with the relevance of constructivism and situated cognition as theories of learning. In this study, disturbances and discontinuities relating to the location and culture <b>of</b> <b>ITE,</b> together with the development <b>of</b> <b>ITE</b> students’ professional knowledge are uncovered, warranting further research...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research investigated {{the development and}} use of an analytical assessment methodology anchored in systems engineering principles, affordance theory, and human abilities, to measure the potential of integrated training environments (ITEs) to effectively support training. Empirical investigation <b>of</b> <b>ITEs</b> is costly, lacks formal guidance, and is therefore often unreliable. Ad hoc studies, commissioned by individual organizations, constitute the current state <b>of</b> Army <b>ITE</b> evaluation. These assessments are often entirely based on subject matter expert judgment through surveys, which produce results that are linked indirectly and loosely to the ITEs. What is required is a repeatable, inexpensive, analytical approach to ITE assessment that bounds the potential of a given system to the support it provides to the deliberate practice of specific tasks. The results of this research include the {{development and use of}} the integrated training environment assessment methodology (ITEAM). ITEAM was used to evaluate the ability <b>of</b> several <b>ITEs</b> to support the deliberate practice of specific tasks during training. The dissertation shows that ITEAM consistently predicted where training was supported by an ITE and generally how well. ITEAM is offered as a tool to be used early in the acquisition process to affordably define and verify the requirements <b>of</b> candidate <b>ITE</b> solutions for Department of Defense needs.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the part that schools have played, and could play, in initial teacher {{education}} (ITE) in Scotland and England. It reviews the common problems of which these two countries (and indeed many others) gradually became aware {{in relation to their}} twentieth century systems <b>of</b> <b>ITE,</b> controlled by, and largely located in, higher education institutions (HEIs). It looks next at the efforts made by teacher educators and the teaching profession, again in both countries, to reform ITE through strengthening the part in it played by schools and by practising teachers and through developing more balanced and integrated partnerships for ITE between schools and HEIs. The general failure of these efforts is recognised and the different consequences in the two countries of this failure, through government efforts to impose reform, are examined. The brief final section of the paper suggests that present circumstances in both countries may present opportunities for renewed efforts for reform. 1960 – 1978 : LEARNING FROM RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE In striking contrast to the internationally dominant school-based model <b>of</b> <b>ITE</b> i...|$|R
