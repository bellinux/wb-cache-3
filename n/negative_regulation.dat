Little is known about whether adaptive cognitive coping processes (e. g., distraction) may help decrease the likelihood of student smoking for <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation.</b> The present study tested the hypothesis that distraction would predict (a) greater engagement in adaptive pleasant pastimes and (b) lower rates of smoking behavior among undergraduates (n = 162, 41. 9 % female). We further assessed whether <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> expectations would explain both relationships. Results indicated that <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> fully mediated the relationship between distraction and engagement in pleasurable activities among college smokers. Although the relationships among distraction, <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation,</b> and cigarette consumption were not significant, {{they were in the}} expected direction (negative). Results from the present study point to the importance of prevention efforts focused on enhancing cognitive coping skills in college smokers. Such a focus may lead to more frequent adaptive cognitive coping during negative mood states, presumably instead of smoking...|$|R
40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have pointed out}} the need for investigation into how personality variables affect the coping process. Researchers have also called for more longitudinal studies of coping. The current research addresses these concerns. It comprises three studies conducted {{on the role of}} expectancies for <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> [...] as measured by the <b>Negative</b> Mood <b>Regulation</b> Scale (NMR; Catanzaro 2 ̆ 6 Mearns, 1989) [...] in shaping the affective consequences of experiencing a distressing event [...] in this case the end of a romantic relationship. College undergraduate subjects who had recently experienced the end of a romantic relationship completed the NMR, and measures of depression and coping strategy. In addition, they filled out a questionnaire which assessed characteristics of the ended relationship. Study 1 (N = 585) investigated whether high scorers on the NMR differed from low scorers in the intensity of depression they initially felt in the first week following the end of a romantic relationship. Study 2 (N = 119) presented longitudinal data which focused on whether NMR high scorers experienced a more rapid rise in mood over time than did low scorers. And, Study 3 (N = 78) presented prospective data on whether the NMR [...] taken six months previously [...] could uniquely predict initial and current depression following the subsequent end of a romantic relationship. ^ The results of the three studies reported here (a) provide support for the discriminant and predictive validity of the <b>Negative</b> Mood <b>Regulation</b> Scale, and (b) illuminate the process by which <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> expectancies affect people 2 ̆ 7 s moods following a distressing event. Individuals with high expectancies for mood regulation become less depressed following an upsetting event. In addition, these individuals also experience a greater decrease in depression over time, although this relationship is not independent of the person 2 ̆ 7 s initial level of depression. In all, {{results of this study suggest}} the value of research on the role of <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> expectancies in the coping process and of the <b>Negative</b> Mood <b>Regulation</b> Scale as a measure of these expectancies. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{canonical}} Wnt Pathway {{involves the}} accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which activates transcription factors. Casein kinase 1 epsilon, and related casein kinase 1 delta, is dephosphorylated in this pathway. Dephospho rylation of casein kinase 1 epsilon is likely achieved by Protein Phosphatase 2(PP2A), which increases both the enzymes' kinase activity in vivo. Casein kinase 1 epsilon and casein kinase 1 delta have been implicated in increasing β-catenin's stability in the cytoplasm, although studies of the mechanism for this stabilization are inconclusive. The current theory for how casein kinase 1 epsilon and/or casein kinase 1 delta function in this pathway is that both casein kinases either directly stabilize β-catenin though positive regulation, or that they indirectly stabilizes β-catenin through <b>negative</b> <b>regulation</b> of the β-catenin degradation complex (protease).|$|E
2500|$|Further {{experimentation}} with GFP-tagged proteins and mutant proteins {{indicates that the}} medial cortical nodes are formed by the ordered, Cdr2-dependent assembly of multiple interacting proteins during interphase.

[...] It has also been shown that Cdr2 recruits Wee1 to the medial cortical node. [...] The mechanism of this recruitment has yet to be discovered. [...] A Cdr2 kinase mutant, which is able to localize properly despite a loss of function in phosphorylation, disrupts the recruitment of Wee1 to the medial cortex and delays entry into mitosis. [...] Thus, Wee1 localizes with its inhibitory network, which demonstrates that mitosis is controlled through Cdr2-dependent <b>negative</b> <b>regulation</b> of Wee1 at the medial cortical nodes.|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{silencing}} {{may occur}} either via mRNA degradation or preventing mRNA from being translated. For example, miR16 contains a sequence complementary to the AU-rich element {{found in the}} 3'UTR of many unstable mRNAs, such as TNF alpha or GM-CSF. It has been demonstrated that given complete complementarity between the miRNA and target mRNA sequence, Ago2 can cleave the mRNA and lead to direct mRNA degradation. Absent complementarity, silencing is achieved by preventing translation. The relation of miRNA and its target mRNA(s) can {{be based on the}} simple <b>negative</b> <b>regulation</b> of a target mRNA, but it seems that a common scenario is the use of a [...] "coherent feed-forward loop", [...] "mutual negative feedback loop" [...] (also termed double negative loop) and [...] "positive feedback/feed-forward loop" [...] Some miRNAs work as buffers of random gene expression changes arising due to stochastic events in transcription, translation and protein stability. Such regulation is typically achieved by the virtue of negative feedback loops or incoherent feed-forward loop uncoupling protein output from mRNA transcription.|$|E

Method: The research design was a correlation study. The research sample consisted of 100 who were selected of the substance abusers that referred to clinical of addiction withdrawal by random sample method in Ardabil city. To collect the data, Emotion regulation Scale and Interpersonal Reactivity Index were used. Results: The results showed that positive and <b>negative</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> strategies were correlated to interpersonal behavior in substance abusers. The results of multiple regression analysis showed positive and <b>negative</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> strategies explained 16 percent of interpersonal behavior variance. Also the results showed that “putting into perspective“ was found to be the best predictor for interpersonal behavior.

Atf 3 is required for <b>negative</b> feedback <b>regulation</b> of other genes, but is itself subject to <b>negative</b> feedback <b>regulation</b> possibly by autorepression. In cardiomyocytes, Atf 3 and Egr 1 mRNAs are upregulated via ERK 1 / 2 signalling and Atf 3 suppresses Egr 1 expression. We previously developed a mathematical model for the Atf 3 -Egr 1 system. Here, we adjusted and extended the model to explore mechanisms of Atf 3 feedback regulation. Introduction of an autorepressive loop for Atf 3 tuned down its expression and inhibition of Egr 1 was lost, demonstrating that <b>negative</b> feedback <b>regulation</b> of Atf 3 by Atf 3 itself is implausible in this context. Experimentally, signals downstream from ERK 1 / 2 suppress Atf 3 expression.

40|$|Depression is a {{significant}} mental health risk in student populations. Mindfulness-based interventions have gained increasing support for improving mood and reducing depressive symptoms. This study of approximately 83 % White college students proposed (1) a theoretical model of mindfulness meditation and depressive symptoms with self-acceptance, <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation,</b> positive affect, and ruminative brooding as hypothesized mechanisms; and (2) a longitudinal randomized trial with an active control that dismantles the mindfulness meditation (MM) component of mindfulness-based interventions and compares it with relaxation training (RT). Findings from Study 1 (n = 514) using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), indicate that mindfulness, {{as measured by the}} Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), was statistically significantly related to self-acceptance, <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation,</b> and positive affect while indirectly and inversely related to ruminative brooding and depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D. Study 2 (n = 120) consisted of students screened for depressive symptoms who were randomly assigned to either an MM (n = 61) or an RT (n = 59) group and instructed to listen to a 20 -minute guided CD three times a week for four weeks. Participants were assessed at four time points: at baseline, 5, 12, and 24 weeks. Using a Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), results indicate that both groups improved significantly on depressive symptoms. There were statistically significant Time X Group differences for mindfulness and self-acceptance with the Time X Group differences in <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> approaching significance. Both groups experienced {{a significant}} decrease in ruminative brooding. Analyses of mediation indicate that self-acceptance, <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> and ruminative brooding mediate the effects of mindfulness on depressive symptoms, with <b>negative</b> mood <b>regulation</b> providing full mediation. This study provides a powerful examination of the effects of mindfulness on depressive symptoms. It is also of practical relevance in supporting the effectiveness of a stand-alone MM training in decreasing depressive symptoms. Findings from this study contribute to the ongoing dialogue on mindfulness meditation by proposing a model of mindfulness and depression and by isolating mindfulness as a key component of mindfulness-based interventions in precipitating improvement in psychological outcomes. ...|$|R
