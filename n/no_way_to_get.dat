25|$|At this time, Allied {{forces were}} working {{to push the}} Ottoman Troops back from the Canal and deep into the desert. To get their {{supplies}} in, {{it was decided that}} a railway would be built by the engineers. There was however a slight problem. There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the locomotives needed onto these rails. The Bridging Train was therefore tasked with building new wharves to unload the locomotives that would be needed for the desert trains, which they did by converting two small vessels into floating pile drivers.|$|E
25|$|By about 3:00p.m. on April 30, 1864, {{the federal}} forces finally crossed the Saline River {{with all their}} {{remaining}} men and the artillery pieces and equipment and supply wagons which were not irretrievably stuck in the mud, which they burned. Steele's forces were compelled to abandon many more wagons in the swamp north of the Saline River. The Confederates did not renew the attack as Steele's men crossed the pontoon bridge {{on the afternoon of}} April 30. Not only were the Confederates exhausted from the morning’s battle, but the federal forces had set up artillery and infantry {{on the opposite side of}} the river to protect the remaining federal soldiers as they crossed the bridge. After crossing the Saline River, Steele's forces cut and burned the pontoon bridge, which they would not need for the remainder of their march. With <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across the river, the Confederates could not follow them. By not trapping Steele's force at Camden or cutting them off before they reached the Saline River, the Confederates under Kirby Smith lost a good chance to destroy Steele's army, which was the major portion of federal forces in Arkansas. After crossing the river and three days' further march, Steele’s forces regrouped within the fortifications of Little Rock.|$|E

2500|$|In {{executing}} {{their search}} warrant, the federal agents supposedly seized over 10,000 {{copies of the}} documentary a/k/a Tommy Chong, which {{had yet to be}} released, though this was later retracted. Chong speculated that the initially alleged seizure may rest with prohibitions against one benefiting financially from a crime; however, Chong has not stated publicly that he has been charged with such an offense. In a statement released to the press, he stated [...] "It's [...] a way to punish the distributor financially. There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the DVDs back until the investigation is over." [...] Chong also stated that he has no ownership in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the scripts}} she {{turned out for}} Griffith went unproduced. Some he {{considered}} unfilmable because the [...] "laughs {{were all in the}} lines, there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them onto the screen," [...] but he encouraged her to continue, because reading them amused him. Her first screen credit was for an adaptation of Macbeth in which her billing came right after Shakespeare's. When Griffith asked her to write the subtitling for his epic Intolerance (1916), she traveled to New York City {{for the first time to}} attend its premiere. Instead of returning to Hollywood, Loos spent the fall of 1916 in New York and met with Frank Crowninshield of Vanity Fair. They had an instant rapport, and Loos would remain a Vanity Fair contributor for several decades.|$|E
2500|$|Insight 3 – No {{matter how}} well they have gained {{insights}} 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But {{it is unlikely that}} people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that there is usually <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute [...] "musts" [...] (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible preferences; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.|$|E

2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, but there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E
