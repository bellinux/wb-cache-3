5|$|Spiders in the French {{territory}} of New Caledonia in the Pacific {{were identified as}} L. hasselti in 1920, based on morphology. Their behaviour differs from Australian redbacks, as they do <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> sexual cannibalism and are less prone to biting humans.

They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce, and they could not leave Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.|$|E

Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes {{made by the}} feet {{in the ground and}} twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a {{peculiar}} habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport have different drinking outcome expectancies and normative beliefs than {{students who are}} <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. A cross-sectional survey of university students in England in 2008 – 2009 was undertaken. A questionnaire battery, including the Drinking Expectancies Questionnaire (DEQ) and a measure of normative beliefs, was completed by 770 students from seven universities across England. Responses from 638 students who were not abstaining from alcohol were analyzed. Students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport have significantly higher drinking expectancies of assertion compared with students <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. Moreover, students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport consistently report higher personal alcohol consumption and higher perceptions of consumption in those around them than students <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. Both assertion and the perception that students around them drink heavily provide only a partial explanation for why students <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport drink more than those <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> university sport. Further research is required to identify the reasons for heavy drinking among students involved in university sport in England...|$|R

5|$|Noted hadrosaur expert Jack Horner is {{currently}} the major advocate {{of the idea that}} Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> active hunting at all. Horner has presented several arguments to support the pure scavenger hypothesis. The presence of large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for sniffing out carcasses over great distances. The teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. At least some of its potential prey could move quickly, while evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{suspension}} of NATO flights, former US President Jimmy Carter personally negotiated a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia. Although there were some violations of this ceasefire, most of the parties in the conflict heeded it. NATO ordered its planes back in the air, but due to the diminished hostilities, they did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> any significant operations {{for the next several}} months. The reduced tensions resulting from the Carter ceasefire and the cessation of NATO air operations also led to the release of most of the UNPROFOR hostages over the next several weeks.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the bookseller and apothecary, the scholarly gentry class did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> trade professions, since scholars and government officials viewed the merchant class as lowly and contemptible. Sympathetic to the plight of farming peasants who had lost their land, a court edict of 94 CE stipulated that farming peasants who had been reduced to selling wares as street peddlers were not to be taxed as registered merchants, since the latter were heavily taxed by the state. Registered merchants, the majority being small urban shopkeepers, were obligated to pay commercial taxes in addition to the poll tax.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Beaty {{returned}} to Cincinnati {{and raised his}} family. His son, A. Lee Beaty, became an Ohio state legislator and an assistant U.S. District Attorney for southern Ohio. He resumed {{his career as a}} turner and pursued amateur acting and public speaking engagements. He gave public readings for charitable causes and became a well-known elocutionist among the African American community of Cincinnati. Through the 1870s he acted in local theaters and directed music and drama exhibitions in the city. He wrote a play about a rich southern planter entitled Delmar, or Scenes in Southland, which was performed in January 1881 with himself in the lead role. Set in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Massachusetts, the work covered the end of slavery and transition to freedom for blacks from 1860 to 1875. The privately run play was well received, but Beaty did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> self-promotion and it never moved into public theaters.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{addressed}} the Parliament of Australia and was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, {{one of the}} highest imperial honours that can be bestowed on a non-British subject—at the time, Australians were also British subjects. Diệm did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> substantive political discussions with the Australian leaders and {{he spent most of his}} time at public functions. He was universally extolled by the media, which praised him for what they perceived to be a successful, charismatic, democratic and righteous rule in South Vietnam, overlooking his authoritarianism, election fraud and other corrupt practices. The Australian Catholic leadership and media were particularly glowing towards the South Vietnamese head of state. A member of Vietnam's Catholic minority and the brother of Vietnam's leading archbishop, Diệm had pursued policies in Vietnam favoring his co-religionists. He exempted the Catholic Church from land redistribution, gave them more aid and job promotions, and allowed Catholic paramilitaries to attack Buddhists, who formed the religious majority.|$|E
40|$|Peculiarities of students’ {{physical}} fitness and body composition were identified through an international research project including Lithuania, Poland and Belorussia. The article deals with the data of research carried out in Lithuania. The study included 207 students (aged 19. 7 +- 1. 3).

5|$|From {{the time}} of British {{colonization}} of Australia in 1788, Indigenous Australians were characterised as nomadic hunter-gatherers who did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> agriculture, despite evidence to the contrary. In 1969, the archaeologist Rhys Jones proposed that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning {{as a way of}} enhancing natural productivity, what has been termed fire-stick farming. In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the Gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years. The archaeologist Harry Lourandos suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of 'intensification' in progress across Australia, a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years. These concepts led the historian Bill Gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such that United Nations Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two ammunition ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated arrival time September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply.

5|$|On 1 April 1927, Shoup {{and nine}} other {{officers}} were pulled from training to accompany a detachment of Marines sent to China to protect American interests during {{the instability of}} the Chinese Civil War. Embarking from San Diego with the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines, Shoup's contingent was to play a primarily defensive role, and <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> military action. Still, he was personally opposed to the mission, feeling that Americans in China were exploiting its people. The contingent landed in Shanghai on 10 June aboard USS Chaumont. Initially, they conducted shore patrol around American sections of the city. On 5 July the battalion was moved to Tientsin to protect American interests there should Chinese Nationalist troops threaten them. Shoup became seriously ill there, and remained hospitalized until it was announced U.S. troops would leave. He briefly returned to Shanghai to oversee foreign troop departures with the 4th Marines, before he departed from China on 7 December 1928.|$|E

5|$|The festivals {{associated}} with Vithoba primarily {{correspond to the}} bi-annual yatras (pilgrimages) of the Varkaris. The pilgrims travel to the Pandharpur temple from Alandi and Dehu, towns closely {{associated with}} poet-saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram respectively. Along the way, they sing abhangas (devotional songs) dedicated to Vithoba and repeat his name, carrying the palkhis (palanquins) of the poet-saints. Varkaris do <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> ritual worship but only practice darshan (visual adoration) of the deity. The ritual worship by the priests is restricted to five days each around the Ashadha (June–July) and Kartik (October–November) Ekadashis, when {{a large number of}} Varkaris participate in the yatras. In smaller numbers, the Varkaris also visit the temple on two other Ekadashis—in the Hindu months of Magha and Chaitra.|$|E

These broods did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> front-line combat unless necessary. The Command Wing included the Tiamat Brood, Baelrog Brood, and Fenris Brood. The Attack Wing broods were the Swarm's front-line forces, meant to conquer and occupy worlds. The wing's primary broods were amongst {{the largest in the}} Swarm.

5|$|The first royalist Chetnik {{units were}} mobilised {{by order of}} Draža Mihailović in August 1941. In late July, Mihailović had sent a regular officer, Lieutenant Colonel Veselin Misita to the Jadar {{district}} as his emissary. Misita had established himself at the Tronoša Monastery near Loznica. The abbot of the monastery was Georgije Bojić, {{who was also a}} captain in the Royal Yugoslav Army reserves. In August, Misita and Bojić held a meeting with pro-Chetnik people from the Jadar district to set up the Jadar Chetnik Detachment. Other key attendees included Nikola Gordić and Mika Komarčević. On 15 August, the 25-strong Cer Chetnik Detachment was formed under the command of a regular artillery officer, Captain First Class Dragoslav Račić. Due to Mihailović's position that the Chetniks should prepare for an uprising, but <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> fighting the occupiers until the time was right, some Chetniks left the Jadar detachment and joined the more aggressive Račić or the Partisans.|$|E
