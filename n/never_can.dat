25|$|For these reasons, the {{opinions}} of later students and scholars about the geography of Odysseus's travels vary enormously.

This {{would be considered a}} delusion, unless he were speaking figuratively, or if the belief had a cultural or religious source.|$|E

25|$|IWF {{filtering}} {{has been}} criticised as interfering with legitimate Internet activity while being ineffective against anyone intending to access objectionable content. One carefully argued discussion, while opposing {{such things as}} child pornography and terrorism, points out that filtering has side effects, as discussed in this section, and would not stop access to material such as images {{of child sexual abuse}} as it would not stop email, ftp, https, p2p, usenet, irc, or many other ways to access the same content. As there are simple encryption systems, it <b>never</b> <b>can</b> stop it - at best it just drives it underground and harder to assess and track.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{accepted}} Hoste to {{join him}} as a captain's servant on , which he boarded at Portsmouth {{at the end of}} April 1793. The ship joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Hood, and it was in the Mediterranean and Adriatic that Hoste saw most of his naval service. Extracts from Nelson's letters to his wife mention Hoste frequently; for example: ‘without exception one of the finest boys I ever met with’ and ‘his gallantry <b>never</b> <b>can</b> be exceeded, and each day rivets him stronger to my heart’. Another captain's servant on Agamemnon was Josiah Nisbet, Nelson's stepson, but the letters suggest that Hoste quickly became a favourite and that Josiah compared badly with him in many respects. Hoste was promoted to midshipman by Nelson on 1 February 1794 and served with him during the blockade of and subsequent assault on Corsica on 7 February.|$|E
25|$|Some feminists, such as Carole Pateman, {{believe that}} {{exploitation}} is in both prostitution and sex trafficking. They believe {{that even if}} the women agreed to be a sex worker in a foreign country that the worker was still trafficked because of the preceding conditions that lead her to believe that sex work was the only viable work option. Other feminists such as Kamala Kempadoo, on the other hand, believe that prostitution is a form of labor just like any other migrant labor; however, due to the criminalization of prostitution, prostitutes are then subject to coercion and exploitation and subsequent trafficking. In the USA, each year 80,000 women are arrested for prostitution. Current debates about modifications to Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 policy are based about these two arguments. In providing aid for victims of sex trafficking the government must take a stand on whether or not they believe the sex industry and sex trafficking are inherently linked. These people involved in prostitution have an 80% higher chance of sexually transmitted infections and many <b>never</b> <b>can</b> afford to seek treatment. This results in serious infections, lifelong diseases, and sometimes even death.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Holloway {{began an}} {{association}} with the Shaw Festival in Canada, playing Burgess in Candida. [...] He made what he considered his West End debut as a straight actor in Siege by David Ambrose at the Cambridge Theatre in 1972, co-starring with Alastair Sim and Michael Bryant. He returned to Shaw and Canada, playing the central character Walter/William in You <b>Never</b> <b>Can</b> Tell in 1973.|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{followed}} the first trilogy with a second, published as [...] "Plays Pleasant". Arms and the Man (1894) conceals beneath a mock-Ruritanian comic romance a Fabian parable contrasting impractical idealism with pragmatic socialism. The {{central theme of}} Candida (1894) is a woman's choice between two men; the play contrasts the outlook and aspirations of a Christian Socialist and a poetic idealist. The third of the Pleasant group, You <b>Never</b> <b>Can</b> Tell (1896), portrays social mobility, and the gap between generations, particularly in how they approach social relations in general and mating in particular.|$|E
500|$|From this time, Edward {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, Edward attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, Nellie Clifden, who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers. Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at Cambridge to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861 just two weeks after the visit. Queen Victoria was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes {{for the rest of her}} life and blamed Edward for his father's death. At first, she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>can,</b> or shall, look at him without a shudder." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{his next}} four stage productions, Richardson {{was at the}} Haymarket. Father Carving a Statue (1964) by Graham Greene was short-lived. He had a more {{reliable}} vehicle in Shaw's You <b>Never</b> <b>Can</b> Tell (1966) in which he played the philosopher-waiter William, {{and in the same}} year he had a great success as Sir Anthony Absolute in The Rivals. The critic David Benedictus wrote of Richardson's performance, [...] "...he is choleric and gouty certainly, the script demands that he shall be, but his most engaging quality, his love for his son in spite of himself, shines through every line." [...] In 1967 he again played Shylock; this was the last time he acted in a Shakespeare play on stage. His performance won critical praise, {{but the rest of the}} cast were less well received.|$|E
500|$|Crawford lists {{numerous}} playwrights {{whose work}} owes {{something to that}} of Shaw. Among those active in Shaw's lifetime he includes Noël Coward, who based his early comedy The Young Idea on You <b>Never</b> <b>Can</b> Tell and continued {{to draw on the}} older man's works in later plays. T. S. Eliot, by no means an admirer of Shaw, admitted that the epilogue of Murder in the Cathedral, in which Becket's slayers explain their actions to the audience, might have been influenced by Saint Joan. The critic Eric Bentley comments that Eliot's later play The Confidential Clerk [...] "had all the earmarks of Shavianism... without the merits of the real Bernard Shaw". Among more recent British dramatists, Crawford marks Tom Stoppard as [...] "the most Shavian of contemporary playwrights"; Shaw's [...] "serious farce" [...] is continued in the works of Stoppard's contemporaries Alan Ayckbourn, Henry Livings and Peter Nichols.|$|E
500|$|When Berry was {{released}} from prison in 1963 his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bands—notably the Beatles and the Rolling Stones—had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs, and other bands had reworked some of them, such as the Beach Boys' 1963 hit [...] "Surfin' U.S.A.", which used the melody of Berry's [...] "Sweet Little Sixteen". In 1964 and 1965 Berry released eight singles, including three that were commercially successful, reaching the top 20 of the Billboard 100: [...] "No Particular Place to Go" [...] (a humorous reworking of [...] "School Days", concerning the introduction of seat belts in cars), [...] "You <b>Never</b> <b>Can</b> Tell", and the rocking [...] "Nadine". Between 1966 and 1969 Berry released five albums for Mercury Records, including his first live album, Live at Fillmore Auditorium, in which he was backed by the Steve Miller Band.|$|E

500|$|Hordern made {{a return}} to the London stage in 1987 after a {{four-year}} absence. The play in which he starred, You <b>Never</b> <b>Can</b> Tell, transferred to the Haymarket Theatre that December having made its debut at the Theatr Clwyd in Wales earlier that year. It was the second time the actor had appeared in the play, the first being back in Bristol fifty years previously when he starred as the youthful lead, Valentine. This time he was cast as William, the elderly waiter, a part which he considered to be [...] "a real hell to play", partly because of the many meals he had to serve up on stage, whilst at the same time trying to remember the complex script. [...] He enjoyed the play immensely and was thrilled at its successful run. [...] His engagement also gave him a chance to reunite with some old friends, including Irene Worth, Michael Denison and Frank Middlemass, all of whom were in the cast. Hordern admitted that, on the whole, the experience made him feel [...] "a little happier" [...] about life.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the draft law, meetings in Stillwater and Jerseytown resolved that [...] "A war carried on contrary to the rules and provisions of , {{whether it be a}} crusade against slavery, or any other fanatical or delusory scheme, <b>never</b> <b>can</b> and never will receive our support." [...] The Columbia Democrat also objected to the new draft laws. When Samuel F. Pealer, a draft officer, attempted to recruit four men in Stillwater, one of the men threatened to [...] "knock [...] brains out". Unrest increased still further after a costly military campaign in Virginia in early 1864. By June of that year, opposition to the draft was made clear when 75 percent of all people drafted in Columbia County failed to show up. Tension was especially high in the community of Mifflinville, where many people in the county accused one another of conspiracy. The accusations became exaggerated, leading to the rumors of a fort in the mountains at the headwaters of Fishing Creek. Some people even claimed to have seen the fort and the trails along which cannons were supposedly dragged.|$|E
500|$|In the Quarterly Review in 1821, the English {{writer and}} theologian Richard Whately {{published}} {{the most serious}} and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: [...] "we suspect one of Miss Austin's [...] great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female [...] heroines are what one knows women must be, though one <b>never</b> <b>can</b> get them to acknowledge it." [...] No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had {{set the tone for}} the Victorian era's view of Austen.|$|E

500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably <b>never</b> <b>can</b> do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
500|$|Media {{reactions}} to the race were positive, with Kevin Eason of The Times saying, [...] "What the inaugural Rockingham 500 CART FedEx race in Britain lacked in quantity, it made up for with driving of the highest quality." [...] He reserved praise for de Ferran's last lap overtake on Bräck, calling it [...] "astonishing". Writing for The Sunday Telegraph, Brough Scott stated, [...] "Births have always come with their share of noise, difficulty, danger and the odd touch of absurdity. But <b>never</b> <b>can</b> all the elements have been mixed as heavily as in yesterday's much-delayed launch of the Rockingham 500, which opened and closed with overtaking manoeuvres dramatic enough to take your breath away." [...] Richard Williams of The Guardian wrote, [...] "the 38,000 people who had battled against uncertainty and Silverstone-style traffic jams to see US single-seater cars racing on a banked oval track {{for the first time}} in Britain were rewarded with a race that fully reflected the present strengths of a branch of motor sport that can trace its roots back to the first running of the Indianapolis 500 race in 1911." [...] The Associated Press stated that despite the race almost being cancelled it became [...] "one of CART's most dramatic of the season." ...|$|E
500|$|Born into {{a middle-class}} African-American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an {{interest}} in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded [...] "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song [...] "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more hits, including [...] "No Particular Place to Go", [...] "You <b>Never</b> <b>Can</b> Tell", and [...] "Nadine". But these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion.|$|E
