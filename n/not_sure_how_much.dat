Ann Hornaday praised the prologue, describing it as [...] "worthy of Chaplin in its heartbreaking poignancy." [...] Chicago Tribune editor Michael Phillips praised the scene, describing it as an emotional and cinematic powerhouse, and that he also was nearly moved to tears. However, Salon.com editor Stephanie Zacharek criticized the love between Carl and Ellie, describing their marriage as resembling a dental adhesive commercial more than a real relationship.|$|E

Preliminary results suggest that ownership restrictions may not be needed if the owners of news channels have strong and diverse political motives quite different from the general citizenry- for then there would be no mergers contemplated. However, strong political motives that are not too dissimilar from those of the citizenry may lead to mergers that restrict the information divulged, and thus might be proscribed. If political motives are weak, then the merged entity will want to commit to impartial reporting, so that mergers are not harmful to information dissemination...|$|R

In any two-person, zero-sum game (where one person wins what the other person loses), it is not possible for the game to be advantageous to both players.

50|$|With that said, {{there are}} some {{concerns}} related to cause marketing. The issue of trust has emerged as central to {{the potential for the}} impact of cause marketing. Specifically, 78% of consumers reported that a partnership between a nonprofit and a company that they trust makes a cause stand out (2010, Cone Nonprofit Marketing Trend Tracker). If a consumer doesn't trust the business that is behind the cause marketing campaign, it can be seen as an insincere effort to attract more loyalty from consumers. For that reason, {{it is important that the}} cause marketing campaign be authentic to the brand image of the products which are running the marketing campaign. Another potential issue with cause marketing is the possible increase in the price of the cause-related products. In fact, only 19% of consumers would be willing to buy a more expensive brand if it supported a cause (Cone, 2010). Consumers are also <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money actually gets donated, according to Eikenberry (2009). In the age of social media, it is essential that the business supporting the cause marketing campaign is transparent about how the funds are being used and what amount/percent of funds are donated to the cause.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The main {{objective of this}} research project is to understand how people negotiate and what aspects of the situation they use {{as an aid to}} reach an agreement. Any aspect of a bargaining situation that helps bargainers to coordinate their expectations and behaviour so as to reach an agreement is called a 'focal point'. The purpose of this research is to extend our knowledge about focal points in bargaining situations. There are two sub-projects: In some bargaining situations, such as the division of land, allocation of mineral deposits or oil fields, or the division of an inheritance, there may be no division of the valuable resource that equates money earnings and there may be no equitable outcome. What aspects, if any, become focal in such situations? In many bargaining situations negotiators are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> others stand to gain from any given agreement. How does the absence of such information influence the focality of various divisions of the resource? Real bargaining situations are complex {{and it is difficult to}} find 'clean' data that allows one to isolate the role of particular factors on the observed bargaining behaviour. We shall therefore use lab experiments. This allows us to isolate the role played by a variable of interest while controlling for the influence of other potential factors...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The State-Level Paid Family and Medical Leave {{simulation}} model we developed estimates {{the number of}} family and medical leaves taken or needed in a state {{as well as the}} current employer and employee wage costs associated with those leaves. The model has the capacity to estimate the new and redistributed wage-replacement costs of any new proposed program. The {{simulation model}} relies on information collected from a survey on leave taking behavior conducted by Abt Associates for the US Department of Labor in 2012. Using this information we are able to estimate the probability of who takes a leave, what type, for how long, and based on if they receive employer pay and their own income level the use of a paid leave program. We use these probability estimates to simulate leave taking in Massachusetts using data about individuals from the American Community Survey which allows us to also estimate a host of geographic, employer, and employee characteristics about leave takers and needers. We simulate the decision to use a program versus not to use a program based on several knowable aspects that might go into this decision. These include the generosity of the program compared to employer benefits, length of leave taken, length of leave covered by the program, eligibility requirements, job protection, and individual demographics. But there are decisions to use a program that we cannot model, because these are unknown. These include ease of use, knowledge of the program, and workplace culture in the state. These later aspects will affect the take-up of the program, but we are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> by <b>how</b> <b>much...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{box office}} gross of The Birth of a Nation is not known, and was long subject to exaggeration. At {{the end of}} 1917, Epoch {{reported}} to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million, and Griffith's own records put Epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919, although the distributor's share of the revenue at this time was {{much lower than the}} exhibition gross. In the biggest cities, Epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office; elsewhere, the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor (an arrangement known as [...] "state's rights" [...] distribution). The film historian Richard Schickel says that under the state's rights contracts, Epoch typically received about 10% of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that [...] "Birth certainly generated more than $60 million in box-office business in its first run". By 1940 Time magazine estimated the film's cumulative gross rental (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million. For years Variety had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million. It is <b>not</b> known for <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the film has earned in total, but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version.
