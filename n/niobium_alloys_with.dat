40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{response of}} various niobium based refractory alloys from the Nb-Mo-Si-B-X alloy {{system has been}} examined at temperatures between 700 and 1400 °C in air. The development of these alloys {{was part of an}} ongoing effort to develop and discover a new materials system capable of replacing nickel based super alloys. Additions of titanium were found to provide limited oxidation resistance. A discontinuous layer of TiO 2 was observed to from at temperatures above 1100 °C. Alloys containing titanium additions were observed to suffer from pest oxidation at low and intermediate temperatures due to the development of Nb 2 O 5. Poor oxidation resistance at intermediate temperatures for alloys with titanium additions was attributed to a transformation in the structure of Nb 2 O 5 formed. Additions of chromium were observed to increase oxidation resistance through the development of a layered oxide structure containing SiO 2 and CrNbO 4. An intermediate oxidation layer was observed to develop along the oxide metal interface in which the solid solution was not oxidized. These alloys were found to be susceptible to pest oxidation at intermediate and low oxidation temperatures between 700 and 1000 °C. Boron and molybdenum content was modified and shown to suppress pest oxidation at 700 °C. Modified molybdenum content {{led to the development of}} molybdenum based primary solid solution instead of <b>niobium.</b> <b>Alloys</b> <b>with</b> modified molybdenum and boron content were found to have the best oxidation resistance surviving 168 hours of cyclic oxidation at 1400 °C. Transient oxidation behavior was observed in thermal gravimetric results collected at 1200 °C in the alloys with modified boron and molybdenum content and attributed to the preferential oxidation of Nb 5 Si 3. Oxidation behavior was characterized by the weight change per surface area method and by thermal gravimetric analysis. Oxidation products were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy in several modes including backscatter imaging, secondary imaging, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray mapping. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} {{material}} system currently used for low thrust, radiation-cooled rockets is a <b>niobium</b> <b>alloy</b> (C- 103) <b>with</b> a fused silica coating (R- 512 A or R- 512 E) for oxidation protection. However, {{significant amounts of}} fuel film cooling are usually required to keep the material below its maximum operating temperature of 1370 C, degrading engine performance. Also the R- 512 coating is subject to cracking and eventual spalling after repeated thermal cycling. A new class of high-temperature, oxidation-resistant materials are being developed for radiation-cooled rockets, with the thermal margin to reduce or eliminate fuel film cooling, while still exceeding the life of silicide-coated niobium. Rhenium coated with iridium is the most developed of these high-temperature materials. Efforts are on-going to develop 22 N, 62 N, and 440 N engines composed of these materials for apogee insertion, attitude control, and other functions. There is also a complimentary NASA and industry effort to determine the life limiting mechanisms and characterize the thermomechanical properties of these materials.

40|$|NASA and {{industry}} partners are working towards fabrication process development {{to reduce costs}} and schedules associated with manufacturing liquid rocket engine components {{with the goal of}} reducing overall mission costs. One such technique being evaluated is powder-bed fusion or selective laser melting (SLM), commonly referred to as additive manufacturing (AM). The NASA Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) program was designed to develop processes and material characterization for GRCop- 84 (a NASA Glenn Research Center-developed copper, chrome, <b>niobium</b> <b>alloy)</b> commensurate <b>with</b> powder bed AM, evaluate bimetallic deposition, and complete testing of a full scale combustion chamber. As part of this development, the process has been transferred to industry partners to enable a long-term supply chain of monolithic copper combustion chambers. To advance the processes further and allow for optimization with multiple materials, NASA is also investigating the feasibility of bimetallic AM chambers. In addition to the LCUSP program, NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has completed a series of development programs and hot-fire tests to demonstrate SLM GRCop- 84 and other AM techniques. MSFCs efforts include a 4, 000 pounds-force thrust liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/CH 4) combustion chamber. Small thrust chambers for 1, 200 pounds-force LOX/hydrogen (H 2) applications have also been designed and fabricated with SLM GRCop- 84. Similar chambers have also completed development with an Inconel 625 jacket bonded to the GRCop- 84 material, evaluating direct metal deposition (DMD) laser- and arc-based techniques. The same technologies for these lower thrust applications are being applied to 25, 000 - 35, 000 pounds-force main combustion chamber (MCC) designs.

40|$|Radiation-cooled rockets {{are used}} {{for a range of}} low-thrust {{propulsion}} functions, including apogee insertion, attitude control, and repositioning of satellites, reaction control of launch vehicles, and primary propulsion for planetary space- craft. The key to high performance and long lifetimes for radiation-cooled rockets is the chamber temperature capability. The material system that is currently used for radiation-cooled rockets, a <b>niobium</b> <b>alloy</b> (C 103) <b>with</b> a fused silica coating, has a maximum operating temperature of 1370 C. Temperature limitations of C 103 rockets force the use of fuel film cooling, which degrades rocket performance and, in some cases, imposes a plume contamination issue from unburned fuel. A material system composed of a rhenium (Re) substrate and an iridium (Ir) coating has demonstrated operation at high temperatures (2200 C) and for long lifetimes (hours). The added thermal margin afforded by iridium-coated rhenium (Ir/Re) allows reduction or elimination of fuel film cooling. This, in turn, leads to higher performance and cleaner spacecraft environments. There are ongoing government- and industry-sponsored efforts to develop flight Ir/ Re engines, with the primary focus on 440 -N, apogee insertion engines. Complementing these Ir/Re engine development efforts is a program to address specific concerns and fundamental characterization of the Ir/Re material system, including (1) development of Ir/Re rocket fabrication methods, (2) establishment of critical Re mechanical properly data, (3) development of reliable joining methods, and (4) characterization of Ir/Re life-limiting mechanisms...|$|R
