40|$|SummaryHere, we have {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} Notch pathway in the generation and maintenance of KrasG 12 V-driven non-small cell lung carcinomas (<b>NSCLCs).</b> We demonstrate by genetic means that γ-secretase and RBPJ are essential for the formation of <b>NSCLCs.</b> Of importance, pharmacologic treatment of mice carrying autochthonous <b>NSCLCs</b> with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocks cancer growth. Treated carcinomas present reduced HES 1 levels and reduced phosphorylated ERK without changes in phosphorylated MEK. Mechanistically, we show that HES 1 directly binds to and represses the promoter of DUSP 1, encoding a dual phosphatase that is active against phospho-ERK. Accordingly, GSI treatment upregulates DUSP 1 and decreases phospho-ERK. These data provide proof of the in vivo therapeutic potential of GSIs in primary <b>NSCLCs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: Identify symptom {{clusters}} {{based on}} symptoms experienced by patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancers (<b>NSCLCs),</b> {{and examine the}} relationship between the symptom clusters and impairment in everyday life and quality of life (QOL). Methods: Using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, 9 symptom items and the QOL Questionnaire (QLQ-C- 30) evaluation apparatus from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, we evaluated symptom severity, interference in daily life, and QOL. Factor analysis and multiple regression analysis techniques were used. Results: Sixty patients with advanced <b>NSCLCs</b> seen in pulmonary medicine departments were included in the study. The average age of patients was 64. 33 (standard deviation = 11. 40). Thirty-six were male and 24 were female. Three symptom clusters were identified as fatigue/anorexia cluster (dry mouth, altered the sense of taste, drowsiness, fatigue/tiredness, and lack of appetite), pain cluster (anxiety, sadness, and pain), numbness cluster (numbness, leg weakness, and distress). The pain cluster had the strongest influence (adjusted R 2 = 0. 355) on daily life (emotions) while the numbness cluster most strongly affected walking. The fatigue/anorexia cluster explained 22. 7 % of role function variance. This symptom clustering may be unique among patients with advanced <b>NSCLCs.</b> Conclusions: Each of these clusters affected QOL and everyday life with varying degrees of influence. In clinical screening assessments, focusing on symptom clusters could provide tailored management strategies for patients with advanced <b>NSCLCs.</b> These care strategies may improve outcomes specifically for advanced <b>NSCLCs</b> patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAir {{pollution}} {{has been}} classified as Group 1 carcinogenic to humans, but the underlying tumorigenesis remains unclear. In Xuanwei City of Yunnan Province, the lung cancer incidence {{is among the}} highest in China attributed to severe air pollution generated by combustion of smoky coal, providing a unique opportunity to dissect lung carcinogenesis of air pollution. Here we analyzed the somatic mutations of 164 non-small cell lung cancers (<b>NSCLCs)</b> from Xuanwei and control regions (CR) where smoky coal was not used. Whole genome sequencing revealed a mean of 289 somatic exonic mutations per tumor and the frequent C:G→A:T nucleotide substitutions in Xuanwei <b>NSCLCs.</b> Exome sequencing of 2010 genes showed that Xuanwei and CR <b>NSCLCs</b> had a mean of 68 and 22 mutated genes per tumor, respectively (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{identification}} of the molecular events that drive cancer transformation {{is essential to the}} development of targeted agents that improve the clinical outcome of lung cancer. Many studies have reported genomic driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancers (<b>NSCLCs)</b> over the past decade; however, the molecular pathogenesis of > 40 % of <b>NSCLCs</b> is still unknown. To identify new molecular targets in <b>NSCLCs,</b> we performed the combined analysis of massively parallel whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing for cancer and paired normal tissue of a 33 -yr-old lung adenocarcinoma patient, who is a never-smoker and has no familial cancer history. The cancer showed no known driver mutation in EGFR or KRAS and no EML 4 -ALK fusion. Here we report a novel fusion gene between KIF 5 B and the RET proto-oncogene caused by a pericentric inversion of 10 p 11. 22 –q 11. 21. This fusion gene overexpresses chimeric RET receptor tyrosine kinase, which could spontaneously induce cellular transformation. We identified the KIF 5 B-RET fusion in two more cases out of 20 primary lung adenocarcinomas in the replication study. Our data demonstrate that a subset of <b>NSCLCs</b> could be caused by a fusion of KIF 5 B and RET, and suggest the chimeric oncogene as a promising molecular target for the personalized diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer...|$|R

Such genetic alterations occur in a significant proportion of non-small cell lung carcinomas (<b>NSCLCs)</b> and include amplification of 14 q 13. 3, which contains the TTF 1 gene. We asked whether TTF 1 amplification is associated with increased TTF 1 protein expression in <b>NSCLCs,</b> and whether TTF 1 is associated with clinicopathological features, including patient survival. We used a FISH assay and quantitative immunohistochemical staining to interrogate a population-based cohort of 538 <b>NSCLCs</b> from Swiss patients for TTF 1 amplification and protein expression. We found TTF 1 amplification in ∼ 13 % of adenocarcinomas (ACs) and in ∼ 9 % of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and TTF 1 amplification was associated with increased TTF 1 protein expression. High-level TTF 1 expression was significantly associated with smaller tumour size, female gender and longer overall survival only among ACs (median survival 82 versus 28 months; p = 0. 002). On multivariate analysis, high TTF 1 expression was an independent predictor of favourable prognosis in patients with AC [hazard ratio, 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 38 – 0. 83); p = 0. 008]. We conclude that TTF 1 amplification is a mechanism of high-level TTF 1 expression in a subset of <b>NSCLCs.</b> When expressed at high levels, this routinely used diagnostic marker is also an independent biomarker of favourable prognosis in AC.

In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines.

40|$|Introduction:The {{hepatocyte}} growth factor/MET pathway {{has been}} shown to cause tumor progression in several types of carcinomas. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the correlations between c-MET/phospho-MET expression as well as MET gene copy number alterations and overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung carcinomas (<b>NSCLCs).</b> Methods:We analyzed 906 <b>NSCLCs</b> including 704 adenocarcinomas (ADCs), 150 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 43 sarcomatoid carcinomas, and 9 large cell carcinomas. The mutational status of epidermal growth factor receptor and K-ras and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements were retrospectively examined. We performed immunohistochemistry to detect c-MET/phospho-MET expression and MET gene copy number using bright-field in situ hybridization (BISH). Results:c-MET/phospho-MET expression and MET BISH positivity were observed in 22. 2 %, 5. 6 %, and 10. 9 % of <b>NSCLCs,</b> respectively; they were more prevalent in ADCs (27. 3 %, 6. 9 %, and 11. 5 %, respectively) and sarcomatoid carcinomas (20. 9 %, 9. 3 %, and 36. 6 %, respectively) than in SCCs and large cell carcinomas. Among ADCs, poorly differentiated cases exhibited c-MET expression and MET BISH positivity more commonly than well-differentiated ones. An analysis of all patients revealed that c-MET/phospho-MET expression and MET BISH positivity were not correlated with OS. However, when SCC cases were excluded, both univariate (p= 0. 019) and multivariate (p= 0. 020) analyses revealed a significant correlation between MET BISH positivity and OS. Conclusions:c-MET/phospho-MET expression and MET BISH positivity differed according to histological type.

Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery.

40|$|Non-small cell lung cancers (<b>NSCLCs)</b> are {{the leading}} cause of cancer deaths in most {{developed}} countries. Targeting heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) expression and function, together with the induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), could overcome the multiple anti-cell death mechanisms evidenced in <b>NSCLCs</b> that are responsible for the failure of currently used chemotherapeutic drugs. Because cardenolides bind to the sodium pump, they affect multiple signaling pathways and thus have a number of marked effects on tumor cell behavior. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize in vitro and in vivo the antitumor effects of a new cardenolide (UNBS 1450) on experimental human <b>NSCLCs.</b> UNBS 1450 is a potent source of in vivo antitumor activity in the case of paclitaxel- and oxaliplatin-resistant subcutaneous human NCl-H 727 and orthotopic A 549 xenografts in nude mice. In vitro UNBS 1450 -mediated antitumor activity results from the induction of nonapoptotic cell death. UNBS 1450 mediates the decrease of Hsp 70 at both mRNA and protein levels, and this is at least partly due to UNBS 1450 -induced downregulation of NFAT 5 /TonEBP (a factor responsible for the transcriptional control of Hsp 70).

However, mechanisms how these pathways regulate sensitivity and resistance to EGFR-TKI in <b>NSCLCs</b> remain largely undetermined. Here we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 represses Smad 3 in synergy with the potent negative regulators of TGF-β signaling, c-Ski and SnoN, whereby renders gefitinib-sensitive HCC 827 cells resistant. We found that IL- 6 signaling via phosphorylated Stat 3 induced gefitinib resistance as repressing transcription of Smad 3, whereas TGF-β enhanced gefitinib sensitivity as activating transcription of Smad 3 in HCC 827 cells with gefitinib-sensitizing EGFR mutation. Promoter analyses showed that Stat 3 synergized with c-Ski/SnoN to repress Smad 2 / 3 / 4 -induced transcription of the Smad 3 gene. Smad 3 {{was found to be}} an apoptosis inducer, which upregulated pro-apoptotic genes such as caspase- 3 and downregulated anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl- 2.
