40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that in a competitive market, prices tend to converge. This article examines the prices of small-denomination (<$ 100, 000) certificates of deposit (CDs) offered by commercial banks in 50 major US cities. Owing to information provided by internet websites, the markets for CDs have become increasingly competitive in recent years. Nevertheless, we found large variations in CD rates and yields among the banks in major US cities, and across cities. To date, research regarding small denomination retail CDs {{has focused on the}} relationship between the rates and market-common or macroeconomic factors. Our study is unique in that the primary focus is to identify bank-specific variables explaining significant variations in retail CD yields, thereby enabling more effective revenue management in a broad sense. We find very strong evidence that asset size, the cost of funding earning assets, and the ratio of <b>non-interest-bearing</b> <b>deposits</b> to total deposits are the factors characterising those differences. Taken together, it suggests that the large banks with higher cost of funding and lower non-interest-bearing deposit ratio {{would be willing to pay}} the higher prices on their retail CDs, indicating that liquidity would play a prime role in pricing retail CDs. bank-specific factors; CD yields; microstructure; revenue management; retail pricing; CD pricing; certificates of deposit; commercial banking; USA; United States; liquidity. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} the effects of capital controls. We show that controls have been associated with significant differences in macroeconomic behaviour, especially in monetary policy. While they have not prevented speculative attacks, they have provided the breathing space needed to organize orderly realignments. We also provide {{evidence on the}} channels through which speculative attacks operate, showing that bank lending to non-residents is a key transmission mechanism. We conclude with a discussion of measures that mimic some of the effects of controls as a way of easing the transition to European Monetary Union. <b>Non-interest-bearing</b> <b>deposit</b> requirements on lending to non-residents are proposed as a third-best route to monetary union.

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} examine {{the impact of}} monetary-base growth on {{inflation}} in the post-World War II United States. The most significant and stable empirical relationship is between monetary base growth and inflation. However, the authors also find that <b>non-interest-bearing</b> demand <b>deposit</b> growth has an impact on inflation. The relation between demand deposit growth and inflation was strongest during the Bretton Woods era, but apparently remains significant in the post-Bretton Woods period. The authors' results indicate that newer interest-bearing transactions deposits in M 1, as well as in M 2 -category deposits, play no role in inflation.
