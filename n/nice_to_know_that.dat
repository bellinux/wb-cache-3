500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you people thought I did a good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've never seen anything like it. That made it twice as good. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.|$|E
500|$|The reveal of Sheriff Lamb's {{death was}} not leaked {{anywhere}} online prior to the airing of [...] "Mars, Bars", something about which Muhney was happy. He stated that [...] "the surprise was the best part" [...] and that he disliked it when spoilers from other series were released early. After the episode's initial airing, Muhney reported that his inbox was flooded with emails from press members seeking interviews, stating that new messages came after the airing in each United States time zone. Some fans were upset about his death, and debate occurred online. However, Muhney also received messages {{of support for the}} character, commenting [...] "it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he will be missed." [...] With the announcement of the Veronica Mars film in 2013, Zap2it speculated that Muhney might return; however, this was later revealed not to be the case when the official casting was announced. Thomas praised Daran Norris's performance in the episode, particularly his voice in the scene in which he defends Steve Botando in front of Sheriff Lamb. Thomas noted that Norris was also a voice actor and that he was particularly well-liked on the set for his humorous performances.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of Melody Maker {{praised the}} musicianship {{of the band}} and Anderson's flute playing, writing also that [...] "the joke {{at the expense of}} a local {{newspaper}} wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of Thick"; he described the music as a creative effort where [...] "the ideas flow in super abundance" [...] but that [...] "needs time to absorb" [...] and [...] "heard out of context of their highly visual stage act... does not have such immediate appeal". Tony Tyler in his review for New Musical Express generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album's possible success. He called Thick as a Brick [...] "Jethro Tull's own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of Tommy" [...] and [...] "an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in '70s Britain". Ben Gerson in Rolling Stone magazine called Thick as a Brick [...] "one of rock's most sophisticated and ground-breaking products". Going further, the reviewer stated: [...] "Martin Barre's guitar and John Evan's keyboards especially shine, and Ian's singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not Thick As A Brick is an isolated experiment, it is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> someone in rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace." [...] Rolling Stones Dave Marsh gave it 2 out of 5 stars in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, judging it had [...] "relatively undifferentiated movements". American critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it [...] "the usual shit: rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)".|$|E

[...] In October 2015 at Santa Clara University Scalia told law students that Justice Jackson's dissenting opinion in Korematsu was the past court opinion he admired most, adding [...] "It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> at least somebody on the court realized that that was wrong." ...|$|E

6000|$|At {{nineteen}} {{he was a}} limber, freckled {{youth with}} a wide mouth, light eyes, long dark lashes; a rather charming smile, considerable knowledge of what he should not know, and no experience of what he ought to do. Few boys had more narrowly escaped being expelled--the engaging rascal. After kissing his mother and pinching Imogen, he ran upstairs three at a time, and came down four, dressed for dinner. He was awfully sorry, but his 'trainer,' who had come up too, {{had asked him to}} dine at the Oxford and Cambridge; it wouldn't do to miss--the old chap would be hurt. Winifred let him go with an unhappy pride. She had wanted him at home, but it was very <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> his tutor was so fond of him.

5000|$|Nathan of New Release Tuesday said, [...] "Bebo Norman {{described}} his music on his self titled record dramatic and surprisingly so it’s {{not so far}} off the mark.
