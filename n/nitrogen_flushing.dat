This property is exploited for efficient production of lactate and succinate. Our detailed analysis revealed that marginal growth takes place under anaerobic conditions with glucose, fructose, sucrose, or ribose as a carbon and energy source but not with gluconate, pyruvate, lactate, propionate, or acetate. Supplementation of glucose minimal medium with tryptone strongly enhanced growth up to a final optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) of 12, whereas tryptone alone did not allow growth. Amino acids with a high ATP demand for biosynthesis and amino acids of the glutamate family were particularly important for growth stimulation, indicating ATP limitation and a restricted carbon flux into the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle toward 2 -oxoglutarate.

Analysis {{was carried out}} by low resolution direct probe mass spectrometry (MS). Spectra from extracts of the open tube pyrolyzed material had a series of ions characteristic of tetra- and pentabrominated dibenzofurans as evidenced by comparison with spectra from 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrabromodibenzofuran (TBDF). Confirmatory evidence for the brominated dibenzofurans was obtained by high resolution MS dual ion analysis of certain fragment and molecular ions. Recovery values of TBDF through the cleanup procedure averaged 50 % and, using this recovery value and TBDF as an external standard, dual ion analyses indicated that 40 ppm tetra- and 4 ppm pentabrominanted dibenzofuran were produced based on the PBB level used in the pyrolysis experiments. Additional analysis of the open tube pyrolyzed material by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry provided evidence that there was one tetrabromodibenzofuran compound with a retention time equal to that of TBDF. Trace levels (less than 1 ppm) of the molecular ion of tetrabrominated dibenzofuran were found after analysis by low resolution MS of the PBB pyrolyzed under nitrogen in sealed tubes.

40|$|The photoautotrophic {{cyanobacterium}} Anacystis nidulans {{was used}} to investigate the membrane transport of branched-chain, neutral amino acids and its dependence on photosynthetic reactions. The uptake of alpha-amino [1 - 14 C]isobutyric acid and L-[1 - 14 C]leucine followed Michaelis, Menten kinetics and resulted in an energy-dependent accumulation. As in bacteria, different uptake systems for neutral amino acids were present: two DAG (D-alanine, aminoisobutyric acid, and glycine) systems responsible for uptake of alpha-amino [1 - 14 C]isobutyric acid, and one LIV (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) system, responsible for uptake of leucine. The low-affinity DAG system seemed {{to be dependent on}} the presence of Na+ ions. Uptake was enhanced by white light and by monochromatic light of 630 nm. In far red light (717 nm) with and without <b>nitrogen</b> <b>flushing,</b> considerable uptake dependent on light intensity and inhibition by dibromothymoquinone and by high concentrations of KCN were observed. Therefore, the energy generated by photosystem I reactions only could perform this membrane transport. The proton translocator carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as an ATPase inhibitor reduced amino acid uptake to a high degree. A pH dependence of aminoisobutyric acid and leucine uptake was obvious, with a maximum at pH 6 to 7 and some at a pH as high as 9. 5. At higher pH, increasing concentrations of Na+ K+ and also of triphenylmethylphosphonium ions inhibited the transport of aminoisobutyric acid. These findings are consistent with the assumption that ATP from photosynthetic reactions drives a membrane-bound proton-translocating ATPase producing a proton motive force, consisting at higher pH chiefly in a delta psi amount, which promotes a secondary active H+ or Na+/amino acid symport carrier...|$|E

40|$|Since 1996, {{a growing}} {{coalition}} of stakeholders {{from the private}} sector, government and donor communities has promoted a new package of agronomic practices for smallholders in Zambia. The conservation farming (CF) system they advocate involves: dry-season land preparation using minimum tillage methods (either ox-drawn rip lines or hand-hoe basins {{laid out in a}} precise grid of 15, 850 basins per hectare); no burning but rather retention of crop residue from the prior harvest; planting and input application in fixed planting stations; and nitrogen-fixing crop rotations.

By breaking pre-existing plow-pan barriers, the CF basins and rip lines improve water infiltration, water retention and plant root development. The precise layout of grids and planting lines enables farmers to locate fertilizer and organic material in close proximity to the plants, where they will provide greatest benefits. Evidence from similar technologies in other parts of Africa suggests that the effectiveness of conservation farming will vary not only across regions but also across crops and over time, due to variations in weather and rainfall.

Surface radiation of whole dry soybeans using electron beam or gamma rays from 1 - 30 kGy did provide microbial safety for the astronauts. However, the lower dose levels had surviving yeasts and molds. These doses caused oxidative changes that resulted in soymilk and tofu with rancid aromas.

The results indicate that the BF and the DER are the two most important factors in determining the performance of the RO membranes...|$|R

A {{water quality}} model was {{developed}} to simulate the fate and transport of nutrients within the Ala Wai Canal and to evaluate the impacts of storm runoff on the canal's biological activity. The hydraulic component of the model was developed by considering the canal {{as a series of}} four completely stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), with flushing time as the key hydraulic parameter. Flushing time represents the average time that a particle of freshwater will remain in the estuary. The flushing times were estimated based on salinity data collected by this study and other previous studies. Modeling results indicated that the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) of total nitrogen, which has been set by the state as 25 kg/day, was exceeded by both the wet and dry season averages. This 25 kg/day limit was based on state water quality standards for the canal that state the nitrogen concentration within the canal should not exceed 200 μg/l. Using parameters that have been updated since the TMDL study such as the background concentration of <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>flushing</b> time, and volume of the canal, it was also determined that the water quality standard for total nitrogen of 200 μg/L was exceeded within certain areas of the canal. Field data of chlorophyll a concentrations were collected over a two month period to provide a base for model testing and calibration. Modeling analysis suggests that the canal is highly productive and that this production increases after increased loading of nutrients following a rainstorm. A final application of this model was discussed that showed its potential to determine the fate of contaminants from possible biological spills within the canal. Field data of diurnal dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a concentrations were collected to determine if the model's conclusions on the health of the canal were correct. Field data suggested that the canal is highly productive and can be classified as eutrophic. This bioproductivity was shown to greatly increase after storm events...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous-biphasic {{organometallic}} catalysis is, {{as illustrated}} by the industrial hydroformylation of propene and butene, {{one of the most promising}} ways to overcome the intrinsic problem of catalyst separation in organometallic catalysis. However, for poorly water-soluble substrates, mass transfer limitations bring the reaction rate below any that could be economically viable, greatly limiting the scope of this elegant technology. We have studied three different strategies to overcome this limitation. We developed additives that speed up the reaction whilst retaining fast phase separation and good metal retention. Evidence suggests that those additives affect the reaction by forming emulsions with poor stability under the reaction conditions These emulsions increase the interfacial surface area but break after settling for a short time. We also developed ligands that allow the catalyst to be reversibly transported between an aqueous and an organic phase upon addition and removal of carbon dioxide. This allows the reaction to be carried out under homogeneous conditions, only limited by intrinsic kinetics, and the catalyst to be separated by aqueous extraction triggered by carbon dioxide. The catalyst can be returned to a fresh organic phase by flushing out the carbon dioxide. By applying this methodology for the hydroformylation of medium chain length alkenes, very high reaction rates were obtained and the catalyst could be recycle three times with excellent retention of activity and low metal leaching. This methodology could also be reversed with the reaction being carried out in an aqueous phase in the presence of carbon dioxide and extracting the catalyst into an organic solvent using <b>nitrogen</b> <b>flushing.</b> Finally, we briefly investigated the use of an oscillatory baffled reactor as a mean for mass transfer improvement for aqueous-biphasic hydroformylation. This new type reactor did not improve the performance of the system under the investigated conditions, but may require less energy input for equivalent agitation and mixing.

40|$|The {{difference}} in Calendula oil quality from fractions obtained after seed classification is enormous. The oil quality varies from excellent to very poor, according to important aspects {{such as in}} the hulls and dust fraction, high free fatty acid values (13 % vs. 0. 6 %) are found. This {{can be explained by the}} presence of active lipase enzymes in this fraction, possibly from fungal or microbial sources. In general, Calendula oil deterioration will occur after long periods of post-harvest storage due to seed damage and unfavourable quality conditions regarding moisture, temperature and enzymatic activity. The dark oil colour is probably caused by chemical/enzymatic oxidation and hydrolyzation and is very persistent during the chemical refining steps as degumming, refining, bleaching and deodorising. Processing the oil directly after harvesting, combined with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>flushing</b> and cold storage will probably prevent the formation of a dark colour. Lab-scale refining has shown that an excellent oil quality can be produced using a good initial oil quality. The use of high temperatures (200 °C or higher) for oil deodorisation will cause modification and polymerisation and the formation of calendic acid isomers. Calendula oil is rich in gamma (1800 - 1900 ppm) and alpha (270 ppm) tocopherol and its content is not affected by processing or refining and is relatively high compared to other tocopherol-rich sources such as soybean or maize oil. Recovery of these tocopherols can be of interest, both as a by-product (vitamin E) and to obtain reactive oils (low in anti-oxidant). However, special care must be taken to avoid changing the reactive character of the conjugated triens present in the oil. High temperatures should similarly be avoided while developing a mild process for oil deodorisation and tocopherol removal.

40|$|AbstractUnwashed, sliced, batch-fried {{potato crisps}} {{have a unique}} texture and are growing in {{popularity}} in the UK/EU premium snack food market. In this study, the storage stability of unwashed sliced (high surface starch) potatoes (crisps) fried in regular sunflower oil (SO) or in high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) was compared over accelerated shelf life testing (45 °C, 6 weeks); with and without <b>nitrogen</b> gas <b>flushing.</b> Primary oxidation products (lipid hydroperoxides) were measured with a ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) assay and volatile secondary oxidation products (hexanal) were quantified by using solid phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS). Results revealed that crisps fried in SO were the least stable. Flushing the stored crisps with nitrogen gas proved {{to be effective in}} slowing down the oxidation rate after frying with sunflower oil, significantly stabilizing the crisps. However, crisps fried in HOSO were the most stable, with the lowest rate of development of oxidation markers, and this has previously not been shown for crisps with a high free starch content...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Low soil fertility {{is one of the major}} biophysical constraints affecting African agriculture. Phosphorus and nitrogen are the two most common limiting nutrients. Before fertility amendment recommendations are made a soil's natural nutrient availability should be assessed. In 1998, soil samples were collected at Cinzana, Mali, West Africa for the purpose of documenting the seasonal dynamics of soil nitrogen and phosphorus in two soils after nine years under five crop management systems. The cropping systems are: continuous grain (sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or millet (Pennisetum glaucum)), continuous grain with stalk residue returned to the field every second year, grain in rotation with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), grain in rotation with a sesbania (Sesbania rostrata) green manure crop, and grain in rotation with a dolichos (Dolichos lablab) green manure crop. Nitrogen availability graphs showed an inorganic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>flush</b> early in the rainy season in both soils. Extractable N concentration in a loamy sand soil peaked around 10 - 15 mg N kg?? soil or 15 - 22 kg N in the upper 10 cm of soil ha??. The inorganic N concentration declined four weeks after the onset of the rainy season. Extractable N concentration in the clay soil reached a maximum of 22 - 34 mg N kg?? soil or 33 - 51 kg N in the upper 10 cm of soil ha??. In the clay soil the high N concentrations associated with the early season flush lasted eight weeks after the onset of the rain. Further improvement of cereal grain yield may not be possible by rotation with sesbania and dolichos green manure or cowpea without additional nutrient input. Nitrogen and P return through rotation crops and crop residue is low. Phosphorous Bray- 1 measurements fluctuated by 1. 43 mg P kg?? in the clay soil in 1998. Soil P availability in the clay soil was not influenced by the crop management systems. Bray- 1 P measurements in loamy sand soil five months after Tilemsi phosphate rock application were surprisingly significantly lower than before application. Findings from this study can be used to make future crop management recommendations in the Cinzana, Mali, region...|$|R
