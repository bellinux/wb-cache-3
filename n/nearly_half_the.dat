5|$|After the US {{entered the}} war and the British Army {{recovered}} from its earlier defeats, it defeated the Germans and Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in North Africa in 1942–1943 and helped drive them from Africa.

In the Far East, the British Army rallied against the Japanese in the Burma Campaign and regained the British Far Eastern colonial possessions.|$|E
5|$|At present, <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> {{hydrogen}} at {{the core}} has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|An injury {{sustained}} on 25 August 1990 kept Gibbs out for two months, {{and once}} he had regained full fitness, his team were bottom of the table. His return coincided with a winless run of seven league matches, leaving Watford seven points from safety with <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> season gone. Nonetheless, Watford managed to climb to 20th place, and despite missing 14 games, Gibbs was once again shortlisted for the club's end of season award. In 1991–92 Gibbs finally became Player of the Season. Missing only three matches, he rounded off a good season by scoring his first goal in four years in Watford's last league game, cementing a top-ten finish in the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|Conceived as {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of a large church surmounted by a hotel, construction of the building brought architectural dispute. Initially designed by Timothy L. Pflueger in the Gothic Revival style, the investors fired his firm and hired Lewis P. Hobart, who changed little of Pflueger's design. In a resulting lawsuit, Pflueger won <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> damages he asked for. The building opened in 1930 as the William Taylor Hotel and Temple Methodist Episcopal Church. However, extra construction expenses had put the congregation at greater financial risk, and the church-hotel concept did not prove popular. No profit was made in six years, and the church left, losing their investment. In the late 1930s the building housed the Empire Hotel, known for its Sky Room lounge, then from World War II to the 1970s, 100 McAllister served as U.S. government offices.|$|E

5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{surfaced}} about difficulties {{regarding the}} special effects. By {{a year into}} the production, millions of dollars had been spent, yet almost no usable footage had been created; Abel and Associates was not experienced in motion picture production and the steep learning curve worried the producers. Due to contract obligations, Trumbull served {{as a consultant to}} Abel and Associates, while effects artist Richard Yuricich acted as a liaison between Abel and Paramount. To speed up the work, Abel passed off miniature and matte painting tasks to Yuricich. Despite being relieved of <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> effects work, it became clear by early 1979 that Abel and Associates {{would not be able to}} complete the remainder on time. Creative differences grew between Abel and Associates and the Paramount production team, and by mid-February 1979 the two companies parted ways.|$|E

5|$|The country {{owes its}} varied topography, {{and perhaps even}} its {{emergence}} above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent. About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of Gibraltar's fortifications, {{and of its}} architectural heritage in general, has been a problematic issue. The peninsula is extremely short of land; in the early 1980s, <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> available land was in military usage, comprising the naval dockyard, {{the whole of the}} southern part of Gibraltar, {{the upper part of the}} Rock and a significant amount of property within the city walls, in addition to the runway and military facilities on the isthmus. Until recently, Gibraltar had no public sea front of its own due to military land usage. As the military presence has been run down, MOD property has been handed over to the Government of Gibraltar but the latter has lacked the resources to look after all of the buildings and land that have been transferred. This has led to the abandonment and severe physical deterioration of significant parts of Gibraltar's military heritage.|$|E
