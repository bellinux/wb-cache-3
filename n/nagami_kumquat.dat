50|$|The 'Centennial Variegated' kumquat {{cultivar}} arose spontaneously {{from the}} <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat.</b> It produces a greater portion of fruit versus the thinner peel than the <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat,</b> and the fruit are also rounder and sometimes necked. Fruit are distinguishable by their variegation in color {{of green and}} yellow stripes. The tree is thornless.|$|E
50|$|The Garden of the Hesperides {{contains}} citrus trees, including: lemon, bergamot orange, bitter orange, grapefruit, variegated calamondin, mandarin orange, <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat,</b> {{oval kumquat}} (Fortunella margarita), and Buddha's hand citron (Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis).|$|E
50|$|When the kumquats {{are divided}} into {{multiple}} species, the name Fortunella margarita (or Citrus margarita) is used for this group. The oval kumquat is also called the <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat.</b> The unusual feature of the <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat</b> is in the eating of the fruit. The fruit is eaten whole, skin and all. The inside is still quite sour, but the skin has the sweeter flavour, when eaten together it produces an unusual tart-sweet, refreshing flavour. Fruit ripens mid to late winter and always crops very heavily, making a spectacular display against the dark green foliage. The tree is smaller growing and dwarf in nature, making it ideal for pots and has even been used in bonsai.|$|E
40|$|A pest species (Scirtothrips aurantii (Faure´)), the South African citrus thrips, {{established}} adventitiously in Australia on a weed of biocontrol interest. Investigations {{centered on}} this ‘‘natural experiment’’, reveal that potentially effective biocontrol {{agents in the}} form of host specialist species are currently being overlooked. South African citrus thrips is considered highly polyphagous in Africa, on plants ranging from citrus (Rutaceae) to mango (Anacardiaceae), but in Australia the thrips included in this taxon are restricted to the genus Bryophyllum (Crassulaceae). Choice tests conducted in flight cages on the Australian population of S. aurantii demonstrate they do not infest orange plants (Citrus sinensis) or <b>kumquat</b> <b>nagami</b> (Fortunella margarita), settle occasionally on mango (Magnifera indica), but readily settle on Bryophyllum delagoense (Eckl. & Zeyh) and establish colonies. When confined to each of these hosts, reproduction is successful only on B. delagoense. Although nymphs are occasionally produced on young red mango leaves, mortality of the nymphs and the few resulting adults is complete and no further eggs are oviposited. Results demonstrate the thrips in Australia are likely to remain exclusively on plants of the genus Bryophyllum, although they may occur occasionally and sporadically on flushing leaves of mango. Sampling demonstrated S. aurantii causes significant damage to B. delagoense, both reproductively and structurally. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of understanding the species status of the Australian population of S. aurantii, the potential biocontrol applications of this insect, and the conceptual background to the selection of potential biological control agents for prerelease screening...|$|R
40|$|Citrus leaf blotch virus (CLBV), {{the type}} {{species of the}} {{putative}} new genus Citrivirus, causes a bud union disorder of <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat</b> and Calamondin scions grafted on trifoliate rootstocks. This virus was successfully transmitted to Nicotiana cavicola using leaf extracts of infected <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat</b> and Etrog citron, thus widening its herbaceous host range. The infection was latent but confirmed by the positive response of RTPCR using virus-specific primers and by electron microscopy. The positive transmission of CLBV to N. cavicola should in principle facilitate laboratory investigations, as it provides {{a new source of}} virus alternative to and more manageable than citrus...|$|E
40|$|Embora o Brasil seja o maior produtor mundial de citros, a produção de mudas cítricas para fins ornamentais é pequena, e a pesquisa nessa área ainda é escassa. Os citros são atrativos para o paisagismo principalmente por seus frutos, que são de tamanhos, formatos e cores variados e que, em sua maioria, podem ser ingeridos in natura. O objetivo deste trabalho foi caracterizar, para fins paisagísticos, seis variedades cítricas com potencial ornamental: cidra Mão-de-Buda, kunquat Nagami, laranja Cipó, laranja Imperial, limão Faustrine e tangerina Venezuela, cultivadas no Banco Ativo de Germoplasma do Centro APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira, do Instituto Agronômico, em Cordeirópolis-SP. Para cada variedade, foram coletados 30 folhas adultas, 30 flores totalmente abertas e 30 frutos maduros para análise de seus caracteres morfológicos. As características das árvores também foram avaliadas. O delineamento utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado, e a média das 30 medidas de cada variável representou a variedade. Foram observadas diferenças morfológicas acentuadas entre as seis variedades e todas apresentaram potencial ornamental. Brazil is the {{greatest}} citrus producer in the world, but the cultivation of citrus plants for ornamental purposes is insignificant and the research on this subject is still rare. Citrus plants are impressive for landscaping especially because of their fruits, which have different sizes, shapes and colors, and that, in general, are in natura edible. The objective of this work was to characterize, for landscaping use, six varieties of citrus with ornamental potential: Buddha's Hand citron, <b>Nagami</b> <b>kumquat,</b> Cipó orange, Imperial orange, Faustrine lemon and Venezuela mandarin, cultivated at the germplasm collection of the Centro APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira, of the Instituto Agronômico, located in Cordeirópolis, São Paulo State, Brazil. For each variety, 30 leaves, 30 flowers and 30 fruits, all mature, were collected for analysis of their morphological characteristics. The characteristics of the trees were also evaluated. The experimental design was randomized, and each variety was described by the mean value of the 30 measurements of each variable. There were prominent morphological differences amongst the six varieties, {{and all of them}} showed landscaping value...|$|E
