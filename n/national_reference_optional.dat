40|$|The {{implementation}} of a mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD - plus) {{will be affected by}} governance conditions within host countries. The top eight countries, which are responsible for 70 percent of the world's total annual deforestation, have implemented certain forms of decentralization in public administration and forest management. This paper analyzes implications of decentralized forest management for the {{implementation of}} REDD. Three possible options for the involvement of local governments in the implementation of REDD are: 1) the central government decides on a <b>national</b> <b>reference</b> level and devolves the implementation to local governments; 2) the central government decides on a <b>national</b> <b>reference</b> level and seeks expressions of interest from local governments to implement REDD in their administrative areas; and 3) the central and local governments decide on a <b>national</b> <b>reference</b> level jointly and local governments implement REDD activities locally. This paper also highlights fiscal instruments for REDD revenue distribution...|$|R

40|$|The quality, {{accuracy}} and reliability of the tests performed by <b>National</b> <b>Reference</b> Laboratories are essential aspects that help to guarantee the certification {{carried out by the}} Veterinary Services, as well as to support sanitary programmes, prevention and restraint of emerging diseases and the certification of the sanitary status of a country, zone or compartment and international trade. It is obvious that although a region may have important human resources and infrastructure, not all countries of the region may have the same level of resources. Regardless of the need to reinforce those aspects related to infrastructure and equipment, there is a constant need for training human resources. The conclusions and recommendations of the First Global Conference on OIE Reference Laboratories and Collaborating Centres, held in Florianopolis in 2006, have shown that this OIE Reference Laboratory Network should assist and support the <b>National</b> <b>Reference</b> Laboratories of the Veterinary Services. The OIE Regional Representation for the Americas, together with certain international organisations that have an agreement with the OIE, is leading a project aimed at creating the <b>NATIONAL</b> <b>REFERENCE</b> LABORATORIES NETWORK OF THE VETERINARY SERVICES OF THE AMERICAS, with the purpose of: 1) Identifying the capacities and needs of the <b>National</b> <b>Reference</b> Laboratories of the Veterinary Services of the Americas (NRLVS) for terrestrial and aquatic animals, regarding animal health, zoonoses and food safety. 2) Suggesting mechanisms that facilitate training, both technical and scientific cooperation, availability of reagents, reference materials, expertise, etc. 3) Strengthening the relationships and the collaborative work with the OIE Reference Laboratory Network and the Collaborating Centres, including carrying out inter-laboratory tests. 4) Encouraging the development of specific twining projects with OIE Reference Laboratories. 5) Detecting areas within the region where diagnostic capacity is low and access to reference materials limited. 6) Developing an information management mechanism in the <b>National</b> <b>Reference</b> Laboratorie...|$|R
