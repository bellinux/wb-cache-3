5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the <b>non-availability</b> of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found {{to be very difficult to}} start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Tulu {{is spoken}} {{mainly in the}} coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada. Tulu Mahabharato, written by Arunabja in the Tigalari script, is the oldest {{surviving}} Tulu text. Tigalari script was used by Brahmins to write Sanskrit language. The use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and <b>non-availability</b> of print in Tigalari script contributed to the marginalisation of Tigalari script. Konkani is mostly spoken in the Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada districts and in parts of Udupi, Konkani use the Devanagari script for writing. The Kodavas who mainly reside in the Kodagu district, speak Kodava Takk. Two regional variations of the language exist, the northern Mendale Takka and the southern Kiggaati Takka. Kodava Takk use the Kannada script for writing. English is the medium of education in many schools and widely used for business communication in most private companies.|$|E

25|$|The first {{prototype}} flew on 7 March 1957, revealing poor {{directional stability}} {{which led to}} a taller vertical fin, and later to hexagonal auxiliary fins at the tips of the tailplane. Entering production at Zavod (factory) No.64, Voronezh in 1957, the initial three aircraft were delivered with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, due to <b>non-availability</b> of the Ivchenko AI-20 engines. From 1958, production aircraft were delivered with the Ivchenko AI-20A engines which boasted a longer service life and comparable performance compared to the Kuznetsov engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} this central {{structure}} at {{the midst of the}} courtyard remains unsolved since its discovery. Hence, most of the debates generated hitherto on the architecture of Sompur Mahavihara are cantered on the identification its missing superstructure. The reason may be manifold, but the most important one is the <b>non-availability</b> of substantial amount of first-hand resource including a comprehensive architectural documentation at the disposal of the researchers. There are different arguments regarding the terminating top of the central structure of Sompur Mahavihara.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this was}} a {{ground-breaking}} solution employing over 20,000 ligatures (individually designed character combinations) which provided the most beautiful results and allowed newspapers such as Pakistan's Daily Jang to use digital typesetting instead of an army of calligraphers, it suffered from two problems in the 1990s: (a) its <b>non-availability</b> on standard platforms such as Windows or Mac OS, and (b) the non-WYSIWYG nature of text entry, whereby the document had to be created by commands in Monotype's proprietary page description language.|$|E

It was decided to hire a consultant to sketch a master plan for the project including facilities to be incorporated, timeframe for completion and estimated cost. Global tenders inviting the consultants were issued on 26 September and the authorities would open them on 30 October to select the successful bidder who would be given a time frame of ten months to sketch the master plan, but the date was later extended to 24 December which in turn had an indefinite extension due to <b>non-availability</b> of bidders.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} of Assam which can be attributed to overpopulation, and a faulty education system. Every year, large numbers of students obtain higher academic degrees but because of <b>non-availability</b> of proportional vacancies, most of these students remain unemployed. A number of employers hire over-qualified or efficient, but under-certified, candidates, or candidates with narrowly-defined qualifications. The problem is exacerbated by the growth in the number of technical institutes in Assam which increases the unemployed community of the State. Many job-seekers are ineligible for jobs in sectors like Railways, and Oil India by the appointment of candidates from outside Assam to those posts.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of phase-contrast imaging from visible light to X-rays {{took a long}} time due to the slow progress in improving the quality of X-ray beams and the <b>non-availability</b> of X-ray optics (lenses). In the 1970s it was realized that the synchrotron radiation emitted from charged particles circulating in storage rings constructed for high-energy nuclear physics experiments was potentially a much more intense and versatile source of X-rays than X-ray tubes. The construction of synchrotrons and storage rings, explicitly aimed at the production of X-rays, and the progress in the development of optical elements for X-rays were fundamental for the further advancement of X-ray physics.|$|E

25|$|On 30 November, six top Indian players {{pulled out}} of the league in favor of the {{national}} camp for the Olympic qualifiers from 11 December. In a letter, addressed to Hockey India secretary Narinder Batra and signed by skipper Bharat Chettri, Tushar Khandekar, Yuvraj Walmiki, Sreejesh, Sandeep Singh and Sardar Singh, the players said they would be available for selection to the national team for the qualifiers, which would be held in the Capital in February. The organisers of the WSH, however, said that they were yet to get communication from any WSH player regarding their <b>non-availability</b> for the inaugural edition of the event.|$|E
25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the <b>non-availability</b> of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward {{all aspects of the}} disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, the French Air Ministry {{issued a}} {{specification}} for a four-seat Multiplace de Combat, a multi-seat combat aircraft {{to act as}} a light bomber, reconnaissance aircraft and long-range escort fighter. Amiot received an order for two prototype Amiot 140s, to be evaluated against the competing Bleriot 137, Breguet 410 and SPCA 30. The Amiot 140 was a high-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, with corrugated wing skinning and a fixed tail wheel undercarriage. The pilot sat in an open cockpit, with cockpits for gunners in the nose and dorsal positions. A glazed gondola under the forward fuselage carried a bombardier/gunner, ensuring that the gunners had a clear field of fire all around the aircraft. The Amiot was intended to be powered by two 515kW (690hp) Lorraine 18G Orion water-cooled W engines but these were unavailable and the first prototype was fitted with Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr engines to allow flight testing, making its maiden flight on 12 April 1931. The second prototype was completed in February 1932 but the continued <b>non-availability</b> of its intended engines, either the original Lorraine-Dietrichs or turbocharged Hispano-Suizas, meant that it never flew. Despite this, on 23 November 1933 an order was placed for 40 Amiot 140s, to be powered by 662kW (880hp) Lorraine 12Q Eider engines.|$|E

The court also issued numerous opinions, including that the accident was caused by [...] "a series and combination of individual negligence(s) onboard Greeneville," [...] "artificial urgency" [...] by Waddle to rush the submarine through its demonstration schedule as it began to run late, failure to follow standard procedures, the abbreviated periscope search, distractions and obstruction caused by the presence of the civilian guests, crew training deficiencies, overconfidence and complacency, and Waddle's not paying enough attention to ship contact information. [...] The court found that, although Brandhuber was the senior officer present on Greeneville, Waddle as captain was solely responsible for the safe navigation of the submarine. [...] The inquiry report went into great detail on the purpose and rules surrounding the USN's DVE program.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{before its}} release, Sacred Evil– A True Story faced a {{petition}} which challenged the Censor Board's decision to grant an exhibition certificate to the film. The petition, filed by lawyer Gerry Coelho, contended that granting the certificate to the film, was unethical and indecent {{on the part}} of the Censor Board of India and constituted total non-application of mind. The objections raised by Coelho were based on the film's posters and promotional advertisements. The Censor Board said that they had not been insensitive to Christian sentiments. [...] "We are very careful when we screen sensitive movies [...] But, there is nothing in the movie that is objectionable, or will hurt the sentiments of the community in question." [...] The film was given green signal by the censor board, but was still postponed because of <b>non-availability</b> of theatres. It was finally released on 23 June 2006, and was a commercial disappointment but received mixed reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama commented: [...] "Sacred Evil is a pleasant change and a break from the monotony of the regular Hindi films. However, the subject is one that caters to a niche audience only. However, the fact cannot be denied that the narrative does not go off-track nor does it seem as if some sequences have been incorporated for the sake of it. Despite its slow pacing, Sacred Evil has the knack to hold the interest of its viewer. It's definitely a fine effort by directors Abiyaan Rajhans and Abhigyan Jha. The performances are above average, with Sarika dominating the show." [...] Deepali Singh from The Kolkata Telegraph gave the film three out of ten, stating [...] "If one hopes to discover the secrets of Wiccan ways in Sacred Evil, directed by Abiyaan Rajhans and Abhigyan Jha, one is in for a major disappointment. Beyond a candlelit session, which doesn't really lead anywhere except to a few flickers of vague shadows in the background, the story just about treads into the Wiccan world. [...] Sarika, as Ipsita, ghost walks through another expressionless comeback." ...|$|E
2500|$|Caledonian re-applied to the ATLB for a licence {{to launch}} transatlantic {{scheduled}} services from Gatwick, Heathrow or Stansted via Prestwick to New York JFK, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto, and from Birmingham via Prestwick to New York, in 1967. These services {{were to be}} gradually introduced between 1969/70 and 1970/71 utilising the new 707s. BUA, British Eagle and Transglobe Airways simultaneously applied for similar licences. Caledonian objected to the other independent airlines' applications. BOAC opposed all the independents' applications. The Board of Trade (BOT) directed the ATLB to prejudge the four contenders' applications in order to concentrate only on those that stood a reasonable chance of success under existing bilateral arrangements before the route licensing hearings could begin. As a result, BUA withdrew its own applications but objected to Caledonian's and British Eagle's. Transglobe withdrew its applications as well. Caledonian and British Eagle objected to each other's applications. The ATLB heard Caledonian's applications, British Eagle's counter applications [...] and BOAC's objections in early 1968. Following {{the conclusion of the}} transatlantic scheduled licensing hearings in mid-1968, the ATLB rejected Caledonian's and British Eagle's applications. It felt that the independents generally lacked the financial strength to acquire the then latest widebodied and supersonic transport (SST) aircraft for their proposed services, and that these airlines had insufficient economies of scale to enable them to compete with BOAC and the American carriers on a level playing field. It also felt that it would take the independents too long to make these services profitable. In Caledonian's case, the ATLB found that despite having a dedicated North American sales force and its own ground handling operation at John F. Kennedy Airport, the airline's lack of any kind of scheduled service experience and its almost total reliance on Sabena's and Aviation Traders' engineering support counted against granting it a scheduled service licence {{for one of the most}} competitive air markets in the world. Secondary factors for the ATLB's rejection of Caledonian's applications included the delay in the introduction of Concorde and the <b>non-availability</b> within the envisaged timeframe of widebodied aircraft that were smaller and carried a lower price tag than the Boeing 747, which would have made them better suited to the type of operation proposed.|$|E
