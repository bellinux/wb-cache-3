40|$|The Hengduan Mountains, {{with their}} strong altitudinal {{vegetation}} zonation, form a biodiversity hotspot which {{offers the potential}} for comparison between sites {{in order to understand}} how this zonation arose and how it has responded to climate change and human impacts through time. This paper presents a 22 570 -year pollen record of vegetational and climatic change based on a core 320 cm in depth collected from Wenhai Lake on Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, one of the highest peaks in the Hengduan Mountains region of Yunnan, Southwest China. From 22 570 to 21 140 cal yr BP, the vegetation was dominated by broad-leaved forest (comprising mainly Quercus, Betula and Castanopsis), accompanied by <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> (mainly Pinus and Abies), indicating a rather cold and dry climate relative to the present followed by cold and wet conditions. In the period between 21 140 and 19 350 cal yr BP, the vegetation was still dominated by broad-leaved forest and <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> as before but with a notable increase in Betula pollen and a sharp decrease in Quercus pollen, implying a relatively cold and dry climate with several fluctuations in humidity. The period 19 350 to 17 930 cal yr BP was a transition stage from broad-leaved forest to <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest,</b> with a dramatic decrease in Quercus pollen and a maximum reading for Abies pollen, reflecting the coldest and driest climate since 22 570 cal yr BP. The expansion in <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> dominated by Pinus and Abies (22 570 – 17 930 cal yr BP) along with an increase of Betula might correspond to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; the start of the LGM perhaps occurred prior to the basal age of the core). Between 17 930 and 9250 cal yr BP, <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> declined and broad-leaved forest began to increase at first, suggesting increases in temperature and humidity, while {{towards the end of the}} period, <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> expanded and broad-leaved forest shrank, indicating a colder and drier climate, possibly corresponding to the Younger Dryas. From 9250 cal yr BP to the present, the vegetation has been dominated by <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> (comprising mainly Pinus, Abies and Tsuga), interspersed with broad-leaved Quercus and Betula, reflecting a significant decline in humidity from the early to late Holocene. During this period, human activity likely increased in this region, with impacts on the vegetation such as a distinct decrease in Pinus and Quercus pollen and an increase in Polygonaceae pollen in the upper 30 cm of the core. The marked decline in Quercus pollen compared with the early stage of this period, in particular, in the Wenhai core can be correlated with that observed in the Haligu core (situated about 2 km away) between 2400 cal yr BP and the present...|$|E
40|$|Aims Leaf area index (LAI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used parameters for analysis of canopy structure and forest productivity. It can be determined by direct or indirect methods. Sources of errors in indirect LAI measurements with optical instruments include non-photosynthetic components, element clumping, and a topography effect. Our objective was to find an appropriate method for evaluating LAI and its seasonal dynamics in typical temperate montane forest. Methods We examined the applicability of three indirect methods (LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer, CI- 110 plant canopy analyzer and digital hemispherical photograph (DHP)) and one direct method (litterfall) to determine the seasonal dynamics of LAI in three typical temperate forests in Dongling Mountain of Beijing. The forests included a secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest dominated by Quercus mongolica and two plantations (Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii and Pinus tabuliformis). These represent deciduous broad-leaved forest, deciduous <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> and evergreen <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest,</b> respectively. The optically-based effective leaf area index (LAIe) values were corrected to eliminate wood elements and clumping effects and then compared with the direct measurement of LAI based on litter collection. Important findings For all the three forests, the LAI seasonal dynamic shows a uni-modal pattern with a peak in July. Optically-based LAIe underestimated the amplitude of the seasonal dynamics. Wood element elimination can strengthen the seasonal sensitivity of LAI, especially in the seasonally distinct deciduous forest. The order of LAIe measured by the three optically-based methods in three stands is LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer > DHP > CI- 110 plant canopy analyzer. There was good correspondence with the direct measurement LAI for the corrected LAI of LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer and DHP. The correction method based on gap-size distribution was appropriate for the LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer and the method based on both gap fraction and gap-size distribution for DHP. Considering economics and practical convenience, we recommend DHP for LAI evaluation in these temperate montane forests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Drought is {{expected}} to increase in frequency and severity due to global warming, and its impacts on vegetation are typically extensively evaluated with climatic drought indices, such as multi-scalar Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). We analyzed the covariation between the SPEIs of various time scales and the anomalies of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), from which the vegetation type-related optimal time scales were retrieved. The results indicated that the optimal time scales of <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest,</b> broadleaf forest and shrubland were between 10 and 12 months, which were considerably longer than the grassland, meadow and cultivated vegetation ones (2 to 4 months). When the optimal vegetation type-related time scales were used, the SPEI could better reflect the vegetation’s responses to water conditions, with the correlation coefficients between SPEIs and NDVI anomalies increased by 5. 88 % to 28. 4 %.

40|$|We {{estimated}} aboveground biomass carbon (T-ABC) and net carbon accumulation rates (T-NEP) for {{trees in}} four major forest types based on national forest inventory data collected in 1994 - 1998 and 1999 - 2003. The four types were Pinus massoniana forest, Cunninghamia lanceolata forest, hard broad-leaved evergreen forest and soft broad-leaved evergreen forest. We analyzed variations in T-ABC and T-NEP for five stand ages (initiation, young, medium, mature and old). In both time periods, estimated T-ABC {{in all four}} forest types increased consistently with forest stand age and the oldest stage had the largest T-ABC compared with other stages. Broad-leaved forests (hard and soft) had higher T-ABC than <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> (Pinus massoniana and Cunninghamia lanceolata) {{for each of the}} five age stages. The difference of T-ABC between broad-leaved and <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> increased with forest stand age. Comparison of estimated T-NEP by age category indicated T-NEP increased from the initiation stage to the young stage, and then decreased from the mature stage to old stage in all four forest types. T-NEP for any particular stage depended on the forest type; for instance, broad-leaved forests at both the mature and old stages had greater T-NEP than in <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests.</b> A logistic curve was applied to fit the relationship between T-ABC and forest stand age. In each period, correlations in all four forest types were all statistically significant (P 0. 95. T-ABC was therefore predicted by these regression functions from 2000 to 2050 and the mean TNEP during the predicted period was estimated to be about 41. 14, 31. 53, 75. 50 and 75. 68 g C m(- 2) a(- 1) in Pinus massoniana forest, Cunninghamia lanceolata forest, hard broad-leaved forest and soft broad-leaved forest, respectively. Results from both forest inventory and regression prediction suggest broad-leaved forests are greater carbon sinks, and hence have greater carbon sequestration ability especially in the mature and old stages when compared to <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests.</b> Broad-leaved forests should have high levels of carbon sequestration when compared with <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> in south China...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT] Forest {{classes for}} global land cover data is {{important}} for global environmental studies. However, {{it is difficult to}} correctly classify <b>needle-leaves</b> <b>forest</b> and broad-leaves forest using phenology information extracted from observation data as a nadir view. In this study, we attempted to differntiate <b>needle-leaves</b> and broad-leaves <b>forests</b> using MOD 09 GA and MYD 09 GA. To produce pseudo multidirectional satellite data, we selected several days of data with scannig widths overtapping along the crosstrack direction. We used the pseudo multidirectional data sets to study reflectance on four bands, as well as the variation with solar zenith and relative azimuth for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and GVI (the green chlorophyll index). Data selection followed criteria aimed to reduce as much as possible the influence of viewing direction and terrain conditions. We found that NDVI and GVI change depending on the solar zenith and relative azimuth. Using data in limited ranges of solar zenith and relative azimuth, {{it was not possible to}} clearly show differences between the characteristics of <b>needle-leaves</b> <b>forest</b> and broad-leaves forest from pseudo multidirectional observation data. However, we found differences for both NDVI and GVI between nadir and stant data depending in the surface state of the forest...|$|R
40|$|Half-hourly {{measurements}} of the net exchanges {{of carbon dioxide and}} water vapor between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere provide estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) at the ecosystem level and on daily to annual timescales. The ratio of these quantities represents ecosystem water use efficiency. Its multiplication with mean daylight vapor pressure deficit (VPD) leads to a quantity which we call "inherent water use efficiency" (IWUE*). The dependence of IWUE* on environmental conditions indicates possible adaptive adjustment of ecosystem physiology in response to a changing environment. IWUE* is analyzed for 43 sites across a range of plant functional types and climatic conditions. IWUE* increases during short-term moderate drought conditions. Mean annual IWUE* varied by a factor of 3 among all sites. This is partly explained by soil moisture at field capacity, particularly in deciduous broad-leaved forests. Canopy light interception sets the upper limits to canopy photosynthesis, and explains half the variance in annual IWUE* among herbaceous ecosystems and evergreen <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests.</b> Knowledge of IWUE* offers valuable improvement to the representation of carbon and water coupling in ecosystem process models.

Seven indices such as snow hazard, drought hazard, and landslide were selected in order to evaluate the integrated ecological risk of the ecosystems along the study area. Results show that the Qaidam montane desert zone had the greatest average risk value (4. 26), followed by the Golog-Nagqu high-cold scrub meadow zone (2. 80) and the East Qinghai and Qilian montane steppe zone (2. 73) among the ecosystems within the six natural zones within the study region.

40|$|Forested {{catchments}} {{are generally}} assumed to provide higher quality water. However, this hypothesis must be validated in various contexts as interactions between multiple {{land use and}} land cover (LULC) types, ecological variables and water quality variables render this relationship highly complex. This paper applies a straightforward multivariate approach on a typical large monitoring dataset of a highly managed and densely populated area (Wallonia, Belgium; 10 -year dataset), quantifying forest cover effects on nine physico-chemical water quality variables. Results show that forest cover explains about {{one third of the}} variability of water quality and is positively correlated with higher quality water. When controlling for spatial autocorrelation, forest cover still explains 9 % of water quality. Unlike <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> cover, broad-leaved forest cover presents an independent effect from ecological variables and explains independently 4. 8 % of water quality variability while it shares 5. 8 % with cropland cover. This study demonstrates clear independent effects of forest cover on water quality, and presents a method to tease out independent LULC effects from typical large multivariate monitoring datasets.

40|$|Four main {{vegetation}} regions can {{be recognized}} in the Japanese archipelago : a lowland region of evergreen broad-leaved forest （Camellietea japonicae region）; a lowland-to-montane region of summergreen broad-leaved forest （Fagetea crenatae region）; various regions of subalpine needle leaved forests （Vaccinio-Piceetea region）; and small regions of alpine heaths or "tundra" plus treeline krummholz. The evergreen broad-leaved forests are generally dominated by Castanopsis cuspidata (incl. var. siebodii）, Persea thunbergii, and/or various evergreen Quercus species. The understorey contains the character species Camellia japonica as well as various other evergreen smaller trees, shrubs, and herbs. This evergreen forest vegetation has been almost completely destroyed by human settlement activities. The summergreen broad-leaved forests are generally dominated by Fagus crenata and /or other holarctic deciduous trees （e. g. Ulmus, Acer） but may also contain conifers, evergreen broad-leaved understorey species, and a conspicuous ground cover of Sasa spp., a dwarf bamboo. Various wetlands are also well developed in this reion, including raised bogs and various types of fens. The vegetation of this region has recently been clear-cut over large areas and converted to conifer plantations （Larix, Cryptmeria, Chamaecyparis）. The subalpine <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> occur above the summergreen forests wherever the mountains rise high enough, generally within the belt 1600 - 2500 meters in central Honshu), The most important species are Abies mariesii and A. veitchii, Tsuga diversifolia, Picea jezoensis, and Larix kaempheri, with Vaccinium spp. as character species. Above the subalpine forests (generally above 2500 m in central Honshu), and on unstable sites below, occur Pinus pumil krummholz and various alpine meadows and heaths. All of these subalpine and alpine areas are currently threatened by expanding tourism. Potential natural vegetation represents the theoretical vegetation which would arise, under current conditions, if all disturbance were removed. The map of the potential natural vegetation of Japan suggests four main vegetation regions : a lowland region of evergreen broad-leaved forest （Camellietea japonicae）, a lowland-to montane region of summergreen broad-leaved forest（Fagetea crenatae）, Various regions of subalpine needle-leaved forests（Vaccinio-Piceetea）, and small regions of alpine heaths or "tundra". The Camellietea japonicae region covers roughly the southern half ofJapan, extending up the coasts further to the north, including the original coastline of Tokyo Bay. The suummergreen forest replaces the evergreen forest as winters become colder, both {{to the north and}} at higher elevations （about 700 - 1600 m in central Honshu）.

40|$|International audienceAim Little {{is known}} about the {{understorey}} flammability of European moun- tain forests. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relative effects of cli- mate, vegetation structure and composition on the fuel-driven variation in fire spread and intensity. Location The western Alps. Methods Fire spread and intensity were simulated under constant moisture and weather conditions for a wide range of understorey fuel parameters mea- sured in the litter, grass and shrub layers. Simulation outputs were used to compare understorey flammability between different forest ecosystem types (FET). The FETs were characterized by using a co-inertia analysis between composition and the environment (vegetation structure and climate). The rela- tionships between these factors, fuel properties and understorey flammability were then tested using partial regression analyses. Results The most flammable forests displayed an open canopy (dry-subalpine and open-mediterranean) and grew in areas with dry autumns and wet and cold springs. Fire spread and intensity were controlled by the trade-off between tree cover and dead (litter) and live (grass and shrub) biomass load. Fire inten- sity also increased as a result of seasonal precipitation patterns (differential dis- tribution between the seasons) : rainy springs enhanced biomass growth, whereas dry climates, especially in autumn, promoted shrub biomass and stim- ulated litter accumulation and residence (higher litterfall and lower decomposi- tion rates). Interestingly, we found a positive relationship between fire intensity and the proportion of conifers that disappeared after accounting for tree cover, indicating that, in the Alps, the open canopy structure of <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> makes them potentially more flammable than broad-leaved forests because of the higher load and continuity of surface fuels. Main conclusions Inter-relationships between tree cover, precipitation sea- sonality and species composition govern the understorey flammability of mountain forests. We also found evidence that tree cover strongly constrains fire spread by driving the amount and type of surface fuel, which suggests that land use change can have a strong influence on flammability patterns...|$|R

The changes in tree crown number and land cover in a very remote watershed (area 1305 ha) in Nepal were analyzed using a QuickBird image from 2006 and an IKONOS image from 2011. A geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was carried out using the region-growing technique for tree crown detection, delineation, and change assessment, and a multiresolution technique was used for land cover mapping and change analysis. The coefficient of determination for tree crown detection and delineation was 0. 97 for QuickBird and 0. 99 for IKONOS, calculated using a line-intercept transect method with 10 randomly selected windows (1 × 1 ha).

The forests were as follows: a river valley monsoon forest, semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forest, monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, mid-mountain humid evergreen broad-leaved forest, summit mossy dwarf forest, and warm <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest.</b> Owing to the variation in microenvironment, forest structure (tree density, mean height, mean diameter at breast height, mean basal area at breast height) and tree diversity indices (the number of species, Margalef richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, Simpson’s index, and Pielou’s evenness) differed significantly among forest types but did not differ among sites. We recorded a total of 5155 canopy trees belonging to 204 tree species, 104 genera, and 50 families at three sites, and the co-occurrence of tree species between adjacent communities was higher.

Understanding winter respiration processes and their responses to climate change is also central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle and climate feedbacks in the future. However, the factors influencing the spatial and temporal patterns of winter ecosystem respiration (Reco) of northern ecosystems are poorly understood. For this reason, we analyzed eddy covariance flux data from 57 ecosystem sites ranging from ~ 35 ° N to ~ 70 ° N. Deciduous forests were characterized by the highest winter Reco rates (0. 90 ± 0. 39 g C m- 2 d- 1), when winter is defined as the period during which daily air temperature remains below 0 °C. By contrast, arctic wetlands had the lowest winter Reco rates (0. 02 ± 0. 02 g C m- 2 d- 1). Mixed <b>forests,</b> evergreen <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests,</b> grasslands, croplands and boreal wetlands were characterized by intermediate winter Reco rates (g C m- 2 d- 1) of 0. 70 (± 0. 33), 0. 60 (± 0. 38), 0. 62 (± 0. 43), 0. 49 (± 0. 22) and 0. 27 (± 0. 08), respectively. Our cross site analysis showed that winter air (Tair) and soil (Tsoil) temperature played a dominating role in determining the spatial patterns of winter Reco in both forest and managed ecosystems (grasslands and croplands). Besides temperature, the seasonal amplitude of the leaf area index (LAI), inferred from satellite observation, or growing season gross primary productivity, which we use here as a proxy for the amount of recent carbon available for Reco in the subsequent winter, played a marginal role in winter CO 2 emissions from forest ecosystems. We found that winter Reco sensitivity to temperature variation across space (QS) was higher than the one over time (interannual, QT). This can be expected because QS not only accounts for climate gradients across sites but also for (positively correlated) the spatial variability of substrate quantity. Thus, if the models estimate future warming impacts on Reco based on QS rather than QT, this could overestimate the impact of temperature change...|$|R

Understanding winter respiration processes and their responses to climate change is also central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle and climate feedbacks in the future. The factors influencing the spatial and temporal pattern of winter respiration (RECO) of northern ecosystems are poorly understood. For this reason, we analyzed eddy covariance flux data sets from 57 ecosystem sites ranging from ~ 35 ° N to ~ 70 ° N. Deciduous forests carry the highest winter RECO ratios (9. 7 – 10. 5 g C m− 2 d− 1 ), when winter is defined as the period during which air temperature remained below 0 °C. By contrast, wetland ecosystems had the lowest winter RECO (2. 1 – 2. 3 g C m− 2 d− 1 ). Evergreen <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forests,</b> grasslands and croplands were characterized by intermediate winter RECO values of 7. 4 – 7. 9 g C m− 2 d− 1 , 5. 8 – 6. 0 g C m− 2 d− 1 , and 5. 2 – 5. 3 g C m− 2 d− 1 , respectively. Cross site analysis showed that winter air or soil temperature, and the seasonal amplitude of the leaf area index inferred from satellite observation, which is a proxy for the amount of litter available for RECO in the subsequent winter, are the two main factors determining spatial pattern of daily mean winter RECO. Together, these two factors can explain 71 % (Tair, ΔLAI) or 69 % (Tsoil, ΔLAI) of the spatial variance of winter RECO across the 57 sites. The spatial temperature sensitivity of daily winter RECO was determined empirically by fitting an Arrhenius relationship to the data. The activation energy parameter of this relationship was found to decrease at increasing soil temperature at a rate of 83. 1 KJ ° C- 1 (r = − 0. 32, p < 0. 05), which implies a possible dampening of the increase in winter RECO due to global warming. The interannual variability of winter RECO is better explained by soil temperature than by air temperature, likely due to the insulating effects of snow cover. The increase in winter RECO with a 1 °C warming based calculated from the spatial analysis was almost that double that calculated from the temporal analysis. Thus, models that calculate the effects of warming on RECO based only on spatial analyses could be over-estimating the impact...|$|R

Quantifying the spatiotemporal characteristic of the vegetation’s response to climate is crucial for assessing the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation. In this study, we employed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) that was calculated for various time scales (1 to 12 months) from monthly records of mean temperature and precipitation totals using 511 meteorological stations in China to study the response of vegetation types to droughts. We separated the NDVI into 12 time series (one per month) and also used the SPEI of 12 droughts time scales to make the correlation. The {{results showed that the}} differences exist in various vegetation types. For <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest,</b> broadleaf forest and shrubland, they responded to droughts at long time scales (9 to 12 months). For grassland, meadow and cultivated vegetation, they responded to droughts at short time scales (1 to 5 months). The positive correlations were mostly found in arid and sub-arid environments where soil water was a primary constraining factor for plant growth, and the negative correlations always existed in humid environments where temperature and radiation played significant roles in vegetation growth. Further spatial analysis indicated that the positive correlations were primarily found in northern China, especially in northwestern China, which is a region that always has water deficit, and the negative correlations were found in southern China, especially in southeastern China, that is a region has water surplus most of the year. The disclosed patterns of spatiotemporal responses to droughts are important for studying the impact of climate change to vegetation growth...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{project the}} {{potential}} European distribution of seven broad habitat categories (needle-leaved, broad-leaved, mixed and mediterranean forest, urban, grassland and cropland) {{in order to}} assess effects of land use, climate change and increase in CO 2 on predicted habitat changes up to the year 2050. Location: Europe. Method: We modelled the response of European vegetation to changes in land use, climate and CO 2 by combining the land-use model Dyna-CLUE (based on the CORINE land-cover data) and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Two reforestation options were explored: maintaining the current range of tree species (EFI) or promoting naturally occurring tree species (NAT). Climate data from two general circulation models and two SRES scenarios (A 2 and B 1) were used. The broad habitat types were classified according to a combination of land use and the dominant plant species. Results: Our models predicted that croplands and grasslands are expected to decrease due to land-use change. Although climate change has a negative effect on <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest,</b> it is expected to maintain its area or even increase in the EFI reforestation option while mediterranean, broad-leaved and mixed forests are expected to increase markedly. All investigated drivers have shown some effect, but land use is the dominant contributor to broad habitat change except for needle-leaved and mixed which are mainly influenced by climate change. Main conclusions: Land use is predicted to have the greatest effect on broad habitat distribution according to our simulations. Hence in most parts of Europe mitigating actions should focus on land-use change rather than climate change. According to our simulation, the effects of the different drivers are not in general additive. In some cases they act synergistically and in some cases antagonistically. The projected habitat changes are a valuable tool for species distribution modelling and are available online...|$|E
40|$|AimTo {{project the}} {{potential}} European distribution of seven broad habitat categories (needle-leaved, broad-leaved, mixed and mediterranean forest, urban, grassland and cropland) {{in order to}} assess effects of land use, climate change and increase in CO 2 on predicted habitat changes up to the year 2050. LocationEurope. MethodWe modelled the response of European vegetation to changes in land use, climate and CO 2 by combining the land-use model Dyna-CLUE (based on the CORINE land-cover data) and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Two reforestation options were explored: maintaining the current range of tree species (EFI) or promoting naturally occurring tree species (NAT). Climate data from two general circulation models and two SRES scenarios (A 2 and B 1) were used. The broad habitat types were classified according to a combination of land use and the dominant plant species. ResultsOur models predicted that croplands and grasslands are expected to decrease due to land-use change. Although climate change has a negative effect on <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest,</b> it is expected to maintain its area or even increase in the EFI reforestation option while mediterranean, broad-leaved and mixed forests are expected to increase markedly.

40|$|Abstract: Representative pioneer {{tree root}} {{systems in the}} {{subtropical}} area of South China were examined {{with regard to their}} structure, underground stratification and biomass distribution. Excavation of skeleton roots and observation of fine roots of seven species including the Euphorbiaceae, Theaceae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae and Fagaceae families was carried out. The results showed that: (1) Pioneer tree roots in the first stage of natural succession were of two types, one characterized by taproot system with bulky plagiotropic branches; the other characterized by flat root system with several tabular roots. The late mesophilous tree roots were characterized by one obvious taproot and tactic braches roots up and down. Shrub species roots were characterized by heart fibrous root type featured both by horizontally and transversally growing branches. Root shapes varied in different dominant species at different stages of succession. (2) Roots of the different species varied in the external features—color, periderm and structure of freshly cut slash. (3) In a set of successional stages the biomass of tree roots increased linearly with the age of growth. During monsoon, the total root biomass amounted to 115. 70 t/ha in the evergreen broad-leaved forest; 50. 61 t/ha in needle and broad-leaved mixed forest dominated by coniferous forest; and 64. 20 t/ha in broad-and <b>needle-leaved</b> mixed <b>forest</b> dominated by broad-leaved heliophytes, and are comparable to the underground biomass observed in similar tropical forests. This is the first report about roots characteristics of forest in the lower sub-tropical area of Dinghushan, Guangdong, China...|$|R
40|$|The carbon to {{nitrogen}} {{response of}} forest ecosystems {{depends on the}} possible occurrence of nitrogen limitation versus possible co-limitations by other drivers, such as low temperature or availability of phosphorus. A combination of nitrogen retention estimates and stoichiometric scaling is used to illustrate the most likely carbon–nitrogen responses for <b>needle-leaved</b> and broadleaved <b>forests</b> to atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Results are evaluated against field observations and nitrogen addition experiments. The likely change in carbon to nitrogen response with nitrogen deposition level is hypothesized, distinguishing three threshold values that mark the forest carbon responses. We estimated that at global scale nitrogen deposition currently increases the forest carbon sink by 276 – 448  Tg C yr? 1, with approximately 60 % retained in tree wood and 40 % in soil. Furthermore, the long-term carbon response to nitrogen, accounting for nitrogen saturation over time is hypothesized. In this context, the role of global scale coupled carbon–nitrogen models is also evaluated in view of current knowledge affecting carbon–nitrogen responses, including interactions with other drivers...|$|R
40|$|Aim  Biodiversity {{loss and}} climate-driven {{ecosystem}} modification are leading to substantial changes in forest structure and function. However, {{the effects of}} diversity on demographic responses to the environment are poorly understood. We tested the diversity hypothesis (measured through functional diversity) and the mass ratio hypothesis (measured through functional identity) in relation to tree growth, tree mortality and sapling abundance. We sought to determine whether functional diversity underlies demographic responses to environmental variation in European forests.   Location  Europe (Spain, Germany, Wallonia, Finland and Sweden).   Methods  We used data from five European national forest inventories from boreal to Mediterranean biomes (c. 700, 000 trees in 54, 000 plots and 143 tree species) and the main forest types across Europe (i. e. from <b>needle-leaved</b> evergreen <b>forests</b> to broad-leaved deciduous forests). For each forest type, we applied maximum likelihood techniques to quantify {{the relative importance of}} stand structure, climate and diversity (i. e. functional diversity and functional identity) as determinants of growth, mortality and sapling abundance. We also tested whether demographic responses to environmental conditions (including stand density, evapotranspiration and temperature anomalies) varied with functional diversity.   Results  Our results suggest that functional diversity has a positive effect on sapling abundance and growth rates in forests across Europe, while no effect was observed on tree mortality. Functional identity has a strong effect on mortality and sapling abundance, with greater mortality rates in <b>forests</b> dominated by <b>needle-leaved</b> individuals and a greater abundance of saplings in forests dominated by broad-leaved individuals. Furthermore, we observed that functional diversity modified the effects of stand density on demographic responses in Mediterranean forests and the influence of evapotranspiration and temperature anomalies in forests widely distributed across Europe.   Main conclusion  Our results suggest that functional diversity may {{play a key role in}} forest dynamics through complementarity mechanisms, as well as by modulating demographic responses to environmental variation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the work we have had {{investigated}} the utility of 6. 9 GHz dual polarization passive microwave data from the sensor AMSR-E for quantitative assessment of spatial and temporal variations of permafrost, seasonally frozen grounds and sea ice properties along the transect 70 ° E in 2005 – 2008 years. Analysis of the factors which could be detected with using study of the spatial-temporal variations of the microwave emissivity (brightness temperatures) of the system «Earth-atmosphere» was carried out with using in situ data obtained from meteorological stations situated along the investigated transect of the Western Siberia and geocryologic station Marre-Sale (Yamal Peninsula). A new method of visualization of the brightness temperatures in spatial-temporal dimensions was suggested and practical applied. Eight latitudinal zones with intrinsic peculiarities of the spatial and seasonal variability of the brightness temperatures were revealed and investigated in many details. Comparison of the location of these zones with geographic distribution of biomes in Western Siberia was provided and it shows that satellite passive microwave information can be used for classification of the territories inside biomes. In frame of this study the annual brightness temperatures course for tundra zone area has been strictly divided into four periods (seasons) characterized by different types of microwave emissivity variations. For boreal <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> zone these seasons are manifested weaker. Comprehensive analysis of the satellite microwave survey data and corresponding the in situ data has shown satisfactory correlation between the brightness temperatures of the tundra areas on the Yamal Peninsula and their thermodynamic ground-trough temperatures at the square of geocryologic station Marre-Sale during winter period of stable frozen conditions and vegetation period. In these periods one-channel satellite microwave survey could be applied for the retrieving ground temperatures with using linear regression models. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Hengduan Mountains, with a {{distinct}} altitudinal differentiation and strong vertical vegetation zonation, occupy an important position in southwestern China as a global hotspot of biodiversity. Pollen analysis of lake sediments sampled along an altitudinal gradient in this region helps us to understand how this vegetation zonation arose and how it has responded to climate change and human impacts through time. Here we present a ~ 30 -ka pollen record and interpret {{it in terms of}} vegetational and climatic change from a 310 cm-long core from Shudu Lake, located in the Hengduan Mountains region. Our results suggest that from 30 to 22 cal. ka BP, the vegetation was dominated by steppe/grassland (comprising mainly Artemisia, Poaceae and Polygonaceae) and broad-leaved forest (primarily Quercus, Betula and Castanopsis) in the lake catchment, reflecting a relatively warm, wet climate early in this phase and slightly warmer, drier conditions late in the phase. The period between 22 and 13. 9 cal. ka BP was marked by a large expansion of needle- and broad-leaved mixed forest (Pinus, Abies and Quercus) and a decline in the extent of steppe/grassland, indicating warming, drying climatic conditions followed by a cold, wet period. Between 13. 9 and 3 cal. ka BP, steppe/grassland expanded and the area covered by needle- and broad-leaved mixed forest reduced, implying a fluctuating climate dominated by warm and humid conditions. After 3 cal. ka BP, the vegetation was characterized by an increase in <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> and reduction in steppe/grassland, suggesting warming and drying climate. A synthesis of palynological investigations from this and other sites suggests that the vegetation succession patterns seen along an altitudinal gradient in northwestern Yunnan since the Late Pleistocene are comparable, but that each site has its own characteristics probably due to the influences of altitude, topography, microclimate and human impact...|$|E
40|$|I used {{results from}} camera traps set for tigers (Panthera tigris) during 2001 - 2011 in the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary of {{northern}} Myanmar to assess overall biodiversity of large mammal and bird species, {{and to identify}} differences in photo rates {{inside and outside of}} the most protected core area of the Sanctuary. A total of 403 camera stations were deployed during October-July in the dry seasons of 2001 - 2011, 260 inside the Core area and 143 Outside. From 10, 750 trap-nights I obtained 2, 077 independent photos of wildlife species and 699 of domestic animals and humans, including 35 species of wild mammals (19 carnivores, 4 primates, 1 elephant, 6 even-toed ungulates, 1 pangolin, and 4 rodents) and 16 species of wild birds. Of these, 1 is considered critically endangered, 7 are endangered, 11 are vulnerable, and 5 are nearly threatened. Some species that probably occur in the Sanctuary (e. g., arboreal or semi-aquatic mammals) were not photographed, likely because of camera placement. In total, 48 wild species were photographed in the Core area vs. only 33 at locations Outside of the core area. Generally, few photos of any domestic animal species were obtained inside 9 the Core area, and no photos insurgents were obtained there, but many more photos of poachers and villagers, but also park rangers, were obtained there. Increased patrol efforts may have helped maintain species presence in the Core area, but differences in photo rates between areas were likely mostly influenced by differences in elevation, slope, density of streams, trails, and roads, and perhaps vegetative cover type. Tiger abundance is most influenced naturally by prey availability and anthropogenically by poaching. In the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Myanmar, a major conservation area established to protect tigers, tiger presence has declined. This study was conducted to assess habitat occupancy and distribution of principal tiger prey species in the Core part of the Sanctuary by surveying for sign on 1650. 9 km partitioned into 554 sampling units during November 2007 and May 2008. Using standard occupancy model in the program PRESENCE (6. 2), habitat occupancy and detection probabilities were predicted and the best candidate model for each species was selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). By incorporating 7 environmental and 4 social covariates, the predicted habitat occupancy rates were 0. 76 (SE= 0. 196, naïve estimate = 0. 5162) for gaur (Bos gaurus), 0. 91 (SE= 0. 03, naïve estimate = 0. 7762) for sambar (Rusa unicolor), 0. 57 (SE = 0. 003, naïve estimate = 0. 3195) for wild pigs (Sus scrofa) and 0. 89 (SE = 0. 001, naïve estimate = 0. 7996) for muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak). Overall, shorter Euclidean distances to ranger stations and trails, decreased stream density, and broadleaved evergreen/semi-deciduous forest and relatively rare rain-fed cropland habitat occurrence positively influenced prey habitat occupancy; conversely, shorter Euclidean distances to villages, roads, and streams, higher elevations, and occurrence of mixed broadleaved and <b>needle-leaved</b> <b>forest</b> habitat 10 negatively influenced occupancy. In addition, Euclidean distance to ranger stations, trails, and roads positively affections species detections, whereas shorter Euclidean distance to villages and streams, high elevations, and high precipitation negatively affected detections. Results indicate that all four prey species were relatively well-distributed through the Sanctuary Core area. However, comparisons with tiger and prey indices of abundance elsewhere suggest that prey density is low and would not likely support many tigers...|$|E
40|$|Geometrically {{corrected}} and temporally registered Landsat {{digital data}} from April and February 1974 {{have been used}} to classify and map vegetative cover in the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and North Carolina. Cover classes were grouped into dominance types and subclasses according to the new U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service wetland classification system. Four data sets were analyzed on the Interactive Digital Image Manipulation System (IDIMS) : (1) April data (2) February data (3) bands 5 and 7 from April and February and (4) all 8 bands from April and February. Eighteen dominance types were established for the swamp on the basis of season, dominant canopy species and, in some deciduous classes, on type of understory. The subclasses and dominance types vary in number and composition according to season of data acquisition. Percentage estimates for the swamp subclasses were as follows: shallow water/benthos 2. 2 percent, broad-leaved evergreen forested wetland 6. 5 percent, <b>needle-leaved</b> evergreen <b>forested</b> wetland 16 percent, broadleaved deciduous forested wetland 67. 7 percent, narrow-leaved deciduous forested wetland 1 percent, broad-leaved evergreen shrub wetland 5 percent, and altered 1. 6 percent. IDIMS algorithms were used to choose 65 random, 10 x 10 pixel, sample plots and t o generate the geometric coordinates (line/column; latitude/longitude) for these samples. The plots were transferred to 1 : 65, 000 -scale color infrared photographs of the swamp and each sample plot was photointerpreted for dominance type, subclass, and acreage. The photointerpretation results are being compared with IDIMS classification for each data set to measure the accuracy of classification. In addition, we are using the same sample plots to assess the accuracy of previous classifications made with Landsat digital data from data from the same data sets and from different dates using IDIMS, Image 100, and Laboratory for Applications of Remote Sensing System (LARSYS) ...|$|R
