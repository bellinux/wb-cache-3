40|$|Limited {{research}} has been done on the microbial quality of produce that has been misted at retail food settings. Therefore, our objective was to determine the microbial quality of leaf lettuce displayed at retail in misted or <b>non-misted</b> displays. Three grocery stores that mist and three grocery stores that do not mist lettuce were selected to obtain leaf lettuce. Leaf lettuce was analyzed for aerobic plate count (APC), yeast, mold, and Enterobacteriaceae. APC ranged from 6. 23 to 6. 36 Log 10 /g for misted leaf lettuce compared to 5. 20 Log 10 /g for <b>non-misted</b> leaf lettuce. Yeast counts ranged from 4. 34 to 4. 91 Log 10 g for misted leaf lettuce compared to 4. 04 Log 10 /g for <b>non-misted</b> leaf lettuce. Mold counts ranged from 2. 88 to 4. 46 Log 10 /g for misted leaf lettuce compared to 4. 08 Log 10 /g for <b>non-misted</b> leaf lettuce. Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 6. 23 to 6. 53 Log 10 /g in misted leaf lettuce compared to 4. 08 Log 10 /g for <b>non-misted</b> leaf lettuce. From this study, we have demonstrated that there is a higher amount of microorganisms on leaf lettuce under misted conditions; determination of specific pathogenic microorganisms on the misted and <b>non-misted</b> leaf lettuce needs to be examined...|$|R
40|$|The African ebony (Diospyros crassiflora) is a well-sought {{commercial}} timber tree. As {{a result}} of intense harvesting pressure it ranks high on the IUCN' 1994 CITES list as endangered. Insufficient availability of seeds has limited the current efforts to propagate D. crassiflora from seedlings. Therefore, vegetative propagation through leafy stem cutting could be an alternative. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of four rooting media, length of cuttings and auxin (seradix- 2) application on the rooting ability of stem cuttings set up in a <b>non-mist</b> propagator. The rooting process was monitored over 14 weeks. Root development started after 9 weeks. At 14 weeks, the Seradix- 2 and rooting medium significantly improved the rooting ability. Decomposed sawdust was the best substrate. The combination of the three factors didn’t significantly influence rooting of cuttings. Stem cuttings of 5 cm length survive better in <b>non-mist</b> propagator. The results of the study suggest that D. crassiflora is amenable to vegetative propagation by leafy stem cutting...|$|R
40|$|Prunus africana (Hook. f.) Kalkm and Syzygiym guineense (Willd.) DC subsp. guineense are {{multipurpose}} indigenous {{trees to}} Ethiopia. Reforestation with these species is hindered {{due to their}} recalcitrant seeds and a higher seed predation. This study tested the effects of Indole- 3 -butyric Acid (IBA) and Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) applied at a concentration of 0. 0, 0. 2 and 0. 4 % on juvenile leafy stem cuttings of P. africana and S. guineense using <b>non-mist</b> polypropagator. Two leaves with an area of 30 - 35 cm 2 were left on each cutting. The bases of cuttings were dipped in the hormones for 3 seconds and placed into the rooting medium. All the rooted cuttings of the S. guineense and P. africana were potted in polythene bags containing a mixture of sand, forest soil and well decomposed manure. Auxin treatment had no {{significant effect on the}} final rooting percentage of both species. The effect of auxin treatment on root number, root and shoot length of the rooted cuttings of P. africana and S. guineense was significant (p< 0. 01). The establishment test on the rooted cuttings indicated that mortality accounted for only 0 - 2 %. Prospects for vegetative propagation with the juvenile leafy stem cuttings of the above species are good as cuttings were easily rooted. The low technology <b>non-mist</b> polypropagator designed for tropical trees could serve as a tool for propagation of these species for conservation and capture of genetic variation. Further study on donor plant management is required for maintenance of juvenility to harvest more cuttings for plantation purposes...|$|R
40|$|Teak (Tectona grandis) is a {{priority}} species for plantation development in Papua New Guinea (PNG), although expansion of the planted area is constrained {{by a lack of}} high quality seed sources. To address this problem, clonal methods were used for capturing selected plus trees within existing plantations (9 candidates) and an existing clonal seed orchard (20 candidates). Truncheon cuttings were collected from the lower branches of each of the 29 candidate trees. Truncheons were cool-stored for 5 days during transportation before being planted in a potting medium that was a mixture of coarse sand and forest soil (at ratio 1 : 1 by volume) and placed under intermittent mist. Adventitious root development in the truncheons occurred over a period of 5 to 6 months, and successfully rooted truncheons were planted in a hedge garden and used as a further source for cuttings. Subsequent cutting experiments using softwood single-node cuttings evaluated the effects of (i) rooting media (coarse sand vs a mixture of coarse sand and coconut husk) in the <b>non-mist</b> propagators, and in the mist system, coarse sand, fine sand, jiffypot (coco pellets) and a mixture of perlite and coconut husk, (ii) cutting length (6, 8, 10 and 12 cm), and (iii) rooting ability of clones. After 12 weeks a significantly greater rooting percentage was recorded in a mixture of coarse sand and coconut husk (78 %± 3. 95 se) compared to coarse sand alone (52. 3 %± 2. 85 se) in the <b>non-mist</b> propagators. Rooting percentage variation did not differ significantly across the rooting media in the mist propagation system. However, a greater rooting percentage was attained in jiffypots (85 %± 0. 05 se) compared to in coarse (64. 6 %± 0. 07 se) and fine sand (65. 3 %± 0. 06 se). For the cutting length experiment, s significantly greater rooting percentage (94 %± 0. 04 se) was recorded with the cutting length of 10 cm compared with 6 cm (50 %± 0. 09 se) and 8 cm (53. 1 %± 0. 09 se) cutting lengths. At week 12 after insertion of cuttings in jiffypots, no significant variations in rooting percentages were found among the clones. Low rooting percentages were recorded across all clones. Nevertheless, cutting survival of these clones was significantly higher without producing roots at week 12 after insertion in jiffypots in the mist house. Clones obtained from leafy stem cuttings were successfully acclimatized and would be used in teak clonal seed orchard (CSO) establishment to become a source of high quality germplasm for planting in PNG...|$|R
40|$|The The Guinea Savannah Highlands harbor {{numerous}} {{plant species}} of great socio-economic importance exploited by {{farmers in the}} wild. Vitex doniana Sweet is among these multifunctional tree species. Despite its importance in rural back yard, little scientific research is devoted to it. The main purpose of this work is to contribute to its domestication through root segments cuttings. The assessment {{of the effect of}} diameter of parent tree as well as the sampling distance of root segments cuttings (RSC) from them was undertaken in the nursery. The root system of 45 genotypes was partially excavated to a depth of 20 cm. RSC of 20 cm long were carefully cut and arranged vertically in a <b>non-mist</b> propagator, in black soil-sawdust substrate. The experimental design was a split-plot with three replications. The parent tree diameter was the main treatment while the sampling distance was the sub-treatment. The experimental unit was 10 cuttings.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how {{differentiating}} cells reorganize their cellular structure to perform specialized physiological functions. MIST 1, an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, {{is required for the}} formation of large, specialized secretory vesicles in gastric zymogenic (chief) cells (ZCs) as they differentiate from their mucous neck cell progenitors. Here, we show that MIST 1 binds to highly conserved CATATG E-boxes to directly activate transcription of 6 genes, including those encoding the small GTPases RAB 26 and RAB 3 D. We next show that RAB 26 and RAB 3 D expression is significantly downregulated in Mist 1 −/− ZCs, suggesting that MIST 1 establishes large secretory granules by inducing RAB transcription. To test this hypothesis, we transfected human gastric cancer cell lines stably expressing MIST 1 with red fluorescent protein (RFP) -tagged pepsinogen C, a key secretory product of ZCs. Those cells upregulate expression of RAB 26 and RAB 3 D to form large secretory granules, whereas control, <b>non-MIST</b> 1 -expressing cells do not. Moreover, granule formation in MIST 1 -expressing cells requires RAB activity because treatment with a RAB prenylation inhibitor and transfection of dominant negative RAB 26 abrogate granule formation. Together, our data establish the molecular process by which a transcription factor can directly induce fundamental cellular architecture changes by increasing transcription of specific cellular effectors that act to organize a unique subcellular compartment...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} hormone on the rooting of stem-cuttings and {{marcotting}} of akee apple was studied {{using a combination}} between Indole - 3 - Butyric Acid (IBA) and 1 - Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA). Stem-cuttings from mature akee trees from Challenge, Jalala and Ganmo in Ilorin, were treated with different dilutions of the liquid hormone in the combination of 1. 0 % Indole- 3 - butyric acid + 0. 5 % 1 -Naphthaleneacetic acid before propagating them in a <b>non-mist</b> propagator. Marcotting was also carried-out on trees, using the hormonal combination of different dilutions. Observations and the results obtained revealed that the hormonal combination had {{significant effect on the}} rooting of stem-cuttings and marcotting. Both marcotting and stem cuttings did not produce {{at the end of the}} experiment roots in the absence of the hormonal treatment; a particular aspect was marcotting that initials produced roots. On the other hand, both marcotting and stem cuttings produced roots with the hormonal treatments; more roots were produced using the combination of 2, 000 ppm of IBA and 1, 000 ppm of NAA, compared with lower concentrations of the hormone mixtures. After callus formation, 2, 000 ppm of IBA and 1, 000 ppm of NAA combination gave the best results within stem-cuttings.

40|$|In the Guinea savannah {{highlands}} of Cameroon, Vitex doniana (Verbenaceae) {{belongs to the}} category of tree species which in the wild provide important non-timber forest products to populations. The present study is designed to assess the effects of substrate and length of cuttings on the rooting ability. The root system of 15 genotypes was partially excavated {{to a depth of}} 20 cm. Root Segments Cuttings (RSC) of 10, 15 and 20 cm long were carefully cut and arranged vertically in a <b>non-mist</b> propagator, in three different substrates (sand, sawdust and black soilsawdust). The experimental design used was a split-plot with three replications. The main treatment consisted of three substrates. The sub-treatment was represented by three lengths of RSC. The experimental unit was constituted of 10 cuttings. The best rate of budding (51. 52 ± 18. 37 %) was obtained in the mixture black soil-sawdust while for the rate of rooting (55. 55 ± 16. 66 %), it was in sand. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between substrates for this parameter. Concerning the length of cuttings, the rate of budding ranged significantly from 33. 19 ± 18. 37 % in RSC of 15 cm to 66. 94 ± 15. 38 % for those of 20 cm long (0. 01 < 0. 05). For the rooting, the rate of rooting oscillated between 31. 10 ± 13. 98 % in RSC of 10 cm and 54. 44 ± 13. 89 % in those of 15 cm. The maximum number of leafy shoots (2. 66 ± 0. 69 cm) and of roots (5. 35 ± 1. 37 cm) was developed on RSC of 20 cm long and 15 cm respectively. The longest roots were registered in sawdust (6. 63 ± 1. 01 cm). This information is important in developing appropriate strategies toward domestication of the species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Sandalwood (Santalum spp.) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} forest product {{that has been}} traded for many centuries. The trade {{has been based on}} the exploitation of wild stands of the wood, but as supplies have dwindled interest in its cultivation has been increasing within agroforestry systems, both as an industrial crop and a small scale product. More recently, interest has increased in the domestication of the more commercially valuable species. Recent studies in Vanuatu into Santalum austrocaledonicum have identified individuals with high oil yield and quality that can form the basis of a breeding programme. A lack of appropriate knowledge of the reproductive biology within the genus and the capacity for clonal propagation has hindered progress towards genetic improvement. This situation has led to this study, which has the following objectives: (i) to determine the amenability of cuttings for propagation for S. austrocaledonicum; and (ii) elucidate key features of the reproductive biology of S. austrocaledonicum and other Santalum species that can inform their breeding and domestication. Method To develop an effective method for the vegetative propagation of clonal sandalwood (S. austrocaledonicum), a series of four experiments were conducted. In these experiments I evaluated the effects of cutting (genotype, type of cutting, and leaf area,) and environmental (exogenous auxin, rooting media, and light intensity) treatments on adventitious root initiation and development (mean root number and length) in leafy stem cuttings using <b>non-mist</b> propagators. The results demonstrated that S. austrocaledonicum seedlings can be successfully propagated by cuttings. Genotype: Cuttings taken from genotypes from the island of Erromango outperformed those from Tanna for all three measures of rooting across all experiments.

In terms of survival, the uninoculated cuttings gave the highest (90 %) percent survival while the lowest (60 %) was those inoculated with Pisolithus strain from New Caledonia. It is possible that the indigenous ECM fungi infected easily the roots of the uninoculated cuttings thus contributing to the high survival rate (90 %). During outplanting, fruit bodies of S. columnare were present in the field site. The results, however, show that ECM fungi were able to colonize the roots and that some strains promoted the growth and survival of S. contorta planted in a logged-over dipterocarp forest in Bislig, Surigao, Philippines. </p...|$|R
40|$|To counter {{deforestation}} {{and food}} insecurity, techniques to domesticate {{some of the}} culturally important indigenous nut tree species of Melanesia have been developed in the Solomon Islands. This process started with determining which species the local communities consider to be important. Barringtonia procera (Cutnut) and Inocarpus fagifer (Tahitian chestnut) were chosen as important model species fitting critical niches in the farming systems. The second step {{was to determine the}} factors which affect the rooting ability of cuttings of both species, to ensure that a robust and simple method was developed, appropriate for use by village communities on different islands. Both species were found to be easily propagated by juvenile, single-node, leafy, stem cuttings using a leaf area of 50 cm 2, 0. 8 % IBA as a rooting stimulant and forest/river soil as the rooting medium in a <b>non-mist</b> polythene propagator. This was supplemented by an attempt to induce physiological youth in the ontogenetically mature crowns of fruiting trees, so that early fruiting cultivars could be developed. While this was not entirely successful, the results provide pointers for future studies. The next step was to characterise the phenotypic variation for dry matter partitioning between different components of the nuts. This study found highly significant (P = 0. 001) and continuous intraspecific variation in all the measured traits within each village population. This study was then complemented by a survey of molecular marker variation, which revealed significant genetic diversity within (87 %) and between (13 %) five surveyed populations of Barringtonia procera. Trees selected for their large kernels were found to be unrelated, so providing the opportunity to develop superior cultivars without severely narrowing intraspecific genetic diversity. Based on the above research, farmers in the Solomon Islands have been trained in tree domestication techniques and encouraged to select their best trees for domestication and planting on their own land. This approach towards participatory domestication is part of an initiative to develop an indigenous nut industry, with a focus on the processing and marketing of indigenous nuts, including the extraction of Canarium kernel oil...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Spring {{frost damage}} to pears in the Pacific Northwest {{frequently}} results in substantial crop losses. This research was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effects of frost on pear buds, flowers, and fruit through controlled freezing tests and field studies {{in order to better}} understand the frost phenomenon and refine frost protection decisions. Controlled freezing studies on 'Bartlett' pear (Pyrus communis L.) showed that the percent of florets injured by frost increased with decreasing temperature, advancing developmental stage, and increasing duration at minimum temperatures of - 2, - 3, and - 4 ° C. Increases in injury occurred with exposures of 30 or 60 minutes at all stages except the small fruit stage, in which injury continued to increase for 2 hours at - 2 ° C. No significant effects of freezing rate were found at - 2, - 3, or - 4 ° C. However, there was a significant effect of freezing rate at - 5 ° C. No hardiness differences were found between comparable floral developmental stages from weak and vigorous trees. Bloom delay through evaporative cooling resulted in a loss of hardiness beyond that found earlier in the season on <b>non-misted</b> trees for similar stages of development. However, under field conditions a certain amount of frost protection was gained through bloom delay. Simulated frost injury to small fruit ovaries at intervals after full bloom significantly-increased fruit malformation, reduced fruit weight, and increased fruit drop of 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Comice' pear trees. Time of injury did not affect fruit weight and malformation in most cases, but early injury did significantly increase fruit drop. Significant positive correlations were found between fruit weight and seed content, while negative correlations were found between fruit malformation and seed content for all cultivars. Crop density was correlated significantly with sum of percent floral injury from frost, orchard design, and height in the tree for 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Anjou' pear. Regression models for crop density, regressed on sum of the percent injury, orchard design, and height in the tree differed between cultivars indicating that one model cannot be used to estimate crop density at harvest for all cultivars. Crop density was greater at low levels of frost injury in free standing than in hedgerow trees, and at greater elevations in the trees. Data suggest that 30 percent frost injury in hedgerow and 60 percent frost injury in free standing pear orchards are reasonable injury levels to accept without incurring crop losses...|$|R
