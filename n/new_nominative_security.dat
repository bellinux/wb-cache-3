40|$|Abstract. A {{nominative}} signature scheme {{allows a}} nominator (i. e. the signer) and a nominee (i. e. a designated verifier) to jointly generate and publish a signature {{so that only}} the nominee can check the validity of a nominative signature and further convince a third party to accept this fact. Recently, Huang and Wang proposed a <b>new</b> <b>nominative</b> signature scheme at ACISP 2004, and claimed that their scheme is secure under some standard computational assumptions. In this paper, we show that their scheme is not a secure nominative signature, since it fails to meet the crucial security requirement of verification untransferability. Specifically, we present an adaptively chosen-message attack against their scheme such that the nominator can determine the validity of a new message-signature pair with some indirect help from the nominee. Moreover, we {{point out that this}} attack enables the nominator to demonstrate the validity of nominative signatures to a third party. Therefore, the Huang-Wang scheme does not meet confirmation/disavowal untransferability either...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{signature}} {{scheme is}} an important research topic in cryptography. An ordinary digital signature scheme allows a signer to create signatures of documents and the generated signatures can be verified by any person. A proxy signature scheme, a variation of ordinary digital signature scheme, enables a proxy signer to sign messages {{on behalf of the}} original signer. To be used in different applications, many proxy signatures schemes were proposed. Among them, Soe and Lee nominative Proxy Signature scheme, and Jianhong Zhang, Jianhong Zou, and Yumin Wang nominative Proxy Signature scheme for mobile communication. The authors of these schemes argued that their schemes satisfies the following security requirements: user anonymity, authentication and non-repudiation. However, in this paper, we show that their schemes do not satisfy the non-repudiation among their security requirements. And then we propose a <b>new</b> <b>nominative</b> proxy signature scheme that solves the weakness of their schemes. Unlike their schemes, the proposed scheme provides a non-repudiation property and moreover it is more secure than their schemes...|$|R
40|$|Nominative {{signatures}} are {{the dual}} scheme of undeniable signatures, where only the nominee can verify the nominator (signer) ’s signature and if necessary, only the nominee can {{prove to the}} third party that the signature issued to him (her) is valid. The first construction was proposed by Kim, Park and Won [7] and it was shown in the recent work of Huang and Wang in ACISP 2004 [5] that Kim-Park-Won’s scheme does not satisfy the goal of nominative signatures. Moreover, Huang and Wang suggested a <b>new</b> <b>nominative</b> signature scheme in the same paper. They claimed that the new scheme satisfies all requirements of nominative signatures. In this paper, we show that Huang and Wang’s scheme does not satisfy one important property of nominative signatures, namely the nominator (signer) can also verify {{the validity of the}} published signature. Moreover, we will show that the nominator can always show to anyone that the signature is indeed a valid signature without any cooperation from the nominee. Hence, the scheme is not nominative, since it does not satisfy the requirements of nominative signatures. Finally, we also discuss the security assumption that needs to be satisfied to obtain secure and efficient nominative signatures...|$|R

40|$|A {{nominative}} signature scheme {{allows a}} nominator (or signer) and a nominee (or veri¯er) to jointly generate and publish a signature {{in such a}} way that only the nominee can verify the signature and if nec- essary, only the nominee can prove to a third party that the signature is valid. In a recent work, Huang and Wang proposed a <b>new</b> <b>nominative</b> signature scheme which, in addition to the above properties, only allows the nominee to convert a nominative signature to a publicly veri¯able one. In ACISP 2005, Susilo and Mu presented several algorithms and claimed that these algorithms can be used by the nominator to verify the validity of a published nominative signature, show to a third party that the signature is valid, and also convert the signature to a publicly veri¯able one, all without any help from the nominee. In this paper, we point out that Susilo and Mu 2 ̆ 7 s attacks are actually incomplete and in- accurate. In particular, we show that there exists no e±cient algorithm for a nominator to check the validity of a signature if this signature is generated by the nominator and the nominee honestly and the Decisional Di±e-Hellman Problem is hard. On the other hand, we point out that the Huang-Wang scheme is indeed insecure, since there is an attack that allows the nominator to generate valid nominative signatures alone and prove the validity of such signatures to a third party...|$|R

In the local dialect, the name of the village is Wọ́ku (genitive Wọ́kləga). In the past the German name was Hülben.|$|R
40|$|The basic goal of {{this work}} is to explore three interrelated issues in Icelandic syntax: the {{identification}} of structural case positions, the mechanisms for case checking {{and the role of}} case in NP licensing. As for the first issue, it is argued that nominative subjects in Icelandic are case-checked in Spec-IP or a lower position identified as Spec-TP (following Jonas 1992, 1993 and Jonas 2 ̆ 6 Bobaljik 1993), but accusative objects are case-checked in their base-generated complement position or in a VP-external position identified as Spec-AgrOP (following Deprez 1989 and others). There are certain semantic restrictions on arguments in Spec-IP, Spec-TP or Spec-AgrOP but they are shown to be independent of case and derivable from the Mapping Hypothesis of Diesing (1992), the Shortest Derivation Requirement and other principles of grammar. ^ In contrast to much recent work on Icelandic syntax, the traditional view that A-movement is always case-driven is defended in this thesis. Thus, it is argued that inherently case-marked NPs move to Spec-IP or Spec-TP to have covert nominative case checked as inherent case in Icelandic is irrelevant for satisfaction of the Case Filter. For the same reason, inherently case-marked objects in Icelandic need covert accusative case to satisfy the Case Filter whether they stay in situ or move to Spec-AgrOP. This approach to quirky arguments in Icelandic is used as a basis for a <b>new</b> analysis of <b>nominative</b> objects and agreement. ^ Case checking of an NP requires government by a lexical head or a spec-head relation with a functional head of the appropriate kind. An NP can also satisfy the Case Filter by chain-linking to a structural case position, i. e. case transmission as in expletive-argument chains. More specifically, case is transmitted from the expletive in Spec-IP to the argument in the expletive passive/unaccusative construction (Safir 1985, Burzio 1986), but from the argument in Spec-TP to the expletive in the expletive-TP construction. ...|$|R
