40|$|Abstract: Research {{and media}} reports {{indicate}} that most incidents of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in South Africa, as well as globally, are not reported to the police because of victims’ fears of retaliation, intimidation, stereotyping, secondary abuse and stigmatisation. As a result, {{there is a lack}} of accurate data available to the South African public and a certain level of ignorance to the realities of the incidence of SGBV across all sectors of society. The purpose of the study is to explore how <b>non-personal</b> <b>data</b> obtained through mapping the distress calls received on TEARS Foundation’s “Help-at-your-fingertips” service line can be used for SGBV research and prevention purposes. Given that in South Africa the death of women at the hands of an intimate partner has been estimated at six times the global average, the urgent need for alternative SGBV prevention strategies is unquestionable. The study shows how the calls received on the “Help-at-your-fingertips” service line across South African provinces and towns were analysed to identify trends, and visually represent the number of SGBV distress calls over two periods, namely July 2013 to August 2014 and September 2015 to October 2016. The key trends identified include times of year, times of day, highest call volumes in terms of provinces and differences in times of calls in different areas in South Africa as examples of the kinds of information that can be deduced from <b>non-personal</b> <b>data.</b> The study shows how <b>non-personal</b> <b>data</b> can be used as a powerful tool to make SGBV data visible and to raise public awareness of its incidence in South Africa...|$|E

40|$|The {{discussion}} about appropriate legal {{rules for the}} digital economy has {{raised the question of}} the ownership of <b>non-personal</b> <b>data,</b> e. g. in the context of value networks of firms, smart manufacturing and connected cars. The article analyzes from an economic perspective whether {{there is a need for}} a new exclusive IPR on data. It is shown that there are no convincing economic arguments for the in-troduction of such a new IPR, especially due to the lack of an incentive problem for the production and analysis of data. On the contrary, a new IPR on data might lead to considerable problems and dangers for competition and innovation, especially for the digital economy, which depends on the access to a broad variety of data. Therefore problems of access to data might be a much more im-portant policy issue than exclusive property rights on data...|$|E

40|$|The {{digital economy}} has been termed a {{data-driven}} economy. Many digital business models {{are based on the}} collection and the processing of various types of data. Whereas the protection of personal data falls under the EU legal framework, and first and foremost the General Data Protection Regulation, the protection of data that goes beyond personal data may seem to be not protected at all. The latter circumstance is important in light of the EU Commission’s considerations on the introduction of rights related to the protection of <b>non-personal</b> <b>data.</b> Indeed, the question of whether {{there is a need for}} the protection of such data – called “industrial data” - and the issue of access to such data have also been at the center of a recent academic debate. Yet, whereas the protection of different types of data is highly relevant when it comes to the transfer and the processing of data, for the question of “access to data” data has to be considered more broadly, i. e. as a digital resource. Since in the digital economy it is no longer individual pieces of data (personal and/or non-personal) that play a role, but rather collections of data, digital data sets (which may consist of both personal and <b>non-personal</b> <b>data)</b> have become a digital asset of companies. The value of such digital data sets derives from the analysis of data – importantly though, the analysis of real-time data. Due to this feature of data, i. e. the fact that data is constantly changing, the question that arises as regards access to data in the digital economy relates not so much to access to data as such, but rather to access to the sources of data. After all, it is only in this case that access can be provided to real-time data. In light of this, the current debate on so-called “industrial data” may appear too static and, besides, it considers only part of the data that is relevant for the companies operating in the digital economy. The question is what the legal framework for an optimal allocation of such a digital resource as data should be and whether the question of access can be solved with the currently available legal tools...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the approach under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to profiling and (automated) decision-making {{as well as}} the corresponding legal and ethical implications. The definition of profiling under the GDPR is analysed in relation to different degrees of automation when it comes to decision-making based on the processing of personal or <b>non-personal</b> <b>data.</b> A two-step approach to profiling and decision-making, which {{can be found in the}} structure and wording of the GDPR, is described and analysed. It is argued that the use of this model helps understand how profiling and decision-making are conducted and how the two steps are interconnected. Furthermore, the two-step approach allows to identify various legal implications of profiling and the corresponding decision-making, such as those related to privacy and economic freedom. Further, the discussion of ethical aspects draws on two recent and controversial use cases. The first example deals with discriminatory effects that may result from profiling. The second one concerns opaque automated decision-making in the context of credit scoring. This ethical assessment is based on the ethical framework supplied by the wording of the GDPR...|$|E

The {{new facility}}, known as Health Protection Profiles (HPPs) [1], has made previously-published information more accessible through the use of interactive maps and other graphics and a user-friendly presentation, in line with government policy of increased transparency in respect of <b>non-personal</b> <b>data</b> held by public bodies. They are primarily intended for a lay audience and were developed by the Agency's Local and Regional Services Division following consultation with and feedback from members of the public. Health professionals may find the profiles helpful in needs assessments, commissioning services and to track the impact of local initiatives (see also Sexual Health Profiles below). The indicators covered by HPPs are in three main categories: measures of disease rates or other ill health indicators (eg TB and sexually transmitted infections, and food poisoning notifications); data relating to health protection activities/interventions (eg uptake of MMR, human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) and seasonal influenza vaccination programmes); and environmental hazards (eg radon gas levels in homes above the designated Action Level).

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{tendency}} to release all sorts of public data on the Internet. The greater availability of interoperable public data catalyses secondary use of such data, which leads to growth of information industries and better government transparency. Open data policies may, nevertheless, be {{in conflict with the}} individual’s right to information privacy as protected by the Data Protection Directive. This directive sets rules to the processing of personal data in the European Union. Technological developments and the increasing amount of publicly available data are, however, blurring the lines between <b>non-personal</b> and personal <b>data.</b> Open data may not seem to be personal data on first glance especially when it is anonymised or aggregated. However, it may become personal data by combining it with other publicly available data or when it is de-anonymised. In this article, we argue that these developments extend the reach of European Union privacy regulation to open data, which may obstruct the implementation of open data policies in the European Union.

40|$|Aim Our {{aim was to}} set up {{a system}} to help UK {{clinical}} research units to prevent healthy volunteers from participat-ing in more than one non-therapeutic trial simultaneously, or from starting a second trial too soon after the first. Methods TOPS (The Over-volunteering Prevention System) is internet-based, simple and quick to use, free to users and a charity run by a Board of Trustees. Users enter only two or three pieces of information: (1) ‘National Insurance number’ (NINO) of UK citizens, or ‘passport number ’ and country of origin of non-UK citizens, as their identifier, (2) ‘date of last dose ’ of trial medicine or (3) ‘never dosed’. Subjects must consent, but TOPS collects only <b>non-personal</b> <b>data,</b> so it does not require Ethics Committee approval and is not covered by the Data Protection Act. Results A total of 55 research units (29 clinical research organisations, 5 pharmaceutical companies, 13 universities and 8 hospitals) throughout the UK have registered to use TOPS, and have entered 124, 906 volunteers since we launched it. All commercial and many non-commercial units now use TOPS. In our unit, no subject has {{to the best of our}} knowledge participated in two trials simultaneously. TOPS has reduced to < 1 % the incidence of subjects attempting to volunteer within 3 months of completing another trial elsewhere, and very few have to our know-ledge succeeded. Conclusion TOPS is widely used and effective, and helps research units to comply with UK clinical trial regulations...|$|E
40|$|The EU Directive 95 / 46 /EC on the {{protection}} of individuals {{with regard to the}} processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data aims at harmonising data protection legislation in the European Union. This should promote the free flow of products and services within the EU. This research found a wide variety of interpretations of the application of data protection legislation to geographic data. The variety was found among the different EU Member States, the different stakeholders and the different types of geographic data. In the Netherlands, the Data Protection Authority (DPA) states that panoramic images of streets are considered personal data. While Dutch case law judges that the data protection legislation does not apply if certain features are blurred and no link to an address is provided. The topographic datasets studied in the case studies do not contain personal data, according to the Dutch DPA, while the German DPA and the Belgian DPA judge that topographic maps of a large scale can contain personal data, and impose conditions on the processing of topographic maps. The UK DPA does consider this data outside of the scope of legal definition of personal data. The patchwork of differences in data protection legislation can be harmonised by using a traffic light model. This model focuses on {{the context in which the}} processing of the data takes place and has four categories of data: (1) sensitive personal data, (2) personal data, (3), data that can possibly lead to identification, and (4) <b>non-personal</b> <b>data.</b> For some geographic data, for example factual data that does not reveal sensitive information about a person, can be categorised in the third category giving room to opening up data under the INSPIRE Directive.

40|$|Artificial Intelligence (AI), {{although}} it is not an entirely new phenomenon, has been developing more intensively relatively recently. AI is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are modelled upon the architecture of human brains. Beside several ethical issues, such as whether “artificial brains” can and should be created in the first place, a number of legal questions emerge. One of the most urgent issues to be analyzed as regards AI is whether {{there is a need for}} a regulatory intervention. It is probably fair to say that AI is currently in a shape of a cocoon. In an academic legal research AI is still pretty much “terra incognita”. However, although there is no clear and visible AI market failure (yet), it may be worthwhile analyzing what the status quo of the markets in the digital economy is with a perspective view of the AI markets of the future. After all, AI is featured by the systems that can autonomously learn and improve (machine learning). Such self-learning capability of the machines is based on the technique called “deep learning”. The latter is fed by data. In this regard, it may well be that the purpose of current data collection and processing is related to conquering future markets for AI, so that a “snapshot” analysis of the issues related to current data-driven markets would show only one side of the coin of the market dynamics. The latter insight has to be borne in mind by both regulators and competition authorities. It is in this context that it has to be analyzed whether or what type of protection is needed for (<b>non-personal)</b> <b>data</b> and what is the optimal scope of protection of “deep learning” algorithms. After all, a current “open source” strategy of the biggest market players may be attractive from a short-run perspective, but may possibly raise competition law concerns in a long run. If current processes in the markets feature competition for developing future systems of AI, the question of (setting) standards and interoperability may turn out to be mostly important for future competition...|$|E
40|$|The {{public sector}} {{collects}} and generates {{vast amounts of}} data. In recent years the interest in re-using public, <b>non-personal</b> <b>data</b> has been increasing among citizens, groups and companies outside the public sector. The media, civil society groups, businesses and private citizens can use public data as "raw material" to create new services, new insight and economic value. Efficient re-use of public data requires that public sector agencies inform about their data sources and make data available in relevant formats. Practice varies strongly between Norwegian public sector agencies in different subject areas and across administrative levels (state/regional/local), this fact finding project from August to December 2009 has revealed. Some agencies offer detailed information about their data sources and have made data available for download. However, {{a major part of}} the agencies assessed offer insufficient or no information about data sources on the homepage of their websites. Here a fundamental requirement for the re-use of data is missing. The impression of varying interest and unused potential is amplified by the results of a survey among state agencies. Two thirds of respondents say their agency possesses data with potential for re-use that is not utilized today. The survey on the other hand suggests that the subject of open data is on the agenda in many agencies; more than six out of ten say they plan to make more data available for re-use during the coming year. The survey shows that increased costs and the concern that external groups will misunderstand the data and misinform the public are cited as the two greatest obstacles against more data being made available. In addition, interviews with public sector agency employees suggest that the topic of making data available is new to some agencies. A comparison with initiatives and debates about open public data in a selection of other countries (Britain, Denmark, Netherlands, USA) show that the attention the topic receives is greatest when it is placed on the agenda at the highest political level. The report recommends a number of concrete measures that it is assumed would quickly increase the selection of data sets made available for re-use. A website that collects public data sources, inspired by the US government's data. gov, would be an obviously efficient initiative, especially when accompanied by a set of clear principles and rules and an "instruction manual" that describes how to make data available in a secure and user-friendly way. The report also points out the need for a parallel, ongoing debate about criteria for the constructive re-use of data. The media should, in cooperation with the public, play a leading role by producing examples of best practices in re-using open data...|$|E
