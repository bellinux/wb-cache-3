40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of heating on the chemical compositions and antifungal properties of <b>nutmeg's</b> oleoresin. <b>Nutmeg's</b> oleoresin was obtained by two steps, distillation followed by maceration. The <b>nutmeg's</b> oleoresin was heated at 100 oC, 120 oC and 180 oC. The chemical compositions were determined by GC-MS, and the antifungal properties by giant colony method. The result of the study showed that yield was 13. 6 %± 0. 2 % and 24 components were identified. The <b>nutmeg's</b> oleoresin at 100 °C, 120 °C and 180 °C identified 25, 21 and 20 components. Indeed, heating treatment on <b>nutmeg's</b> oleoresin did not decrease the antifungal properties...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's <b>nutmeg</b> (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and <b>nutmeg,</b> and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E

5|$|Kerala {{produces}} 97% of {{the national}} output of black pepper and accounts for 85% of the natural rubber in the country. Coconut, tea, coffee, cashew, and spices—including cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and <b>nutmeg</b> are the main agricultural products. 80% of India's export quality cashew kernels are prepared in Kollam. The key agricultural staple is rice, with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields. Home gardens made up {{a significant portion of}} the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. The state government promotes these activities via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the Sunandini.|$|E
5|$|Qidra is a rice dish {{named after}} the clay vessel and oven it is baked in. Rice is cooked with pieces of meat inside of the vessel, often using lamb, whole garlic cloves, {{garbanzo}} beans, cardamom pods, and various other spices such as, turmeric, cinnamon, allspice, <b>nutmeg</b> and cumin.

60|$|We {{took out}} of her about sixteen ton of <b>nutmegs,</b> some provisions, and their small-arms, for they had no great guns, and let the ship go: from thence we sailed {{directly}} to the Banda Island, or Islands, where we were sure to get more <b>nutmegs</b> if we thought fit. For my part, I would willingly have got more <b>nutmegs,</b> though I had paid for them, but our people abhorred paying for anything; so we got about twelve ton more at several times, most of them from shore, {{and only a few}} in a small boat of the natives, which was going to Gilolo. We would have traded openly, but the Dutch, who have made themselves masters of all those islands, forbade the people dealing with us, or any strangers whatever, and kept them so in awe that they durst not do it; so we could indeed have made nothing of it if we had stayed longer, and therefore resolved to be gone for Ternate, and see if we could make up our loading with cloves.|$|R

Nearly half of Kerala's people depend on agriculture alone for income. Around 600 varieties of rice, which is Kerala's most used staple and cereal crop, are harvested from 3105.21km2; a decline from 5883.4km2 in 1990. 688,859tonnes of rice are produced per year.

Ivan was considered the worst hurricane to strike the nation since Hurricane Janet in 1955; its passage resulted in 39fatalities and $1.1billion in damage (2004USD, ($ USD), about 200% of its GDP and of which about 45% resulted from housing damage.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, <b>nutmeg,</b> and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey.
