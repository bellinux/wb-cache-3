Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) {{was used as a}} solubilizer while dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) was used as a skin penetration enhancer. It was found that the mean particle sizes of EA-loaded <b>niosomes</b> were in the range of 312 – 402  nm with PI values of lower than 0. 4. The <b>niosomes</b> were determined to be spherical multilamellar vesicles as observed by transmission electron microscope and optical microscopy. All <b>niosomes</b> were stable after 4 months storage at 4  °C. In vitro skin permeation through human epidermis revealed that the skin enhancers affected the penetration of EA from the <b>niosomes</b> at 24  h. The DMSO <b>niosomes</b> showed the highest EA amount in epidermis; whereas the NMP <b>niosomes</b> had the highest EA amount in the acceptor medium. Concomitantly, the skin distribution by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed the high fluorescence intensity of the DMSO <b>niosomes</b> and NMP <b>niosomes</b> at a penetration depth of between 30 – 90  μm (the epidermis layer) and 90 – 120  μm (the dermis layer) under the skin, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} an influence of different types of membrane additives including negative charge (dicetylphosphate, DCP), positive charge (stearylamine, STR) and non-ionic molecule (cholesteryl poly- 24 -oxyethylene ether, SC 24) on the physicochemical properties of drug-free and drug-loaded <b>niosomes.</b> Salicylic acid having different proportions of ionized and unionized species at different pH was selected as a model drug. The <b>niosomes</b> were composed of 1 : 1 mole ratio of Span 60 : cholesterol as vesicle forming agents. The results show that incorporation of salicylic acid to the <b>niosomes</b> did not affect zeta potential values; however, addition of the membrane additives changed the zeta potential depending on the type of the additives. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that <b>niosomes</b> had unilamellar structure. The particle sizes of all developed <b>niosomes</b> were between 217 to 360  nm. The entrapment efficiency (%E. E.) of all salicylic acid <b>niosomes</b> at pH  3 was higher than that of <b>niosomes</b> at pH  5, indicating that salicylic acid in unionized form was preferably incorporated in <b>niosomes.</b> Furthermore, the positively charged <b>niosomes</b> showed the highest %E.

50|$|<b>Niosome</b> {{preparation}} using polyoxyethylene alkyl etherThe {{size and}} number of bilayer of vesicles consisting of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and cholesterol can be changed using an alternative method.25 Temperature rise above 60 °C transforms small unilamellar vesicles to large multilamellar vesicles (>1 μm), while vigorous shaking at room temperature shows the opposite effect, i.e., transformation of multilamellar vesicles into unilamellar ones. The transformation from unilamellar to multilamellar vesicles at higher temperature might be the characteristic for polyoxyethylene alkyl ether (ester) surfactant, since {{it is known that}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) and water remix at higher temperature due to breakdown of hydrogen bonds between water and PEG moieties. Generally, free drug is removed from the encapsulated drug by gel permeation chromatography dialysis method or centrifugation method. Often, density differences between niosomes and the external phase are smaller than that of liposomes, which make separation by centrifugation very difficult. Addition of protamine to the vesicle suspension facilitates separation during centrifugation.|$|E

To this end, VIP/ 125 I-VIP-loaded glucose-bearing <b>niosomes</b> were intravenously injected to mice. Brain uptake was determined by measuring the radioactivity of 125 I-labeled VIP using gamma-counting, after intravenous administration of VIP in solution or encapsulated in glucose-bearing <b>niosomes</b> or in control <b>niosomes.</b> VIP integrity was assessed by reversed-phase HPLC analysis of brain extracts. Distribution of 125 I-VIP derived radioactivity was examined from serial brain slices. HPLC analysis confirmed the presence of intact VIP in brain after administration of VIP-loaded <b>niosomes,</b> but not after administration of VIP solution. Encapsulation within glucose-bearing <b>niosomes</b> mainly allowed a significantly higher VIP brain uptake compared to control <b>niosomes</b> (up to 86 %, 5 min after treatment).

40|$|Drug {{delivery}} {{methods for}} the treatment of brain tumor cells have been both inefficient and potentially dangerous for cancer patients. Drug delivery must be done in a controlled manner so that the effective amount of medication is delivered to the patient and ensure over-dosage does not cause adverse side reactions in the patient. The focus of this investigation is to design a drug delivery system that would allow for site-specific administration of the drug, protection of the drug from the surrounding environment, and controlled sustained release of the drug. We have proposed a model that incorporates a <b>niosome,</b> which is a non-ionic surfactant vesicle, within a biodegradable polymer hydrogel. The drug is encapsulated in the <b>niosome,</b> and the <b>niosome</b> is embedded within a three-dimensional hydrogel network. It is therefore critical that the release rate of the drug from the <b>niosome</b> be studied. This investigation provides information about the release rate and behavior of the drug within the <b>niosome</b> as it is placed in a semi-permeable membrane. The <b>niosome</b> and dye solution in the cellulose membrane are placed in contact with water or PBS. Intensity measurements are taken using fluorescence spectrometry, and the readings are converted to concentration and moles values. The release rates of the dye from of the <b>niosome</b> and across the membrane are studied as the concentration data is collected over time. The results indicate that most of the niosomes will release their dye within ten hours. The water will create instability in the niosomes, while the PBS solution will maintain the stability of the niosomes. The concentration that diffuses across the cellulose membrane will steadily increase and can be predicted well by a simple diffusion model. We hope to use the information provided in this study to continue to design a drug delivery method that will stabilize the niosomes and allow for the maximum control over the release rate of the drug...|$|E

40|$|<b>Niosomes</b> are a novel drug {{delivery}} system, {{in which the}} medication is encapsulated in a vesicle. Thevesicle is composed of a bilayer of non-ionic surface active agents and hence the name given as“Niosomes”. The <b>niosomes</b> are very small ranging usually in micron size. Their size lies in thenanometric scale. Although structurally similar to liposomes, they offer several advantages over them. <b>Niosomes</b> have recently been shown to greatly increase transdermal {{drug delivery}} and also can be usedin targeted drug delivery, and thus increased study in these structures can provide new methods for drugdelivery...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{biological}} and artificial membrane systems, such as niosomes, currently {{rely on the}} use of fluorescent tags, which can influence the system under investigation. For this reason, the development of label-free, non-invasive detection techniques is of great interest. We demonstrate an open volume label-free millimeter-wave sensing platform based on a coplanar waveguide, developed for identification and characterization of <b>niosome</b> constituents. A design based on a λ/ 2 -line resonator was used and on-wafer measurements of transmission and reflection parameters were performed up to 110 GHz. Our sensor was able to clearly distinguish between common <b>niosome</b> constituents, non-ionic surfactants Tween 20 and Span 80, measuring a resonance shift of 3 GHz between them. The complex permittivities of the molecular compounds have been extracted. Our results indicate insignificant frequency dependence in the investigated frequency range (3 GHz – 110 GHz). Values of permittivity around 3. 0 + 0. 7 i and 2. 2 + 0. 4 i were obtained for Tween 20 and Span 80, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Multicompartment nanoscopic {{carriers}} can {{be easily}} assembled by inducing the aggregation of anionic "hybrid" niosomes by means of cationic biocompatible polyelectrolytes. The resulting vesicle clusters, whose size and overall net charge {{can be easily}} controlled by varying the polyelectrolyte-to-particle charge ratio, show an interesting potential for multidrug delivery. In this article we provide strong evidence for their effective use in vitro as multicompartment vectors selectively directed toward monocyte/macrophage cells, showing that the monocyte/macrophage-mediated activation of Tγδ lymphocytes induced by zoledronic acid is enhanced by a factor 103 when the zoledronic acid is intracellularly delivered through these carriers. Furthermore, the multicompartment ε-polylysine <b>niosome</b> clusters, with their intrinsic selectivity toward macrophages, appear particularly suitable for implementing therapeutic strategies against chronically infected macrophages. From the Clinical Editor: ε-polylysine <b>niosome</b> clusters, with their intrinsic selectivity toward macrophages, offer the potential for multidrug delivery. The effectiveness of aminobisphosphonate zoledronate is demonstrated to enhance the recruitment of Tγδ lymphocytes by macrophages by 2 orders of magnitude, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for addressing pathologies featuring chronically infected macrophages. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (SC-CO 2) {{has emerged as}} a {{non-toxic}} and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional organic solvents with many applications. A novel method of nonionic surfactant based lipid vesicle (<b>niosome)</b> production coupling a gas ejector with the rapid expansion of a supercritical solution was studied. Niosomes were prepared using Tween 61, which was shown to be 4 - 6 % soluble (wt. basis) in SC-CO 2 ranging from 40 to 60 °C and 10 to 20 MPa, and cholesterol at a 1 : 1 molar ratio. <b>Niosome</b> lamellarity was shown to depend on the degree of precipitation of the lipid formulation at the point of aqueous cargo introduction. <b>Niosome</b> particle size distributions were bimodal, with the 80 - 99 % of the liposomal volume contributed niosomes ranging in size from 3 - 7 [mu]m and the remaining niosomes ranging from 239 - 969 nm, depending on the system configuration. Using the gas ejector for cargo introduction, the maximum encapsulation efficiency of a 0. 2 M sucrose solution was 28 %. <b>Niosome</b> size and encapsulation efficiency were shown to be influenced by aqueous cargo droplet formation and the aerodynamic forces of the expanding gaseous stream. Simultaneous encapsulation of ferrous sulphate and cholecalciferol achieved encapsulation efficiencies of 25. 1 ± 0. 2 % and 95. 9 ± 1. 5 %, respectively. Niosomes showed good physical stability at 20 °C, but storage at 4 °C showed an initial burst release of ferrous iron, indicating possible rupture of the niosomal membrane. Extraction of oil from potato chips was investigated as a means for the simultaneous production of low fat potato chips and flavor extract. Extraction conditions range 27. 6 - 41. 4 MPa, 35 - 80 °C and solvent flow rate of 0. 5 - 5. 0 g CO 2 /min. Up to 100 % of the oil was recovered from the potato chips at the highest pressure and temperature conditions. Two process conditions were chosen for comparison of performance with a larger scale (1 : 5) system, maintaining the same CO 2 flow rate to feed mass ratio with Good agreement between scales observed at the higher pressure and temperature settings. Kinetic parameters, calculated using a literature model, indicated that the extraction was limited by internal diffusion. Costs associated with the process were assessed using a method described in the literature. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
