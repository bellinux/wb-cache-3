40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} nature of disparities in {{regional}} (State) unemployment rates in Australia over the period 1978 - 1999 {{and their relationship to}} the national unemployment rate. As a measure of dispersion we use the sum of the (weighted) deviations of regional unemployment rates from the national rate. We show that this figure may be interpreted as the number of new jobs or labour force movements that would be needed to even out unemployment rates between regions, expressed as a proportion of the total <b>number</b> <b>currently</b> <b>employed</b> in all regions. Using co-integration analysis, we find that there is a (long-run) relationship between the degree of dispersion in the regional unemployment rates and the level of the national unemployment rate. The relationship between the two is negative implying that, as the national unemployment rate falls, micro and/or differentiated labour markets policies need to bite harder (and affect proportionately more people) if equity in unemployment across regions is to be maintained. We also find that the trade-off between dispersion and unemployment has become steeper in the period following significant deregulation of the Australian economy in the early Nineteen-Eighties. It would appear likely that this reflects an increase in differences in the Natural Rate of Unemployment between the regions since that time. UNEMPLOYMENT; REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT...|$|E

50|$|The {{labour force}} {{is defined as}} the number of people of working age, who are either {{employed}} or actively looking for work. The participation rate is {{the number of people in}} the labour force divided by the size of the adult civilian noninstitutional population (or by the population of working age that is not institutionalized). The non-labour force includes those who are not looking for work, those who are institutionalised such as in prisons or psychiatric wards, stay-at home spouses, children, and those serving in the military. The unemployment level {{is defined as the}} labour force minus the <b>number</b> of people <b>currently</b> <b>employed.</b> The unemployment rate is defined as the level of unemployment divided by the labour force. The employment rate is defined as the <b>number</b> of people <b>currently</b> <b>employed</b> divided by the adult population (or by the population of working age). In these statistics, self-employed people are counted as employed.|$|R
40|$|Fuel-air mixture {{preparation}} {{is a key}} factor determining combustion performance and emissions {{in a variety of}} practical applications, such as internal combustion engines, gas-turbine engines, rocket propulsion devices, and power generation systems. The problem of characterizing the two-phase combustion process, however, is quite difficult {{in part because of the}} complex optical interactions involved, as well as the optically dense nature of many sprays. There are a wide <b>number</b> of techniques <b>currently</b> <b>employed</b> for the characterization of spray combustion processes, with the selection of appropriate measurement technology dependent upon the nature of the spray for each combustion application. This chapter reviews a variety of conventional techniques, in particular Mie scattering, phase-Doppler interferometry, and planar laser-induced fluorescence. More advanced techniques, including holography, three-dimensional tomography, X-ray radiography, and time-gated ballistic imaging are also discussed. Often the combination or comparison of multiple techniques yields information that would otherwise be inaccessible with individual methods. Advantages and disadvantages of each technique, sources of error, measurement needs, and outlook for future development are discussed in the context of the challenges facing combustion scientists and engineers...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{confusion}} {{has existed}} among researchers {{with regard to}} the selection of a particular model of health behavior for study, and many investigators have long felt that the actual number of truly distinct concepts relevant to explaining health-related actions is considerably lower than the large <b>number</b> of variables <b>currently</b> <b>employed.</b> This paper explores selected approaches and models which have been advanced to explain health actions, in terms of structural similarities and differences identified by a panel of judges who are the relevant experts in this field. Judges were asked to partition a set of 109 variables, representing 14 different models, into 12 â€“ 14 groups on the basis of similarity. The structural similarities among the variable groups were evaluated using Smallest Space Analysis. Six interpretable factors emerged from the analyses: (1) accessibility to health care, (2) evaluation of health care, (3) perception of symptoms and threat of disease, (4) social network characteristics, (5) knowledge about disease, and (6) demographic characteristics. The results of the study provide a first step in developing a unified framework for explaining health actions...|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{studies of}} larval fishes have lagged far behind those of adults, yet offer {{tremendous}} opportunities for expanding {{our knowledge of}} the basic biology of both marine and freshwater fishes. Physiological studies of larval fishes can also improve research and management in areas of applied science, such as aquaculture, fisheries, and environmental assessment. Additionally, larval fishes can be highly effective as general animal models for understanding evolution, development and disease processes in vertebrates. While the small size of larval fishes may initially seem to preclude detailed physiological measurements, physiologists have taken advantage of larval transparency and permeability to drugs and toxins to collect many forms of quantitative physiological data. In this essay we present a <b>number</b> of microtechniques <b>currently</b> <b>employed</b> in larval fish to study the cardiovascular, muscular, neurological, and ionoregulatory systems. Several interesting phenomena, including allometry, developmental plasticity and epigenetic effects, are then discussed {{from the perspective of the}} specific contributions that have been or can be made by studies of fish larvae. Ultimately, the integration of larval fish physiology with studies of morphology and behaviour, is both highly feasibly and likely to strengthen basic and applied research in fishes...|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} of the economy of the Western Counties of Ireland industrial expansion, in order to diversify employment opportunities, has been given considerable prominence and insufficient attention given to the need for agricultural development. The need for new industries is obvious, but the total <b>numbers</b> <b>employed</b> <b>currently</b> in industry is less than 12 per cent of those in agriculture, an increase in agricultural productivity is of critical importance if the level of national income produced in these counties is to be brought much closer in line with that {{of the rest of the}} country. The basic economic problems of this area can only be solved over a long period of time, and the immediate requirement is for a much more detailed understanding of these economic problems. At present in An Foras Taluntais a considerable amount of work is being undertaken on both the physical and economic factors involved in an expansion of farm production.
