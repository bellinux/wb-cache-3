5|$|Lead {{affects the}} {{peripheral}} <b>nervous</b> system (especially motor nerves) {{and the central}} <b>nervous</b> system. Peripheral <b>nervous</b> system effects are more prominent in adults and central <b>nervous</b> system effects are more prominent in children. Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their myelin coats.|$|E
5|$|Other {{heavy metals}} noted for their {{potentially}} hazardous nature, usually as toxic environmental pollutants, include manganese (central <b>nervous</b> system damage); cobalt and nickel (carcinogens); copper, zinc, selenium and silver (endocrine disruption, congenital disorders, or general toxic effects in fish, plants, birds, or other aquatic organisms); tin, as organotin (central <b>nervous</b> system damage); antimony (a suspected carcinogen); and thallium (central <b>nervous</b> system damage).|$|E
5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} central <b>nervous</b> system oxygen {{toxicity}} {{may lead to}} incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the <b>nervous</b> system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E
5|$|Animal tissues can {{be grouped}} into four basic types: connective, epithelial, muscle and <b>nervous</b> tissue.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the <b>Nervous</b> System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development of the <b>nervous</b> system, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central <b>nervous</b> system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the <b>nervous</b> system during 1938. Neuroscience {{during the twentieth century}} began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophore {{nerve cells}} and <b>nervous</b> system evolved {{separately}} from other animals {{and have a}} different biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nervous</b> {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central <b>nervous</b> system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral <b>nervous</b> system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral <b>nervous</b> system is divided into the somatic <b>nervous</b> system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic <b>nervous</b> system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Neurocutaneous {{conditions}} are due organic <b>nervous</b> system disease or are psychiatric in etiology.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic <b>nervous</b> system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{cranial nerves}} are {{considered}} {{components of the}} peripheral <b>nervous</b> system (PNS), although on a structural level the olfactory, optic and terminal nerves are more accurately {{considered part of the}} central <b>nervous</b> system (CNS).|$|E
5|$|The diet of the <b>nervous</b> shark {{consists}} {{mainly of}} small teleost fishes (including silversides, smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including prawns, crabs, and mantis shrimps) and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark {{is also known}} to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite of the <b>nervous</b> shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic <b>nervous</b> system. Input from the parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, {{and increases the}} secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic <b>nervous</b> system and spares the sympathetic autonomic <b>nervous</b> system remain poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central <b>nervous</b> system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central <b>nervous</b> system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central <b>nervous</b> system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's <b>nervous</b> system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|At high {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 20atm or twoMPa), {{a mixture of}} helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to high-pressure <b>nervous</b> syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding {{a small amount of}} nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that the <b>nervous</b> shark {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the silky shark (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between the <b>nervous</b> and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the <b>nervous</b> system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the <b>nervous</b> system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Bitterman et al. in 1986 and 1995 {{showed that}} {{darkness}} and caffeine would delay {{the onset of}} changes to brain electrical activity in rats. In the years since, research on central <b>nervous</b> system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance. Sensitivity to central <b>nervous</b> system oxygen toxicity {{has been shown to}} be affected by factors such as circadian rhythm, drugs, age, and gender. In 1988, Hamilton et al. wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations. Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Claudel and Rodin parted in 1898. Claudel {{suffered}} an alleged <b>nervous</b> breakdown {{several years later}} and was confined to an institution for 30 years by her family, until her death in 1943, despite numerous attempts by doctors {{to explain to her}} mother and brother that she was sane.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores have no brain {{or central}} <b>nervous</b> system, but instead have a nerve net (rather like a cobweb) that forms a ring round {{the mouth and}} is densest near {{structures}} such as the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles (if present) and the sensory complex furthest from the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{relatively}} small central <b>nervous</b> system, some spiders (like Portia) exhibit complex behaviour, including {{the ability to use}} a trial-and-error approach.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the <b>nervous</b> systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the <b>nervous</b> system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma, {{also known}} as {{olfactory}} neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the olfactory epithelium and its classification remains controversial. However, since {{it is not a}} sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and is {{not to be confused with}} neuroblastoma.|$|E

5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral <b>nervous</b> system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic <b>nervous</b> system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
