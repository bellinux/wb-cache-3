25|$|A {{possibly}} good <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> {{makes the}} MSR attractive for the neutron poor thorium fuel cycle.|$|E
25|$|More {{efficient}} breeding. The thorium blanket {{can effectively}} capture leaked neutrons {{from the core}} region. There is nearly zero fission occurring in the blanket, so the blanket itself does not leak significant numbers of neutrons. This results in a high efficiency of neutron use (<b>neutron</b> <b>economy),</b> and a higher breeding ratio, especially with small reactors.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of online processing {{can be an}} MSR advantage. Continuous processing would reduce the inventory of fission products, control corrosion and improve <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> by removing fission products with high neutron absorption cross-section, especially xenon. This makes the MSR particularly suited to the neutron-poor thorium fuel cycle. Online fuel processing can introduce risks of fuel processing accidents, which can trigger release of radio isotopes.|$|E
25|$|Pressurised {{heavy water}} {{reactors}} {{are a subset}} of pressurized water reactors, sharing {{the use of a}} pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using heavy water as coolant and moderator for the greater <b>neutron</b> <b>economies</b> it offers.|$|R
25|$|Thorium-based reactors. It is {{possible}} to convert Thorium-232 into U-233 in reactors specially designed for the purpose. In this way, thorium, which is four times more abundant than uranium, {{can be used to}} breed U-233 nuclear fuel. U-233 is also believed to have favourable nuclear properties as compared to traditionally used U-235, including better <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> and lower production of long lived transuranic waste.|$|E
25|$|To date, most {{research}} has focused on FLiBe, because lithium and beryllium are reasonably effective moderators and form a eutectic salt mixture with a lower melting point than each of the constituent salts. Beryllium also performs neutron doubling, improving the <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b> This process occurs when the beryllium nucleus re-emits two neutrons after absorbing a single neutron. For the fuel carrying salts, generally 1% or 2% (by mole) of UF4 is added. Thorium and plutonium fluorides have also been used.|$|E
25|$|Most BWR and PWR {{commercial}} reactors use uranium enriched {{to about}} 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors {{with a high}} <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency {{there are at least}} 100 research reactors in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment uranium). Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).|$|E
25|$|The <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> {{of heavy}} water {{moderation}} and precise control of on-line refueling allow CANDU {{to use a}} great range of fuels other than enriched uranium, e.g., natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, thorium, plutonium, and used LWR fuel. Given the expense of enrichment, this can make fuel much cheaper. There is an initial investment into the tonnes of 99.75% pure heavy water to fill the core and heat transfer system. In {{the case of the}} Darlington plant costs released as part of a freedom of information act request put the overnight cost of the plant (four reactors totalling 3,512 MWe net capacity) at $5.117 billion CAD (about $4.2 billion USD at early 1990s exchange rates). Total capital costs including interest were $14.319 billion CAD (about $11.9 billion USD) with the heavy water accounting for $1.528 billion, or 11%, of this.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{commercial}} reactor designs use normal {{water as}} the moderator. Water will absorb {{some of the}} neutrons, enough {{that it is not}} possible to keep the reaction going. CANDU replaces this [...] "light" [...] water with heavy water, whose extra neutron eliminates the absorption and results in a better <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b> This allows CANDU to run on a wider variety of fuels; this includes unenriched natural uranium, as well as uranium mixed with a wide variety of other materials such as plutonium and thorium. This was a major goal of the CANDU design; by operating on natural uranium the cost of enrichment is removed. This also presents an advantage in nuclear proliferation terms, as there is no need for enrichment facilities which might also be used for military purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{elements}} like Xe and Kr {{come out}} easily as gas, assisted by a sparge of helium. In addition {{a part of}} the [...] "noble" [...] metals are removed together with the gas as a fine mist. Especially the fast removal of Xe-135 is important, as this is a very strong neutron poison and makes reactor control more difficult if left in the reactor. Removal of Xe also improves <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b> The gas (mainly He, Xe and Kr) is held up for about 2 days until a large fraction of the Xe-135 and other short lived isotopes have decayed. Most of the gas can then be recycled. After an additional hold up of several months, radioactivity is low enough to separate the gas at low temperatures into helium (for reuse), xenon (for sale) and krypton. The krypton needs storage (e.g. in compressed form) for an extended time (several decades) to wait for the decay of Kr-85.|$|E
50|$|A {{possibly}} good <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> {{makes the}} MSR attractive for the neutron poor thorium fuel cycle.|$|E
5000|$|A 'breeder' {{is simply}} a reactor {{designed}} for very high <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> with an associated conversion rate higher than 1.0. In principle, almost any reactor design could possibly be tweaked to become a breeder. An example {{of this process is}} the evolution of the Light Water Reactor, a very heavily moderated thermal design, into the Super Fast Reactor [...] concept, using light water in an extremely low-density supercritical form to increase the <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> high enough to allow breeding.|$|E
50|$|A {{key issue}} for the fusion-fission concept is the number and {{lifetime}} of the neutrons in the various processes, the so-called <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Heavy Water is an {{extremely}} efficient moderator. As a result, reactors using heavy water, such as the CANDU also have a high <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Neutron</b> <b>economy</b> {{is defined}} as the ratio of an adjoint {{weighted}} average of the excess neutron production divided by an adjoint weighted average of the fission production.|$|E
50|$|However {{the term}} <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> is used {{not just for}} the {{instantaneous}} reactivity of a reactor but also to describe the overall efficiency of a nuclear reactor design.|$|E
50|$|A {{molten salt}} reactor design, {{a type of}} nuclear reactor where the working fluid is a molten salt, would use UF4 as the core material. UF4 is {{generally}} chosen over other salts because of {{the usefulness of the}} elements without isotope separation, better <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> and moderating efficiency, lower vapor pressure and better chemical stability.|$|E
5000|$|More {{efficient}} breeding. The thorium blanket {{can effectively}} capture leaked neutrons {{from the core}} region. There is nearly zero fission occurring in the blanket, so the blanket itself does not leak significant numbers of neutrons. This results in a high efficiency of neutron use (<b>neutron</b> <b>economy),</b> and a higher breeding ratio, especially with small reactors.|$|E
50|$|Use of the isotope 15N (which {{constitutes}} around 0.37% {{of natural}} nitrogen) is preferable because the predominant isotope, 14N, has a not insignificant neutron {{absorption cross section}} which affects <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> and, in particular, it undergoes an (n,p) reaction which produces significant amounts of radioactive 14C which {{would need to be}} carefully contained and sequestered during reprocessing or permanent storage.|$|E
5000|$|In an open {{fuel cycle}} (i.e. {{utilizing}} [...] in situ), higher burnup {{is necessary to}} achieve a favorable <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b> Although thorium dioxide performed well at burnups of 170,000 MWd/t and 150,000 MWd/t at Fort St. Vrain Generating Station and AVR respectively, challenges complicate achieving this in light water reactors (LWR), which compose {{the vast majority of}} existing power reactors.|$|E
50|$|A reactor {{whose main}} {{purpose is to}} destroy actinides, rather than {{increasing}} fissile fuel stocks, is sometimes known as a burner reactor. Both breeding and burning depend on good <b>neutron</b> <b>economy,</b> and many designs can do either. Breeding designs surround the core by a breeding blanket of fertile material. Waste burners surround the core with non-fertile wastes to be destroyed. Some designs add neutron reflectors or absorbers.|$|E
50|$|CANDU type {{reactors}} {{operating in}} Canada have the particularity {{of being able}} to use natural uranium as fuel because of their high <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b> Therefor the costly fuel enrichment step required by the more prevalent light-water reactor types can be avoided. However this comes at the cost of heavy water usage which, for example, represented 11% ($1.5 billion) of the capital costs of the Darlington plant.|$|E
50|$|Filippone {{maintains}} that when steam {{is used as}} the moderator, the average neutron energy is increased {{from that of a}} liquid water-moderated reactor such that the delayed neutrons persist until they hit another nucleus. The resulting extremely high <b>neutron</b> <b>economy,</b> he claims, will make it possible to maintain a self-sustaining reaction in fuel rods of pure , once the reactor has been started by enriched fuel.|$|E
50|$|Self Powered Neutron Detector (SPND) is {{a neutron}} {{detector}} used in nuclear fission reactors. It is a compact device extensively used worldwide for mapping of neutron flux, helping the reactor-operators {{in maintaining the}} <b>neutron</b> <b>economy.</b> It gives a direct current signal proportional to the incident flux of neutrons, due to production of negative beta particles or Compton electrons {{in the heart of}} the device.|$|E
50|$|The {{quantity}} {{that indicates}} {{how much the}} <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> is out of balance is given the term Reactivity. If a reactor is exactly critical - that is, the neutron production is exactly equal to neutron destruction - then the reactivity is zero. If the reactivity is positive - then the reactor is supercritical. If the reactivity is negative - then the reactor is subcritical.|$|E
50|$|The {{reactor core}} {{consists}} of 16 low-enriched plate-type fuel assemblies and is located under 13 metres {{of water in}} an open pool. Light water (normal H2O) is used as the coolant and moderator while heavy water (D2O) is used as the neutron reflector. The purpose of the neutron reflector is to improve <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> in the reactor, and hence to increase the maximum neutron flux.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of online processing {{can be an}} MSR advantage. Continuous processing would reduce the inventory of fission products, control corrosion and improve <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> by removing fission products with high neutron absorption cross-section, especially xenon.

50|$|Uranium-233 {{has been}} used as a fuel in several {{different}} reactor types, and is proposed as a fuel for several new designs (see Thorium fuel cycle), all of which breed it from thorium. Uranium-233 can be bred in either fast reactors or thermal reactors, unlike the uranium-238-based fuel cycles which require the superior <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> of a fast reactor in order to breed plutonium, that is, to produce more fissile material than is consumed.|$|E
50|$|A {{breeder reactor}} is {{a nuclear reactor}} that generates more fissile {{material}} than it consumes. These devices achieve this because their <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> is high enough to breed more fissile fuel than they use from fertile material, such as uranium-238 or thorium-232. Breeders were at first found attractive because their fuel economy was better than light water reactors, but interest declined after the 1960s as more uranium reserves were found, and new methods of uranium enrichment reduced fuel costs.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{challenge}} {{associated with}} the thorium fuel cycle is the comparatively long interval over which [...] breeds to [...] The half-life of [...] is about 27 days, which is {{an order of magnitude}} longer than the half-life of [...] As a result, substantial [...] develops in thorium-based fuels. [...] is a significant neutron absorber and, although it eventually breeds into fissile , this requires two more neutron absorptions, which degrades <b>neutron</b> <b>economy</b> and increases the likelihood of transuranic production.|$|E
50|$|One such {{proposal}} {{calls for}} a gas-cooled fast reactor that is fueled primarily by plutonium and americium. The neutronic properties of americium {{make it difficult to}} use in any critical reactor because it tends to make the moderator temperature coefficient more positive, decreasing stability. The inherent safety of an ADS, however, would allow americium to be safely burned. These materials also have good <b>neutron</b> <b>economy,</b> allowing the pitch-to-diameter ratio to be large, which allows for improved natural circulation and economics.|$|E

For the fuel carrying salts, generally 1% or 2% (by mole) of UF4 is added. Thorium and plutonium fluorides have also been used.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of neutron energies {{in a nuclear}} reactor differs from the fission neutron spectrum due to the slowing down of neutrons in elastic and inelastic collisions with fuel, coolant and construction material. Neutrons slow down in elastic and inelastic collisions, until they are absorbed via Neutron capture or lost by leakage. <b>Neutron</b> <b>economy</b> is the balanced account, in a reactor, of the neutrons created and the neutrons lost through absorption by non-fuel elements, resonance absorption by fuel, and leakage while fast and thermal energy ranges.|$|E
50|$|A {{pressurized}} heavy-water reactor (PHWR) is {{a nuclear}} reactor, commonly using unenriched natural uranium as its fuel, that uses heavy water (deuterium oxide D2O) as its coolant and neutron moderator. The heavy water coolant is kept under pressure, {{allowing it to}} be heated to higher temperatures without boiling, much as in a pressurized water reactor. While heavy water is significantly more expensive than ordinary light water, it creates greatly enhanced <b>neutron</b> <b>economy,</b> allowing the reactor to operate without fuel-enrichment facilities (offsetting the additional expense of the heavy water) and enhancing {{the ability of the}} reactor to make use of alternate fuel cycles.|$|E
