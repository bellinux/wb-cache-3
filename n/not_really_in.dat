25|$|No. 487 (NZ) Squadron {{came into}} being on 15 August 1942. Formed as a day bomber unit, it was {{initially}} equipped with Lockheed Venturas crewed by Royal New Zealand Air Force pilots, and based at RAF Feltwell in Norfolk. The Ventura, an update of the Lockheed Hudson, acquired a poor reputation in Europe as its performance was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the same league as British and German aircraft of the period. Nevertheless, operations began in December, with the squadron's first being a 16-plane raid on the Phillips factory at Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, during which it lost three aircraft, including the one flown by its commanding officer, Wing Commander F.C. Seavill.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} Bruce Report {{not only}} recommended {{the construction of}} two major new railway stations, but also {{the construction of an}} inner ring road of motorway that circled the city centre. Despite being proposed {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War it was not until the 1960s that this project was begun. This involved the construction of the M8 motorway through the east end of the city along the route of the old Monkland Canal. This part of the project was fairly non controversial as the canal was in a poor state and <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> use by this time. This portion of the ring road would form the northern flank.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the season}} was much more violent than {{previous}} MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be [...] "too far", saying that [...] "Daredevil wasn’t asking {{for a lot of}} sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the position to get into a relationship, and it just didn’t fit the story for that season. I think that’ll change moving forward, but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I think once Daredevil was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in Jessica Jones." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, {{the song}} was [...] "a {{perfectly}} decent slice of midtempo Timba-pop, but it's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the same league as the brilliant 'The Way I Are'." [...] MTV Buzzworthy said [...] "slightly less out-there are the beats -- which sound {{an awful lot like}} Hilson and Timbaland's first collaboration, [...] "The Way I Are"—and the cameo from Timba himself." [...] Sophie Bruce of BBC Music thought that the song lacked the a catchy hook such as in [...] "The Way I Are." [...] Less than impressed with Timbaland's rapping and [...] "less than sexy" [...] vocal appeal, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said the [...] "unfortunate pairing" [...] was reprised, and the song [...] "encapsulates the record’s shortcomings." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his field}} and day, Wright was {{certainly}} eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, {{to whom he}} is often compared. One critic, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would [...] "ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms" [...] but that positively [...] "they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a [...] "full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet", the more seriously minded Wright, who was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.|$|E

500|$|Willis, however, {{still wanted}} to play football. [...] "My heart was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> {{coaching}}", he later said. He read that Paul Brown was coaching a team in the newly formed All-America Football Conference (AAFC), and he gave Brown a call. Brown said he would get back to Willis on a possible tryout. In the meantime, Willis was recruited by the Montreal Alouettes, a team in the Canadian Football League. Not hearing back from Brown, he planned to go play in Canada. Willis {{was about to leave}} for Montreal when Paul Hornung, a sportswriter for the Columbus Dispatch, called with a message from Brown. Hornung told Willis to go for a tryout in Bowling Green, Ohio, where the new team, the Cleveland Browns, was holding its training camp.|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

Djawadi {{has worked on}} the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created {{for the beginning of}} the episode, titled [...] "Light of the Seven", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, [...] "The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the language of the Game of Thrones score." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|The Litigators {{is said to}} be [...] "an amusing and appalling {{look into}} the machinations of a {{nationwide}} class-action suit," [...] according to Tobin Harshaw of Bloomberg L.P. [...] The Wall Street Journals Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at lawyers {{at the bottom of the}} food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be a good starting point for those who have tired of Grisham. [...] Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a [...] "heartier meal" [...] than Grisham's usual [...] "potato-chip fiction". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away." [...] Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there is}} little doubt that the writers of the Second Amendment were heavily {{influenced}} by the English Bill of Rights, it is a matter of interpretation as to whether they were intent on preserving the power to regulate arms to the states over the federal government (as the English Parliament had reserved for itself against the monarch) or whether it was intent on creating a new right akin to the right of others written into the Constitution (as the Supreme Court decided in Heller). Some in the United States have preferred the [...] "rights" [...] argument arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need to have arms for self-defence was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> question. Peoples all around the world since time immemorial had armed themselves for the protection of themselves and others, and as organized nations began to appear these arrangements had been extended to the protection of the state. Without a regular army and police force (which in England was not established until 1829), it had been the duty of certain men to keep watch and ward at night and to confront and capture suspicious persons. Every subject had an obligation to protect the king's peace and assist in the suppression of riots.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a planned}} MDC rally in Harare on 22 June was {{prevented}} by ZANU-PF supporters, Tsvangirai announced {{at a press}} conference {{on the same day that}} he was withdrawing from the election due to the violence. He said that his supporters faced being killed if they voted for him and that under such circumstances he could not ask them to do so. According to Tsvangirai, a free and fair election was impossible for eight basic reasons: [...] "state-sponsored violence" [...] ("The police have been reduced to bystanders while Zanu PF militia commit crimes against humanity varying from rape, torture, murder, arson, abductions and other atrocities."); interference with the MDC's campaign, including its inability to hold rallies; the arrests of many members of the MDC, including important figures, thereby disrupting the party's organizational ability to campaign; Electoral Commission [...] "partisanship" [...] (although he said that the Electoral Commission was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> control); media censorship, harassment of journalists, and the exclusion of foreign journalists; Mugabe's attitude and his suggestions that he would not accept defeat; and the existence of [...] "an elaborate and decisive plan by Zanu PF to rig the elections", which included extensive intimidation, obstruction of MDC election agents, and ballot stuffing in the Mashonaland provinces. Tsvangirai said that the MDC would ultimately prevail and that its victory [...] "can only be delayed".|$|E
2500|$|The {{coalition}} was {{buoyed by}} the news that Bavaria, a former French ally, agreed to join the Sixth Coalition according to the Treaty of Ried concluded just before the Battle of Leipzig. This allowed the coalition to threaten the overall military position of the French by moving a 45,000 - 50,000 Austro-Bavarian army, {{under the command of}} Karl Philipp von Wrede, into Napoleon's rear, occupying Würzburg in Franconia. The small French garrison of Würzburg did not try to resist and instead barricaded themselves at the local citadel, allowing the enemy to occupy the town without a fight. From Würzburg, Wrede moved towards the strategic city of Hanau, along one of Napoleon's main retreat routes. Wrede’s advance guard reached Hanau on 28 October and took possession of the city, blocking Napoleon’s route to Frankfurt. Although Wrede probably assumed that {{the main part of the}} French forces was retreating along a more northerly road to Coblenz and thus expected to face a force of only 20,000 men, he did entertain hopes that he would be able to play a major role in the defeat of Napoleon. He also believed that the French army was completely disorganised, which was not true, and was closely followed by the main coalition army, the [...] "Army of Bohemia", which was in reality much further away and <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>in</b> close contact with Napoleon's forces.|$|E
