While the private, <b>non-material</b> <b>loss</b> can hardly be quantified, flooding events cause substantial costs amounting to billions, such as hurricane Katrina in the US (2005) which killed more than 1800 people and caused damage of over 80 billion US$. These numbers clearly emphasize the importance for the development of flood protection and flood management tools. Due to human intervention, like river regulations and land sealing, as well as an increasing dense settlement in flood-prone regions, the need for research in this field is also underlined.|$|E

Protesters demanded that European Union member states end denial policies, {{recognize}} the Armenian Genocide, and subject deniers to criminal liability. The protesters further {{called on the}} European Union to pressure Turkey to recognize the genocide and take action {{to compensate for the}} material and <b>non-material</b> <b>losses</b> and restoration of the historic rights of the Armenian nation.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{financial}} costs of accidents are {{the tip of}} the iceberg when compared to the indirect costs. Notwithstanding the difficulties involved, it is very important to estimate the indirect costs borne by society, and the <b>non-material</b> <b>losses</b> due to pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life undergone by the victim. This study investigates the pain and suffering costs (<b>non-material</b> <b>losses)</b> of the victims of construction accidents in Hong Kong based on relevant High Court personal injury case judgements in the years 1999 - 2003. The 54 non-fatal accident cases and 14 fatal accident cases analysed indicate that the average percentage of compensation awarded for non-material damages (pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life) to that for material damages (loss of earnings, medical and travelling expenses, etc.) during those years is about 30 %. This result enables estimating the pain and suffering costs of the society for a particular year if the total material losses of all construction accidents in that year are known. Based on previous research in which the material losses in Hong Kong were evaluated for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, the corresponding pain and suffering costs could be estimated as 219 million, 150 million and 107 million Hong Kong dollars, respectively (US$ 1. 00  = HK$ 7. 80). Accidents, construction, costs, damages, Hong Kong losses, pain, suffering,...|$|R
40|$|Disaster is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} which {{has become part of}} everyday human life. The amount of material and <b>non-material</b> <b>losses</b> arising from any catastrophic event raises concerns together. Women {{are one of the most}} vulnerable people to disaster. However, women have shown their potential capability to become agents of change if managed purposely. Women Pager Jurang, Sleman, Yogyakarta have done a good adaptation in post-disaster life by developing entrepreneurial skill in selling food products and crafts to increase their income. However, marketing knowledge has become their constraints to make their efforts sustained. This paper aims to describe community service activities in order to improve the capability of women in marketing knowledge. The activity used for community service were included training on marketing, financial capital, and institution, advocacy, and community assistance. The program has shown positive impacts on the marketing capability and networking for women in Pager Jurang...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{of information technology}} today brings a huge impact for the social life of the community, the rapid {{development of}} access between regions led to a very narrow and without being limited by space and time. As {{a result of the}} development of the information technology is not always a positive impact on human life technology users, this development is also accompanied by the development of the crime is known as cybercrime or cyber crime. Crime in cyberspace occur due to the negative impact of technological developments, various modes of crimes that occurred in the virtual world affect to human life in the real world. As the state government 2 ̆ 7 s legal obligation to protect every citizen of the actions that could harm the rights of its citizens, one of which is a crime that happens in the virtual world that often result in material and <b>non-material</b> <b>losses</b> for its users. In addressing these issues the government has enacted Law No. 11 Year 2008 on Information and Electronic Transactions (ITE). With the ITE Law is expected to provide legal protection for people who use the technology and can provide a sense of security for those who use information technology in activities in cyberspace...|$|R
40|$|Flood {{risks are}} {{expected}} to increase in North-western European countries, due to (among others) climate change. Acknowledging that full avoidance of floods is difficult to reach; current flood risk management is directed to give ‘space to the river’ while reducing the probability of harmful flooding {{and the consequences of}} flooding, like tangible (e. g. material losses) and intangible impacts (e. g. <b>non-material</b> <b>losses).</b> The focus of this paper is on intangible impacts. Empirical research has demonstrated that some population groups are more vulnerable towards intangible flood impacts than others, like elderly, ill people, immigrants, single parents, financially deprived people and people living in one-storey houses (Tapsell and Tunstall 2001; Werrity et al. 2007; DEFRA/EA 2003; Cutter et al. 2003; Morrow 1999; Trush et al. 2005). Localization of these people is a prerequisite to develop policy that aims to reduce the intangible impacts. In this paper, the Belgian social flood vulnerability index is developed and applied to five flood prone areas in Flanders. This index enables relative comparison in space and time. Geographical comparison identifies socially vulnerable areas and is carried out {{at the level of the}} river catchments (macro), at the level of the municipalities (meso) and at the level of the districts (micro). The change of social flood vulnerability over time is analyzed by the periodic comparison. Linear regression is used to understand the driving forces of current social flood vulnerability and social flood vulnerability change over time. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{thermodynamic}} performance of three industrial bread production chains: one that generates food waste, one that avoids food waste generation, {{and one that}} reworks food waste to produce new bread. The chemical exergy flows {{were found to be}} much larger than the physical exergy consumed in all the industrial bread chains studied. The par-baked brown bun production chain had the best thermodynamic performance because of the highest rational exergetic efficiency (71. 2 %), the lowest specific exergy losses (5. 4 MJ/kg brown bun), and the almost lowest cumulative exergy losses (4768 MJ/ 1000 kg of dough processed). However, recycling of bread waste is also exergetically efficient when the total fermented surplus is utilizable. Clearly, preventing material losses (i. e. utilizing raw materials maximally) improves the exergetic efficiency of industrial bread chains. In addition, most of the physical (<b>non-material</b> related) exergy <b>losses</b> occurred at the baking, cooling and freezing steps. Consequently, any additional improvement in industrial bread production should focus on the design of thermodynamically efficient baking and cooling processes, and on the use of technologies throughout the chain that consume the lowest possible physical exergy...|$|R
