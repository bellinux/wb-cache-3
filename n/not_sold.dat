In European markets, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.|$|E

A total of 33,487 car ferry flights had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948. As of 1 November, Lympne closed as a public airport, although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried for hire or reward.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{remained}} with their squadrons until 1917 {{when they were}} converted into minelayers, Bellona in May and Boadicea in October, Bellona replacing her sister in the 2nd Battle Squadron that month.

They laid mines at the entrance to the Kattegat on the nights of 18/19 and 24/25 February 1918 and both made several other sorties to lay their mines before the end of the war. They were placed in reserve after the war and taken out of service in 1920. Bellona was quickly sold for scrap in 1921, but Boadicea was <b>not</b> <b>sold</b> until 1926.|$|E
5|$|The writing team {{included}} Nakazawa, {{who wrote}} You's route and the Kid's common route; Nakazawa's assistant Kitaro Sasanari, who wrote Tsugumi and Sora's routes; Nobuaki Umeda; and Uchikoshi, who wrote Coco's route. The writing process for all routes were supervised by Uchikoshi, {{in an effort}} to eliminate inconsistencies in the setting or characters, and plot holes between the different parts of the story. Because he was running out of time at the end, he had to rush the writing of the end of Coco's route, which he described as possibly his only regret with the game. Nakazawa wrote his parts in between his directorial work, such as writing specification documents, supervising the production, and doing quality control work; {{due to the lack of}} time, he ended up having to stay overnight at KID everyday and work through the night, something he said was only possible because of how young he was at the time. Nakazawa described himself as working particularly hard on the game because he felt bitter that Never 7 had <b>not</b> <b>sold</b> particularly well.|$|E
