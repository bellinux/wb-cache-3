500|$|On Folie à Deux, Fall Out Boy {{continued}} its pattern of musical experimentation that {{began on the}} band's previous album, Infinity on High. Singer/guitarist Patrick Stump was once again the primary composer, and attempted to create compositions that echoed the themes discussed in Wentz's lyrics. As the lyrical content shifted in new directions from the group's previous works, the musical style employed by the other band members evolved as well. On this topic, Trohman commented [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> said, 'We want to push the envelope,' It's not that at all. We just wanted to try cooler things. The album still sounds like Fall Out Boy. It has big choruses. But you can't {{do the same thing}} every record." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{temperatures}} reaching 122° on {{the artificial}} turf at Texas Stadium, the Giants played the Dallas Cowboys on September 16. The Giants dominated {{from the outset}} and used backup players heavily throughout the game. Lawrence Taylor batted a Troy Aikman pass high into the air, which he caught and returned for a touchdown. The Giants' defense held the Cowboys to 20 rushing yards and 156yards of total offense, while the Giants' offense gained 369 yards. The Cowboys totaled only nine first downs, averaged 1.8yards per rush and were dominated in time of possession, 41:40 to 18:20. Despite the 28–7 victory, Giants center Bart Oates still felt the offense could improve its play: [...] "e missed a lot of assignments. We rushed the ball O.K., but <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> did against Buffalo in preseason. Phil was pressured some. There were plenty of things we didn't do." ...|$|E
500|$|By September 2015, John Paesano {{had begun}} {{composing}} {{music for the}} season. He felt that the season's new showrunners [...] "were true to {{what we were trying}} to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge" [...] such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that [...] "it’s <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> all of the sudden went into John Williams territory, you know? It’s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." [...] When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he [...] "took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt" [...] and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 15, 2016.|$|E

I think you'll <b>like</b> it. <b>We</b> have yeast to-day, and the {{experiments}} are very jolly," [...] added Johnny, trotting {{off to a}} tall brown tower of rye and Indian bread, where the school was kept.|$|R
2500|$|Al-Ahly {{qualified}} for 2005 FIFA Club World Championship but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: [...] "Our {{problem was that}} we lost our form, for some reason <b>we</b> could <b>not</b> play <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had before arriving in Japan".|$|R
500|$|Similar {{to other}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{the lyrics of}} All Hands on the Bad One feature personal, political, and social themes. The first song, [...] "The Ballad of the Ladyman", is a {{deliberate}} attempt to mock those who misunderstand the band. Tucker said that the song is [...] "almost making fun of how people see us, how people see what you're supposed to be when you're a woman in rock." [...] The song was inspired when the band was invited to the Bowlie Weekender music festival in England in 1999. Tucker explained, [...] "We were all staying in little chalets or whatever and we had our own cabin and we were cabin 216. Someone wrote this message to us that was like, 'Cabin 216 ladymen.' And we were like, 'What?' It {{was meant to be}} a funny thing, but in this other way, it was really this naming of us. It was a subtle way of saying, 'Oh, you're different because you're a woman band and because you're in some ways political.' It's still seen as threatening to people. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had this weekend where we just relaxed with everyone and just hung out." [...] Kat Iudicello, writing for PopMatters, stated that the song [...] "sports sweet harmonies, a slow anger and soft, low bitterness, and driving steady guitars and drums." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August, {{the band}} played at the Skanderborg Festival in Denmark and Parkenfestivalen in Bodø, Norway. In September, the band {{announced}} that they would release The Best of Suede on 1 November 2010. The compilation, put together by Anderson, consisted of singles, album tracks and B-sides. Shortly after the release, Suede made a short European tour from late November into December covering Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. The band concluded the tour on 7 December at the O2 Arena in London. Suede were subsequently asked whether they would produce any new material and Anderson said, [...] "Unless we were all convinced {{it would be an}} amazing record, I think we'd rather just leave it alone. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> have to at the moment, it has to feel special and that's always been our criteria." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{yet there}} was {{something}} about him, something in his atmosphere, so to speak, that I did <b>not</b> <b>like.</b> Before <b>we</b> parted that evening I felt sure that {{in one way or another}} he was a wrong-doer, not straight; also that he had a violent temper.|$|R
3000|$|No, I would <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to move, <b>we</b> {{have been}} here for generations and I was born here. This is my heritage. (Interview # 39) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be too sure. If {{you like}} Madame de Cintre so much, perhaps you will <b>not</b> <b>like</b> me. <b>We</b> are as {{different}} as blue and pink. But you and I have something in common. I have come into this family by marriage; {{you want to come}} into it in the same way." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{returning}} for the series' second season, {{with new}} showrunners Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez (who {{had worked with}} DeKnight on the first season), Paesano felt that the two [...] "really were true to {{what we were trying}} to do" [...] with the first season, but the score still changed to reflect the new elements of season two [...] "that we had to acknowledge. Obviously we have two characters being introduced, we have the Punisher and Elektra, and they both have their own backstories, their own interactions with Matt Murdock, so there are way more branches in this season than there were last season ... we just had to broaden the score to handle some of these different stories." [...] Paesano continued, [...] "even though there are these new stories, it’s still in the same Hell’s Kitchen atmosphere that we’re creating. So there’s definitely differences, but it’s <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> all of the sudden went into John Williams territory ... it’s definitely a very grounded show but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." [...] Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1997 {{the band}} {{released}} their second album, Our Newest Album Ever!. Following {{the success of}} their first album, the band felt that their success had been based at least partially on the third wave of ska in general. According to Scott Kerr [...] "The unfortunate reality is that good songs and good live performances have far less to do with our so-called success than our being a part of the 'flavor-of-the-month'." [...] Five Iron Frenzy sought to distance themselves from the ska scene while maintaining their artistic integrity. Dennis Culp portrayed their goal, stating that [...] "The Police used a lot of ska, but they really weren't referred to as a ska band... they went far beyond ska." [...] For Five Iron, the method of achieving that goal was the creative process. On the first three releases Roper wrote most of the lyrics and Kerr supplied the musical portion. After Kerr left, the band began to explore a wider variety of musical influences, incorporating diverse influences such as Latin and swing music. Roper continued to write the lyrics, a task that he took seriously. He explained to 7ball in 1997 that [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> try to sit down and write wacky songs. I take songwriting pretty seriously... I've been given this podium. I have a responsibility to tell the truth about things." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. March {{pressed her}} hand for answer, and after another little delay, sighed and said, [...] "They are <b>not</b> <b>like</b> us, and <b>we</b> cannot help it. They are more temporizing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you justly remark, Miss Worth," [...] he observed, [...] "this sort {{of thing}} has been done before. We will leave it there for the present. Will you come this way with me, if you please, Captain Granet? I won't trouble you, Miss Worth, or you, Sir Meyville. You might <b>not</b> <b>like</b> what <b>we</b> are going to see." ...|$|R
60|$|MARY. He must hear of my {{good fortune}} from none but me. And, besides, {{you do not}} understand. <b>We</b> are <b>not</b> <b>like</b> other families, <b>we</b> Brodies. We are so clannish, we hold so close together.|$|R
5000|$|Absolutely. Our {{statement}} is bold, but we're {{not here to}} judge anyone. We want to meet people and talk to people. This {{might be the only}} glimpses of love or any kind of hope that they might get that week, so it's an open invitation. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> want you to be whatever we are. We played with Suffokate a few weeks ago, and they were really cool dudes and we had a great show together. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> want to circle around the Christian market, preaching to the choir. That's not what we're about. Gerard Mora ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, {{the band}} {{reformed}} and recorded a new album. Helmkamp {{said of the}} reunion: [...] "It just seems like the planets realigned. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> didn't get along or that there were any bridges to mend." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It will shift, as {{the world}} shifts. Women do love {{watching}} scary films. It’s been proven, and they’ve done all the tests. The demographics are half men, half women. And we know fear. It’s <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> can’t explore the subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{may be your}} friend, Béla," [...] rejoined Elsa gently, [...] "and she {{certainly}} belongs to this village; {{but she is not}} one of us. She is a Jewess, <b>not</b> a Hungarian, <b>like</b> <b>we</b> all are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{eldest son}} is fifteen! I often wish {{that he was}} {{anything}} else but what he is, but <b>we</b> do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to separate. <b>We</b> are all one family, sir, and that makes us bear many things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are just}} a little," [...] he confided, [...] "just a little suspicious, my young friend, you in your little island. Perhaps it is because you live upon an island. You do not expand. You have small thoughts. You are <b>not</b> great <b>like</b> <b>we</b> in Germany, <b>not</b> broad, not deep. But we will talk later of these things. I must tell you about our Kaiser." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{that third}} season of Endeavour {{screened}} on ITV, Evans told the Oxford Mail: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> have a six-year contract, there's none of that. It's day by day, year by year. I think {{this one is}} really good. We'll know when it airs if there's an audience for it and if we feel there's another place to take these characters." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Today {{was a great}} {{race for}} NASCAR and a great race for this track. I know it got spread out some, but there was some really good racing from what I saw. Yes, today we got a huge gift. But I was running fourth or fifth {{at the time the}} last caution, so it's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> totally backed into this thing. And I still had to hold Kevin off." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album is}} darker than {{previous}} Primus efforts, featuring lyrics dealing with murder, suicide, and alienation. The band has commented {{that prior to}} recording, they had been touring for nearly two solid years and were thus in a sombre mood, although in a 2015 interview Claypool described the era surrounding the album as [...] "Good times, happy times. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were reflecting any personal drama or anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|I keep living {{over again}} the lovely times we have had. But I don't think you liked me quite so much towards the end, did you? You did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> me when <b>we</b> left Paris. Why didn't you? ...|$|R
60|$|Pala. That is only, if {{the servant}} {{were not found}} a man of this world; but if, upon trial, <b>we</b> had <b>not</b> <b>liked</b> each other, <b>we</b> had {{certainly}} left loving; and faith, that's the greater happiness of the two.|$|R
60|$|We were {{perfectly}} secured at Bassorah, by having frighted away the rogues, our comrades; {{and we had}} nothing to do but to consider how to convert our treasure into things proper to make us look <b>like</b> merchants, as <b>we</b> were now to be, and <b>not</b> <b>like</b> freebooters, as <b>we</b> really had been.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Futon Critic, Brown notes that what viewers will see is what they really do in real life everyday: [...] "I have a job and my husband has a job so they were just following us around. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had to make anything up or we had to act. It was actually quite easy, to be honest. The kids thoroughly enjoyed it. It was just a very natural thing to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Atkins {{began his}} career in stage plays both on-and-off Broadway, before moving to Los Angeles {{to pursue a career}} in film and television. His first movie role was in The Detective, which starred Frank Sinatra. Talking of his {{experience}} working on his first feature film - and with Sinatra - Atkins says: [...] "It was great! It was intimidating and frightening and scary but Frank was great. He was very easy to work with. He didn't like {{to do a lot of}} takes. But then it's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were doing Shakespeare." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cave later {{declared}} the recording, [...] "a documentary {{of the group}} in utter collapse. The four songs are utterly dissimilar to each other because we all {{knew it was the}} last record and there was no longer any union within the group. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> reached a point where we couldn't get any better. I just think we dissolved mid-climb.Cave claimed there were tensions within the band at the recording sessions. [...] "I knew that I wasn't getting along creatively with Rowland Howard, but we were still friends. There were different conflicts but it's kind of hard to put my finger on what they were now," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The dry {{earth is}} lowing like a cow for the rain, and I--I am afraid. It was <b>not</b> <b>like</b> this when <b>we</b> counted the stars. But thou lovest {{me as much}} as before, though a bond is taken away? Answer!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend Dickon," [...] resumed Lawless, {{addressing}} his commander, [...] "ye {{have certain}} matters on hand, unless I err? Well, prithee be about them incontinently. For here I {{be with the}} choice of all good company, two tough old shipmen; and till that ye return I will go warrant these brave fellows will bide here and drink me cup for cup. <b>We</b> are <b>not</b> <b>like</b> shore-men, <b>we</b> old tough tarry-Johns!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't," [...] he admitted. [...] "I haven't bothered about girls; I haven't had time. They {{expect you}} to tell them they're pretty, to send them things, to josh and make them laugh, and {{now and then to}} quarrel about nothing. Rather a bore when you'd sooner be quiet; but you're <b>not</b> <b>like</b> that. <b>We</b> have been pals, and now I wish you were going out with me." ...|$|R
