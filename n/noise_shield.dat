The question is how, and to what extent, this <b>noise</b> <b>shield</b> will affect the pool shape and size of an instantaneous release of a flammable liquid, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

To assess the influence of a <b>noise</b> <b>shield,</b> a full scale test was conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline.

The question is to what extent this <b>noise</b> <b>shield</b> hinders the cooling of a rail tanker, carrying flammable liquid such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) ? To answer this question, a full scale testwas conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline [N. Rosmuller, D. W. G. Arentsen, (2005). Praktijkproeven Betuweroute: Instantane uitstroming en koeling 24 juni 2005, Nibra, Arnhem, The Netherlands]. Two railcars and a rail tanker were placed behind a 3 m high <b>noise</b> <b>shield.</b> First, it was tested as to whether firemen or water canons should be used to deliver the water. Water canons were best next, four positions of the water canons to wet the rail tanker were tested. Three camera’s and three observers recorded the locations and the extent of water that hit the rail tanker. The results indicate that the <b>noise</b> <b>shield,</b> to a large extent, prevents thewater fromhitting, and therefore cooling, the rail tanker. The upper parts of the rail tanker were minimally struck by the water canons and the small amount of water flowing down the rail tanker did not reach the lower parts of it because of the armatures at the rail tanker. Also, the amount of water in the ditches to be used for wetting was too small. The ditch nearby ran empty. These insights are both relevant to emergency responders for disaster abatement purposes and towater management organizations. The Ministry of Transport is examining the possible strategies to deal with these findings. The results are based upon one single full scale test near a 3 m high <b>noise</b> <b>shield.</b> In addition, it would be valuable to determine what the influence would be of other heights of the <b>noise</b> <b>shield...</b>|$|E

Most research on <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> is focused on BlendedWing Body (BWB) configurations because of the large dimension of the fuselage.

In this work two methods are used to calculate <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> and compared in terms of accuracy and computational time, the Diffraction Integral Method (DIM) and a method built on the Modified Theory of the Physical Optics (MTPO). Both methods are based on the Kirchhoff integral and are considered accurate for sharp-edged objects.

Since airports tend to be located close to or inside cities, an increasing amount of people suffer from aircraft noise pollution. More silent aircraft are needed to be able to reduce this noise pollution. One {{way to do this is}} through blocking the engine noise propagation with elements of the aircraft itself such as the wings. This method is called aircraft engine <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> To be able to shield the aircraft engine noise efficiently, a <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> assessment tool is required. In this thesis project, such a tool is developed for conventional tube with wing aircraft. This tool needs to have low computational cost while the accuracy should be sufficient for the preliminary design. To create a fast and accurate noise prediction tool, the aircraft's fuselage is modelled as a cylinder and the wings as planar surfaces. The engine is represented by a monopole sound source. The most suitable <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> calculation methods are found to be the barrier shielding method for the wings and the analytic solution of a cylinder for the fuselage. The <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> assessment tool is validated against results obtained with the Kirchhoff theory of diffraction. The <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> prediction tool developed in this thesis project has shown to be able to determine the noise attenuation by a point source of different aircraft configurations with low computational cost.

The {{distance from the}} tip of each electrode to its dedicated amplifier is kept short at ~  10  cm, amplifiers are mounted inside the metal electrode casings, and those metal casings cover the entire region near the heart to act as <b>noise</b> <b>shielding.</b> Further, since electrodes are pushed into the interior of the housings with body contact, metal casings are drawn closer to the body-surface to increase <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> during measurement.

Accordingly, <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> is sufficient to measure body-surface potential under normal (low radiation) conditions.

40|$|Many {{configurations}} {{proposed for}} the next generation of aircraft rely on the wing or other aircraft surfaces to shield the engine noise from the observers on the ground. However, the ability to predict the shielding effect and any new noise sources that arise from the high-speed jet flow interacting with a hard surface is currently limited. Furthermore, quality experimental data from jets with surfaces nearby suitable for developing and validating noise prediction methods are usually tied to a particular vehicle concept and, therefore, very complicated. The Jet/Surface Interaction Test was intended to supply a high quality set of data covering a wide range of surface geometries and positions and jet flows to researchers developing aircraft noise prediction tools. During phase one, the goal was to measure the noise of a jet near a simple planar surface while varying the surface length and location in order to: (1) validate noise prediction schemes when the surface is acting only as a jet <b>noise</b> <b>shield</b> and when the jet/surface interaction is creating additional noise, and (2) determine regions of interest for more detailed tests in phase two.
