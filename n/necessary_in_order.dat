5|$|Since eliminative materialism {{claims that}} future {{research}} {{will fail to}} find a neuronal basis for various mental phenomena, it must necessarily wait for science to progress further. One might question the position on these grounds, but other philosophers like Churchland argue that eliminativism is often <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to open the minds of thinkers to new evidence and better explanations.|$|E
5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E

Periodic clearing is <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to halt the deteriorating effects of invasive root growth. The trail and ruins, which are located in a protected watershed, are officially off-limits to the public, although state DLNR officials do not regularly monitor the site.

5|$|People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone surgery becomes <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When <b>necessary,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Ramsey was {{approached}} by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but {{the intervention of the}} Project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of the nuclear weapons being built by the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about the matter was divided with many Australians opposed to the issue on moral grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the matter was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined {{with members of the}} opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the wild population at Chittenango Falls State Park, efforts to establish captive populations began in 1990. A captive Novisuccinea chittenangoensis colony was being maintained at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York, however, the last remaining snails died in November 2002. Other unsuccessful breeding programs were tried in the 1990s: at ESF at Syracuse; at the Wildlife Conservation Park/Bronx Zoo; an early effort at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo (then called the Burnet Park Zoo); at the Seneca Park Zoo (Rochester, New York); and at the Buffalo Zoo. Further experiments are <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to determine what the proper conditions are for maintaining a healthy captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{efforts in}} 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers {{to raise the}} warship's {{propeller}} were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off Cape Hatteras. Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons {{as well as the}} inability to bring up the wreck intact, NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship, namely her engine, propeller, guns, and turret. It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years. The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $14.5 million. The Navy divers, mainly from its two Mobile Diving and Salvage Units, would perform the bulk of the work <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to train in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment.|$|E

5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{previous}} installments of the series, the two games follow {{the journey of}} a young Pokémon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train Pokémon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduced 157 new Pokémon to the franchise, 6 more than the previous record holder Red and Blue, {{as well as many}} new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pokémon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pokémon between both of the games is <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to complete the games' Pokédex.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were <b>necessary,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded.|$|E

5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the bailout is <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to assure {{the stability of the}} European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout, with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if the bailout fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that {{they had decided to}} terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined that a number of upgrades would be <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450–680million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing.|$|E
5|$|The current club {{ownership}} {{have stated}} that a larger stadium is <b>necessary</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United. Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter the ground via the Fulham Road exits, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations. The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home, but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks. In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders. In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, {{with a view to}} developing the site into a new stadium, but lost out to a Malaysian consortium. The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium.|$|E
