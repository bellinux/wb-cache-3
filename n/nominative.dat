5|$|The 3rd person {{singular}} and plural <b>nominative</b> forms, ngonggega and bogo, {{are labeled}} 'rare' {{because they are}} gradually becoming disused. Speakers prefer to use non-personal pronouns such as gayh- 'that' or gayh-gorden 'those'. Moreover, since the person and number of the subject is contained in the prefix of the verb, <b>nominative</b> free pronouns are often dropped.|$|E
5|$|Quenya nouns are {{declined}} for case. Parmaquesta Quenya has ten cases. These {{include the}} four primary cases: <b>nominative,</b> accusative, genitive, and instrumental; three adverbial cases: allative (of which the dative is a shortened form), locative (also with a shortened form), and ablative; and a possessive or adjectival case. The accusative was however only used for Parmaquesta {{and had been}} replaced by <b>nominative</b> in late colloquial Quenya.|$|E
5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: <b>nominative</b> (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the <b>nominative</b> if it is unspecific. In {{addition}} to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the <b>nominative</b> that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E

5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English <b>nominative</b> case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them <b>nominative</b> and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories. This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the <b>nominative</b> case.|$|E
5|$|New Scientist {{coined the}} term <b>nominative</b> contradeterminism for people who move away from their name, {{creating}} a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Portland Chief of Police Danielle Outlaw, Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine, would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently {{changed his name to}} Jirgensohn, and the Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Sin. The synonym inaptronym is also sometimes used.|$|E

5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for <b>nominative</b> determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, one Lieutenant Mike Kafka; authors of the book The Imperial Animal Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox; and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with <b>nominative</b> case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E

5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant <b>nominative,</b> there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (<b>nominative),</b> /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases <b>nominative</b> and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E
50|$|The Greek {{article is}} often {{translated}} the, {{which is the}} English definite article, but it can {{have a range of}} meanings that can be quite different from those found in English, and require context to interpret. Ancient Greek does not have an indefinite article like the English word a, and <b>nominatives</b> without articles also have a range of meanings that require context to interpret.|$|R

5000|$|The {{formulations}} [...] "over the subject" [...] and [...] "over the object" [...] {{indicate that}} the predicative expression is expressing a property that is assigned to the subject or to the object. For example, the predicative expression a thief in the last sentence serves to assign to Jill the property of being a thief. Predicative nominals over subjects are also called predicate <b>nominatives,</b> a term borrowed from Latin grammars and indicating the morphological case that such expressions bear (in Latin).|$|R
5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} <b>nominative</b> determinism is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for <b>nominative</b> determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

25|$|Words {{with a final}} r in {{the word}} stem, such as vetr, do not add another -r, as the sounds are already the same. The effect of the {{dropping}} usually results in the lack of distinction between some forms of the noun. In the case of vetr the dropping renders the <b>nominative</b> and accusative singular and plural identical; the <b>nominative</b> singular and <b>nominative</b> and accusative plural {{would otherwise have been}} *vetrr (*vintrʀ), while the accusative singular would still have been vetr. This is because the 3rd strong masculine declension, to which it belongs, marks the <b>nominative</b> singular and <b>nominative</b> and accusative plural, but not the accusative singular, with inflectional ʀs.|$|E

50|$|Ryukyuan {{languages}} are generally SOV, dependent-marking, modifier-head, nominative-accusative languages, like the Japanese language. Adjectives are generally bound morphemes, occurring either with noun compounding or using verbalization. Many Ryukyuan languages mark both <b>nominatives</b> and genitives {{with the same}} marker. This marker has the unusual feature of changing form depending on an animacy hierarchy. The Ryukyuan languages have topic and focus markers, which may take different forms depending on the sentential context. Ryukyuan also preserves a special verbal inflection for clauses with focus markers—this unusual feature was also found in Old Japanese, but lost in Modern Japanese.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{sentence}} {{is composed of}} a subject and a predicate and every {{sentence is}} a full speech or thought in words.

5000|$|Since {{there is}} copula in Hidatsa, all adjectives, adverbs, and nouns {{that are used}} as predicates of nouns are {{regarded}} as intransitive verbs. They do not undergo a change of form to denote different modes and tenses. They make take the incorporated pronouns 'mi' and 'di' for their <b>nominatives,</b> which are prefixed. Verbs beginning with consonants are usually prefixed in full: 'liié' ("old, to be old") and 'liie' ("he, she, or it is or was old" [...] or [...] "you are or were old"). Before verbs beginning with vowels, the pronouns are often contracted.|$|R
2500|$|Chinese {{differs from}} English in {{distinguishing}} between names of things, which can stand as predicate <b>nominatives,</b> and names of characteristics. Names of characteristics (e.g., green) cannot follow linking verbs. There {{is not an}} equivalent to the English predicate adjective. Instead, abstract characterizations such as [...] "green", [...] "angry", [...] "hot", etc., stand as complete predicates in their own right. For example, 我不累。Wǒ bú lèi. A word-for-word version in English might be [...] "I not tired." [...] Another common phrase, 你好 (nǐ hăo), demonstrates this feature.

40|$|This paper {{claims that}} case is vP-internally interpretable and that high NP-movement {{is driven by}} (minimally) two other ‘forces’: Person {{checking}} in a position higher than Tense, and EPP (Fin) checking in a still higher position, ‘Spec,IP’. This is evidenced by ´low’ <b>nominatives,</b> quirky agreement, Stylistic Fronting and expletive-distribution. Another central claim of the paper is that grammar interprets event features in relation to speech features. In particular, Person drives NP-movement because it computes event participants (cased θ-roles) in relation to speech participants, much as Tense links event time to speech time. As evidenced by both tense interpretation and pronoun interpretation, the finite clause is a Speech Phrase, SP, containing syntactic speech features...|$|R
