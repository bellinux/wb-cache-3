25|$|A <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> was {{an early}} type of {{birefringent}} polarizer, that consists of a crystal of calcite which has been split and rejoined with Canada balsam. The crystal is cut such that the o- and e-rays are in orthogonal linear polarization states. Total internal reflection of the o-ray occurs at the balsam interface, since it experiences a larger refractive index in calcite than in the balsam, and the ray is deflected {{to the side of}} the crystal. The e-ray, which sees a smaller refractive index in the calcite, is transmitted through the interface without deflection. Nicol prisms produce a very high purity of polarized light, and were extensively used in microscopy, though in modern use they have been mostly replaced with alternatives such as the Glan–Thompson prism, Glan–Foucault prism, and Glan–Taylor prism. These prisms are not true polarizing beamsplitters since only the transmitted beam is fully polarized.|$|E

50|$|William Nicol FRSE (18 April 1770 - 2 September 1851) was a Scottish {{geologist}} and physicist {{who invented}} the <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism,</b> the first device for obtaining plane-polarized light, in 1828.|$|E
50|$|It is monoclinic m {{with space}} group Cc, but {{crystals}} are pseudotetragonal. Scolecite, like natrolite and mesolite, usually occurs as acicular (needle-like) and fibrous aggregations. It has {{nearly the same}} angles between the crystal faces as does natrolite, but natrolite is orthorhombic and scolecite is monoclinic. The etched figures (figures that arise from the action of a solvent on a crystal face, and indicate its true symmetry) and the pyroelectric character of scolecite show that it crystallizes with a plane of symmetry, but no axis of symmetry, {{that is to say}} it belongs to the hemihedral class of the monoclinic system. Scolecite can therefore be distinguished from natrolite by an optical examination, since the acicular crystals do not extinguish parallel to their length between crossed <b>nicol</b> <b>prisms.</b> Twinning on the ortho-pinacoid is usually evident.|$|R
40|$|An optical {{investigation}} of the high-temp. structural transitions in gel-grown single crystals of KClO_ 4, RbClO_ 4 and CsClO_ 4 is reported. These crystals undergo transitions from the room-temp. Pnma phase to a cubic Fm 3 m phase at T_c values of 306 ^ 0 C, 281 ^ 0 C, and 222 ^ 0 C, respectively. The birefringence Δ n falls abruptly to zero at T_c, as is expected in a 1 st-order transition. The phase transition was also studied by measuring the intensity of light transmitted by the sample placed between crossed <b>Nicol</b> <b>prisms.</b> The results do not suggest the coexistence of phases above T_c. Microscopy examination of the samples at transition reveals that on cooling from the high-temp. phase the crystals {{have a tendency to}} form multidomains, with differing orientations, in the orthorhombic phase. This suggests that the phase transition is ferroelastic of m 3 mFmmm type and also explains the mismatch between the results of the heating and cooling runs...|$|R
40|$|Isolated wet {{and dried}} sulfur globules, {{obtained}} by osmotic lysis of lysozyme-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid prepared spheroplasts of Chromatium okenii, C. weissei, and C. warmingii, were studied by polarizing microscopy and X-ray diffraction. When viewed through crossed <b>Nicol</b> <b>prisms,</b> the sulfur globules, {{whether in the}} cell or isolated in a pure, wet state, had a characteristic maltese cross appearance. The observation that rotation of the mount did not change {{the orientation of the}} arms suggested a symmetrical radial arrangement of the birefringent units. X-ray diffraction patterns of freshly isolated, wet sulfur globules gave two broad and diffuse diffraction rings with maxima at 0. 36 and 0. 52 nm. This pattern closely resembled the diffraction pattern of liquid sulfur. When allowed to stand in the wet state, the sulfur globules eventually converted into crystalline orthorhombic sulfur after passing through an unstable crystalline phase not previously described by X-ray diffraction. Vacuum drying of the sulfur globules accelerated the change into crystalline orthorhombic sulfur...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} Canada balsam {{is in the}} construction of the <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism.</b> A <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> consists of a calcite crystal cut into two halves. Canada balsam is placed between the two layers. Calcite is an anisotropic crystal and has different refractive indices for rays polarized along directions parallel and perpendicular to its optic axis. These rays with differing refractive indices are known as the ordinary and extraordinary rays. The refractive index for Canada balsam is in between the refractive index for the ordinary and extraordinary rays. Hence the ordinary ray will be totally internally reflected. The emergent ray will be linearly polarized, and traditionally this has been one of the popular ways of producing polarized light.|$|E
50|$|Certain optical components, {{such as a}} Wollaston prism or <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism,</b> {{are made}} of {{multiple}} transparent pieces that are directly attached to each other. The adhesive is usually index-matched to the pieces. Historically, Canada balsam {{was used in this}} application, but it is now more common to use epoxy or other synthetic adhesives.|$|E
50|$|Petrography as {{a science}} began in 1828 when Scottish {{physicist}} William Nicol invented the technique for producing polarized light by cutting a crystal of Iceland spar, a variety of calcite, into a special prism which {{became known as the}} <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism.</b> The addition of two such prisms to the ordinary microscope converted the instrument into a polarizing, or petrographic microscope. Using transmitted light and Nicol prisms, it was possible to determine the internal crystallographic character of very tiny mineral grains, greatly advancing the knowledge of a rock's constituents.|$|E
50|$|The {{polarimeter}} {{is made up}} of two <b>Nicol</b> <b>prisms</b> (the polarizer and analyzer). The polarizer {{is fixed}} and the analyzer can be rotated. The prisms may be thought of as slits S1 and S2. The light waves may be considered to correspond to waves in the string. The polarizer S1 allows only those light waves which move in a single plane. This causes the light to become plane polarized. When the analyzer is also placed in a similar position it allows the light waves coming from the polarizer to pass through it. When it is rotated through the right angle no waves can pass through the right angle and the field appears to be dark. If now a glass tube containing an optically active solution is placed between the polarizer and analyzer the light now rotates through the plane of polarization through a certain angle, the analyzer will have to be rotated in same angle.|$|R
5000|$|The two <b>Nicol</b> <b>prisms</b> (occasionally {{referred}} to as nichols) of the petrographic microscope have their polarizing planes oriented perpendicular to one another. When only an isotropic material such as air, water, or glass exists between the filters, all light is blocked, but most crystalline materials and minerals change the polarizing light directions, allowing some of the altered light {{to pass through the}} analyzer to the viewer. Using one polarizer makes it possible to view the slide in plane polarized light; using two allows for analysis under cross polarized light. A particular light pattern on the upper lens surface of the objectives is created as a conoscopic interference pattern (or interference figure) characteristic of uniaxial and biaxial minerals, and produced with convergent polarized light. To observe the interference figure, true petrographic microscopes usually include an accessory called a Bertrand lens, which focuses and enlarges the figure. It is also possible to remove an eyepiece lens to make a direct observation of the objective lens surface.|$|R
5000|$|Polarized 3-D {{projection}} {{was demonstrated}} experimentally in the 1890s. The projectors used <b>Nicol</b> <b>Prisms</b> for polarization. Packs of thin glass sheets, angled {{so as to}} reflect away light of the unwanted polarity, served as the viewing filters. Polarized 3-D glasses only became practical after the invention of Polaroid plastic sheet polarizers by Edwin Land, who was privately demonstrating their use for projecting and viewing 3-D images in 1934. They were first used to show a 3-D movie {{to the general public}} at [...] "Polaroid on Parade", a New York Museum of Science and Industry exhibit that opened in December 1936. 16 mm Kodachrome color film was used. Details about the glasses are not available. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a short polarized 3-D film was shown at the Chrysler Motors pavilion and seen by thousands of visitors daily. The hand-held cardboard viewers, a free souvenir, were die-cut {{in the shape of a}} 1939 Plymouth seen head-on. Their Polaroid filters, stapled over rectangular openings where the headlights ought to be, were very small.|$|R

In association with the names of geologists grouped in this area, named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1971 after William Nicol (1770-1851), Scottish natural philosopher who devised the <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> and the preparation of thin rock sections, thus contributing to the techniques of microscopy.|$|E
50|$|In 1896 another International Meteorological Conference was held, and in {{conjunction}} with it was published the first International Cloud Atlas. It was a political and technical triumph, and an immediate de facto standard. The scientific photography of clouds required several technical advances, including faster films (shorter exposures), color, and sufficient contrast between cloud and sky. It was Albert Riggenbach who worked out how to increase the contrast by using a <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> to filter polarized light. Others learned to achieve similar results using mirrors or lake surfaces, and selectively photographing {{in certain parts of}} the sky.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{polarimeter}} {{to measure}} this rotation {{consists of a}} long tube with flat glass ends, into which the sample is placed. At {{each end of the}} tube is a <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> or other polarizer. Light is shone through the tube, and the prism at the other end, attached to an eye-piece, is rotated to arrive at the region of complete brightness or that of half-dark, half-bright or that of complete darkness. The angle of rotation is then read from a scale. The same phenomenon is observed after an angle of 180°. The specific rotation of the sample may then be calculated. Temperature can affect the rotation of light, which should be accounted for in the calculations.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Rayleigh (1902) {{interpreted}} this contraction as {{a mechanical}} compression which {{should lead to}} optical anisotropy of materials, so the different refraction indices would cause birefringence. To measure this effect, he installed a tube of 76 cm length upon a rotatable table. The tube was closed by glass at its ends, and was filled with carbon bisulphide or water, and the liquid was between two <b>nicol</b> <b>prisms.</b> Through the liquid, light (produced by an electric lamp and more importantly by limelight) was sent to and fro. The experiment was sufficiently precise to measure retardations of [...] of a half wavelength, i.e. of the order [...] Depending on the direction relative to Earth's motion, the expected retardation due to birefringence was of order 10−8, which was well within {{the accuracy of the}} experiment. Therefore, it was, besides the Michelson-Morley experiment and the Trouton-Noble experiment, one of the few experiments by which magnitudes of second order in v/c could be detected. However, the result was completely negative. Rayleigh repeated the experiments with layers of glass plates (although with a diminished precision by a factor of 100), and again obtained a negative result.|$|R
50|$|Referring to Fig. 1, key optical {{components}} were mounted within vacuum chamber V on a fused quartz base of extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion. A water jacket W kept the temperature regulated to within 0.001 °C. Monochromatic green {{light from a}} mercury source Hg passed through a <b>Nicol</b> polarizing <b>prism</b> N before entering the vacuum chamber, and was split by a beam splitter B set at Brewster's angle to prevent unwanted rear surface reflections. The two beams were directed towards two mirrors M1 and M2 which were set at distances as divergent as possible given the coherence length of the 5461 Å mercury line (≈32 cm, allowing a difference in arm length ΔL ≈ 16 cm). The reflected beams recombined to form circular interference fringes which were photographed at P. A slit S allowed multiple exposures across {{the diameter of the}} rings to be recorded on a single photographic plate at different times of day.|$|R
50|$|A Glan-Thompson prism {{is a type}} of {{polarizing}} prism {{similar to}} the <b>Nicol</b> and Glan-Foucault <b>prisms.</b> It consists of two right-angled calcite prisms that are cemented together by their long faces. The optical axes of the calcite crystals are parallel and aligned perpendicular to the plane of reflection. Birefringence splits light entering the prism into two rays, experiencing different refractive indices; the p-polarized ordinary ray is totally internally reflected from the calcite-cement interface, leaving the s-polarized extraordinary ray to be transmitted. The prism can therefore be used as a polarizing beam splitter. Traditionally Canada balsam was used as the cement in assembling these prisms, but this has largely been replaced by synthetic polymers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> {{is a type}} of polarizer, {{an optical}} device used to produce a {{polarized}} beam of light. It is made {{in such a way that}} it eliminates one of the rays by total internal reflection, i.e the ordinary ray is eliminated and only the extraordinary ray is transmitted through the prism. It was the first type of polarizing prism, invented in 1828 by William Nicol (1770-1851) of Edinburgh. It consists of a rhombohedral crystal of Iceland spar (a variety of calcite) that has been cut at an angle of 68° with respect to the crystal axis, cut again diagonally, and then rejoined as shown, using a layer of transparent Canada balsam as a glue.|$|E
50|$|William Nicol, {{whose name}} is {{associated}} with the creation of the <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism,</b> seems to have been the first to prepare thin slices of mineral substances, and his methods were applied by Henry Thronton Maire Witham (1831) to the study of plant petrifactions. This method, of such far-reaching importance in petrology, was not at once made use of for the systematic investigation of rocks, and it was not until 1858 that Henry Clifton Sorby pointed out its value. Meanwhile, the optical study of sections of crystals had been advanced by Sir David Brewster and other physicists and mineralogists and it only remained to apply their methods to the minerals visible in rock sections.|$|E
50|$|In {{ordinary}} light, {{the vibrations}} occur in all planes {{perpendicular to the}} direction of propagation. When light passes through a <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> its vibrations in all directions except the direction of axis of the prism are cut off. The light emerging from the prism {{is said to be}} plane polarised because its vibration is in one direction. If two Nicol prisms are placed with their polarization planes parallel to each other, then the light rays emerging out of the first prism will enter the second prism. As a result, no loss of light is observed. However, if the second prism is rotated by an angle of 90°, the light emerging from the first prism is stopped by the second prism and no light emerges. The first prism is usually called the polarizer and the second prism is called the analyser.|$|E
25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a <b>Nicol</b> (double-image) <b>prism</b> for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|R

50|$|When {{dealing with}} {{unfamiliar}} types or with rocks so fine grained that their component minerals cannot be determined {{with the aid}} of a hand lens, a microscope is used. Characteristics observed under the microscope include colour, colour variation under plane polarised light (pleochroism, produced by the lower <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism,</b> or more recently polarising films), fracture characteristics of the grains, refractive index (in comparison to the mounting adhesive, typically Canada Balsam), and optical symmetry (birefringent or isotropic). In toto, these characteristics are sufficient to identify the mineral, and often to quite tightly estimate its major element composition.The process of identifying minerals under the microscope is fairly subtle, but also mechanistic - it would be possible to develop an identification key that would allow a computer to do it. The more difficult and skilful part of optical petrography is identifying the interrelationships between grains and relating them to features seen in hand specimen, at outcrop, or in mapping.|$|E
50|$|When plane-polarised light {{passes through}} some crystals, the {{velocity}} of left-polarised light {{is different from that}} of the right-polarised light thus the crystals are said to have two refractive indices i.e. double refractingConstruction: It consists of a monochromatic source S which is placed at focal point of a convex lens L. Just after the convex lens there is a <b>Nicol</b> <b>Prism</b> P which acts as a polariser. H is a half shade device which divides the field of polarised light emerging out of the Nicol P into two halves generally of unequal brightness. T is a glass tube in which optically active solution is filled. The light after passing through T is allowed to fall on the analyzing Nicol A which can be rotated about the axis of the tube. The rotation of analyser can be measured with the help of a scale C. Laurent’s half-shade polarimeter is shown in Figure 6.22.|$|E
50|$|Frankenheim's {{focus of}} {{research}} was crystallography, particularly studies of crystal {{structure and the}} mathematical and theoretical basis of the symmetry of crystals. By 1826, he was already using the integer reciprocals of Weiss' coefficients (the intersection of a plane with the three crystallographic axes) to describe the spatial positions of crystal surfaces, from which the British crystallographer William Hallowes Miller (1801-1880) developed the concept of Miller indices in 1839. By assigning symmetry elements to the crystal systems defined previously by Weiss and Friedrich Mohs (1773-1839), Frankenheim was able, for the first time, to define 32 point groups (crystal classes) and to classify them into four crystal systems (the regular one, the fourfold, the twofold and the sixfold). From his observations he derived 15 lattice types for crystals, which were later reduced by Auguste Bravais (1811-1863) to 14 and today as Bravais lattices describe unit cells of crystal structures. Frankenheim conducted {{one of the first}} microscopic examinations of crystals in polarized light, using the then-new <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism</b> as a polarizer.|$|E
5000|$|Nicholas Steno first {{observed}} {{the law of}} constancy of interfacial angles (also known as the first law of crystallography) in quartz crystals in 1669. This was later generalized and established experimentally by Jean-Baptiste L. Romé de l'Islee in 1783. René Just Haüy, the [...] "father of modern crystallography", showed that crystals are periodic and established that the orientations of crystal faces can be {{expressed in terms of}} rational numbers, as later encoded in the Miller indices. In 1814, Jöns Jacob Berzelius introduced a classification of minerals based on their chemistry rather than their crystal structure. William Nicol developed the <b>Nicol</b> <b>prism,</b> which polarizes light, in 1827 - 1828 while studying fossilized wood; Henry Clifton Sorby showed that thin sections of minerals could be identified by their optical properties using a polarizing microscope. James D. Dana published his first edition of A System of Mineralogy in 1837, and in a later edition introduced a chemical classification that is still the standard. X-ray diffraction was demonstrated by Max von Laue in 1912, and developed into a tool for analyzing the crystal structure of minerals by the father/son team of William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg.|$|E
