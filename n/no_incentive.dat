5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were {{repeated}} by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} workhouse labour was never clear {{according}} to historian M. A. Crowther. In {{the early days}} of workhouses it was either a punishment or a source of income for the parish, but during the 19thcentury the idea of work as punishment became increasingly unfashionable. The idea took hold that work should rehabilitate the workhouse inmates for their eventual independence, and that it should therefore be rewarded with no more than the workers' maintenance, otherwise there would be <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> for them to seek work elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackgroundPatent expiries on leading {{biologics}} {{are creating}} new {{momentum in the}} market for biosimilars (copies of off-patent biologics), paving the way for their development. However, {{little is known about the}} factors influencing the competition between biosimilars and their reference products (REF). ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to analyse key global erythropoietin (EPO) markets and factors affecting biosimilar EPO (BIOSIM-EPO) uptakes, and to identify countries where BIOSIM-EPOs have gained significant market shares. MethodsInclusion criteria for countries in the study were a biosimilar regulatory framework similar to the EU framework, and biological market value higher than US$ 2. 5 billion. Factors evaluated included EPO market size, EPO retail/hospital distribution mix, national incentives to use biosimilars and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences. IMS Health provided EPO consumption in volumes, values, and EPO ex-manufacturer prices from 2007 to 2012. ResultsJapan: large-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, <b>no</b> <b>incentives,</b> low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (6. 8 % in 2012). France: large-sized market, dominant retail distribution, <b>no</b> <b>incentives,</b> low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (5. 8 %). Spain and Italy: medium-sized market, dominant hospital distribution, <b>no</b> <b>incentives,</b> moderate BIOSIM-EPO uptakes (11. 5 and 8. 6 %). Germany: small-sized market, dominant retail distribution, presence of incentives, high BIOSIM-EPO uptake (30. 4 %). UK: small-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, <b>no</b> <b>incentives,</b> low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (2. 0 %). BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences play no role at a global level (− 10. 8 % in Germany and − 26. 9 % in Japan). ConclusionsEPO markets have proven to be highly country-specific. EPO market sizes, EPO retail/hospital distribution mixes and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences may not be determining factors of BIOSIM-EPO uptakes. Prescription and substitution incentives to use BIOSIM-EPO appear to be determining factors in Germany. The heterogeneity of national EPO markets makes it impossible to outline country profile types with significant BIOSIM-EPO penetrations...|$|R

5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, so there was <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do {{in an attempt to}} make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders' {{march through}} Anatolia was {{thereafter}} unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything {{he left behind}} in his army's flight. It {{was the middle of}} summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died. Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the Cilician Gates, Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the Euphrates; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by Thoros of Edessa, a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his Greek Orthodox religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated. Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the County of Edessa, the first of the crusader states.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that under sales tax, the seller has <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to disbelieve a purchaser who says {{it is not a}} final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive to deduct input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding an invoice quoting the VAT paid on the purchase, and indicating the VAT registration number of the supplier.|$|E

40|$|Prepaid {{monetary}} incentives consistently exert {{the largest}} {{positive effect on}} response rates in mail sur-veys. For web-based surveys, {{it has not been}} possible to administer monetary incentives via the Internet in advance.

Does this really have the same positive effect on response rates as shown in traditional mail surveys? The authors investigated this question experimentally {{in the context of a}} web-based sur-vey among members of a professional association in Virginia. The results indicate that prepaid incen-tives in web surveys seem to have no advantages concerning the willingness to participate, actual com-pletion rates, and the share of incomplete response patterns when compared with postpaid incentives. Furthermore, postpaid <b>incentives</b> show <b>no</b> advantages over <b>no</b> <b>incentives.</b> Finally, compared to <b>no</b> <b>incentives,</b> prize draws increase completion rates and also reduce various incomplete participation patterns...|$|R

25|$|Advocates of neo-liberal {{economics}} {{argue that}} while import substitution policies might create {{jobs in the}} short run, as domestic producers replace foreign producers, neoliberal theory believes {{that in the long}} run output and growth will be lower than it would otherwise have been. This is because import substitution denies the country the benefits to be gained from specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency: Domestic producers have <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, it {{was argued}} by Chiam See Tong, the Leader of the Opposition, that since Singapore {{practices}} representative democracy, NMPs are useless {{to the people}} as, being unelected, they have <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to present their views to Parliament. In other words, one should not enjoy the privilege of representing views without bearing the responsibility of serving those whom one represents. The Opposition perceived the scheme as a plan {{to make it look}} unnecessary. A similar point has been made by an academic, Chua Beng Huat, who has argued that the NMP scheme co-opts more moderate dissenting voices and is thus an attempt to de-legitimize the need for more aggressive opposition.|$|E
25|$|The Province of Carolina was {{the first}} {{attempted}} English settlement south of Virginia. It was a private venture, financed {{by a group of}} English Lords Proprietors who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir John Colleton. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became Charleston, originally Charles Town for Charles II of England.|$|E

25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the problem}} of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to {{resources}} leads to <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve lose out compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of over-exploitation is not helped {{by the fact that the}} efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant that stocks were put under more pressure. All these factors contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} boom {{spurred on by}} the California Gold Rush that had brought on {{the era of the}} clipper ships had turned to bust. All the secrets of building lofty clippers had been discovered and there were too many of them in existence. The dropping freight rates now gave <b>no</b> <b>incentive</b> to build any more. The San Francisco market was so saturated that many a disgusted ship captain dumped unwanted cargo overboard in the bay before sailing on to other ports. The diary of Robert Underhill, which recorded his 1856 travels on the Sweepstakes, revealed that Westervelt was also traveling on this voyage to San Francisco and the Orient. Underhill's entries made clear that Westervelt recognized the economic situation facing the port of New York and was seeking other possible venues for the family business.|$|E
