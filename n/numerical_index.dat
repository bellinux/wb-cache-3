There can {{be highly}} resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated coral reefs.” Ecological resilience is a “capacity” that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered {{and how they are}} to be quantified. Approaches to assessing it “face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research.” Other authors have sought a <b>numerical</b> <b>index</b> of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time. One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x system resilience. Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ “nonsense units,” the indices have “no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown.” ...|$|E
