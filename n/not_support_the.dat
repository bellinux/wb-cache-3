5|$|Czech mycologist Josef Šutara {{circumscribed}} {{the genus}} Mariaella in 1987, assigning Mariaella bovina as the type species. Mariaella contained Suillus species in section Fungosi. Molecular studies do <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> existence of Mariaella, {{and so it}} is considered synonymous with Suillus. Older synonyms for S.bovinus include those resulting from generic transfers to Agaricus by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1783, and the now-obsolete Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1888.|$|E

The power of the Whigs was so great that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E

In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book Pornography were held for inspection by Canada Customs agents, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under {{a law that}} she herself had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance, Dworkin did <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> decision, and her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) were held temporarily {{as part of a}} standard procedural measure, unrelated to the Butler decision.|$|E

5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star was {{released}} on May 10, 1994 by DGC, which also released the band's previous two albums. The album peaked at No. 34 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 39 on the UK Albums Chart. It was the band's highest position on the US charts until their 2009 album The Eternal reached No. 18. The album also charted in several other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands and Sweden. The band did <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> album with a tour due to Gordon's advanced pregnancy at the time.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, did <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites {{that he did not}} support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should have been resolved in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his view, to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, do <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E

5|$|In late 2000, as {{word spread}} that President-elect George W. Bush {{intended}} to appoint both Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice {{and a third}} unnamed black to the United States Cabinet, Jackson sought to prevent blacks from supporting Bush as Bush planned {{to reach out to}} blacks. Jackson partnered with Republican Henry Hyde to push for a third Chicago airport. Jackson said Hyde was the right wing complement to his own left wing role in pursuing support for the airport. Jackson has withheld support for local Democrats who would <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> airport, such as 1998 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Glenn Poshard.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson.

Vlad had to pledge that he would <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> enemies of the Ottoman Empire and he would pay an annual tribute and send 500 Wallachian boys to serve as janissaries in the sultan's army.

5|$|Of the 14 men in {{contention}} for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to}} the convention were Ulysses S. Grant, James G. Blaine, and John Sherman. Grant had served two terms as President from 1869 to 1877, and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office. He was backed by the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party, which supported political machines and patronage. Blaine was a senator and former representative from Maine who was backed by the Half-Breed faction of the Republican Party. Sherman, the brother of Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, was serving as Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes. A former senator from Ohio, he was backed by delegates who did <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> Stalwarts or Half-Breeds.|$|E
5|$|One of Glynne's main {{interests}} was mountaineering {{and rock}} climbing, although {{her family did}} <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> hobby, as her mother's cousin, Owen Glynne Jones {{died at the age}} of 32 in a climbing accident on Dent Blanche. Despite this, Glynne climbed throughout her life, including in Australia and New Zealand whilst she was touring there. She recorded the second ever ascent of Mount Spencer in New Zealand, the first by a woman. When she returned to Europe, she climbed major Alpine peaks such as Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije and Aiguille du Dru in the 1930s. She carried on climbing into her 60s, ascending Mount Fuji in Japan in 1963.|$|E
