5|$|Following this event, Zwingli {{and other}} humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July {{to abolish the}} {{requirement}} of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, {{three months before the}} birth of their first child. They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Zurich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, Apologeticus Archeteles (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.|$|E

To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Despite its designation, it is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet, but rather, a new, larger airframe using the design concepts of the Hornet.|$|E

This was a full edition, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> add-on, that came with its own board, money and playing pieces. Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated, and offices and home offices (instead of houses and hotels) could be built.|$|E
25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge {{can be seen as}} one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E
25|$|The bishop or eparch of a see, {{even if he}} {{does not}} also hold a title such as Archbishop, Metropolitan, Major Archbishop, Patriarch or Pope, is the centre of unity for his diocese or eparchy, and, {{as a member of the}} College of Bishops, shares in {{responsibility}} for governance of the whole Church (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 886). As each local particular Church is an embodiment of the whole Catholic Church, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> administrative subdivision of something larger, the bishop who is its head is not a delegate of the Pope. Instead, he has of himself primary teaching, governance and sanctifying responsibility for the see for which he has been ordained bishop.|$|E

25|$|Todd Park, the U.S. chief {{technology}} officer, initially said on October 6 that the glitches {{were caused by}} unexpected high volume when the site drew 250,000 simultaneous users instead of the 50,000-60,000 expected. He claimed that the site would have worked with fewer simultaneous users. More than 8.1 million people visited the site from October 1 to 4. White House officials subsequently conceded that it was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> issue of volume, but involved software and systems design issues. For example, consumers are required to create an account before being able to compare plans, and the registration process may have created a bottleneck {{that led to the}} long wait times. Also, stress tests done by contractors 1 day before the launch date revealed that the site became too slow with only 1,100 simultaneous users, nowhere near even the 50,000-60,000 expected.|$|E
25|$|Data by Strassman et al. {{indicates}} that reproduction in P. colobopterus {{reaches a maximum}} during the rainy season. At these times, {{there is a high}} number of new queens and a trend of colony foundation. Colonies have been known to persist {{for an extended period of}} time – up to 4.5 years. Mortality has not been shown to be associated with stage in the queen cycle, nor with season. The overall mortality rate of P. colobopterus is not consistent with other social insects, since it has a decreased mortality rate early in the history of a colony; this is likely due to the fact that it is founded by a swarm, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> individual queen. Since the success of the new colony is not completely dependent on the survival of the queen, this increases the colony’s initial chance of survival.|$|E
25|$|With {{gunpowder}} being increasingly {{applied to}} mining, rock chunks from a mining face became much larger, and the blast dependent mining itself had become dependent upon an organized group, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> individual swinging a pick. Economies of scale gradually infused industrial enterprises, while transport became a key bottleneck as {{the volume of}} moved materials continued to increase following demand. This spurred numerous canal projects, inspired laying first wooden, then iron protected rails using draft animals to pull loads in the emerging bulk goods transportation dependent economy. In the coal industry, which grew up hand in hand as the preferred fuel for smelting ores, crushing and preparation (cleaning) was performed for {{over a hundred years}} in coal breakers, massive noisy buildings full of conveyors, belt-powered trip-hammer crushing stages and giant metal grading/sorting grates. Like mine pumps, the internal conveyors and trip-hammers contained within these 711 story buildings.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} support from {{various members of the}} art community, it was often {{necessary}} for Dove to earn money through farming, fishing and commercial illustration. Dove’s most consistent supporter was Duncan Phillips, founder of the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., which now holds the majority of Dove’s work. Dove’s work convinced Philips that abstract was an artistic process, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> art style. Stieglitz’s gallery was first visited by Phillips because of Dove, and he continued to return to see Dove's work. In exchange for first choice of paintings from each exhibition, Phillips paid Dove a commission of $50.00 a month. Interestingly, Dove met Phillips only once in his lifetime, in 1936. In 1937 Phillips purchased Goin Fishin for $2,000.00, then the largest sum paid for any of Dove's work. Phillips also purchased “Huntington Harbor 1.” Dove produced about twenty-five assemblages between 1924 and 1930.|$|E

She was greatly affected by John Wayne's own cancer during this period, and Wayne reportedly wept on the phone when she informed him that her own cancer had been given the all clear.

500|$|As a candidate, Carter had {{proposed}} {{health care reform}} that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objective—balancing the federal budget. Kennedy and labor compromised and made the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a single bill with a fixed schedule for phasing-in comprehensive coverage. Frustrated by Carter's budgetary concerns and political caution, in a December 1978 speech on national health insurance at the Democratic midterm convention, Kennedy said regarding liberal goals overall that [...] "sometimes a party must sail against the wind" [...] and in particular should provide health care as [...] "a basic right for all, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> expensive privilege for the few." ...|$|E
500|$|In Outliers, Gladwell {{interviews}} Gates, {{who says}} that unique access to a computer {{at a time when}} they were not commonplace helped him succeed.

Gladwell chooses his words carefully to never mention that Gates' mother was on the board of directors of IBM with access to the whole of IBM, and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> ordinary daughter of wealthy businessmen as he says. Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post.|$|E
500|$|The 1943–44 {{season was}} Maurice Richard's first full {{season with the}} Canadiens. Richard was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> {{exciting}} player to watch which served to increase attendance, but also had the offensive skills needed to turn the Canadiens into an exceptional team. The Canadiens proceeded to dominate the regular season finishing well ahead of second-place Detroit.

Then, in the final they swept Detroit in four games to win their first Stanley Cup in thirteen years. While the [...] "Punch Line" [...] of Richard, Toe Blake and Lach provided the offensive power it was Bouchard and goal-tender Bill Durnan who kept the goals out. During the regular season Montreal had allowed only 109 goals, 68 less than second-place Detroit.
