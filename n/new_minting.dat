Its {{machinery}} was evidently damaged during the war, {{but because of}} its importance, unlike the mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R.

Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, <b>new</b> <b>minting</b> equipment was shipped to New Orleans.

From this time the production of coins became a small part of the overall business of non-ferrous metal sheet and tube production. Coinage accounted for 10–20% of the business from 1940 to 1964.

2500|$|The later 5th and 6th centuries {{are very}} murky {{in almost every}} way, and coinage is no exception. [...] The once {{vigorous}} late Roman monetary system lay in tatters, with almost no <b>new</b> <b>minting</b> and very little importation of new coins. [...] Nevertheless, it is becoming apparent that coinage never faded away completely, and that re-use of the existing supply of coinage continued throughout the period, buoyed along by occasional incomers. [...] Some archaeological excavations of Romano-British settlements that persisted into this period have produced older coins that remained in circulation, as at Wroxeter. [...] Gold and bronze coins in particular are often found on early Anglo-Saxon settlement sites and in graves, in many cases pierced or mounted for use as Jewellery. [...] Indeed, there is no telling exactly when any late Roman coin was lost, {{and in some cases}} they may have been in use well into the post-Roman period. [...] As for new imports, the number known for this period has increased considerably in recent years thanks to the spread of metal-detecting. [...] Hoards from this period are rare, but two have been found in recent years at Oxborough (2001) and Patching (1997), both dating to the later 5th century and the latter including no fewer than fifty gold and silver coins dating from the period up to c. 470. [...] A scattering of single-finds from the same period shows that the flow of coinage into 5th- and 6th-century Britain never dried up totally, and it appears that there was also some use of Byzantine coinage in the 6th century: gold and especially bronze coins have been found in substantial numbers, even {{in the western part of}} Britain, which is normally less well represented in coin finds. [...] This to some extent parallels the pattern of finds of North African pottery from the same period, which is found extensively in western Britain on 6th-century sites. [...] Unfortunately, the widespread use of Byzantine bronzes from this period as souvenirs from the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean means many finds of them must be treated with extreme care. [...] The importation of current continental issues – mainly in gold – continued over the 6th century, with considerable numbers of Merovingian tremisses circulating in southern and eastern England even by the end of the 6th century.

[...] But what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons why he should not go--public reasons why he should not quit his post at this crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed [...] "coaching" [...] for the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and indirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his own chessmen in the heat of a game; and any {{candidate}} on the right side, even if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a gentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke and keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote for the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence and power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task. Mr. Farebrother's prophecy of a fourth candidate [...] "in the bag" [...] had not yet been fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any other power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy nodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate like Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own expense; and the fight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the new Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future independent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only. Mr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of Pinkerton, and Mr. Brooke's success must depend either on plumpers which would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the <b>new</b> <b>minting</b> of Tory votes into reforming votes. The latter means, of course, would be preferable.|$|E

Clipping may have carried on {{into the middle of the}} 5th century, or been restricted to the 410s and 420s, and was perhaps carried out as a means of taxation by a government deprived of new supplies of coinage.

40|$|In the {{democratic}} family of nations, Nigeria is reputed to host {{one of the}} most expensive democratic political systems. The Nigerian democratic system has become a <b>new</b> <b>minting</b> causeway producing nouveaux riches, political jobbers and a tiny political aristocracy who control the vast resources and opportunities in the state. In the midst of this megalomaniac plutocracy, a distended army of the Nigerian unemployed is palpable. This precariat class is a victim of a democratic system that seems to legislate wealth avenues for a minority while pauperising the majority. On the other hand, while China’s democratic system has earned epithets such as “pseudo democracy”, “flawed democracy” or socialist or communist democracy, the country is a modern example of an economic phoenix. Within 30 years, China rose from a dark silhouette as one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second-largest economy status, lifting six hundred and fifty million of its citizens out of grinding poverty, about 80 % of the entire world’s bottom billion. The Chinese economic model and particularly its positive and unconditional friendship to African nations have stood out. While its democratic model provides an alternative to the Western-chiselled liberal democratic orthodoxy, its approach to governance with zero tolerance for corruption and its lean political structure may become a learning point for Nigeria and its African kindred nations. This study aims to examine the scale of Nigeria’s expensive democratic politics, and investigate its impact on the festering unemployment situation in the country vis-à-vis the Chinese democratic model and its cost of governance. Lessons drawn from this analysis and using the Marxist and Deprivation theories are expected to compel the present political class in Nigeria to overturn its natural shenanigans for responsible and benign leadership, which has the potential of reversing the unemployment dead weight in Nigeria...|$|E
