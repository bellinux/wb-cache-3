5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} that γ'A(λ) ≤ μ'A(λ) can be proven by considering a particular eigenvalue ξ of A and diagonalizing the first γ'A(ξ) columns of A {{with respect to}} the eigenvectors of ξ, described in a later section. The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix ξI'γ'A(ξ). As a result, the characteristic polynomial of B will have a factor of (ξ−λ)γ'A(ξ). The other factors of the characteristic polynomial of B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of B is <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> geometric multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.|$|E

500|$|In modern {{scholarship}} {{outside the}} legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states' rights {{with regard to}} federalism and republicanism. According to Kevin Gutzman, the Report, together with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, forms a foundation for the [...] "radical southern states' rights tradition." [...] However, Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro-nullification Southerners. The Report of 1800, Madison argued, did not say the government was a compact of the individual states, as the pro-nullification elements suggested. Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of [...] "the people {{in each of the}} States, acting in their highest sovereign capacity." [...] The state governments themselves, <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> federal judiciary, possess only delegated power and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance. Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the Ordinance of Nullification was not.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} Alkan's {{compositions}} {{from this period}} were never performed and have been lost. Among the missing works are some string sextets and a full-scale orchestral symphony in B minor, which was described {{in an article in}} 1846 by the critic Léon Kreutzer, to whom Alkan had shown the score. Kreutzer noted that the introductory adagio of the symphony was headed [...] "by Hebrew characters in red ink... This is <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> verse from Genesis: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." [...] Kreutzer opined that, set beside Alkan's conception, Joseph Haydn's Creation was a [...] "mere candle (lampion)." [...] A further missing work is a one-act opera, mentioned frequently in the French musical press of 1846-7 as being shortly to be produced at the Opéra-Comique, which however never materialized. Alkan also referred to this work in a letter of 1847 to the musicologist François-Joseph Fétis, stating that it had been written [...] "a few years ago." [...] Its subject, title and librettist remain unknown.|$|E
500|$|The Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, the 19th-century {{transcription}} of Merina oral history, {{offers an}} account of the idols' introduction into Imerina. According to legend, one day during Ralambo's reign a woman named Kalobe arrived in Imerina carrying a small object wrapped in banana leaves and grass. She had traveled from her village located at Isondra in Betsileo country to the south which had been destroyed by fire, walking the great distance and traveling only at night in order to deliver to the king what she called Kelimalaza ("the Little Famous One"), giving the impression that it was <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> greatest treasure in the land. Ralambo took the sampy and built a house for it in a nearby village. He then selected a group of adepts who were to study under Kalobe to learn the mysteries of Kelimalaza. Oral history maintains that Kalobe was [...] "made to disappear" [...] after the adepts' training was completed in order to prevent her from absconding with the precious idol.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} source of David's wealth during his career came from the revenue of his English earldom and the proceeds of the silver mines at Alston. Alston silver allowed David to indulge in the [...] "regalian gratification" [...] of his own coinage, and to continue his project of attempting to link royal power and economic expansion. Building programmes depended {{to a large degree}} on disposable income; consumption of foreign and exotic commodities broadened; men of ability and ambition found their way to court and entered the service of the king. What is more, <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> written word, the coin acted upon the culture and mental categories of people who made use of it. Like a seal displaying the king in majesty, the coin broadcast the image of the ruler to his people and, more fundamentally, altered the simple nature of trade. Though coins were not absent from Scotland before David, these were by definition foreign objects, unseen and unused by most of the population. The arrival of a native coinage – <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> arrival of towns, laws and charters – marked the penetration of the [...] "Europeanizing" [...] concepts of European culture into ever less [...] "non-European" [...] Scotland.|$|E
