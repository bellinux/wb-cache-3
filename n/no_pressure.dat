5|$|Dissidia Final Fantasy was {{originally}} envisioned by creative producer Tetsuya Nomura as a Kingdom Hearts spin-off featuring {{a cast of}} Disney characters while the Square Enix staff were developing Kingdom Hearts II. Nomura later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use Final Fantasy characters, although the original idea eventually {{gave rise to the}} development of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, with the game's multiplayer mode inspired by Dissidia's gameplay. The game was made in conmemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary and despite being handled by young employees, Nomura noticed there was <b>no</b> <b>pressure,</b> having assisted them in the designing various areas from the gameplay. The game was directed by Takeshi Arakawa whom Nomura noted that his experience in a previous Square Enix game, The World Ends With You, had a good effect in the game. In order to have their desired way of fighting, the team chose the PlayStation Portable console. There were plans for online play but the console's capacities made them unable to add such feature. Developing the game took three years due with the battle system requiring two years and the RPG mode one.|$|E
5|$|Finishing 18th in the Premier League {{resulted}} in relegation to the Championship {{for the following}} season. The Norwich City board announced shortly after relegation was confirmed on 11 May 2014 that a new manager would be announced within the week. On 22 May 2014, Neil Adams was named as the permanent manager despite the relegation from this season and four defeats in five matches as caretaker manager. The upheaval at the club {{was not limited to}} change in the management team, with a number of first team players being linked to moves away from Carrow Road, including Robert Snodgrass, Gary Hooper and John Ruddy. Chairman Alan Bowkett responded to the reports by stating that the club would be under <b>no</b> <b>pressure</b> to sell players during the transfer window.|$|E
5|$|Pressure {{readings}} from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is <b>no</b> <b>pressure</b> reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E

In the 1940s Ludwig Guttmann introduced a program of turning paraplegics every two hours thus allowing bedsores to heal. Previously such individuals had a two-year life-expectancy, normally succumbing to blood and skin infections. Guttmann had learned the technique from the work of Boston physician Donald Munro.|$|E

The liquid fuel allows for online removal of gaseous fission products, such as xenon, for processing, thus these decay products would not be spread in a disaster. Further, fission products are chemically bonded to the fluoride-salt, including iodine, cesium, and strontium, capturing the radiation and preventing the spread of radioactive material to the environment.|$|E

However, the defensive line should back up and thus increase this distance, stand off, when there is <b>no</b> <b>pressure</b> on the opponent in possession, as this increases {{the possibility of a}} through ball. With tough pressure on the opponent, the distance may be reduced to below 15 metres. Also, as opponents move in close to the penalty area, the defending team will be forced to move their midfielders ever closer to their defenders.|$|E

The company’s president and chief executive, Daniel Lamarre, insisted that Cirque received <b>no</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Beacon Theatre and had voluntarily closed the show for a re-staging. The limited engagement of Banana Shpeel ran in Toronto from September 18 to October 10. Despite one positive review, the show again received a generally poor response.

Over four seasons Allen graded 86.8% for blocking consistency, registered 386 knockdowns, allowed just four sacks and three pressures, while only committing seven penalties while seeing action during 1,309 pass plays during his tenure with the Griffons. Allen was a First-team Freshman All-American selection in 2005 after starting all 12 games at both offensive guard spots. He was penalized three times and gave up just 1.5 quarterback sacks and <b>no</b> <b>pressures</b> all season. In 2006, he was First-team All-Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association as he started all 12 games at right offensive guard. He allowed just 1.5 quarterback sacks and <b>no</b> <b>pressures.</b> In 2006 Allen was a Little All-American choice by The NFL Draft Report and a First-team All-MAIA Association selection {{for the second straight}} season.

25|$|To {{grip the}} ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam {{parallel}} to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and {{the third and fourth}} fingers close together and rest {{against the side of the}} ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart <b>no</b> <b>pressure.</b> When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.|$|E
25|$|By the 1500s, the Indian subcontinent {{benefited from}} {{extensive}} {{external and internal}} trade. Its agriculture was highly efficient {{as well as its}} industry. For economic historian Irfan Habib, however, this was not sufficient to later lead to an important capitalistic development. Unlike China, Japan and western and central Europe, India did not experience extensive deforestation until the 19th and 20th centuries. It thus had <b>no</b> <b>pressure</b> to move to coal as a source of energy. From the 17th century, cotton textiles from Mughal India became popular in Europe, with some governments banning them to protect their wool industries. In the 18th century, India were the most important manufacturers in world trade, producing about 25% of the world's industrial output in 1750, with Mughal Bengal in particular being globally dominant in industries such as textile manufacturing and shipbuilding.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was an}} {{exchange}} between judges and academics in the United Kingdom and United States comparing the process of appeal used in both nations. Although the British judges found the emphasis on written arguments unattractive, they did {{like the idea of}} pre-reading; that the court should read the pleadings of counsel, the case being appealed and the judgment from the lower court before delivering their judgment. After a trial in the Court of Appeal, despite the success of this, the idea was quietly scrapped. The court which Lord Denning presided over from 1962 to 1982 was under <b>no</b> <b>pressure</b> and had no inclination to modernise, with liaisons and management handled by clerks with little knowledge. This changed in 1981 with the appointment of a Registrar, John Adams, an academic and lawyer, who significantly reformed the internal workings of the Court.|$|E

25|$|United's season {{came to a}} {{crashing}} end in {{the playoff}} match against Montreal Impact. In the 3rd minute, captain Bobby Boswell made a huge mental mistake, ignoring his goalie's pleas to allow a missed shot to bounce over the end line and under <b>no</b> <b>pressure,</b> Boswell played it out for a corner. Montreal converted on the set piece as Laurent Ciman ran onto the cross and volleyed to give the visitors the early lead. United was frustrated by the Impact defense, and ifnally surrendered a second goal {{late in the first}} half after a failed clearance gave the Impact a chance to run at the D.C. defense. Ignacio Piatti chipped the ball behind the back line and Matteo Mancosu ran on to the pass and slotted it in for a 2-0 lead. The lead grew to 3-0 when a Mancosu header beat Hamid. United began showing some life late, but two Birnbaum headers were cleared off the line. The result was put beyond any doubt when Mancosu and Piatti combined on a breakaway, with Piatti getting the goal. D.C. did manage to make the scoreline more respectable in the closing moments, as Neagle headed in a Nyarko cross for a goal in the 90th minute and Kemp scored unassisted in stoppage time with a screamer inside the post from 25 yards. Though the team showed the same late-game fire they had for the last 3 months, they had dug too deep a hole, and a 4-2 loss began the long off-season.|$|E
