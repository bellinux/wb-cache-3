50|$|The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) {{determined}} that the accident {{was caused by the}} flight crew allowing the aircraft to descend significantly below the minimum descent height for the approach without gaining sight of the approach lighting or runway threshold. The AAIB also found that the crew had failed to cross-check altimeter height indications during the approach, that the <b>non-handling</b> <b>pilot</b> failed to call out the minimum descent height as the aircraft reached that altitude, and that the flight crew's performance had been impaired by the effects of fatigue.|$|E
5000|$|The audio {{recordings}} {{from the}} Cockpit voice recorder {{revealed that the}} crew were unaware of any significant abnormality until the flight from the Clipper platform to the Monarch platform. About 4.5 minutes into this flight, they discussed an increase in vibration. The <b>non-handling</b> <b>pilot</b> carried out a [...] "rotor track and balance" [...] procedure; the increase in vibration did not cause the crew any immediate concern and the procedure was carried out to enable the Integrated Health and Usage Monitoring System (IHUMS) to log rotor track and balance data for later analysis.|$|E
