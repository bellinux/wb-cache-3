5|$|In 2002, Sony {{released}} the first useful and fully functioning operating {{system for a}} video game console, after the Net Yaroze experiment for the original PlayStation. The kit, which included an internal hard disk drive and the necessary software tools, turned the PlayStation 2 into a full-fledged computer system running Linux. Users can utilize a <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> to connect the PlayStation 2 to the internet, a monitor cable adaptor to connect the PlayStation 2 to computer monitors {{as well as a}} USB Keyboard and Mouse which can be used to control Linux on the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony <b>Network</b> <b>Adapter</b> and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of the Xbox 360 come with a built-in 10/100 Ethernet <b>network</b> <b>adapter.</b> Proprietary USB Wi-Fi 802.11n and 802.11g adapters can be purchased separately. The Xbox 360 S, or slim, has built in wirelessN 2.4GHz networking.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} network speed, {{it is no}} longer possible to capture and transmit network packets at wire-speed using general-purpose operating systems. Many companies tried to tackle this problem by manufacturing costly <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> able to keep up at high network speeds. This paper describes a new approach to wire-speed packet capture and transmission named nCap based on commercial <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> rather than on custom <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> and software...|$|R
50|$|Native {{drivers for}} some <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> are not {{available}} on Linux as some manufacturers maintain proprietary interfaces and do not write cross-platform drivers.

25|$|The Xbox 360 {{can connect}} to Xbox Live over the Internet through the {{built-in}} 100 megabit Ethernet connector or an optional wireless <b>network</b> <b>adapter.</b> These {{can also be}} used to connect two consoles together directly for LAN play on supported games.|$|E
25|$|Note that BITS {{does not}} {{necessarily}} measure the actual bandwidth. BITS versions 3.0 and up will use Internet Gateway Device counters, if available, to more accurately calculate available bandwidth. Otherwise, BITS will use the speed {{as reported by the}} NIC to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> (10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (56 kbit/s).|$|E
25|$|Microcontroller {{firmware}} in the <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> typically handles link issues, {{supported by}} driver software {{in the operating}} system. Non-programmable analog and digital electronics are normally {{in charge of the}} physical components below the link layer, typically using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chipset for each network interface or other physical standard. High-performance routers are to a large extent based on fast non-programmable digital electronics, carrying out link level switching.|$|E

It also includes a clip for attaching the wireless <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> to it, much like what Xbox 360 consoles of the time had. The device also has an integrated 256MB memory unit which is used for storage of HD DVD data and is accessible to the user for saving other data such as saved games.|$|E
2500|$|As in the {{previous}} game, online play is available for those with a Sony <b>Network</b> <b>Adapter.</b> The title belts (including Create-A-Belt creations) can be defended online via a [...] "virtual WWE Championship" [...] with career leader boards and a permanent ID system that tracks all user stats. Players are also able to trade wrestlers created in the Create-A-Superstar mode with each other online. All arenas are also available for online play, including the unlockable WrestleMania IX Arena.|$|E
50|$|For {{the older}} models (non-Slim) of the PlayStation 2 console, a <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> {{was needed to}} play online and use a hard drive. All {{versions}} of the <b>Network</b> <b>Adapter</b> provide an Ethernet port, while some North American versions also featured a phone-line port for dial-up connection. The newer slimline versions, however, have an Ethernet port built into them, making the <b>Network</b> <b>Adapter</b> unnecessary and hard drive use nearly impossible, as well as ruling out any {{need to keep the}} <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> in production.|$|E

40|$|Bandwidth {{plays an}} {{important}} role for quality of service in most network systems. There are many technologies developed to increase host bandwidth in a LAN environment. Most of them need special hardware support, such as switching hub that supports IEEE Link Aggregation standard. In this paper, we propose a Linux solution to increase the bandwidth between hosts with multiple <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> connected to a regular switching hub. The approach is implemented as two Linux kernel modules in a LAN environment without modification to the hardware and operating systems on host machines. Packets are dispatched to bonding <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> for transmission. The proposed approach is backward compatible, flexible and transparent to users and only one IP address is needed for multiple bonding <b>network</b> <b>adapters.</b> Evaluation experiments in TCP and UDP transmission are shown with bandwidth gain proportionally to the number of <b>network</b> <b>adapters.</b> It is suitable for large-scale LAN systems with high bandwidth requirement, such as clustering systems...|$|R
40|$|With {{several recent}} {{initiatives}} in the protocol offloading technology present on <b>network</b> <b>adapters,</b> the user market is now distributed amongst various technology levels including regular Ethernet <b>network</b> <b>adapters,</b> TCP Offload Engines (TOEs) and the recently introduced iWARP-capable networks. While iWARPcapable networks {{provide all the}} features provided by their predecessors (TOEs and regular Ethernet <b>network</b> <b>adapters)</b> and a new richer programming interface, they lack with respect to backward compatibility. In this aspect, two important issues need to be considered. First, not all <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> support iWARP; thus, software compatibility for regular <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> (which have no offloaded protocol stack) with iWARP capable <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> needs to be achieved. Second, several applications on top of regular Ethernet as well as TOE based adapters have been written with the sockets interface; rewriting such applications using the new iWARP interface is cumbersome and impractical. Thus, it is desirable to have an interface which provides a two-fold benefit: (i) it allows existing applications to run directly without any modifications and (ii) it exposes the richer feature set of iWARP to the applications to be utilized with minimal modifications. In this paper, we design and implement a software stack to handle these issues. Specifically, (i) the software stack emulates the functionality of the iWARP stack in software to provide compatibility for regular Ethernet adapters with iWARP capable networks and (ii) it provides applications with an extended sockets interface that provides the traditional sockets functionality as well as functionality extended with the rich iWARP features...|$|R

50|$|In {{computing}} the SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) is {{a protocol}} that allows one computer to access SCSI devices attached to another computer via remote {{direct memory access}} (RDMA). The SRP protocol {{is also known as}} the SCSI Remote Protocol. The use of RDMA makes higher throughput and lower latency possible than what is possible through e.g. the TCP/IP communication protocol. RDMA is only possible with <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> that support RDMA in hardware. Examples of such <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> are InfiniBand HCAs and 10 GbE <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> with iWARP support. While the SRP protocol has been designed to use RDMA networks efficiently, it is also possible to implement the SRP protocol over networks that do not support RDMA.|$|R
