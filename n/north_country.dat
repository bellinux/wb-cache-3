5|$|New York State Route812 (NY812) is a {{state highway}} in the <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> of New York in the United States.

Its northern terminus is at the Canada–United States border in Ogdensburg, where it crosses the Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge and connects to Highway16 in Ontario. While most of NY812 passes through rural areas of the <b>North</b> <b>Country,</b> the route also serves several villages and small communities.|$|E

5|$|When NY3 was {{assigned}} in 1924, it followed a significantly different routing through the <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> {{than it does}} today. NY3 entered Franklin County near Hogansburg and served Malone, Paul Smiths, Gabriels, and Harrietstown before leaving the county near Saranac Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY3 was rerouted east of Watertown to follow its modern alignment through the <b>North</b> <b>Country.</b> The portion of NY3's former routing from Harrietstown to a junction southeast of Gabriels was designated as NY408 while the segment between Paul Smiths and the vicinity of Gabriels became part of NY192, an east–west highway extending from Paul Smiths to the realigned NY3 in Bloomingdale.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century two breeds {{had been}} {{developed}} for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably {{closely related to the}} Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY28 was {{extended}} south from Colliersville to Kingston largely {{by way of}} its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike.

Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The small portion of NY10A that did not become part of NY28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY10.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route177 (NY177) is an east–west {{state highway}} in the <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> of New York in the United States. It extends from Interstate81 (I-81) exit42 in the Jefferson County town of Adams to NY12 {{west of the}} Lewis County village of Lowville. NY177 intersects U.S. Route11 (US11) in Adams Center and meets Lewis County's County Route21 (CR21), {{formerly}} part of NY194, at Barnes Corners. NY177 originally began at US11 when it was assigned in 1930. It was extended west to its present terminus in the 1950s following the construction of I-81.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} realignment that occurred {{at this time}} was in the <b>North</b> <b>Country,</b> where NY3 was shifted onto its current alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh. From Tupper Lake east to Plattsburgh, most of what became NY3 was previously part of NY10. The NY10 designation remained in place from Tupper Lake east to Upper Saranac Lake, forming an overlap with NY3; however, it was completely replaced by NY3 from Saranac Lake east. Between Upper Saranac Lake and Saranac Lake, the routing of NY3 was previously unnumbered, as was the routing from Watertown to Tupper Lake.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{designated}} the primary northsouth roadway {{along the west}} bank of the Hudson River from the New Jersey state line near New York City to Albany, now largely US9W, as Route3, an unsigned legislative route. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route3 became part of the new NY10, which initially began at the New Jersey state line and ended in Saranac Lake. North of Albany, the route followed modern NY5, NY50, and NY9N through Schenectady and Saratoga Springs to reach the <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> at Lake George. Past this point, NY10 continued north on what is now US9, NY8, NY28, NY28N, and NY30 to Tupper Lake via Chestertown, Wevertown, North Creek, and Long Lake. At Tupper Lake, the route headed east on current NY3 to Wawbeek before taking a more circuitous route to Saranac Lake by way of modern NY30, NY186, and NY86.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, {{the segment}} of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway within New York was {{designated}} NY3. At that time, it spanned the full eastwest length of the state, extending from the eastern bank of the Niagara River in North Tonawanda to {{the western edge of}} Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh; however, the routing through the <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> was significantly different at that time from its modern alignment. The route was moved onto its modern routing east of Watertown as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; it was truncated to Sterling on its western end and rerouted to follow its current alignment from Sterling to Watertown roughly five years later.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{passes the}} American Real Estate School and a campus of Empire State College before {{intersecting}} NY454 (Veterans Highway). Not far from NY454, NY111 has a short concurrency with CR76 (Townline Road) along the Islip–Smithtown {{and then the}} names changes to Hauppauge Road town line before fully crossing into Smithtown. After forking from CR76, NY111 continues northeast through the hamlet of Hauppauge, crossing NY347 (Smithtown Bypass) at-grade as it runs across another residential stretch. The route soon enters Village of the Branch, where it bends northward into a large commercial area {{at the center of}} the community. Here, NY111 intersects with East Main Street, which enters the junction from the west as NY25 and NY25A. At this point, NY25 continues eastward as Middle Country Road, NY111 terminates, and NY25A turns northward on NY111's right-of-way, changing names to <b>North</b> <b>Country</b> Road.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, SH160 and SH500 became the westernmost portion of NY8, which continued northeast to Newburgh by way of Middletown and Montgomery. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the NY8 designation was reassigned to another highway serving the Central New York Region and the <b>North</b> <b>Country.</b> The portion of its former alignment east of Montgomery became part of the new NY215 while the rest was renumbered to NY84. Another, much smaller renumbering was carried out in May1966 after I-84 was built along an alignment similar to that of NY84. To prevent confusion between the two nearby roads, the section of NY84 south of Slate Hill was renumbered to NY284 while the part east of Middletown became an extension of NY211. From Slate Hill to Middletown, the road remained part of US6 and NY17M, which NY84 had previously overlapped.|$|E
