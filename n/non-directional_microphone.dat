50|$|A {{much simpler}} {{form of the}} Dynaco patent keeps the four {{speakers}} in their normal left and right plus front and rear positions.The left and right rear speakers {{are connected to the}} two-channel stereo amplifier via a passive matrix circuit, while the front ones stay directly connected to the amplifier.A lot of stereo material, recorded with a central, <b>non-directional</b> <b>microphone</b> (so-called kidney sensitivity diagram) placed in front of the orchestra, possessed suitable difference signals across the stereo signals. When taken across this passive speaker matrix for the rear channels, these produced a quasi-quadraphonic effect at low cost (the patent specifies the use of one fixed 10 ohm resistor and three variable 20 ohm resistors in a star arrangement). Especially for classical music, a fine impression of concert-hall ambiance is achieved with such a system.|$|E

Leaky air-coupled surface waves are measured with ordinary <b>non-directional</b> audio <b>microphones.</b> Results show that microphones can be successfully used to produce a realistic phase velocity spectrum even while moving along the surface. The paper presents some theoretical background along with initial experimental results using the moving microphone array...|$|R
