40|$|We {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that larval <b>neurones</b> guide growth of adult sensory axons in Drosophila. We show that ablation of larval sensory <b>neurones</b> causes defects in the central projections of adult sensory <b>neurones.</b> Spiralling axons and ectopic projections indicate failure in axon growth guidance. We show that larval sensory <b>neurones</b> are required for peripheral pathfinding, entry into the CNS and growth guidance within the CNS. Ablation of subsets of <b>neurones</b> shows that larval sensory <b>neurones</b> serve specific guidance roles.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of peripheral and central synaptic input to non-spontaneous, irregular discharging and regular discharging <b>neurones</b> in the inferior mesenteric ganglion {{of the cat}} were studied in vitro using intracellular recording techniques. All three types of <b>neurones</b> in rostral and caudal lobes received central synaptic input primarily from L 3 and L 4 spinal cord segments. Since irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> received synaptic input from intraganglionic regular discharging <b>neurones,</b> some of the central input to irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> may have been relayed through the regular discharging <b>neurones.</b> In the rostral lobes of the ganglion, more than 70 % of the non-spontaneous and irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> tested received peripheral synaptic input from the lumbar colonic, intermesenteric and left and right hypogastric nerves. Most of the regular discharging <b>neurones</b> tested received synaptic input from the intermesenteric and lumbar colonic nerves; none of the regular discharging <b>neurones</b> received synaptic input from the hypogastric nerves. Some of the peripheral synaptic input from the lumbar colonic and intermesenteric nerves to irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> may have been relayed through the regular discharging <b>neurones.</b> Axons of non-spontaneous and irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> located in the rostral lobes travelled to the periphery exclusively in the lumbar colonic nerves. Antidromic responses were not observed in regular discharging <b>neurones</b> during stimulation {{of any of the}} major peripheral nerve trunks. This suggests these <b>neurones</b> were intraganglionic. In the caudal lobes, irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> received a similar pattern of peripheral synaptic input as did irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> located in the rostral lobes. The majority of irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> in the caudal lobes projected their axons to the periphery through the lumbar colonic nerves. Non-spontaneous <b>neurones</b> in the caudal lobes, in contrast to those located in the rostral lobes, received peripheral synaptic input primarily from the hypogastric nerves. Axons of the majority of non-spontaneous <b>neurones</b> located in the caudal lobes travelled to the periphery through hypogastric nerves. The results suggest that non-spontaneous <b>neurones</b> and irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> in the rostral lobes and the majority of irregular discharging <b>neurones</b> in the caudal lobes transact and integrate neural commands destined for abdominal viscera supplied by the lumbar colonic nerves. Non-spontaneous <b>neurones</b> in the caudal lobes transact and integrate neural commands destined for pelvic viscera supplied by the hypogastric nerves...|$|R
40|$|Electrophysiological {{recordings}} {{have been}} used to characterize responses mediated by AMPA receptors expressed by cultured rat cortical and spinal cord <b>neurones.</b> The EC 50 values for AMPA were 17 and 11 [*]μM, respectively. Responses of cortical <b>neurones</b> to AMPA were inhibited competitively by NBQX (pKi= 6. 6). Lower concentrations of NBQX (⩽ 1 [*]μM) also potentiated the plateau responses of spinal cord <b>neurones</b> to AMPA, which could be attributed to a depression of desensitization to AMPA. GYKI 52466 inhibited responses of spinal cord <b>neurones</b> to AMPA to about twice the extent of responses of cortical <b>neurones.</b> Blockade of AMPA receptor desensitization by cyclothiazide (CTZ) potentiated responses of spinal cord <b>neurones</b> (6. 8 fold) significantly more than responses of cortical <b>neurones</b> (4. 8 fold). Responses of cortical <b>neurones</b> to KA were potentiated 3. 5 fold by CTZ, while responses of spinal cord <b>neurones</b> were unaffected. Ultra-fast applications of AMPA to outside-out patches showed responses of spinal cord <b>neurones</b> desensitized by 97. 5 % and exhibit marked inward rectification, whereas cortical <b>neurones</b> desensitized by 91 % and exhibited slight outward rectification. The time constants of deactivation and desensitization were about twice as fast in spinal cord than cortical <b>neurones.</b> In cortical <b>neurones,</b> single-cell RT[*]–[*]PCR showed GluR 2 and GluR 1 accounted for 91 % of all subunits and were expressed together in 67 % of <b>neurones,</b> predominantly as the flip variants (78 %).

40|$|Most lamina I <b>neurones</b> with a {{projection}} to the brainstem express the neurokinin 1 receptor and thus {{belong to a}} small subgroup of lamina I <b>neurones</b> that are necessary {{for the development of}} hyperalgesia in rat models of persisting pain.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the role that four populations of spinocerebellar <b>neurones</b> play in forwarding information on descending commands relayed by feline reticulospinal <b>neurones.</b> Both intracellular and extracellular recording was used from medially located ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT) <b>neurones</b> {{as well as from}} spinal border (SB) subpopulation of VSCT <b>neurones</b> and from dorsal spinocerebellar tract <b>neurones</b> located in Clarke's column (CC DSCT) and in the dorsal horn (dh DSCT) in the lumbosacral enlargement. Axons of reticulospinal <b>neurones</b> were stimulated within the ipsilateral and contralateral medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF). We found striking differences in synaptic input from reticulospinal <b>neurones</b> to these four populations of spinocerebellar <b>neurones.</b> Both monosynaptic and disynaptic excitatory input was found in VSCT and SB <b>neurones,</b> only disynaptic in CC DSCT <b>neurones</b> and none in dh DSCT <b>neurones.</b> Discharges of VSCT and SB <b>neurones</b> were potently modulated by inhibitory actions of group I and II afferents. Following application of single stimuli to peripheral nerves these <b>neurones</b> ceased to respond for about 5 ms and thereafter discharged at a lower incidence rate. As inhibition of spinocerebellar <b>neurones</b> and of α-motoneurones is evoked by the same premotor interneurones, VSCT <b>neurones</b> may provide the cerebellum with information on the likely outcome of reticulospinal actions on motoneurones depending on {{the degree to which they}} are inhibited.

The present study aimed to identify the morphology and neurochemical coding of enteric <b>neurones</b> in the human small intestine, which {{are involved in the}} innervation of the mucosa. The lipophilic neuronal tracer DiI was applied to one mucosal villus of small intestinal resection specimens. The tissue was kept in organotypic culture and subsequently processed for immunohistochemistry. <b>Neurones</b> labelled from the mucosa were located in all ganglionated nerve networks, including the myenteric plexus. In all plexuses, at least five neurochemical types of <b>neurones</b> could be observed, i. e.

Most of the DiI-labelled <b>neurones</b> were multidendritic; a minority of <b>neurones</b> could be identified as Dogiel type II cells, suggesting the existence of a subgroup of primary afferent <b>neurones</b> in the DiI-filled cell population. The ratio of labelled multidendritic <b>neurones</b> (assumed to be secretomotor) to labelled Dogiel type II <b>neurones</b> (assumed to be primary afferent) in the myenteric plexus is higher in large mammals (pig and human) than in small mammals (guinea pig).

40|$|Most {{intracellular}} electrical recordings from myenteric <b>neurones</b> {{have been}} made from the centre of large ganglia. In this study, we examined the electrophysiological properties of <b>neurones</b> {{at the corners of}} large ganglia close to internodal strands and in microganglia. Of 150 <b>neurones</b> in these locations: 111 were tonic S neurones; 9 were phasic S <b>neurones</b> and 30 were AH <b>neurones.</b> Tonic S <b>neurones</b> were characterized by: (i) low resting membrane potentials (− 50 ± 1 mV, mean ± s. e. m.); (ii) high input impedance (522 ± 23 MΩ); (iii) low threshold for action potential (AP) generation (0. 012 ± 0. 004 nA); (iv) firing of APs throughout a depolarizing pulse (duration ≤ 1 s) and one to four APs following a hyperpolarizing pulse and (v) spontaneous fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (FEPSPs). A substantial proportion of tonic S <b>neurones</b> (43 %) also fired APs spontaneously (7. 6 ± 0. 6 Hz; range, 0. 3 – 19 Hz). All APs were blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 μm). Tonic S <b>neurones</b> were subclassified, according to their post-stimulus responses, as SAH or SAD <b>neurones.</b> Following a burst of APs, SAH <b>neurones</b> exhibited a prominent after-hyperpolarization (duration, 711 ± 10 ms) and SAD <b>neurones</b> an after-depolarization (duration, 170 ± 10 ms). The after-hyperpolarization was reduced in four of ten <b>neurones</b> by apamin (0. 3 μm). FEPSPs were evoked in 20 of 38 S <b>neurones</b> by electrical stimulation applied both oral and anal to the recording site. Repetitive stimuli evoked slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (SEPSPs) in some tonic S <b>neurones.</b> Three functional classes of S <b>neurones</b> were identified after injection of neurobiotin through the recording microelectrode: (i) longitudinal muscle motor <b>neurones,</b> (ii) short circular muscle motor <b>neurones,</b> and (iii) ascending interneurones.

40|$|Reflex {{responses}} to hyperthermia include sweating, salivation and a redirection of blood {{flow from the}} viscera to the periphery, and involve changes in peripheral nerve activity mediated by {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), including specific areas of the ventral lower brainstem. The lower brainstem contains nitrergic <b>neurones</b> and <b>neurones</b> that project to intermediolateral cell column; however, it is not known whether these populations of <b>neurones</b> in the lower brainstem are activated following hyperthermia. The aims of the present study were to determine whether lower brainstem <b>neurones</b> activated by acute hyperthermia are nitrergic and/or whether they also project to the spinal cord. Retrogradely transported rhodamine-tagged beads were microinjected into the spinal cord. The rats were heated (environmental temperature 39 degrees C) for 1 h. Following perfusion/fixation, brain sections were processed to detect Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) and NADPH-diaphorase activity (a marker of nitrergic <b>neurones).</b> The results showed a significant increase in activated <b>neurones</b> in the mid-line (by fivefold), ventromedial (by eightfold) and ventrolateral lower brainstem (by ninefold). Some of these <b>neurones</b> were nitrergic, particularly in the ventromedial lower brainstem (5 % of the activated <b>neurones</b> in this region were nitrergic).

Two additional neuronal groups were identified: silent <b>neurones</b> having no spontaneous firing rates and EPSP-driven <b>neurones</b> having action potentials that are primarily dependent on excitatory synaptic input from nearby <b>neurones.</b> Silent <b>neurones</b> had the most extensive dendritic trees, and these branched in all directions.

40|$|Membrane and {{discharge}} properties {{determine the}} input-output relationship of <b>neurones</b> {{and are therefore}} of paramount importance for the functions of neural circuits. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that <b>neurones</b> in different laminae of the spinal dorsal horn differ in their electrophysiological properties. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from dorsal horn <b>neurones</b> in a rat transverse spinal cord slice preparation were used to record active and passive membrane properties. <b>Neurones</b> from superficial dorsal horn laminae had higher membrane resistances and broader action potentials than deep dorsal horn <b>neurones.</b> Action potential thresholds were highest in lamina II <b>neurones,</b> representing low membrane excitability. Five types of firing patterns were identified in response to depolarising current injections. Tonic-firing <b>neurones</b> discharged action potentials at regular intervals throughout the current pulse. Delayed-firing <b>neurones</b> showed a delayed onset of firing in response to current injections that was due to activation of a transient voltage-dependent outward current, presumably an A-current. Another group of <b>neurones</b> fired a short initial burst of action potentials. Single-spiking <b>neurones</b> discharged only one action potential {{at the onset of}} a depolarising pulse. Phasic-bursting <b>neurones</b> showed irregular bursts of action potentials. Firing patterns were unequally distributed among laminae. Tonic-firing <b>neurones</b> were numerous in lamina I and deeper laminae but were not found in lamina II. Delayed-firing <b>neurones</b> were encountered in laminae I and II but not in deeper laminae. Most of the <b>neurones</b> showing an initial burst were found in lamina II.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to clarify how Barrington's nucleus regulates bladder contractility. Single <b>neurones</b> that {{discharge}} at higher rates during micturition contraction were recorded from Barrington's nucleus. Spinal-projecting <b>neurones</b> were identified by antidromic stimulation of the spinal cord. Seventy-six spinal-projecting <b>neurones</b> were classified into four types based on the firing patterns displayed during the relaxation phase of the micturition contraction–relaxation rhythm: (1) ramp-tonic <b>neurones</b> displayed a ramp increase in firing throughout the relaxation phase, (2) ramp-silent <b>neurones</b> were silent initially during the relaxation phase and displayed a ramp increase later, (3) flat-tonic <b>neurones</b> fired constantly, and (4) flat-silent <b>neurones</b> displayed little firing, being virtually silent throughout relaxation. During the relaxation phase, discharge volleys from Barrington's nucleus to sacral <b>neurones</b> were estimated to increase exponentially as micturition contraction approached. Twenty-two <b>neurones</b> increased firing even further within 3 s of micturition contraction, suggesting that they are involved in the final stages of initiation of micturition contraction. During micturition contraction, 18 <b>neurones</b> (of which 14 belonged to the ramp-silent class) displayed maximal firing rates before maximal bladder pressures were reached; firing gradually decreased during micturition contraction. Thirty-nine <b>neurones</b> (of which 25 belonged to the ramp-tonic class) displayed constant firing during micturition contraction. This suggests that ramp-silent <b>neurones</b> might be involved in increasing bladder pressure rapidly and strongly via feed-forward regulation, while ramp-tonic <b>neurones</b> might be involved in maintaining high bladder pressure via positive feedback from the bladder afferents. Sixty <b>neurones</b> continued to fire for 1 – 8 s after the onset of bladder relaxation, suggesting that Barrington's nucleus does not trigger bladder relaxation...|$|R
40|$|Previous reports {{suggest that}} an {{important}} characteristic of chemosensitive <b>neurones</b> is an unusually large change of steady-state intracellular pH {{in response to a}} change in extracellular pH (ΔpHi/ΔpHo). To determine whether such a correlation exists between <b>neurones</b> from the medullary raphe (a chemosensitive brain region) and hippocampus (a non-chemosensitive region), we used BCECF to monitor pHi in cultured <b>neurones</b> subjected to extracellular acid–base disturbances. In medullary raphe <b>neurones,</b> respiratory acidosis (5 % → 9 % CO 2) caused a rapid fall in pHi (ΔpHi ∼ 0. 2) with no recovery and a large ΔpHi/ΔpHo of 0. 71. Hippocampal <b>neurones</b> had a similar response, but with a slightly lower ΔpHi/ΔpHo (0. 59). We further investigated a possible link between pHi regulation and chemosensitivity by following the pHi measurements on medullary raphe <b>neurones</b> with an immunocytochemistry for tryptophan hydroxylase (a marker of serotonergic <b>neurones).</b> We found that the ΔpHi/ΔpHo of 0. 69 for serotonergic <b>neurones</b> (which are stimulated by acidosis) was not different from either the ΔpHi/ΔpHo of 0. 75 for non-serotonergic <b>neurones</b> (most of which are not chemosensitive), or from the ΔpHi/ΔpHo of hippocampal <b>neurones.</b> For both respiratory alkalosis (5 % → 3 % CO 2) and metabolic alkalosis (22 mm → 35 mm HCO 3 −), ΔpHi/ΔpHo was 0. 42 – 0. 53 for all groups of <b>neurones</b> studied. The only notable difference between medullary raphe and hippocampal <b>neurones</b> was in response to metabolic acidosis (22 mm → 14 mm HCO 3 −), which caused a large pHi decrease in ∼ 80 % of medullary raphe <b>neurones</b> (ΔpHi/ΔpHo = 0. 71), but relatively little pHi decrease in 70 % of the hippocampal <b>neurones</b> (ΔpHi/ΔpHo = 0. 09). Our comparison of medullary raphe and hippocampal <b>neurones</b> indicates that, except in response to metabolic acidosis, the <b>neurones</b> from the chemosensitive region do not have a uniquely high ΔpHi/ΔpHo.

25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral <b>neurone.</b> … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E

To study {{the mechanisms of}} chemosensitivity in the raphe, rat VMM <b>neurones</b> were maintained in primary dissociated tissue culture, and studied using perforated patch-clamp recordings. Baseline electrophysiological properties were similar to raphe <b>neurones</b> in brain slices and in vivo. <b>Neurones</b> were exposed to changes in CO 2 from 5 % to 3 or 9 % while maintaining a constant [NaHCO 3]. Fifty-one per cent of <b>neurones</b> (n = 210) did not change their firing rate by more than 20 % in response to hypercapnic acidosis.

Inhibited <b>neurones</b> had a mean increase in firing rate to 232 ± 265 % of control when pH increased from 7. 38 to 7. 57. <b>Neurones</b> were also exposed to isocapnic acidosis. All CO 2 -stimulated <b>neurones</b> tested (n = 15) were also stimulated by isocapnic acidosis, and all CO 2 -inhibited <b>neurones</b> tested (n = 19) were inhibited by isocapnic acidosis. <b>Neurones</b> with no response to hypercapnic acidosis also had no response to isocapnic acidosis (n = 12). Thus, the effects of CO 2 on these <b>neurones</b> were mediated in part via changes in pH. In stimulated <b>neurones,</b> acidosis induced a small increase in the after-hyperpolarization level of 1. 38 ± 1. 15 mV per − 0. 2 pH units, which was dependent on the level of tonic depolarizing current injection. In voltage clamp mode at a holding potential near resting potential, there were small and inconsistent changes in whole-cell conductance and holding current in both stimulated and inhibited <b>neurones.</b> These results suggest that pH modulates a conductance in stimulated <b>neurones</b> that is activated during repetitive firing, with a reversal potential close to resting potential. The two subtypes of chemosensitive VMM <b>neurones</b> could be distinguished by characteristics other than their response to acidosis. Stimulated <b>neurones</b> had a large multipolar soma, whereas inhibited <b>neurones</b> had a small fusiform soma. Stimulated <b>neurones</b> were more likely than inhibited <b>neurones</b> to fire with the highly regular pattern typical of serotonergic raphe <b>neurones</b> in vivo. Within the medullary raphe, chemosensitivity is a specialization of two distinct neuronal phenotypes. The response of these <b>neurones</b> to physiologically relevant changes in pH is of the magnitude that suggests that this chemosensitivity plays a functional role. Elucidating their mechanisms in vitro may help to define the cellular mechanisms of central chemoreception in vivo...|$|R
40|$|GABA <b>neurones</b> in the dorsal {{raphe nucleus}} (DRN) {{influence}} ascending 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) <b>neurones</b> but are not physiologically or anatomically characterised. Here, in vivo juxtacellular labelling methods in urethane-anaesthetised rats were used to establish the neurochemical and morphological identity of a fast-firing population of DRN <b>neurones,</b> which recent data suggest may be GABAergic. Slow-firing, putative 5 -HT DRN <b>neurones</b> were also identified {{for the first time}} using this approach. Fast-firing, DRN <b>neurones</b> were successfully labelled with neurobiotin (n= 10) and the majority (n= 8 / 10) were immunoreactive for the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. These <b>neurones</b> were located in the DRN (mainly lateral regions), and consistently fired spikes with short width (1. 1 +/- 0. 1 ms) and high frequency (12. 1 +/- 2. 0 Hz). In most cases spike trains were regular but displayed low frequency oscillations (1 - 2 Hz). These <b>neurones</b> were morphologically heterogeneous but commonly had branching axons with varicosities and dendrites that extended across DRN subregions and the midline. Slow-firing DRN <b>neurones</b> were also successfully labelled with neurobiotin (n= 24). These <b>neurones</b> comprised a population of <b>neurones</b> immunopositive for 5 -HT and/or tryptophan hydroxylase (n= 12) that fired broad spikes (2. 2 +/- 0. 2 ms) with high regularity and low frequency (1. 7 +/- 0. 2 Hz). However, a slow-firing, less regular population of <b>neurones</b> immunonegative for 5 -HT/tryptophan hydroxylase (n= 12) was also apparent. In summary, this study chemically identifies fast- and slow-firing <b>neurones</b> in the DRN and establishes {{for the first time that}} fast-firing DRN <b>neurones</b> are GABAergic. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of these <b>neurones</b> suggest a novel function involving co-ordination between GABA and 5 -HT <b>neurones</b> dispersed across DRN subregions...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of sensory, including nociceptive, information in spinal dorsal horn is critically modulated by spinal GABAergic <b>neurones.</b> For example, blockade of spinal GABAA receptors leads to pain evoked by normally innocuous tactile stimulation (tactile allodynia) in rats. GABAergic dorsal horn <b>neurones</b> have been classified neurochemically and morphologically, but {{little is known}} about their physiological properties. We used a transgenic mouse strain coexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD 67 to investigate the properties of a subgroup of GABAergic <b>neurones.</b> Immunohistochemistry showed that EGFP-expressing <b>neurones</b> accounted for about one-third of the GABAergic <b>neurones</b> in lamina II of the spinal dorsal horn. They constituted a neurochemically rather heterogeneous group where 27 % of the <b>neurones</b> coexpressed glycine, 23 % coexpressed parvalbumin and 14 % coexpressed neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). We found almost no expression of protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) in EGFP-labelled <b>neurones</b> but a high costaining with PKCβII (78 %). The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to intracellularly label and physiologically characterize EGFP- and non-EGFP-expressing lamina II <b>neurones</b> in spinal cord slices. Sixty-two per cent of the EGFP-labelled <b>neurones</b> were islet cells while the morphology of non-EGFP-labelled <b>neurones</b> was more variable. When stimulated by rectangular current injections, EGFP-expressing <b>neurones</b> typically exhibited an initial bursting firing pattern while non-EGFP-expressing <b>neurones</b> were either of the gap or the delayed firing type. EGFP-expressing <b>neurones</b> received a greater proportion of monosynaptic input from the dorsal root, especially from primary afferent C-fibres. In conclusion, EGFP expression defined a substantial but, with respect to the measured parameters, rather inhomogeneous subgroup of GABAergic <b>neurones</b> in spinal lamina II. These results provide a base to elucidate the functional roles of this subgroup of GABAergic lamina II <b>neurones,</b> e. g. for nociception...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the electrophysiological properties of <b>neurones</b> in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) in rats and guinea pigs in transverse medullary slices maintained in vitro. There were only minor differences in the morphology of the <b>neurones</b> between the species, and their passive electrical properties were very similar. However, action potentials in guinea pig <b>neurones</b> had larger amplitudes and longer half-widths than did those in rat <b>neurones.</b> In both species. action potentials were followed by prolonged after hyperpolarisations (AHPs). In the majority of guinea pig <b>neurones,</b> two calcium-activated potassium currents underlying the AHP could be separated into an early apamin-sensitive component and a late apamin-insensitive component. In rat <b>neurones,</b> the current underlying the AHP was briefer and entirely apamin-sensitive. In response to a step of depolarising current, <b>neurones</b> in the guinea pig only discharged once or twice and then ceased firing. In rat <b>neurones,</b> this manoeuvre produced repetitive firing. An inward rectifier was larger in <b>neurones</b> of the guinea pig than in those in the rat. The effects of 5 -hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline also differed between <b>neurones</b> of each species. We conclude that. despite many similarities of size and electrical properties. DMV <b>neurones</b> in the two species differ in terms of several voltage- and calcium-dependent conductances which determine their active electrical behaviour...|$|R

The lateral giant <b>neurones</b> mediated short latency responses in the pereiopod common inhibitor <b>neurones,</b> the same abdominal first root <b>neurones</b> and one uropod protopodite promotor motoneurone.

40|$|Parasympathetic <b>neurones</b> in the submandibular {{ganglion}} {{of the rat}} innervate the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. <b>Neurones</b> which innervate the submandibular gland (s. m. <b>neurones)</b> {{are usually}} located along the salivary ducts which drain both glands. <b>Neurones</b> which innervate the sublingual gland (s. l. <b>neurones)</b> {{are located in the}} thin sheet of tissue which lies between the salivary ducts and the lingual nerve. The existence and characteristics of intrinsic synaptic connexions were studied electrophysiologically in these two divisions of the submandibular ganglion. Three days or more after denervating the ganglion two types of excitatory intrinsic synaptic potentials [...] chemical and electrical [...] were recorded in ganglion cells. Chemical synaptic responses were reversibly blocked by nicotinic antagonists such as hexamethonium (10 microM) and D-tubocurarine (100 microM). Intrinsic chemical synapses were common among s. m. <b>neurones</b> (present in 72 % of <b>neurones)</b> but only 12 % of s. l. <b>neurones</b> were coupled with chemical synapses. Electrical coupling was found among 31 % of s. m. <b>neurones</b> but was not observed between s. l. <b>neurones.</b> Electrotonic coupling in s. m. <b>neurones</b> in denervated and intact ganglia was directly demonstrated by impaling adjacent <b>neurones</b> with separate micro-electrodes. The average coupling ratio for current pulses injected into one cell and recorded in the adjacent cell was 0. 06. During the first 30 days after birth, the number of synaptic inputs from preganglionic (chorda tympani) axons was markedly reduced in both s. m. and s. l. <b>neurones,</b> whereas the incidence of electrical synaptic connexions remained unchanged. The effect of long-term denervation (up to 4 months) on intrinsic synapses was examined. The membrane properties of the parasympathetic <b>neurones</b> and the intrinsic synaptic connexions were maintained without marked changes. It is concluded that the submandibular ganglion in the rat consists of two distinct populations of parasympathetic <b>neurones.</b> The two classes of <b>neurones</b> differ in (1) their location within the ganglion, (2) their target organs and (3) the incidence of intrinsic synapses. Possible mechanisms for the development, maintenance and function of these intrinsic synapses are discussed...|$|R
