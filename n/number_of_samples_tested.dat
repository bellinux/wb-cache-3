Another limitation of this study is that we were unable to reproduce the possible stretching of the whole lateral capsule on the cadaver occurring in vivo, along with the bony avulsion, as reported to occur in the majority of cases of Segond’s fracture [5]. This possible plastic deformity of the anterolateral capsule occurring in vivo would lead to an underestimate of the actual role of Segond’s fracture as evaluated in the present study.|$|E

A method of taking large (300 mm diameter) samples using a thin walled tube pushed by a CPT truck, is described. Then, the procedure of testing these samples under a load of 25 kPa using a large scale oedometer arrangement is described.

Therefore a holistic particle-based approach is proposed. The particle-based approach uses minerals and particles as a common parameters going through the geometallurgical program from the collecting of the geological data to the process simulations.

The geological model describes quantitatively and spatially modal composition and texture of the ore. The particle breakage model that describes quantitatively what kind of particles will be produced as the rocks given by the geological model are broken. The unit process models quantify how particles behave in different unit operations. For developing and managing the models some practical techniques are described and proposed.
