5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|Miss Rosa meets new {{prison inmate}} Piper and offers her some advice. She reveals {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her chances of survival.

5|$|Stacey {{explains}} to Dot that Bradley {{knew he was}} not Lily's father. Dot informs Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood), who tells her he already knows. Concerned by Stacey telling people her secrets, he wonders if she has ceased taking medication for her bipolar disorder. He tells her that she <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the truth about Lily's father {{and the fact that}} she killed Peggy's husband Archie (Larry Lamb) several months previously to herself. Phil tries to convince various people to let him out as he is suffering withdrawal symptoms, but nobody will. Janine awakens in Richard's flat and gets dressed, though they did not have sex. She returns home and tells Pat that she feels guilty, and Pat tells her not to inform Ryan. Janine fears that she is not good enough for Ryan, but he reassures her and they marry. Stacey attends their wedding reception in The Queen Victoria, leaving Lily in a bedroom upstairs. She is surprised by a photograph of Peggy and Archie, and is frightened to hear Phil making noises in the living room. Stacey tells Peggy that she thinks Archie is alive and locked upstairs. Peggy assures Stacey that Archie is dead, telling her that Bradley killed him, as he was posthumously found guilty of the murder. Stacey then confesses that she killed Archie.|$|E

While Papa is away, he feels like he's the man of the house and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his family safe.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{means of}} transport for the cowboy, even in the modern era, is by horseback. Horses can travel over terrain that vehicles cannot access. Horses, along with mules and burros, also serve as pack animals. The most important horse on the ranch is the everyday working ranch horse that can perform {{a wide variety of}} tasks; horses trained to specialize exclusively in one set of skills such as roping or cutting are very rarely used on ranches. Because the rider often <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> one hand free while working cattle, the horse must neck rein and have good cow sense—it must instinctively know how to anticipate and react to cattle.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} first game, duels are also common. During duels, the {{character}} and the enemy will slowly circle one another, with the player needing to keep the character's hand as close to his gun as possible by moving the left analog stick/mouse. However, they cannot touch their gun, as if they do, their hand is automatically moved away. At the same time, the player <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the opponent lined up in {{the centre of the}} screen by using the right analog stick or keyboard. When the time comes to draw, a bell rings, and the player has only a very brief window in which to draw, aim and fire.|$|E
25|$|The airline <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a {{specific}} {{number of seats}} in reserve to cater to the probable demand for high-fare seats. This process can be managed by inventory controls or by managing the fare rules such as the AP (Advanced Purchase) restrictions. (30 day advance purchase, 21 day advance purchase, 14 day advance purchase, 7 day advance purchase, day of departure/walk up fares) The price of each seat varies directly {{with the number of}} seats reserved, that is, the fewer seats that are reserved for a particular category, the lower the price of each seat. This will continue until the price of seat in the premium class equals that of those in the concession class. Depending on this, a floor price (lower price) for the next seat to be sold is set.|$|E

He {{comes across as a}} sweet guy so he can get the girls to confess their love to him and then reject them for fun. After Yukina blackmails him, Shigure does things to try to get out of it, one of them being finding out her glasses secret to no avail. Shigure denies that he has feelings for Yukina but for some reason can't understand why he feels he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Yukina to himself. He is also jealous of Akira and Hisame but denies it, he later on confesses his love to Yukina but because of her unsure feelings in the past, she did not respond to his feelings until after Shigure came back from his studies and told him her feelings. They started going out.|$|E

500|$|Coghill has {{explained}} that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as}} he met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Coghill elucidated: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] As Tony began to lose interest in Whitney, he started grooming her 14-year-old school-friend Lauren Branning. A show-insider commented that Tony had been getting away with abusing Whitney for years, but was escalating as one young girl was no longer enough to satisfy him.|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life.

[...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E

It includes the pulmonary circulation, a [...] "loop" [...] through the lungs where blood is oxygenated; and the systemic circulation, a [...] "loop" [...] {{through the rest of}} the body to provide oxygenated blood. The systemic circulation can also be seen to function in two parts–a macrocirculation and a microcirculation. An average adult contains five to six quarts (roughly 4.7 to 5.7 liters) of blood, accounting for approximately 7% of their total body weight. Blood consists of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

2500|$|Suffering from {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, it was {{too painful}} for Bowden to signal a batsman out in the conventional fashion, with a straight index finger raised above the head, and {{this led to the}} [...] "crooked finger of doom". He has also put his own slant on several other signals, including a [...] "crumb-sweeping" [...] wave of the arm to signal four, and the [...] "double crooked finger six-phase hop" [...] to signal a six. His signals are sedate in Tests, more flashy in ODIs and decidedly flamboyant in Twenty20. His behavior has attracted him both fans and critics almost equally. Martin Crowe referred to him as Bozo the Clown, and at least one commentator has said he should remember that cricket is for the players and fans, not for the umpires. However, there was a suggestion that he needs to do the signals in the way he does because of his arthritis, as he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his body fluid.|$|E
2500|$|New York Times Style section write, Eric Wilson did an {{extensive}} {{study on the}} impact of fashion bloggers on the fashion industry for one of his style columns. Wilson wrote that these bloggers have ascended ‘from the nosebleed seats to the front row’ in the past year and that the divide between the ‘high code’ editors with a professional opinion and the ‘amateur’ fashion bloggers is beginning to disintegrate. [...] Wilson interviewed prominent publicists, editors and designers. Publicist Kelly Cutrone stated that over the past two years, there has been a complete change in who is writing about fashion. Not only does Cutrone say she <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a watch on the editors of mainstream writings, such as Vogue and Elle, but now she needs to monitor on the millions of fashion bloggers around the world. Cutrone goes on the later state that once these bloggers post anything on the internet, it never comes off, and it now becomes the first thing that the designers will see.|$|E
