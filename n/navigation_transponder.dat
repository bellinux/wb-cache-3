50|$|In normal operation, {{the display}} {{in front of}} the pilot is the PFD and will provide {{aircraft}} attitude, airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, heading, rate-of-turn, slip-and-skid, <b>navigation,</b> <b>transponder,</b> inset map view (containing map, traffic, and terrain information), and systems annunciation data. The second display, typically positioned {{to the right of the}} PFD, operates in MFD mode and provides engine instrumentation and a moving map display. The moving map can be replaced or overlaid by various other types of data, such as satellite weather, checklists, system information, waypoint information, weather sensor data, and traffic awareness information.|$|E

50|$|The current {{generation}} sensor can only detect and track pulsed emissions, {{due to the}} requirement to measure the time of arrival of pulses. The receivers operate in the frequency range of 1-18 GHz and typically exploit secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponders, identify friend or foe (IFF) transponders, airborne radars, weather radars, tactical air <b>navigation</b> (TACAN) <b>transponders,</b> distance measurement equipment (DME) beacons, digital communications signals and pulsed jamming signals.|$|R
50|$|The TACAN {{navigation}} system is an evolution of radio <b>transponder</b> <b>navigation</b> systems that {{date back to}} the British Oboe system of World War II. In the United States many companies were involved with the development of TACAN for military aircraft. Hoffman Laboratories Div. of the Hoffman Electronics Corp.-Military Products Division (now NavCom Defense Electronincs) was a leader in developing the present TACAN system in the US starting in the late 1950s.|$|R
40|$|At {{present time}} there exists {{on-going}} need {{and demand for}} air vehicles and services for the real-time remote sensing both at national and international level. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is very useful to solve a number of non-military tasks as {{an effective means of}} search, detection and identifying of the objects and subjects of interest as well as the precise determination of their coordinates. Disaster management and oil and gas pipelines monitoring may be the first large scale practical applications of non-military UAVs. Almost all technical problems of UAV technology development have been already solved except one. It is the «sense and avoid » problem. This problem could be successfully overcome with a help of the GNSS (Global <b>Navigation</b> Satellite System) <b>Transponder</b> Concept. The main obstacles for UAV applications are not technical. They are in the arias of legislation, regulations, certification and air traffic management. Small size UAVs and optionally piloted air vehicles (OPAV) are the most likely to be ready for legal limited practical applications in the nearest future. International cooperation could speed up the process of civil and commercial UAV applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study was conducted}} to prove the concept of an iterative approach to single <b>transponder</b> <b>navigation</b> for REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Although the concept of navigation with one acoustic beacon is not new, the objective was to develop a computer algorithm that could eventually be integrated into the REMUS architecture. This approach uses a least squares fit routine coupled with restrictive geometry and simulated annealing vice Kalman filtering and state vectors. In addition, to provide maximum flexibility, the single transponder was located on a GPS equipped surface ship that was free to move instead of the more common single bottom mounted beacon. Using only a series of spread spectrum ranges logged with time stamp, REMUS standard vehicle data, and reasonable initial conditions, the position at a later time was derived with a figure of merit fit score. Initial investigation was conducted using a noise model developed to simulate the errors suspected with the REMUS sensor suite. Results of this effort were applied to a small at sea test in 3, 300 meters with the REMUS 6000 deep water AUV. A more detailed test was executed in Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts, in 20 meters of water with a REMUS 100 AUV focusing on navigation in a typical search box. (cont.) While deep water data was too sparse to reveal conclusive results, the Buzzard's Bay work strongly supports the premise that an iterative algorithm can reliably integrate REMUS logged data and an accurate time sequence of ranges to provide position fixes through simple least squares fitting. Ten navigational legs up to 1500 meters in length showed that over 90 % of the radial position error can be removed from an AUV's position estimate using the STRONG algorithm vice dead reckon navigation with a magnetic compass and Doppler Velocity Log alone (DVL). by J.

40|$|The Rosebud {{hydrothermal}} vent field {{was discovered in}} May 2002 in the Galapagos Rift near 86 W during a series of Alvin dives and ABE autonomous vehicle surveys. Vertical-incidence digital imaging using a 3. 1 Mpixel digital camera and strobe illumination from altitudes of 3 - 5 m was carried out during the Alvin dives. A complete survey of the Rosebud vent site was carried out on Alvin Dive 3790. Submersible position was determined by post-cruise integration of 1. 2 MHz bottom-lock Doppler sonar velocity data logged at 5 Hz, integrated with heading and attitude data from a north-seeking fiber-optic gyroscope logged at 10 Hz, and initialized with a surveyed-in long-baseline <b>transponder</b> <b>navigation</b> system providing geodetic position fixes at 15 s intervals. The photo-mosaicing process consisted of three main stages: pre-processing, pair-wise image co-registration, and global alignment. Excellent image quality allowed us to avoid lens distortion correction, so images only underwent histogram equalization. Pair-wise co-registration of sequential frames was done partially automatically (where overlap exceeded 70 percent we employed a frequency-domain based technique), and partially manually (when overlap did not exceed 15 percent and manual feature extraction {{was the only way}} to find transformations relating the frames). Partial mosaics allowed us to determine which non-sequential frames had substantial overlap, and the corresponding transformations were found via feature extraction. Global alignment of the images consisted of construction of a sparse, nonlinear over-constrained system of equations reflecting positions of the frames in real-world coordinates. This system was solved using least squares, and the solution provided globally optimal positions of the frames in the overall mosaic. Over 700 images were mosaiced resulting in resolution of ~ 3 mm per pixel. The mosaiced area covers approximately 50 m x 60 m and clearly shows several biological zonations and distribution of lava flow morphologies, including what is interpreted as the contact between older lobate lava and the young sheet flow that hosts Rosebud vent communities. Recruitment of tubeworms, mussels, and clams is actively occurring at more than five locations oriented on a NE-SW trend where vent emissions occur through small cracks in the sheet flow. Large-scale views of seafloor {{hydrothermal vent}} sites, such as the one produced for Rosebud, are critical to properly understanding spatial relationships between hydrothermal biological communities, sites of focused and diffuse fluid flow, and the complex array of volcanic and tectonic features at mid-ocean ridge crests. These high-resolution perspectives are also critical to time-series studies where quantitative documentation of changes can be related to variations in hydrothermal, magmatic and tectonic processes...|$|R
