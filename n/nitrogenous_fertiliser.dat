40|$|In partial {{fulfilment}} of the National Diploma in Horticulture of the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate recent advances in the use of anhydrous and aqua ammonia as <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> with emphasis on the prospects and needs there are for their usage in New Zealand. There is at present a large dependence on New Zealand made organic and imported artificial fertilisers which are mostly low analysis materials. These <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> with their low nitrogen content, have a high cost per pound of nitrogen. Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are high analysis materials whose use could prove worthwhile in this country on the grounds of economy and practicability. An appraisal of these prospects would appear to offer advantages in the development of horticulture (and agriculture) in New Zealand. Part I deals with the aspects of nitrogen in the soil and in plants. This introduces the trends in <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and usage of the various forms, particularly anhydrous and aqua ammonia. Also dealt with is the history of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> Part II illustrates the usage of ammonia as a fertiliser. The manufacture, use for crops, equipment and basic economics are discussed, with a view to demonstrating that anhydrous and aqua ammonia fertilisers have been shown to be both efficient and very economical fertilisers overseas. Part III deals with the position in New Zealand. The types of nitrogen fertilisers used and the economic aspects of their usage. Prospects for anhydrous and aqua ammonia in New Zealand are looked at. In conclusion the general findings are summarised and recommendations are made with a view to future needs in New Zealand for anhydrous and aqua ammonia. This thesis attempts to tentatively answer the question, "Is there a place for anhydrous and aqua ammonia fertiliser in New Zealand, and what action should be taken to examine this subject more closely"...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of green cane harvesting with trash retention, compared with burning, on soil fertility were evaluated {{using data from the}} long-term trash management trial at Mount Edgecombe (BT 1). Total and potentially mineralisable soil N were greater under green cane harvesting than burning in the surface 0 - 10 cm layer of soil. As expected, fertiliser applications induced increases in extractable soil P and also some accumulation in soil organic P (particularly under trash retention). Both exchangeable and non-exchangeable soil K concentrations were higher in fertilised than non-fertilised treatments. Exchangeable K concentrations were also increased markedly by trash retention reflecting the large amounts of K that are returned in trash and demonstrating their positive effect on K fertility. Soil pH was lowered considerably by fertiliser applications and this effect was evident to 30 cm. Mean pH to a depth of 20 cm was 6. 0 for unfertilised plots and 5. 4 for those fertilised. Fertiliser induced acidification is attributed to annual applications of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> at a rate of 140 kg N/ha. Trash retention also tended to result in a decline in pH due to the greater amount of N cycling in the system. It was concluded that recommended fertiliser rates are likely to be reduced under green cane harvesting and that regular lime applications are important when acidifying <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> are being used routinely...|$|R
40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is {{commonly}} applied to identify {{greenhouse gas emissions}} arising from agricultural production. Greenhouse emissions were determined for the life cycle from “cradle-to-gate ” of different cotton and corn production systems in the Namoi Valley, Australia.

Analysis was conducted using SimaPro software, drawing background data from international databases. Greenhouse gas emissions averaged 345 kg CO 2 -e for the production of 1 tonne of cotton lint and seed for both irrigated and dryland cotton and 325 kg CO 2 -e for the production of 1 tonne of corn. The emissions profile for irrigated cotton grown in rotation included N 2 O directly from fertilisers (35. 3 %), production of fertilisers (14 %), CO 2 emissions from the use of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> (11. 6 %), N 2 O emissions indirectly via leaching (7. 2 %), N 2 O emissions via volatilisation and indirectly from fertiliser re-deposition (3. 8 %), CO 2 emissions from on-farm combustion (7. 8 %) and irrigation (9. 2 %).

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of methane}} by methane-oxidising microorganisms {{is an important}} link in the global methane budget. Oxic soils are a net sink while wetland soils are a net source of atmospheric methane. It has generally been accepted that the consumption of methane in upland as well as lowland systems is inhibited by <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> additions. Hence, mineral nitrogen (i. e. ammonium/nitrate) has conceptually been treated as a component {{with the potential to}} enhance emission of methane from soils and sediments to the atmosphere, and results from numerous studies have been interpreted as such. Recently, ammonium-based fertilisation was demonstrated to stimulate methane consumption in rice paddies. Growth and activity of methane-consuming bacteria in microcosms as well as in natural rice paddies was N limited. Analysing the available literature revealed that indications for N limitation of methane consumption have been reported in a variety of lowland soils, upland soils, and sediments. Obviously, depriving methane-oxidising bacteria of a suitable source of N hampers their growth and activity. However, an almost instantaneous link between the presence of mineral nitrogen (i. e. ammonium, nitrate) and methane-oxidising activity, as found in rice soils and culture experiments, requires an alternative explanation. We propose that switching from mineral N assimilation to the fixation of molecular nitrogen may explain this phenomenon. However, there is as yet no experimental evidence for any mechanism of instantaneous stimulation, since most studies have assumed that <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> is inhibitory of methane oxidation in soils and have focused only on this aspect. Nitrogen as essential factor on the sink side of the global methane budget has been neglected, leading to erroneous interpretation of methane emission dynamics, especially from wetland environments. The purpose of this minireview is to summarise and balance the data on the regulatory role of nitrogen in the consumption of methane by soils and sediments, and thereby stimulate the scientific community to embark on experiments to close the existing gap in knowledge.

40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} of nitrogen-fixing (NF) bacteria {{to form a}} symbiotic relationship with leguminous plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen has been exploited {{in the field to}} meet the nitrogen requirement of the latter. This phenom-enon provides an alternative {{to the use of the}} <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> whose excessive and imbalanced use over the decades has contributed to green house emission (N 2 O) and underground water leaching. Recently, it was observed that non-leguminous plants like rice, sugarcane, wheat and maize form an extended niche for various species of NF bacteria. These bacteria thrive within the plant, successfully colonizing roots, stems and leaves. During the association, the invading bacteria benefit the acquired host with a marked increase in plant growth, vigor and yield. With increasing population, the demand of non-leguminous plant products is growing. In this regard, the richness of NF flora within non-leguminous plants and extent of their interaction with the host definitely shows a ray of hope in developing an ecofriendly alternative to the nitrogenous fertilisers.

Environmentally relevant concentrations of a fertiliser, ammonium nitrate, and a commercial formulation of the herbicide glyphosate Roundup Plus were tested on the embryonic development of Chioglossa lusitanica. This study introduces new data at three different levels. First, we provide previously unknown information about hatchling traits of C. lusitanica. Second, we present the first ecotoxicological study of this endangered species, to which environmental pollution is considered a major threat. Third, we conduct the first experiment with an amphibian species exposed to a mixture of a glyphosate-based herbicide and a <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> Control individuals hatched with an average (±SD) total length of 18. 77 (± 2. 02) mm and at an average Harrison’s developmental stage of 44. 58 (± 1. 24).

The first collection was made just before treatments were imposed in early November (spring). Samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} series of experiments designed to understand the potential anthelmintic properties of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> for control of gastrointestinal parasites. Anthelmintic administration is no longer considered the sole method for control of gastrointestinal parasites. Due to the increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance, alternative methods of parasite control are required. <b>Nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> produce a number of potentially toxic compounds during their conversion to plant available forms, {{and there are some}} reports they may have anthelmintic properties, although there is a paucity of specific evidence. Therefore, this series of experiments investigated the effects of nitrogen-containing fertilisers on Trichostrongylus colubriformis eggs hatching and larval development. Experiment one (Chapter 3) consisted of topical application of either water or urea (Flow-Fert N, 20 % concentration) onto 100 g of faeces. The total number of larvae collected per 100 g of faeces was 25, 600 and 800 for water and urea respectively, a 97 % reduction in larvae following treatment with urea. Visual assessment of the faeces showed a white fungus growing on the faeces sprayed with water that was not present on the faeces sprayed with urea. The second experiment (Chapter 4) involved immersing T. colubriformis eggs in pH solutions ranging in whole number increments from 4 to 11, and in solutions of 20 % urea (pH of 8). pH had a significant effect on egg hatching at pH less than 6 (P< 0. 001), whilst above pH 6 there was no effect on egg hatching. Urea solutions suppressed 90 %+ of the eggs from hatching indicating that the effect on egg hatching was independent of pH. Experiment three (Chapter 5) determined the optimum concentration of urea required to inhibit eggs from hatching. T. colubriformis eggs were immersed in solutions of urea at various concentrations (1 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %, 10 %, 20 %, 50 %). There was a significant effect of urea concentration on egg hatching with hatching decreasing as urea concentrations increased with less than 10 % of eggs hatching in concentrations greater than 10 %. Optimum concentrations estimated using an LD 90 and ROC analysis were determined to be 19. 6 % and 5. 5 %, respectively. The fourth experiment (Chapter 6) compared five nitrogen-containing fertilisers: urea (46 - 0 - 0 - 0), sulphate of ammonia (21 - 0 - 0 - 24), potato fertiliser (15 - 10 - 10 - 8), potassium nitrate (13 - 0 - 44 - 0) and nitrophoska blue (12 - 5. 2 - 14 - 0) at various concentrations (1 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 50 %) and their effects on eggs hatching. There was a fertiliser type X concentration interaction with all fertilisers, at concentrations greater than 10 % inhibiting eggs from hatching to less than 6 % (P< 0. 001). At a concentration of 1 %, sulphate of ammonia and potassium nitrate had the strongest effect on eggs hatched, viz 24 % and 48 %, respectively, in comparison with 90 % in the control. Regression analysis credited the variation in percentage of eggs hatched could be explained by both nitrogen percentage and electrical conductivity, but not phosphorous, potassium, sulphur levels or pH. The final experiment (Chapter 7) considered the implications of four of the fertilisers and whether exposure to the fertilisers was reversible. Following 24 hours of immersion in the solution, and a further 24 hours of incubation in water, no eggs had hatched under any of the fertilisers (20 % concentration), indicating a strong, irreversible effect on the eggs (P< 0. 001). <b>Nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> have the potential to control ruminant GINs outside of the host, as an alternative to anthelmintics.

The anticipated increase in the population to 2050 will increase the dependency on fertiliser inputs. The paper examines the different potential sources of energy and hydrogen required for this essential fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into plant-available <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and concludes that methane from natural gas is clearly the most suitable source. In the absence of a cost-effective alternative source of hydrogen it is recommended that an on-going requirement for methane is acknowledged and that consideration be given to strategic reserves for the production of food. Phosphorus is also an essential and unsubstitutable nutrient for plants and animals, but while the global reserves of atmospheric nitrogen are effectively unlimited, the reserves of phosphate rock are finite. Recent estimates of the reserve suggest that at the current rate of use this resource will become exhausted within some hundreds of years. The annual increment of phosphorus contained in the human population is estimated to be in the order of 1 Mt/yr, which is a small proportion of the quantity mined. There is a clear requirement to ensure that phosphorus is recycled to a large extent, so that the rate of exhaustion of the reserves of phosphate rock is significantly reduced. Legislation relating to the management of phosphorus appears entirely associated with its potential to upset natural ecosystems, with apparently no regulations yet requiring the efficient use and reuse of a scarce resource.

Agricultural <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use {{is the major}} source of human-induced N 2 O emissions. A field experiment was conducted at Bundaberg from October 2012 to September 2014 to examine the impacts of legume crop (soybean) rotation as an alternative nitrogen (N) source on N 2 O emissions during the fallow period and to investigate low-emission soybean residue management practices. An automatic monitoring system and manual gas sampling chambers were used to measure greenhouse gas emissions from soil. Soybean cropping during the fallow period reduced N 2 O emissions compared to the bare fallow. Based on the N content in the soybean crop residues, the fertiliser N application rate was reduced by about 120 kg N/ha for the subsequent sugarcane crop. Consequently, emissions of N 2 O during the sugarcane cropping season were significantly lower from the soybean cropped soil than those from the conventionally fertilised (145 kg N/ha) soil following bare fallow. However, tillage that incorporated the soybean crop residues into soil promoted N 2 O emissions in the first two months. Spraying a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) onto the soybean crop residues before tillage effectively prevented the N 2 O emission spikes. Compared to conventional tillage, practising no-till with or without growing a nitrogen catch crop during the time after soybean harvest and before cane planting also reduced N 2 O emissions substantially. These results demonstrated that soybean rotation during the fallow period followed with N conservation management practices could offer a promising N 2 O mitigation strategy in sugarcane farming.

These phenomena require an integrated analysis to estimate their potential impacts and initiate strategic thinking about adaptation. Water loss below the root zone, i. e. deep drainage, is {{the primary cause of}} sub-soil salt mobilisation leading to surface soil salinity in areas cleared of natural vegetation in Australia; hence deep drainage is an important externality of agricultural production.

Since results of Global Circulation Models (GCM) are still largely inconsistent for this region, we have opted for a factorial approach in adapting 90 years of historical weather data. This set-up enabled separation of effects Of CO 2, temperature, precipitation and their interactions, and unravelling of the complex interactions between water and nitrogen availability, phenological development and climate change factors, in the extremely variable Mediterranean climate in WA. Elevated CO 2 concentration increased yields, particularly if nitrogen fertilisation was sufficient and conditions were relatively dry. Higher temperatures had non-linear effects, with initial (up to 3 degreesC) benefits on clay soils, but not on sandy soils, and then substantial yield declines. Both elevated CO 2 concentrations and temperatures (+ 3 degreesC) decreased grain protein, but in financial terms this was more than offset by the increase in yield in most cases. If, in addition, precipitation was decreased, financial returns dropped below present levels, particularly in the low precipitation regions. Deep drainage tended to be slightly higher under elevated CO 2 concentrations but when higher temperatures were also simulated this was reversed. Deep drainage was greatly reduced in the low precipitation scenarios. Evidently climate change is not only likely to affect productivity, but also deep drainage and hence dryland salinity. The impact can vary in direction such that both 'win-win' and 'lose-win' outcomes may occur, particularly depending on the relative change in precipitation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

In this paper, a mathematical model and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique are proposed for the simulation and optimisation of the urea plant in an industrial petrochemical company. The developed mathematical model consists of complex vapour–liquid equilibria for the NH 3 –CO 2 –H 2 O–(NH 2) 2 CO system in thermodynamic and reaction frameworks. The smart technique (e. g. ANN) considers the CO 2 conversion in terms of temperature and the molar ratios of NH 3 /CO 2 and H 2 O/CO 2 in the liquid phase. The ANN predictions were compared with the real data and results obtained from the mathematical model. An acceptable agreement was attained between deterministic methods. Through implementation of a systematic sensitivity analysis, {{it was found that}} a temperature of 191 °C, a pressure of 132 [*]atm and a NH 3 /CO 2 ratio of 2. 7 are the optimum process conditions for the urea production. It is concluded that the developed ANN (or connectionist) technique is an efficient tool for modelling complex phase equilibria with reaction in the industrial urea plant...|$|R
50|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{fertilisers}} {{provide a}} convenient and {{effective means of}} maintaining a satisfactory level of balanced nutrition in nurseries provided they are used with proper regard to timing and in quantities which have some relation to the actual requirements. For many years their regular use has been regarded as an accepted part of nursery husbandry. In New Zealand Forest Service nurseries, {{as well as some}} private forest nurseries, assessment of requirements is made largely on the basis of standardised agricultural soil tests. Soil sampling methods and interpretation of soil test results are outlined. Prescriptions based on soil test ratings have generally helped to maintain satisfactory growth in successive crops, while preventing cumulative excesses which could also adversely affect nursery stock. Fertilisers are commonly applied during bed preparation (especially P, K and secondary nutrients (Ca, Mg, S) as low-cost simple agricultural fertilisers), as well as later during the period when seedlings are making rapid growth (light maintenance side- or topdressings of granulated multinutrient <b>fertilisers</b> or <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> according to soil requirements). In the event of poor growth or malnutrition symptoms affecting a crop, visual diagnosis, aided where necessary by foliar analysis, is used to resolve the cause so that prompt remedial action can be taken, e. g., by foliar spray.

40|$|Spring calving cows {{were used}} in the years 1997 to 2003 in the {{development}} of planned low and high input systems of suckler beef production. The main objective {{of the study was to}} compare a semiintensive Grange (standard) : system of suckler beef production with a more extensive REPS (Rural Environment Protection Scheme) compatible system. In the standard system the stocking rate was 0. 80 ha per cow unit (cow plus heifer and steer progeny to slaughter at 20 and 23 / 24 months of age, respectively, plus replacements or its equivalent), a <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> application rate of 210 kg per ha and two silage harvests each year amounting to the equivalent of 87 % of the total area harvested. The REPS system involved a 25 % lower stocking rate, an annual nitrogen fertiliser application rate of 90 to 100 kg per ha and one silage harvest (portion in late May to provide good silage for the progeny and the remainder in June to provide lower quality silage for cows) amounting to 58 % of the total area harvested. Between 1997 and 2000 the cow herd were Limousin x Friesians (LF) and Simmental x (Limousin x Friesians) (SLF). A herd of first calvers were introduced in 2001 and 2002 which in addition to LF and SLF included Limousin x (Limousin x Friesians), purebred Limousin and purebred Charolais. Charolais (or Simmental) sires were used on mature cows. Replacement heifers were bred to calve at 2 years of age using an easy calving Limousin bull. Concentrate inputs per animal were the same in the two systems. The main findings of the study were: • The mean nitrogenous application rates were 210 and 98 kg per ha in the standard and REPS systems, respectively. • Mean dry matter digestibility of the first-cut silages harvested early (May 19 to May 29), late (June 5 to June 13) and the second cut silage in the standard system (harvested in July/early August) were 716, 690 and 674 g/kg, respectively. • When averaged throughout two grazing seasons there was no difference between the standard and REPS systems in pregrazing or post-grazing sward heights. When examined over one grazing season the only major difference between the grazing areas was that the pasture crude protein content was higher in the standard system in both the pre-grazed (205 and 159 g/kg) and post-grazed (172 v 141 g/kg) swards. Cow liveweight and body condition score gains at pasture and calf gains from birth to weaning were the same for both systems. Carcass weights of the progeny were the same for the standard and REPS systems. End of Project Repor...|$|E

Animal {{evaluation of}} Aries HD perennial ryegrass selected for high digestibility. Proceedings Of The Conference- New Zealand Grassland Association, 59, 245 - 249. Four grazing field experiments {{were carried out}} at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand, to evaluate the nutritive value and endophyte status of a new perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) cultivar (Aries HD) selected for increased organic matter digestibility in summer and early autumn. It is {{claimed to be the}} first commercial perennial ryegrass selected specifically for improved digestibility. The nutritive value and organic matter digestibility of Aries HD, compared to a standard cultivar Yatsyn 1 perennial ryegrass were evaluated in terms of liveweight gain, carcass weight gain, wool production, grazing behaviour and herbage intake of sheep. The effects of endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii) were assessed with reference to the performance of sheep, incidence and severity of ryegrass staggers, serum prolactin concentration, respiration rate, rectal temperature, faecal moisture and scouring (dags). A tiller demography experiment was carried out to compare the survival, reproductive development and density of tillers in pure swards of Aries HD and Yatsyn 1 pasture. The first three grazing experiments (Experiments 1, 2 and 3) were conducted on clover-free swards of Aries HD and Yatsyn 1 established in the autumn of 1995, in a randomised complete block design with three blocks (0. 33 ha/plot). The proportion of tillers infected with endophyte was over 90 % in both cultivars. Plots were continuously grazed to a sward surface height of 6 cm. There were regular monthly applications of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and herbicide was applied to eliminate volunteer clover. In vitro organic matter digestibility, neutral detergent fibre and nitrogen content from herbage cut to ground level or plucked samples did not differ significantly overall, and showed no indications of seasonal differences between cultivars. In the first weaned lamb experiment (Experiment 1 : 11 December 1995 to 25 April 1996) lambs grazing Aries HD gained 20 g/day more than lambs grazing Yatsyn 1 pasture (104 vs 84 ± 4. 6 g/day, P = 0. 1028), with a particular advantage in relative terms over the dry summer period. This resulted in a 9 % greater carcass weight at slaughter for Aries HD lambs over Yatsyn 1 lambs. Incidence of clinical ryegrass staggers among Yatsyn 1 lambs was double that of lambs grazing Aries HD (29 vs 15 %) although lolitrem B concentrations did not differ between cultivars. Ergovaline concentrations in Aries HD herbage samples were consistently half those of Yatsyn 1 samples. The better animal performance in this experiment reflected the interrelated effects of alkaloid concentrations and ryegrass staggers. Experiment 2 (3 September 1996 to 1 December 1996) measured the performance of ewes with their single lambs over spring, providing an evaluation of the relative nutritive value of pastures when the risk of endophyte alkaloids was minimal. Ewe liveweight gain was significantly higher on Aries HD than Yatsyn 1 over September (94 vs 56 ± 14. 5 g/day) which coincided with a significantly higher bite rate and herbage intake. This enabled Aries HD ewes to gain an extra kilogram over the spring months. The liveweight gain of the suckling lambs did not differ between cultivars, presumably reflecting high and non-limiting milk yields on both cultivars. The percentage of leaf was consistently higher in Aries HD swards over this experiment, although this was not reflected in a higher organic matter digestibility. In the second weaned lamb experiment (Experiment 3 : 2 December 1996 to 12 March 1997) {{there was no significant difference}} in lamb liveweight gain (116 vs 111 ± 5. 1 g/day) between cultivars. Incidence of ryegrass staggers was low with only 9 % of Yatsyn 1 lambs being affected, which reflected low levels of lolitrem B and ergovaline. It was concluded that the lambs were faced with a lower alkaloid challenge than in the previous summer, reflected in the lack of difference in animal performance between cultivars. The tiller demography experiment spanned both Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 (September 1996 to March 1997). Each replicate plot had five randomly placed transects with 10 marked tillers, and tiller survival and reproductive development were recorded at weekly intervals. Tiller population density and mean tiller weight were determined on three dates. There was no difference in the rate of tiller death between Aries HD and Yatsyn 1. Few tillers died until mid December, after which survival approximated an exponential decay curve (ebt, b=- 0. 0133, t 1 / 2 = 52 days). Aries HD appeared to have a more rapid onset of initial flowering but then a lower proportion of secondary reproductive tillers. There was some evidence that the proportion of vegetative tillers was greater in Aries HD than in Yatsyn 1 swards. Aries HD swards had a higher density of finer tillers than Yatsyn 1. The results from the first three experiments highlighted the need for more detailed evaluation of the cultivar/endophyte associations which influenced the production and balance of alkaloids. The final grazing experiment (Experiment 4 : 2 December 1997 to 7 April 1998) was conducted with this in mind. Clover-free swards of Aries HD and Yatsyn 1 were established in the autumn of 1997 in six replicate plots (0. 2 ha) of each cultivar arranged in a randomised block design. The proportion of tillers infected with endophyte was 96 % in both cultivars. There were regular applications of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and herbicide was applied to eliminate volunteer clover and Poa annua. The experiment was designed as a 2 x 2 factorial, with two perennial ryegrass cultivars (Aries HD and Yatsyn 1) and two grazing sequences. Two groups of lambs were rotationally grazed on each cultivar in a leader/follower sequence. It was anticipated that the leader lambs would test the nutritional value of the pasture, while the follower lambs would be forced to graze into the base of the sward possessing the greatest potential for endophyte toxicity. Lambs on all treatments were severely affected by ryegrass staggers from 3 February onwards. The leader-follower regime created contrasts in sward composition and nutritive value, resulting in significantly faster liveweight gains in leader lambs than in follower lambs (92 vs 53 ± 10. 6 g/day). Aries HD and Yatsyn 1 pasture did not differ in in vitro organic matter digestibility, neutral detergent fibre, nitrogen content or in liveweight gain of lambs. Lambs grazing Aries HD pasture had higher herbage intakes in late January than those grazing Yatsyn 1 pastures. Ergovaline concentration of Aries HD pasture was consistently half that of Yatsyn 1 pasture. Respiration rate, which is an indicator of heat stress, was higher in Yatsyn 1 lambs. Staggers severity score was highest in the Yatsyn 1 pastures. The higher ergovaline concentration may have acted synergistically with lolitrem B concentration to increase the severity of staggers observed in Yatsyn 1 pastures. The follower lambs had significantly reduced serum prolactin levels and respiration rates, possibly reflecting greater ergovaline intoxication, and had greater faecal contamination scores (dags) and severity scores. The severe and debilitating symptoms of ryegrass staggers could have prevented any differences in animal performance during the period when severe staggers were observed. This work highlighted the importance of assessing not only the nutritive value, but the effects of the cultivar/endophyte association in animal evaluations of perennial ryegrass in New Zealand. The effect of management and alkaloid concentration is likely to have a larger impact on lamb performance than small differences in nutritive value between cultivars of high-endophyte perennial ryegrass...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{formulate}} an integrated disease management (IDM) strategy for winter sports turf. (Winter sports turf, or coarse turf, consists primarily of perennial rye grass, Lolium perenne, which is used for football, rugby and hockey pitches because of its wear tolerant characteristics). IDM involves the use of a number of control strategies to suppress disease economically and efficiently. Such strategies incorporate cultural, biological, genetic, legislative and chemical control. In order to formulate a successful disease management strategy, all the significant diseases affecting winter sports turf and the effects of different management strategies on these target pathogens needed to be identified and collated. This was achieved by a comprehensive questionnaire survey to professional football clubs (who require a high level of turf maintenance) and local authorities (moderate/low maintenance). The questionnaire sought information regarding disease, pest and weed incidence, control measures employed and general problems, e. g. drainage, wear and routine management practices. Red thread, Laetisariafiiciformis, and Fusarium patch, Microdochium nivale appeared to be the most ubiquitous diseases on winter sports turf. Some important management practices that suppress red thread can, however, encourage Fusarium patch, e. g. the application of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> A series of experiments and field trials have been initiated to identify a number of specific factors which manage to effectively suppress both diseases. A field trial involving the use of species mixtures, perennial rye grass and smooth stalked meadow grass (Poa pratensis), illustrated that genetic diversity can help to reduce both red thread and Fusarium patch compared to turf grown in monoculture. The amount Fusarium patch and red thread cover indicated that disease severity was significantly lower in dual species stands as compared to monoculture. A mixture comprising 50 % perennial rye grass and 50 % smooth stalked meadow grass appeared the most effective at suppressing disease incidence. Similarly, mixtures of three perennial rye grass cultivars appeared more successful at suppressing slight outbreaks of red thread as compared to bi-blends and monoculture. In addition, individual perennial rye grass cultivars also vary in tolerance to red thread. One hundred and ten cultivars, under three different nitrogen regimes were assessedto determine which were the most disease resistant. The cultivars, received artificial football type wear treatment throughout the winter, to determine if red thread incidence predisposes rye grass to be less wear tolerant. The results indicate that a number of cultivars tolerant to red thread throughout the summer were also more resistant to wear. These cultivars included Quickstart, DelDwarf and Brightstar. Wear tolerance was also increased under a moderate nitrogen level (150 kg/ha/yr). Finally, a field trial investigating the effect of nitrogen rate on red thread and Fusarium patch incidence on five different constructions for football pitches was set down. Both diseases appeared to be efficiently suppressed under a moderate/high nitrogen level (N= 225 kg/ha/yr). The 'pipe/slit' construction type also appeared to contain both diseases effectively, whilst sustaining a healthy, vigorous sward throughout the Winter when subjected to artificial football-type wear treatment. In addition to the field studies, an investigation to isolate potential microbial antagonists for use as biocontrol agents against Fusarium patch was undertaken; Fusarium patch was identified as the most economically important disease on winter sports turf from the original survey. A number of known antagonists and indigenous fungi and bacteria isolated from the phylloplane and rhizosphere of Lolium perenne were screened in vitro on turfgrass extract agar against Fusarium patch. This in vitro assay identified which species effectively suppressed disease growth. These potential antagonists were further tested in vivo to determine efficacy under field conditions. Fungi from the genus Trichoderma and bacteria from the genera Bacillus and Pseudornonos appeared the most effective antagonists against Fusarium patch in the in vivo study. In all cases where an antagonist was present, Fusarium patch severity was significantly lower than the untreated control, e. g. the indigenous Bacillus sp. reduced disease severity by 76. 1 %. The results obtained from the field trials are encouraging and suggest that the use of species/cultivar mixtures, disease tolerant cultivars and a balanced fertiliser regime on a freely-draining construction type can successfully be incorporated into an IDM plan. An IDM strategy will help to effectively suppress both red thread and Fusariurn patch on winter sports turf. Biological control of Fusariurn patch was successful on an experimental basis, although further research is required to identify an appropriate formulation and optimum application technique for successful commercial use. The use of IDM on winter sports turf will help reduce reliance on chemical control, may delay the onset of fungicide resistance and reduce non-target impacts of fungicides. IDM will also help limit the need for potentially hazardous chemicals in recreational areas open to the public...|$|E

We use a recursive dynamic model to analyse beef production and trade and adjust it as to include a component to evaluate {{the impact of}} liberalised trade due to Romania’s accession to the EU on groundwater and air quality. The environmental module of the model associates the pollution {{to the use of}} production inputs. We link the use of itrogen inputs (e. g., <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> manure) to nitrogen loss through leaching/runoff into groundwater (nitrates) and greenhouse gases (emissions of nitrous oxide and methane). We compute the nitrogen loss through leaching/runoff into the groundwater based on the nitrogen balance and the greenhouse gases emissions as a function of applied nitrogen and the number of beef cattle. We consider two scenarios for the non-accession and accession case, produced a market outlook throughout the year 2011 based on assumptions regarding full trade liberalisation between the EU and Romania and income change in Romania and analysed the impact on environment. The increase in beef imports in the accession scenario at a higher rate than in the baseline scenario corresponds to a decrease in the groundwater and air pollution caused by cattle production. agricultural trade, externalities, partial equilibrium model, Romania, Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|The age-old {{need to make}} soils more {{productive}} and yet, at the same time, more sustainable was the core of debate at an expert group meeting held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, from 26 to 30 July 1999.

Moving beyond the obvious effects of injudicious fertiliser use on the environment, the group examined how to make progress in the search for organic <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> such as waste products, and how to study the efficacy of some organo-minerals as fertilisers, taking into account the environmental effects of the heavy metals in them. Among the recommendations were the need for more training and incentives in fertiliser management, applications of local resources as fertilisers, and studies on new bio-fertiliser materials such as Azolla and water hyacinth.

40|$|From a {{study of}} the {{variation}} of nitrates in the soil known as terra roxa misturada (mixed purple soil), the following conclusions were drawn : a) The nitrate content of this soil reveals a periodic variation through the year. The same kind of variation is expected in the majority of S. Paulo soils, because the climate, with minor exceptions, is fairly uniform over the State. b) As nitrification proceeds at a higher rate in the hot wet (September-May) than in the cool dry season (May-September), nitrates accumulate in the soil during the first period and disappear in the second. However, as an exception to the above rule, there appeared to be a fall in nitrates during December. This may have been due, either to leaching by rain, or to absorption by weeds, then in their growing period in the experimental fields. Since inorganic <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> do not generally give good results in the State of S. Paulo, when applied {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season, it is logical to attribute the decrease in nitrogen content to leaching, although the investigation did not lead to a conclusive explanation. c) This study did not support the view of an upward migration of salts in our soils during the dry months, since a steady level of nitrate content was observed during this period. d) Although the author was able to establish an association between nitrate losses and rainfall, it was not possible to determine the relation quantitatively...|$|R
