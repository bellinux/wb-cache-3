5000|$|... "When I did daytime before, they didn't {{have any}} blogs. So I didn't know when people didn't like me. Ignorance is bliss. I was like, 'I {{think this is}} fun,' and then I was reading a lot of {{negative}} stuff. It's hard {{not to take it}} personally. Than I thought, 'You know what? I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> to myself. I'm just going to do the best job I can."—Noelle Beck ...|$|E

5000|$|Matt Cain {{writing in}} The Independent {{refuses to be}} {{critical}} [...] "a reviewer is only ever respected if he demolishes someone's work {{and even if he}} loves it can often feel duty-bound to toss in at least one criticism. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> as I think Us is a perfect book. And I don't care if that means I've failed as a reviewer, because I've already won as a reader." ...|$|E
5000|$|Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania {{to produce}} Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, {{following}} {{the success of}} Girls Aloud's debut album Sound of the Underground. Xenomania produced {{all four of the}} album's singles. [...] "When the second album came round, the label said, 'Listen, we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> group any more if you don't do it.'" [...] Higgins explained. [...] "I think my initial reaction was to do a few tracks and he said, 'No, you have to do this because I think you're the only person who understands exactly what it is'. So, that's how we took it on." ...|$|E
5000|$|Carefree, Jerry strolls {{down the}} sidewalk, and Tom jumps out {{from around the}} corner with a plate, fork, knife, and a napkin around his neck. As Jerry screeches {{to a stop and}} reverses direction, Tom sneaks around the fence and holds out two pieces of bread as the mouse heads towards him, such that Jerry is unable to stop in time. Just as Tom starts to cut the bread in half with Jerry in it, Jerry {{whistles}} and Spike saves him by grabbing Tom in the neck. He checks on Jerry to make sure he's O.K. and then issues Tom with an ultimatum: the cat will better to leave Jerry alone and <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> trouble or he will face the consequences. To prove his point, Spike squashes Tom into an accordion before walking off, reminding his pal once again to just whistle. Seeing an opportunity to provoke Tom, Jerry picks up a tiny board and challenges the cat to a fight, who flicks the board away and prepares to punch the mouse. Then Jerry whistles before Spike zooms in and his own punch lands onto his Tom's face, which leaves the cat dazed in front of a mailbox behind him. Once again, Spike reminds to Jerry: [...] "Anytime, chum".|$|E

5000|$|When she {{graduated}} from college, she {{became president of the}} Lexington NAACP. She attended the NAACP national convention in New York, and with some members from Ohio, agreed to participate in an experiment that would test White America's racism. She agreed that she would travel with some male NAACP members by car from New York to Lexington through Virginia and Maryland—and back again to New York. On the way to Kentucky, they drove [...] "a fairly good little old car, not fancy or anything, just a good, old running car" [...] and were dressed in their regular business professional clothes. Grevious described the reactions from White business owners when they stopped: [...] "We weren't served any place. Now a couple of places said they would fix us some food in a box, in a sack if we came around to the back door to get it. Of course, naturally you were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> Then the plan was to get back to Lexington, the NAACP rented a limousine for us, furs for me, jewelry -- not African dress like they do now so much, but different. And I was to sit in the back, one young man was to be dressed up in a suit all the time and the other was to be the chauffeur. And we were to head back and stop at the very same places {{all the way back to}} New York. And we were served at every place that we stopped except one. And the conclusion that we came to was that they weren't quite sure who I was. Same people, we were still clean when we went before only this time I had some furs in the hot summertime wrapped around me and jewelry... so they were quite sure whether this was a foreigner coming through and they served us. ... this is what really got me into the serious part of making a change ... got me into the Movement one hundred and ten percent." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig {{was asked if}} he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make another Danzig record after Deth Red Sabaoth.

With the way record sales are now...I won't do some stupid pro-tool record in someone's living room where all the drum beats are stolen from somebody and just mashed together...and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that if I can't do a record how I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and if it's not financially feasible, I'm just <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one." ...|$|R
