5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, <b>neonatal</b> death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, <b>neonatal</b> conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and <b>neonatal</b> deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{preclinical}} {{studies have been}} conducted using MFGM and combinations of MFGM-derived components. Liu et al. (2014) studied brain development and spatial learning and memory in <b>neonatal</b> piglets.|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & <b>Neonatal</b> Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the <b>Neonatal</b> Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from <b>neonatal</b> heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the <b>neonatal</b> benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other <b>neonatal</b> withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Scott Paper {{created the}} Sandra Schmirler Foundation in January 2001, with the {{assistance}} of the Canadian Curling Association and Scott Paper Limited. The foundation raises funds to help care for babies in crisis through direct donations to benefit <b>neonatal</b> care across Canada. In the charity's first four years of existence donations were made to the Children's Miracle Network, Canadian Cystic Fybrosis Foundation and Canadian Ronald McDonald Houses. After altering the charity's mission to focus on <b>neonatal</b> care, donations have been made directly to hospitals in Halifax, Regina, London, Lethbridge, Hamilton and Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Protocols for {{avoidance}} {{of the effects}} of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including underwater diving using compressed breathing gases, hyperbaric medicine, <b>neonatal</b> care and human spaceflight. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.|$|E
5|$|Tyler is {{an active}} {{supporter}} of the charitable United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). She was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United States in 2003. In November 2004, she hosted the lighting of the UNICEF Snowflake in New York City. Tyler also served as spokesperson for the 2004 Givenchy Mother's Day promotion, in support of UNICEF's Maternal and <b>Neonatal</b> Tetanus campaign.|$|E
25|$|While {{this model}} of infant care is {{substantially}} different from the typical Western <b>neonatal</b> intensive-care unit (NICU) procedures described here, the two are not mutually exclusive, and {{it is estimated that}} more than 200 <b>neonatal</b> intensive care units practice kangaroo care today. One recent survey found that 82 percent of <b>neonatal</b> intensive care units use kangaroo care in the United States today.|$|E
25|$|Phenobarbital is the {{first-line}} {{choice for}} the treatment of <b>neonatal</b> seizures. Concerns that <b>neonatal</b> seizures in themselves could be harmful make most physicians treat them aggressively. No reliable evidence, though, supports this approach.|$|E
25|$|The neuropsychological {{effect on}} the bonding between mother and child, on later contact with health professionals, and on {{personal}} and social psychological well-being is difficult to quantify. Research suggests that babies exposed to pain in the <b>neonatal</b> period have more difficulty in these areas. Professionals {{working in the field}} of <b>neonatal</b> pain have speculated that adolescent aggression and self-destructive behaviour, including suicide, may, in some cases, be attributed to the long-term effects of untreated <b>neonatal</b> pain.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Marfan-progeroid-lipodystrophy {{syndrome}} typically exhibit congenital lipodystrophy and a <b>neonatal</b> progeroid appearance. Sometimes {{identified as}} having <b>neonatal</b> progeroid syndrome, the term is a misnomer since they do not exhibit accelerated aging. The condition is caused by mutations near the 3'-terminus of the FBN1 gene.|$|E
25|$|Transient <b>neonatal</b> {{diabetes}} mellitus can also involve imprinting.|$|E
25|$|Natal and <b>neonatal</b> {{teeth are}} an anomaly that {{involves}} teeth erupting in a newborn infant’s mouth earlier than usual. The incidence ranges from 1:2,000 to 1:3,500 births. Natal teeth are more frequent, approximately {{three times more}} common than <b>neonatal</b> teeth. Some authors reported a higher prevalence in females than males. The most common location is the mandibular region of the central incisors. Natal teeth and <b>neonatal</b> teeth are associated with genetics, developmental abnormalities and certain recognized syndromes. Additional names for this condition include precocious dentition, baby teeth, and milk teeth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neonatal</b> lupus is the {{occurrence}} of SLE symptoms in an infant born from a mother with SLE, most commonly presenting with a rash resembling discoid lupus erythematosus, and sometimes with systemic abnormalities such as heart block or enlargement of the liver and spleen. <b>Neonatal</b> lupus is usually benign and self-limited.|$|E
25|$|Obstetric complications: {{prenatal}} and perinatal complications may factor {{into the}} development of anorexia nervosa, such as maternal anemia, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, placental infarction, and <b>neonatal</b> cardiac abnormalities. <b>Neonatal</b> complications may also have an influence on harm avoidance, one of the personality traits associated with {{the development of}} AN.|$|E
25|$|Children’s health: Peri- and <b>neonatal</b> {{death rates}} increased. Failure to grow, {{intellectual}} impairment, etc.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis {{can also}} occur in {{neonates}} and {{is attributable to}} a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults. Congenital or perinatal infection with the hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause <b>neonatal</b> hepatitis. Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to <b>neonatal</b> hepatitis. Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated. <b>Neonatal</b> hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue. This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Intrauterine and <b>neonatal</b> insults (many {{of which}} are {{infectious}} in nature) increase the risk.|$|E

25|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} in pregnancy confers an increased rate of fetal death in utero, spontaneous abortion, and of <b>neonatal</b> lupus.|$|E
25|$|Results {{from another}} recent {{study suggest that}} fetuses were able to form both {{short and long term}} memories. This {{conclusion}} was drawn from the fact that habituation rates (number of stimuli needed to habituate) were higher in babies in the <b>neonatal</b> stage that had not previously undergone fetal stimulations when compared to those who had: therefore demonstrating the memory of the stimulus in its fetal stage being carried into the <b>neonatal</b> stage.|$|E
