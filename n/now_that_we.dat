Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in Xenosaga, others are more like self-parodies, so we don't really want Xenogears fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it's similar to that.|$|E

Skipper W was named grand champion stallion at the three shows he attended, the 1948 National Western Stock Show in Denver, the 1948 Colorado State Fair, and the 1948 New Mexico State Fair.

500|$|Some {{scholars}} and critics challenge {{the validity of}} Pinter's critiques of what he terms [...] "the modes of thinking of those in power" [...] or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work. In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being [...] "terribly disturbed {{as a young man}} by the Cold War. And McCarthyism... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I felt very strongly then and feel as strongly <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have an obligation to subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny."

Historians point out that the stability of the frontier over the centuries is remarkable, although Nisibis, Singara, Dara and other cities of upper Mesopotamia changed hands from time to time, and the possession of these frontier cities gave one empire a trade advantage over the other.

500|$|Hearing {{reports of}} the heavy {{fighting}} taking place between the junction and the Chinese Farm, Dayan suggested withdrawing Matt's brigade and canceling the operation. He voiced concerns that the paratroopers were threatened with annihilation and noted that all attempts to open a corridor for the bridges had failed. Gonen rejected the suggestion, stating that, [...] "If we knew in advance {{this was going to}} happen we would not have started the crossing operation, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have crossed then let us follow through to the bitter end." [...] Bar-Lev concurred with Gonen, and Dayan decided not to press his suggestion. At around 6:00 AM, Golda Meir telephoned Dayan to inquire about the situation. Dayan informed her that the bridges had not yet been laid and that the Egyptians had closed the routes leading to Deveroir. He also stated there were high hopes that Egyptian resistance would be overcome and that the bridges would be laid during the morning. Dayan also told her that Matt's paratrooper brigade had crossed to the west bank without encountering resistance and that Southern Command, as yet, had no intentions of withdrawing the brigade, even if the bridge-laying was delayed.|$|E

She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies."

500|$|Due to {{the controversies}} {{surrounding}} the Beatles during their tour, critical {{reaction in the}} United States was muted relative to the band's previous releases. According to Rodriguez, in its attempts to redefine the limits of pop music, Revolver emphasised the need for genuine rock criticism, a form of journalism that would become commonplace from 1967 onwards. KRLA Beat reviewer described Revolver as [...] "a musical creation of exceptional excellence" [...] while lamenting that, {{in the wake of}} the acclaimed Rubber Soul, [...] "it is receiving only a fraction of the attention and respect due". Writing in the recently launched Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams gave the US version of the album a mixed review, in which he admired [...] "Love You To" [...] and [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] but derided [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Yellow Submarine". According to Turner, the album's combination of novel sounds and unusual subject matter [...] "challenged all the conventions of pop" [...] and it was the upcoming generation of writers who [...] "got it immediately". Among these, Richard Goldstein of The Village Voice described Revolver as [...] "a revolutionary record" [...] that was [...] "as important to the expansion of pop as was Rubber Soul". He added: [...] "it seems <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will view this album in retrospect as a key work in the development of rock and roll into an artistic pursuit..." [...] Another writer identified by Turner, Jules Siegel, likened Revolver to works by John Donne, Milton and Shakespeare, saying that the band's lyrics would provide the basis for scholarly analysis well into the future.|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want to do, what good is the power? Let's test {{it and try to}} get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E
