Among various 2 D-carrier systems, such as field effect transistors and heterostructures, polar materials hold a unique potential; the spontaneous electric polarization in the bulk could generate positive and <b>negative</b> 2 D <b>carriers</b> {{at the surface}}. Although several experiments have shown ambipolar carriers at {{the surface of a}} polar semiconductor BiTeI, their origin is yet to be specified.

Experiment and simulation fit nicely and the time dependence of the electroluminescence intensity is accounted for by the charge behaviour. Light emission scales with the injection current.

The {{method is to}} measure {{the change in the}} reflection coefficient of a microwave cavity caused by the admission of ions. The measured relaxation times can be combined with the known dc mobilities of the ions to yield values for the effective masses. Most extensive measurements were performed using positive ions in He II. A temperature-dependent effective mass, increasing from approximately 40 helium masses at 1. 3 K to over twice this value near the lambda point is found. The data are shown to be consistent with the electrostriction model of the ion, including contributions to the mass from both normal and superfluid components. A core radius of approximately 6 Å is shown to account both for the mass and for the mobility in the viscous flow region. Data on the <b>negative</b> <b>carrier</b> near 1. 8 K yield an effective mass of 100 to 200 helium masses, and are consistent with the bubble model. The radius implied both by the mass and an analysis of mobility data in the viscous flow regime is 14 ± 3 Å, quite consistent with the value deduced from other measurements. A measurement on the positive carrier in saturated (NBP) helium vapor indicates a mass of 75 ± 20 helium masses.

40|$|An inverse {{relationship}} {{exists between the}} net electrical charge of immunogens and the antibodies they elicit (1). Results of an earlier study have demonstrated that the net charge phenomenon has a cellular basis, since the immune response potential of murine spleen cells to 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) on a negatively charged synthetic polypeptide carrier was reduced by cell fractionation over negatively charged glass beads, whereas {{the response to the}} same hapten on a positively charged carrier was unaffected (14). To verify that the net charge correlation is expressed at the cellular level, spleen cells were fractionated over positively charged poly-L-lysine-coated glass bead columns, and their immunocompetence to DNP on positively and negatively charged carriers was tested by cell transfers in irradiated recipient mice. In this case, the fractionated cells showed reduced response potential to DNP on the positively charged carrier only. Thus, the cellular basis of the net charge phenomenon has been demonstrated for both positively and negatively charged immunogens (for the same specificity) by cell separation techniques over columns of opposite charge. In order to establish whether the cell population relevant for the charge properties of immunogens was of thymus or marrow origin, thymocytes and bone marrow cells were selectively passed over positively or negatively charged columns and mixed with unfractionated cells of the complementary type. Transfers of the filtered and unfiltered cell mixtures in irradiated recipient mice immunized with DNP on either a positive or a negative synthetic polypeptide carrier indicated that fractionation of thymocytes, but not of marrow cells, correlated with the spleen population. Thus, thymocytes fractionated over negatively charged columns and mixed with unfractionated marrow cells exhibited reduced response to DNP on the <b>negative</b> <b>carrier,</b> but normal responses to DNP on the positive carrier. The opposite result was obtained when thymocytes were passed over positively charged columns. No effect on the anti-DNP response was detected by filtration of bone marrow cells over columns of either charge. These findings indicate {{that it is possible to}} distinguish between thymocytes on the basis of their capacity to react with more acidic or more basic surfaces and that a population of thymus-derived cells may recognize immunogens on the basis of their overall electrical charge.

40|$|For decades {{serological}} methods {{seemed to}} be useful and sufficient to diagnose BLV infection in cattle. Repeatedly it was found out, that antigen variants and outcoming antibody (AK) -serotypes do not appear. The occurence of serological negative provirus carrying cattle {{and the lack of}} BLV-provirus in Enzym-Linked-Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) - and Agargel-Immunodiffusion-Test (AGID) -positive animals lead to the assumption, that with the selection of BLV free herds specific mutants of provirus dominated. For this reason the aim of the paper was to investigate the nucleotid sequence of different BLV isolates and the resulting aminoacid sequence in consideration of the serological state and geograpical origin of the infected cattle. Simultaneously the influence of nucleid- and aminoacid-changes on the RNA- and protein-secundary structure should be investigated. Especially in the veterinary medicine DNA sequence analysis is limited because it is much timeconsuming and expensive. For this reaseon different sequencing methods should be compared with respect to their practicability and rentability. 1. In comparison of different "Sanger principle" using sequencing methods (method after Sommer, Hot Tub sequencing, T 7 -Sequencing and Auto Read sequencing) with respect to practicability and rentability the T 7 -sequencing method was the most suitable. With a minimum of 1, 5 - 2, 0 µg ds DNA up to 450 nucleotides could be read during 4 h from a vertical, wedge-shaped gel. 2. The direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products in comparision with the sequencing of cloned PCR products has various advantages: less time consuming, high purity of DNA template and less danger of sequencing DNA fragments with PCR induced mutationes. The quantity of detectable nucleotides sequencing PCR products synthesized in single- or double PCR with a maximum of 230 bp was lower than sequencing cloned PCR products. Using fragments from asymmetric PCR´s the number of detectable nucleotides were raised to 400 bp. 3. Investigations for the detection of BLV provirus in 37 cattle of different herds with ELISA, AGID, leucocyte short term culture and PCR enabled a division of the probands into four groups: 10 animals (27 %) serology positive, carrier of provirus; group 1 3 animals (8 %) serology uncertain, carrier of provirus; group 2 10 animals (27 %) serology <b>negative,</b> <b>carrier</b> of provirus; group 3 14 animals (38 %) serology negative, no carrier of provirus group 4 4. The comparison of the diagnostic methods AGID, ELISA, leucocyte short term culture and PCR showed, that the ELISA is not sufficient to detecte all provirus carrier. The PCR is necessary for the detection of cattle with weak serological signals in BLV eradication. 5. The sequencing of the BLV long terminal repeat (LTR) region from FLK (fetal lamb kidney) -BLV provirus is highly comperable with the Japanese isolat (Sagata et al., 1985 a). Two detected nucleitid substitutiones found in this region were in structural less significant regions of the sequence. 6. The DNA sequencing of parts from the envelope (env) - polymerase- and Tax protein (tax) -region of BLV indicate the existence of three groups of mutants from BLV: BLV-D+ (BLV mutant of serology positive, carrier of provirus) BLV-D+/- (BLV mutant of serology instable, carrier of provirus) BLV-D- (BLV mutant of serology negative, no carrier of provirus) 7. For the occurence of serologic negative cattle there are at least four reasonable explanationes: congenital immuntolerance following intrauterin infection BLV provirus detection in the early stage of BLV infection, before detectable antibody titers have developed selection of virus mutants whith weak immunogenicity (BLV virus selection hypothesis) selection of cattle with weakly immune response by parallel working with different eradication concepts (BLV host selection hypothesis) 8. Changes in nucleotid sequence influence the RNA- and protein secundary structure. Potentiell splice donors and acceptors are mainly conservative. BLV isolates from some seropositive cattle were lacking the gp 51 sequence epitop G. 9. The result of the study indicate that there is a relation between the serological state of the infected cattle and the DNA sequence of the BLV mutant but not between BLV provirus mutant and the geographical origion of the host. 10. Partial DNA sequencing of the tax - and env -region of the BLV from different FLK-sublines show, that there are differences beetween the FLK-sublines as well as between other BLV isolates. This difference indicates an antigenic drift between BLV proviruses that may influence the suitability of FLK-BLV antigenes in test systems for diagnosis of bovine leukosis infection...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} a self-consistent quantum {{molecular}} dynamics approach to calculate the mobility of both positive and <b>negative</b> polaron-type <b>carriers</b> on isolated chains of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) {{and some of its}} derivatives and the dependence of their mobility on the applied electric field. Our results suggest that polaron-type mobility along most of these polymer chains has a clear dependence on the electric field which {{is quite different from the}} result derived for bulk PPV-based materials. 1...|$|R
