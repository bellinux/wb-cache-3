The only chance of success now is if Rosie continues impersonating Joanna. Sam persuades Rosie, against her better judgement, to do so.|$|E

Reinhold arrived in the valley six days later with severe frostbite, but survived. His brother, Günther, however died on the Diamir Face—according to Reinhold Messner on the same descent, during which they became further and further separated from each other. As a result, the time, place and exact cause of death is unknown. Messner claimed his brother had been swept away by an avalanche.|$|E

25|$|The ground barely {{changed from}} then until the mid-1980s. During {{this time the}} ground had a hump in {{the centre of the}} ground making only the top half of players visible {{from the other side of}} the ground. There was a shed for players located where the main {{pavilion}} now stands. There was a hill on the outer (where the hill <b>now</b> <b>is)</b> <b>that</b> could accommodate two rows of vehicles, the small scoreboard stood on the outer close to where the electronic scoreboard is now, and the time clock sat about halfway up a training light tower. The police booth sat, until very recently, in the north-east corner of the oval.

[...] In the Champions League, he started in the semi-final first leg against Real Madrid; the team lost 2–0 and were defeated 3–1 on aggregate. In May 2002, Rexach was dismissed and replaced by Louis van Gaal, who was managing the club for a second time. Overmars was wary of the appointment beforehand, saying, [...] "Van Gaal is a good manager, but I do not know if his return would be good for Barcelona."

500|$|Gillard, as a Member of Parliament, {{voted against}} {{a bill that}} would have legalised {{same-sex}} marriage in Australia in 2011. In 2010 she stated [...] "the Marriage Act is appropriate in its current form, that is recognising that marriage is between a man and a woman" [...] and that marriage being between a man and woman [...] "has a special status". The triennial Labor conference held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. When the private members bill was introduced by Labor backbencher Stephen Jones, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012. In September 2014, Gillard said that the [...] "course of human history <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we are going to see same-sex marriage here and in, you know, most parts of the developed world." [...] She declared her support for same-sex marriage in August 2015.|$|E

[...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I have <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website describes the character as the [...] "powerful millionaire-tycoon {{with a secret}} agenda to take everything from his long-lost mother Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)." [...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E
500|$|When {{producers}} realised that Paul's behaviour {{had gone}} too far, they considered killing him off. Dennis commented [...] "As an actor, I had the best time because this character just got more evil and more sneaky, more of a cad and a womaniser and it just escalated where {{it got to the}} point where it just got silly. It was ridiculous for the supposed reality of the show." [...] The actor also said that he accepted the producers decision to kill his character off when they explained that they did not know where to take him. However, the show's then executive producer Ric Pellizzeri decided to save the character and redeem him by giving him a brain tumour. Following the removal of the brain tumour, Paul mellowed in his evil ways. Of Paul's dramatic change to his personality, post brain tumour, Dennis compared the differences stating: [...] "He's changed back to where he was 18 odd years ago. What he has become is the same Paul he was back then when he was a very ambitious young entrepreneur with Lassiters and Robinson Corporation. But the difference <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he is older and wiser and therefore a lot more shrewd and a lot more careful. Post brain tumor, he is no longer evil, more ruthless than evil. Ruthless with a conscience and emotion." ...|$|E

He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, {{but the good news is}} that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing.

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E

Dudley hinted that he had acted on the {{authority}} of Prince and Council and by warrant of the Great Seal. Answered that the Great Seal of a usurper was worth nothing, he asked [...] "whether any such persons as were equally culpable of that crime ... might be his judges". After sentence was passed, he begged the Queen's mercy for his five sons, the eldest of whom was condemned with him, the rest waiting for their trials. He also asked to [...] "confess to a learned divine" [...] and was visited by Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who had passed most of Edward's reign in the Tower and was now Mary's Lord Chancellor. The Duke's execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning; however, it was suddenly cancelled. Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula, where he took the Catholic communion and professed that [...] "the plagues that is upon the realm and upon us <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we have erred from the faith these sixteen years." [...] A great propaganda coup for the new government, Dudley's words were officially distributed—especially in the territories of the Emperor Charles V. In the evening the Duke learnt [...] "that I must prepare myself against tomorrow to receive my deadly stroke", as {{he wrote in a}} desperate plea to the Earl of Arundel: [...] "O my good lord remember how sweet life is, and how bitter ye contrary."
