40|$|The oral {{administration}} to rats of the calcium antagonists nifedipine, nisoldipine and <b>niludipine</b> (3 mg/kg, 1 - 1. 25 h before acute coronary ligation) greatly reduced {{the duration of}} ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VF) occurring in the first 30 min post-ligation period. The duration of VF was especially reduced (by 74 - 92 %). None of the animals so treated died compared with a 40 % mortality in the controls...|$|E
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} the dihydropyndine slow channel calcium blocking agents, nifedipine, nitrendipine, FR 34235, ni-ludipine and nisoldipine were compared to the vasodilator, hy-dralazine, in conscious, instrumented dogs before and after propranolol (2 mg/kg i. v.). The calcium-blocking agents (1. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 1 0. 0 and 25. 0 g/kg/min i. v.) and hydralazine (0. 01, 0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 1 0 and 0. 25 mg/kg/mm i. v.) produced dose-related de-creases in blood pressure and reflex increases in heart rate and heart rate-systolic pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen consumption. Hydralazine also produced a reflex in-crease in myocardial contractility (+dP/dt); however, minimal changes in contractility were observed with the dihydropyndines. Nisoldipine, nitrendipine and FR 34235 were relatively more effective in reducing arterial pressure than <b>niludipine,</b> nifedipin...|$|E
