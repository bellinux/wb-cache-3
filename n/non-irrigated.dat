25|$|Crop {{areas were}} farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on <b>non-irrigated</b> {{cultivation}} (secano), which made up 85% {{of the entire}} crop area, depended solely on rainfall {{as a source of}} water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regadío) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.|$|E

This {{case study}} {{investigated}} the impact of irrigation on household food security at Ibu and Kalizinje villages in Chingale, Malawi. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether irrigation improved household food security. The study was qualitative in nature. Fifty-eight farmers and three World Vision field staff participated in the study. Group discussions with participatory techniques and in-depth interviews were used to collect data. Data were analysed qualitatively using matrix/logical analysis. Irrigation improved irrigating farmers’ household food security through an increase in production and income levels. Irrigating farmers were better off in terms of crop production and income levels than <b>non-irrigating</b> farmers. Irrigating farmers planted irrigated maize two to three times a year, while <b>non-irrigating</b> farmers planted rain-fed maize only once a year. In terms of income levels, irrigating farmers produced more food than households required, and sold surpluses. Most irrigating farmers began cash cropping after the introduction of irrigation and also earned higher incomes, as irrigation enabled production of crops during lean periods and enabled them to sell surpluses at higher prices. Irrigation did not improve crop diversification. <b>Non-irrigating</b> farmers diversified crops more than irrigating farmers by planting groundnuts and sweet potatoes. Income from irrigating farmers did not increase dietary diversity and the acquisition of assets for irrigating farmers. Few farmers consumed a variety of foods and few acquired assets with the income derived from irrigation. Nevertheless, irrigation has the potential to smooth production cycles and provide food and income during seasons when food and income would be low. In addition, the study revealed the following as problems faced by farmers: constraining size of small diesel pumps, pump breakdown at Kalizinje, floods, pests and diseases, storage problems, lack of market places and poor roads, small land sizes, and expensive farm inputs...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} government of Tigray has invested {{millions of dollars}} to develop irrigation schemes as a strategy of poverty reduction. However, there has been limited attempt to analyze whether these investments have attained their stated objectives of poverty reduction and overall socio-economic enhancement. Therefore, we endeavor to: (1) evaluate the impacts of access to small-scale irrigation on farm household's income and poverty status, (2) contribute to the scant literature on irrigation and poverty reduction in Ethiopia, and (3) provide information for policy makers. We examine a representative sample of 613 farm households (331 irrigators and 282 non-irrigators) drawn using three-stage stratified sampling with Probability Proportional to Size. We find that the average income of <b>non-irrigating</b> households is less than that of the irrigating households by about 50 %. The overall average income gain due to access to irrigation ranges from 4000 Birr to 4500 Birr per household per annum. We find also that farming income is more important to irrigating households than to <b>non-irrigating</b> households, and off-farm income is negatively related with access to irrigation.

40|$|This study uses Tobit and Logit {{models to}} examine the impacts of {{selected}} small-scale irrigation schemes in the Lake Tana basin of Ethiopia on household income {{and the likelihood of}} poverty, respectively. Data for these analyses were collected from a sample of 180 households. Households using any of the four irrigation systems had statistically significantly higher mean total gross household income than households not using irrigation. The marginal impact of small-scale irrigation on gross household income indicated that each small scale-irrigation user increased mean annual household income by ETB 3353 per year, a 27 % increase over income for <b>non-irrigating</b> households. A Logit regression model indicated that access to irrigation significantly reduced the odds that a household would be in the lowest quartile of household income, the poverty threshold used in this study. Households using concrete canal river diversion had higher mean cropping income per household than those using other irrigation types.

40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} (ECV) is a micrometeorological {{mass transfer}} method for measuring evapotranspiration (ET) {{which has been}} used successfully {{for the last decade}} to measure evapotranspiration from natural and agricultural plant communities. However, no such usage has been reported in relation to evaporation losses occurring during sprinkler irrigation. Instead, sprinkler irrigation research has focused on using traditional methods acknowledged to have many limitations. In this field study, the feasibility of precision energy budget measurement, utilising ECV, to measure the total ET during sprinkler irrigation over different surfaces has been established. The trials were carried out at small scale using a low-pressure impact type sprinkler irrigation system over bare soil, grass and cotton during the Australian summer of 2010 – 11. All radiation components plus soil heat flux were measured. The sensible and latent heat fluxes measured using ECV were used to deduce instantaneous Bowen ratio values and hence partition the energy available for sensible plus latent heat (ET) transport. From the measurements of energy fluxes, the effect of advection on irrigation was inferred. Non-dimensionalisation of measured ET permitted comparison of the rate of change of ET in different phases of measurement, i. e. pre-, during and post-irrigation. Results indicated that the technique was clearly able to measure the different rates of total evaporation over the short crops before, during and after sprinkler irrigation and a relative ET discrimination of order 0. 06 mm h− 1 was achieved, equivalent to a discrimination in the difference between irrigation and nonirrigation evaporation rates of ± 11 %. In addition, the results showed that nondimensional ET ranged from 1. 4 to 1. 6 times the reference (<b>non-irrigating)</b> ET value for mature cotton of height approaching 1 m. ...|$|R
40|$|Smallholder {{irrigation}} farming is potentially transformative to poor communities. Although {{previous studies have}} examined the relationship between smallholder {{irrigation farming}} and livelihoods in South Africa, little has been done to quantify the contribution and to examine how benefits from smallholder irrigation are distributed across different types of households. It is often assumed that the benefits flowing from irrigation farming will be distributed evenly among the irrigators. Furthermore, previous studies have focused on farmers operating on irrigation schemes to the exclusion of independent smallholder irrigation farmers. This thesis aims to examine the contribution of smallholder irrigation farming to rural livelihoods in South Africa, specifically the contribution of smallholder irrigation farming to improved household income and food security as pathways out of poverty for rural households. The study provides a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of smallholder irrigation farming on rural livelihoods by including independent irrigators. Specifically, the study addresses the following questions: How has smallholder irrigation farming contributed to household income and food security in the study area? Are household income and food security significant pathways through which smallholder irrigation farming contributes to rural livelihoods? To what extent does smallholder irrigation farming contribute to household income and food security? What factors determine benefit distribution among irrigators? The study was conducted in Mopani district in the Greater Tzaneen municipality of Limpopo Province of South Africa in 2013. Julesburg irrigation scheme, located in the former Gazankulu and Lebowakgomo homelands, formed the anchor of the study area. Data were collected through a survey of 180 rural households, 27 of which were smallholder irrigation scheme farmers, 35 smallholder non-irrigation scheme farmers (independent irrigators), 53 smallholder farmers practising home gardening and 65 other households that included dryland farmers {{and those who did not}} practise farming. The households were selected from villages in the vicinity of the irrigation scheme. Farming households represented three groups of farmers, namely, scheme irrigators, independent irrigators and home gardeners. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with the sampled households. Data analysis employed econometric regression models, semi-parametric propensity score matching techniques and the analysis of variance to compare livelihood outcomes between irrigating and <b>non-irrigating</b> households. Irrigation was the treatment and non-irrigators were used as a control group for propensity score matching. Results of the survey identified substantial differences in the capital base among home gardener, scheme and independent irrigator households. Households involved in irrigation farming had a stronger capital base in terms of natural, physical and financial capital. Differences in the capital base existed even if income flows from agriculture were not considered, suggesting that participation in irrigation farming positively affects the overall capital base of rural households. The results also provide sufficient evidence that smallholder irrigation farming makes a significant contribution to rural livelihoods through its effect on household income and food security. Irrigators were found to have a significantly higher household income and were more food-secure than their <b>non-irrigating</b> counterparts, suggesting that smallholder irrigation contributed positively to rural livelihoods. This provides a strong motivation for continued investment in smallholder irrigation farming in South Africa as part of a strategy to improve rural livelihoods and to grow the rural economy. However, the benefits from irrigation accrue unevenly for different types of farmers and, therefore, they are not equally successful. The main determinants of benefit distribution were: adequacy of source of water for farming, gender and marital status of the household head, ownership of transport means and access to financial services. The contribution of smallholder irrigation to rural livelihoods can be further enhanced by focusing on policies that enhance female participation in irrigation farming, equip farmers with entrepreneurial skills, encourage membership of associations and enhance the effectiveness of the associations to allow more farmers to participate in irrigation farming. As independent irrigators benefit more from smallholder irrigation farming, independent irrigation should be promoted as an option for expanding smallholder irrigation farming. Such policies should be integrated into the overall strategy of growing the rural economy within the National Development Plan of the country.
