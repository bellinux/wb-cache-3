To develop such a diagram, {{it is necessary to}} find the corresponding value of the relative deformation of the least compressed (stretched) fibre of the steel shell ε_pmin.

Depending on a single parameter of the helix, we warp it onto an arc of circle or onto a line segment. For those latter skeletons closed form convolutions are known for entire families of kernels.
