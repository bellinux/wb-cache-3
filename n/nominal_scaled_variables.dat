40|$|Background: The University of Witten/Herdecke {{was founded}} in 1983 as the first private {{university}} in Germany to teach medicine. The University {{is not part of}} the centralized state system of medical placement distribution but rather has its own concept and procedure relating to its choice of students. In order to evaluate reliability and validity of the process of selecting medical students at the University of Witten/Herdecke, the first step was to analyse the interview selection process. Material and methods: The basic foundation of this examination were the results of the interview period of of the admission process from 1999 to 2000. In order to test inter-rater-reliability of the interviewers, a modified Cohen Kappa coefficient for multiple <b>nominal</b> <b>scaled</b> <b>variables</b> was used with regards to the group as a whole and also individually for the subgroups gender, admission year, age-groups and A Level results. Results: With Kappa-values ranging from 0. 70 in 2000 to 0. 88 in 1999 the reliability of the interviewer-process is obvious. However there are clear differences in the two years examined with regards to agreement in the decisions of interviewers. In the subgroup analysis with regards to gender no differences in the Kappa values were seen (male: 0, 81; female: 0. 8). Slightly less agreement can be seen with regards to subgroup analyses of A Level results of applicants ranging from 0. 76 to 0. 82. Discussion: In summary, this study shows that the application selection procedure for medicine at the medical faculty of the University of Witten/Herdecke is a reliable instrument with a high inter-rater reliability. This remains the case even though the interviewers do not seem to have standardized decision making criteria. Whether individual criteria/constellations were decisive with regards to the decision making process will be the subject of a further study...|$|E

The term paper shall be an independent work demonstrating how multiple regression can be used to analyze a social science problem. The paper should be written as a journal article, but with more detailed documentation of data and analysis, for example by means of appendices. B. SUGGESTED PROCEDURE Based on sociological or political science theory a problem discussion should explain the reasons for analysing the variation in an appropriately chosen dependent variable. The dependent and independent variables can either be taken from a data set prepared for the class (see separate presentation) or they may be taken from data collected in other ways for example for your own masters thesis. Your own data will have to satisfy some minimum requirements securing that a valid multiple regression can be performed. Hence, use of your own data has to be approved. The requirement is basically that the dependent variable either is a measurement <b>scale</b> <b>variable</b> with sufficient variation for ordinary least squares regression or a <b>nominal</b> <b>scale</b> <b>variable</b> for logistic regression.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an empirical study to reveal rules associated with defect correction effort. We defined defect correction effort as a quantitative (ratio <b>scale)</b> <b>variable,</b> and extended conventional (<b>nominal</b> <b>scale</b> based) association rule mining to directly handle such quantitative variables. An extended rule describes the statistical {{characteristic of a}} ratio or interval <b>scale</b> <b>variable</b> in the consequent part of the rule by its mean value and standard deviation so that conditions producing distinctive statistics can be discovered. As an analysis target, we collected various attributes of about 1, 200 defects found in a typical medium-scale, multi-vendor (distance development) information system development project in Japan. Our findings based on extracted rules include: (1) Defects detected in coding/unit testing were easily corrected (less than 7 % of mean effort) when they are related to data output or validation of input data. (2) Nevertheless, they sometimes required much more effort (lift of standard deviation was 5. 845) in case of low reproducibility, (3) Defects introduced in coding/unit testing often required large correction effort (mean was 12. 596 staff-hours and standard deviation was 25. 716) when they were related to data handing. From these findings, we confirmed {{that we need to}} pay attention to types of defects having large mean effort as well as those having large standard deviation of effort since such defects sometimes cause excess effort. 1...|$|R

In order to avoid low response rates, follow-up letters and surveys were sent two weeks after the initial mailing. ^ The study utilized two independent variables: departmental affiliation and level of education. Seven dependent variables, concept learning score, student intellectual development score, vocational development score, external influences score, personal educational beliefs score, implicit objectives and actions score, and explicit objectives and actions score, were measured by sets of Likert-scale responses to survey items. ^ Independent variables were measured on the <b>nominal</b> <b>scale</b> and dependent <b>variables</b> were measured on the interval scale. The Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance was used to examine differences among groups. Significant differences were detected for the independent variables departmental affiliation and level of education.
