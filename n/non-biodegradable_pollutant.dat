30|$|Fluorine is {{the most}} {{electronegative}} element and belongs to halogen group with atomic weight 19 and atomic number 9. It exists as a diatomic molecule with remarkably low dissociation energy (38  kcal/mol). Fluoride is a persistent and <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutant</b> that accumulates in soil, plants, wildlife and human beings (Tomar and Kumar 2013). In soil fluoride presents as earth crust (0.6 – 0.9  %) commonly associated with volcanic activity and gases. It is also present in water and air. However, in air not large quantities but an average concentration of fluoride (0.5  µg/m 3) {{is found in the}} air (WHO 2004). Several fluoride-containing minerals such as topaz, fluorite, fluorapatite, cryolite, phosphorite, theorapatite, etc. are mainly responsible for fluoride contamination in groundwater and fluoride is also present in geochemical deposit which can be leached out by rainwater (Shahjee et al. 2013). Groundwater forms a major source of drinking water in urban as well as rural areas. According to previous researchers, excessive fluoride concentrations have been reported in groundwater in more than 20 developed and developing countries including India where 19 states are facing acute fluoride problems (Meenakshi and Maheshwari 2006). In West Bengal, major part of Birbhum, Bankura, Purulia, and part of Burdwan, are intensly affected by fluoride (Hernández-Montoyaa et al. 2012). Fluoride in drinking water is a pressing global issue as it can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis when present at levels above the World Health Organization (WHO 2008) drinking water guideline of 1.5 mg/l.|$|E
40|$|Substances emitted {{into the}} {{atmosphere}} by human activities in urban and industrial areas cause environmental problems such as air quality degradation, respiratory diseases, climate change, global warming, and stratospheric ozone depletion. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major air pollutants, emitted largely by industry, transportation and households. Many VOCs are toxic, and some {{are considered to be}} carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic. A wide spectrum of VOCs is readily oxidized photocatalytically. Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) over titanium dioxide may present a potential alternative to air treatment strategies currently in use, such as adsorption and thermal treatment, due to its advantageous activity under ambient conditions, although higher but still mild temperatures may also be applied. The objective of the present research was to disclose routes of chemical reactions, estimate the kinetics and the sensitivity of gas-phase PCO to reaction conditions in respect of air pollutants containing heteroatoms in their molecules. Deactivation of the photocatalyst and restoration of its activity was also taken under consideration to assess the practical possibility of the application of PCO to the treatment of air polluted with VOCs. UV-irradiated titanium dioxide was selected as a photocatalyst for its chemical inertness, non-toxic character and low cost. In the present work Degussa P 25 TiO 2 photocatalyst was mostly used. In transient studies platinized TiO 2 was also studied. The experimental research into PCO of following VOCs was undertaken: - methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as the basic oxygenated motor fuel additive and, thus, a major <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutant</b> of groundwater; - tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) as the primary product of MTBE hydrolysis and PCO; - ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol) as one of the reduced sulphur pungent air pollutants in the pulp-and-paper industry; - methylamine (MA) and dimethylamine (DMA) as the amino compounds often emitted by various industries. The PCO of VOCs was studied using a continuous-flow mode. The PCO of MTBE and TBA was also studied by transient mode, in which carbon dioxide, water, and acetone were identified as the main gas-phase products. The volatile products of thermal catalytic oxidation (TCO) of MTBE included 2 -methyl- 1 -propene (2 -MP), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water; TBA decomposed to 2 -MP and water. Continuous PCO of 4 TBA proceeded faster in humid air than dry air. MTBE oxidation, however, was less sensitive to humidity. The TiO 2 catalyst was stable during continuous PCO of MTBE and TBA above 373 K, but gradually lost activity below 373 K; the catalyst could be regenerated by UV irradiation in the absence of gas-phase VOCs. Sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water were identified as ultimate products of PCO of ethanethiol. Acetic acid was identified as a photocatalytic oxidation by-product. The limits of ethanethiol concentration and temperature, at which the reactor performance was stable for indefinite time, were established. The apparent reaction kinetics appeared to be independent of the reaction temperature within the studied limits, 373 to 453 K. The catalyst was completely and irreversibly deactivated with ethanethiol TCO. Volatile PCO products of MA included ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and water. Formamide was observed among DMA PCO products together with others similar to the ones of MA. TCO for both substances resulted in the formation of ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water. No deactivation of the photocatalyst during the multiple long-run experiments was observed at the concentrations and temperatures used in the study. PCO of MA was also studied in the aqueous phase. Maximum efficiency was achieved in an alkaline media, where MA exhibited high fugitivity. Two mechanisms of aqueous PCO – decomposition to formate and ammonia, and oxidation of organic nitrogen directly to nitrite - lead ultimately to carbon dioxide, water, ammonia and nitrate: formate and nitrite were observed as intermediates. A part of the ammonia formed in the reaction was oxidized to nitrite and nitrate. This finding helped in better understanding of the gasphase PCO pathways. The PCO kinetic data for VOCs fitted well to the monomolecular Langmuir- Hinshelwood (L-H) model, whereas TCO kinetic behaviour matched the first order process for volatile amines and the L-H model for others. It should be noted that both LH and the first order equations were only the data fit, not the real description of the reaction kinetics. The dependence of the kinetic constants on temperature was established {{in the form of an}} Arrhenius equation...|$|E

Fe-ions deposited onto chemically treated C fabrics or encapsulated in Nation thin films cast directly onto the carbon fabrics are efficient in decomposing H 2 O 2 used as an oxidant in the photo-assisted abatement of non-biodegradable azo-dyes used in textiles. The Orange II taken as a model pollutant quickly fades under solar irradiation even at an initial pH 6. This range of pH is not possible with the homogeneous photo-Fenton process. In contrast, the use of supported catalysts on C fabrics allows the costly pH adjustment to be avoided.

30|$|The {{discharge}} of the untreated wastewater containing the aniline derivatives is {{harmful to the}} water bodies (Sun et al. 2008). Hence, the removal of these aniline derivatives from the industrial wastewater {{is very important to}} reduce the pollution of the water bodies. The physical, biological and chemicals methods are available for the removal of these aniline derivatives. The biological treatment methods are not efficient for the removal of these aniline derivatives even though these methods are economical and also nitro group present in the aromatic ring enhances the stability to these aniline derivatives. Among the chemical treatment methods, for the removal of the removal of these aniline derivatives, the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are the most promising methods (Sun et al. 2008). The Fenton’s oxidation process is another promising oxidation process for effective removal of the <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> (Neyen and Baeyens 2003). In the Fenton’s oxidation process, complex organic compounds are broken down in the form of carbon dioxide and water (Wang et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Heavy metal {{contamination}} of industrial effluents {{is one of}} the significant environmental problems due to their toxic nature and accumulation throughout the food chain as <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants.</b> In this study, dead Bacillus subtilis biomass was assessed for its efficiency to remove chromium(VI) from aqueous solutions. Optimum pH and temperature for biosorption of Cr(VI) were found to be 2. 0 and 30 oC, respectively. The biomass has the maximum biosorption capacity of 14. 54 mg/g of biomass at 100 ppm initial chromium concentration and 2 g/l biomass loading. The biosorption process followed pseudo first order kinetic model, implying that the initial rate of biosorption is totally independent of the initial concentration. The biosorption of Cr(VI) is well described by Langmuir isotherm, which express the existence of monolayer adsorption under the experimental conditions. The adsorption-desorption experiments performed inferred the reusability of the biomass. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies revealed that chromium bound on to the B. subtilis biomass was in trivalent form...|$|R
30|$|Demand for {{developmental}} strides and industrialization {{has led to}} more toxic effluents being discharged {{with little}} or no treatment into the environment especially water bodies. Quality water is indispensable and essential to life (Fawole et al. 2002) but meeting the quality for different purposes has been a huge task because of loads of wastes received by it from domestic, municipal and industrial sources (Lateef 2004; Adewoye and Lateef 2004; Pal and Deb 2014; Azeez et al. 2015). Most of these wastes have detrimental effects on environment, human health, agricultural produce, aquatic lives and are also known to be genotoxic (Bakare et al. 2003; Lateef et al. 2007). Dyes are examples of such wastes and are increasingly being used in pharmaceutical, paint, textile industries and laboratories as indicators. They are <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> that affect water quality by causing foul odour, preventing light penetration, increasing chemical oxygen demand, decreasing dissolved oxygen level, and eventually leading to death of aquatic lives. They {{have been found to be}} nephrotoxic and also induce toxicity on reproductive system (Das et al. 2006, 2008; Baskaran et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012; Ramalingam et al. 2015; Tan et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} years the growing {{presence}} of endocrine disrupting compounds in the environment has been regarded as a serious sanitary issue. The more and more frequent detection of these compounds in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants poses the risk associated to their persistence into the aquatic systems {{as well as to}} their adverse effects on both public health and environment. As conventional systems do not allow their efficient removal, great attention has been raised towards their possible treatment by Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs). They rely on the action of hydroxyl radicals, which are highly reactive species, able to oxidize recalcitrant and <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants.</b> AOPs can either provide contaminant partial degradation or their complete removal. As their effectiveness has been proved for a wide spectrum of both organic and inorganic pollutants, they are considered a suitable option for the treatment of contaminated aqueous media, especially when combined with conventional biological processes. This paper aims at reviewing main AOPs for the removal of endocrine disruptors, in order to highlight the most important features of different technologies, thus providing their comparative assessment. To this end, a brief overview of the most frequently detected endocrine disruptor compounds was also discussed, in order to clarify their fate into the environment as well as the contamination pathways of greatest concern for human health...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) are {{carcinogenic}} and <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{that exist}} at high concentration in wastewater of chemical industries. In this study, treatment and removal of organic materials (COD) in wastewater {{was carried out}} by catalytic ozonation process (COP) using carbon Nano-composite catalysts. Materials and methods: This study was conducted in cylindrical 250 mL semi-continuous reactor and the effects of several parameters including pH of the solution (4 - 10), the amount of catalyst concentrations (0 to 4 g/L), reaction time (0 to 60 min), and saturated catalyst was studied on treatment of high concentration of DNP and the COD removal efficiency. Also, the kinetics were compared with single ozonation (SOP). Results: Removal efficiency of high concentrations of DNP (1500 mg/L) and kinetics of the COP process catalyst concentration of 4 g/L was 83 (0. 0241 min- 1) while the results in SOP were 50 (0. 0108 min- 1). The optimum pH was 6 with the reaction time of 60 min. However, the removal efficiency of COD at initial concentration of 610 mg/L in the SOP process was 61 which increased to 92 after addition of the catalyst. The main mechanism of process was chemical oxidation and a small share (3) was due to adsorption. Conclusion: The results showed that COP and this new catalyst effectively and quickly removed high concentrations of DNP and COD. This method is believed to be economic due to the short time of ozonation, recovery and reuse of the catalyst. © 2016, AMazandaran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{ecosystem}} green, recently an increasing interest has been focused on the adsorption techniques (El-Sayed 2011; Aksu 2005). This technique is quite popular due to its simplicity as well as the availability {{of a wide range of}} adsorbents and it proved to be an effective and attractive process for the removal of <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> (including dyes) from wastewater (Ali and Gupta 2007; Saad et al. 2010; da Silva et al. 2011). In the past decade, Gupta et al. (2000, 2004 a, b, 2005, 2006 a, b, 2007 a, b, 2008 a, b, 2009 a, b, c, 2011) made some great efforts to give collective information through review articles and research papers/reports about the current available techniques and adsorbents, for the dye removal and decolourization of aqueous waste. Most commercial systems use activated carbon as adsorbent to remove dyes from water because of its significant adsorption capacity. Although activated carbon is a preferred adsorbent yet its widespread use is restricted due to its cost. In order to decrease the cost of treatment, some attempts have been made to find low-cost alternative adsorbents. Recently, numerous studies have been conducted to develop cheaper and effective adsorbents from a variety of starting materials. By selecting proper adsorbent, it is possible to make the adsorption process promising and economically viable for the removal of contaminants (Annadurai et al. 2002; Sivaraj et al. 2001). Therefore, it is preferable to use low-cost adsorbents such as an industrial waste, natural ores and agricultural by-products (Jain et al. 2003; Kumar and Sivanesan 2006; Han et al. 2006; Low et al. 2011; Sharma et al. 2010; Bhattacharya and Sharma 2004; Mall et al. 2005; Lakshmi et al. 2009; Mohanty et al. 2006). In our recently published review article (Sharma et al. 2011), we have compiled an extensive list of adsorbents obtained from different sources, and this review also reports the optimum processing parameters to get maximum dye removal from effluent water. In the same review article, a comparison between the adsorbent capacities of chemically modified, pre-treated, and untreated adsorbents has also been made.|$|R
30|$|In case of Heterogeneous Fenton reaction, soluble Fe 2 + {{catalyst}} {{is replaced}} by Fe-containing solids. This kind of Fenton reaction has been proved to be also effective {{in the treatment of}} industrial wastewater containing <b>non-biodegradable</b> organic <b>pollutants.</b> Furthermore, this process has numerous advantages over classical homogenous Fenton catalysis; e.g. no iron sludge is generated and easy separation of the catalyst from the treated stream (Bautista et al. 2008; Garrido-Ramirez et al. 2010). Various heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts such as Fe 2 O 3 (Feng et al. 2004), S-doped Fe 2 O 3 (Guo et al. 2010) and Fe 3 O 4 (Zhang et al. 2008) were used for wastewater treatment. Unfortunately, a lot of these catalysts do not exhibit favorable catalytic activity at neutral pH and the working pH values are usually around 3. Therefore, acidifying the wastewater or inputting external energy into the reaction system is a frequently used method to enhance their activity (Muthukumari et al. 2009; Cruz-González et al. 2010; Li et al. 2010). So it is worth to use low cost catalyst to reduce the overall cost of the treatment process while keeping reasonable efficiency.|$|R

Moreover, a novel method of synthesis of encapsulated nZVI from a waste material is presented, which meets the principles of green chemistry and at the same time represents a low-cost method of obtaining nZVI with improved characteristics. Chapter 1 describes the current state of the topics that will be discussed in the rest of the thesis. Specifically, the different mechanisms of contaminant remediation by nZVI are discussed, a summary of the current synthesis methods is presented and the principal modifications of nZVI to improve its characteristics are described. Finally, the limitations of the current techniques are assessed, which will be the starting point of the thesis. In Chapter 2, the application of nZVI to heavy metal removal during long time periods is explored. The contaminants studied are Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu and Cr, which are the most common heavy metals found in ground and wastewater. A delivery-effect of the heavy metal ions that had already been attached to nZVI surface is observed after long reaction times, which is a consequence of the nZVI aging and oxidation. The conditions that influence the delivery-effect are assessed and possible solutions to this detected problem are presented. In Chapter 3, nZVI is applied to the removal of sulfur-based odorous compounds in air streams. The compounds studied are hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which are commonly found in wastewater treatment plants. Both nZVI loading and pH are varied to assess their influence on the process. Bimetallic nanoscale particles of Cu/Fe, Ni/Fe and Pd/Fe are synthesized in order to improve the DMDS abatement by the nZVI. The advantages of this new method for odor removal are discussed at the look of the experimental results. Lastly, a pilot scale test was performed in a wastewater treatment plant in order to test the effectiveness of the nZVI in a real application. The nZVI were applied in a scrubber to eliminate the sulfurous compounds from the pre-treatment area of the wastewater treatment plant. Chapter 4 deals with the application of nZVI to the oxidation of <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> by the Fenton reaction. Specifically, the effect of pH on the degradation of the herbicide 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) is studied. The advantages of using nZVI as a Fenton reagent compared to homogeneous Fenton are described. Furthermore, the addition of UV-light to the process is investigated. Finally, the main degradation intermediates of the reaction are identified and a degradation mechanism is accordingly proposed. In Chapter 5, the presence of polychlorinated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) in the nZVI surface is addressed. Studies have shown that nZVI enhances the formation of such chlorinated compounds during thermal processes, but it is unclear which the origin of the compounds is. It has been suggested that nZVI could possess impurities such as PCDD/Fs in its surface. Therefore, the concentration of PCDD/Fs in both commercial and laboratory-synthesized nanoparticles is analyzed. PCDD/Fs pattern and WHO-TEQ concentrations are also obtained. As an outcome of the results obtained in this chapter, a recommendation for preventing the PCDD/Fs presence in nZVI is given. Chapter 6 is dedicated to the synthesis of carbon-encapsulated nanoparticles using hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of an agricultural waste, particularly, olive mill wastewater (OMW). This novel method, in addition to meet the green chemistry principles, makes profit of the high polyphenol content of OMW to maximize the fraction of incorporated iron into the nZVI. Moreover, the carbon layer surrounding the nZVI protects it against oxidation and avoids its aggregation. Several HTC conditions are explored to study their implications in the characteristics of the material obtained. A deep characterization of the encapsulated nZVI is also presented in this chapter. In Chapter 7, the applications of the encapsulated nZVI synthesized in Chapter 6 are explored and compared for the same contaminants that have been studied in the previous chapters. Then, the advantages of encapsulated nZVI in comparison with common nZVI are discussed at the end of the chapter, and an estimation of the synthesis costs with this method is addressed. Lastly, in Chapter 8, the main conclusions of the thesis are summarized and suggestions for future work are presented...|$|R
40|$|The incapability of {{conventional}} biological wastewater treatment to remove effectively biorecalcitrant and/or toxic pollutants, {{as well as}} the shortage of world water resources have promoted the research of more efficient and ecologically y friendly water treatment technologies. This thesis contributes {{to the development of a}} new hybrid technology combining advanced oxidation processes (AOP) and biological processes for the treatment of wastewater containing biorecalcitrant and toxic pollutants. In the proposed coupled system, AOP is applied exclusively as pre-treatment with the aim to modify the chemical structure of the pollutants to transform them into biodegradable intermediates. During this step partial mineralization of pollutant take place, and the subsequent biological treatment is applied to complete mineralization. This approach is viable from the economic and environmental point of view, and appears as an alternative to the drastic and/or inefficient single-step processes actually applied for the treatment of biorecalcitrant wastewater. This thesis is organized in 6 chapters and focuses on the degradation of a model biorecalcitrant pollutant: 5 -amino- 6 -methyl- 2 -benzimidazolone (AMBI) an important precursor in the industrial production of dyes. In the first chapter, AOP and the concept of coupling AOP-biological process are introduced. An overview of studies which used a combination of photoassisted and biological degradation of organic contaminants in water was performed. Chapter 2 focuses on an exploratory study with some of the most representative AOP Thus sonochemical, electrochemical and photochemical oxidation processes were applied to degrade AMBI. The comparison of these AOP revealed that the iron photo-assisted processes are the most advantageous, and have an application potential in sunny regions. Chapter 3 focuses on the degradation of AMBI by means of the hν/Fe(III) /O 2 (air) and hν/ Fe(III) /H 2 O 2 systems using an artificial irradiation source. The transformation of AMBI photoinduced by the Fe(III) in presence of both O 2 (from air) and H 2 O 2 electron acceptors is studied. The effect of AMBI, Fe 3 + and H 2 O 2 concentration for the degradation of AMBI wastewater in the photo-Fenton process was discussed and optimal conditions were found. Chapter 4 focuses on coupling iron photoassisted process with a biological system at lab scale. Here a general strategy to develop combined photochemical and biological systems for biorecalcitrant wastewater treatment is proposed. Following this strategy, two kinds of combined systems were developed and tested using for the photocatalytic pretreatment hν/Fe 3 +/O 2 (air) or hν/Fe 3 +/H 2 O 2 and in both cases fixed bed with activated sludge culture for the biological step. To replace relatively expensive artificial irradiation in photoassisted processes, the solar irradiation was applied. Chapter 5 illustrates the development and optimization at pilot scale, of a coupled solar-biological system for water treatment. The following points were taking into account: (i) the choice of the most appropriate solar collector and the most efficient photocatalytic system, (ii) the optimization of the photocatalytic system, (iii) the monitoring of the chemical and biological characteristics of photo-treated solution and (iv) the evaluation of the performances of the coupled solar-biological system for the treatment of real industrial wastewater containing AMBI. Results indicate that coupling solar-biological processes at pilot scale is an effective method to the treatment of <b>non-biodegradable</b> industrial <b>pollutants</b> such as AMBI. To overcome the problem of electricity supply for pumps used for the recirculation of wastewater in a coupled water detoxification process, chapter 6 proposes a new Hybrid Photocatalytic-Photovoltaic System (HPPS). HPPS is a device which allows simultaneously decontaminate water and convert solar energy into electricity. This ecological equipment (which is actually following a patent procedure at the EPFL) was designed, installed, and tested. The results show that the HPPS represents an autonomous and environmentally friendly method for this strategy of polluted water remediation...|$|R
