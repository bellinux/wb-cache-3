5|$|Abbasi's {{political}} career began {{after the death}} of his father Khaqan Abbasi in 1988. In May 1988, President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq sacked the government of his handpicked Prime Minister Muhammad Khan Junejo, and prematurely dissolved the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly.</b> Consequently, new parliamentary elections were called for 16 November 1988. Abbasi ran for the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> seat from Constituency NA-36 (Rawalpindi-I), which had been held by his father until his death. Abassi was elected with 47,295 votes as an independent candidate. He acquired Rawalpindi's <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> seat for the first time at the age of 30 by defeating both Raja Zafar ul Haq, a candidate of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate Raja Muhammad Anwar by a narrow margin. After winning the election he joined the IJI, which was newly founded in September 1988 by then Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence to counter the PPP.

Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late.|$|E
