500|$|As {{the number}} of First World War {{veterans}} dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty's Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place {{after the death of}} the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prospect, but has also been quoted as saying [...] "I don't mind— as long as it's not me." [...] Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.|$|E
500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact that we went from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

However, when they were told {{they were going to}} meet an individual they had just written about, those in the suppression group sat significantly farther away from the [...] "skinhead" [...] (just by virtue of his clothes being present). These results show that even though there may have been an initial enhancement of the stereotype, participants were able to prevent this from being communicated in their writing; this was not true for their behavior though.|$|E

50|$|Explicit memory (used {{in legal}} testimony) is {{affected}} by post traumatic stress disorder(PTSD); individuals diagnosed with PTSD can struggle to recall explicit events from their memory, usually those which are especially traumatic events.

Implicit memory, on the other hand, does not seem to be affected in the same way that explicit memory does, rather some individuals with PTSD may score higher on implicit memory tests than non-PTSD individuals.|$|E
50|$|Emotion {{regulation}} {{refers to}} the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience. For example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (trying <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation, doing distracting activities, etc.). Depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion, different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently. Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as rational emotive behavior therapy. Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary Gestalt therapy).|$|E

People don’t really expect as much from an EP, so you’re free to do what you want to do. And that is what was so empowering about this particular experience for me. I never needed to take a step back and obsess over what kind of music I was making. I didn’t think that some people might think it’s weird that I’m making this electronic pop song or I’m making this really ambient, droney song. I just did what I wanted to do and it felt good <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> outside perspective. I do that so much. I spend a lot of time worrying about what other people think. But this EP was the most fun I’ve had writing and recording in a long time. ... A lot of times bands put out EPs with the leftover tracks that didn’t make it onto the album for some reason. But this was not like that for me." ...|$|E
50|$|Jimmy Hudson {{is the son}} of Wolverine/James Howlett and Magda. Wolverine fought {{alongside}} James Hudson in the Iraq war and entrusted James {{with his}} newborn son. James later becomes a sheriff in Florida and with his wife Heather raised Jimmy in Port St Lucie, Florida. While drag racing, Jimmy's car flipped off the road. He survived, but his body was severely and fatally injured, but he rapidly began to heal as his X-Gene activated. The following day, Jimmy met Kitty Pryde and she handed him a box of Wolverine's possessions. In a holographic message Wolverine appeared before Jimmy. Wolverine told Jimmy he was his son and to forget about asking who his birth mother is, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past and focus on the future, respect the Hudsons for raising him on his behalf, and learn to live with the choices he had made. Wolverine's final message was that he never regretted having Jimmy as a son. Kitty theorized that Jimmy inherited Wolverine's abilities and encouraged him to try. After focusing hard, his bone claws painfully sheathed through his knuckles for the first time. Jimmy formed a metallic coating over his claws. After this, he mastered control of his claws.|$|E

5000|$|Thus, Reavis {{approached}} the topic {{from the standpoint}} of homosexuality being a social problem akin to alcoholism or prostitution. This echoed how many earlier programs, often produced as episodes of local talk shows, addressed homosexuality with shows bearing such titles as [...] "Homosexuals and the Problems They Present" [...] and [...] "Homosexuality: A Psychological Approach". The Rejected focused exclusively on gay men, with no representation of lesbians. Reavis expressed his reluctance to include lesbians in his proposal: [...] First, the repugnance [...] - [...] or desire <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> problem [...] - [...] is even greater in society than that towards the problem of Gay men. Second, the number of persons involved is much smaller.... Third, the problems are vastly different, as are the solutions. For example, promiscuity is much less, relationships apt to be bilateral, economic and social sanctions are less, and the ability to carry on a relationship of this sort is greatly simplified. [...] Commercial stations turned down the program, as did sponsors. KQED bought the project in early 1961 under the new title. The documentary was shot entirely in the KQED studio except for one segment on location at the Black Cat Bar, a San Francisco gay bar that had been fighting state and police harassment since 1948. Reavis and co-producer Irving Saraf filmed The Rejected on a budget of less than $100.|$|E

She returned to school just {{before the end of the}} spring semester after she placed a restraining order on the person she alleged committed the assault. [...] She subsequently dropped out of Amherst College and started working on a dude ranch in Wyoming during the fall of 2012.
