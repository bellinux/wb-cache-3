50|$|Some models {{available}} in Speed Dreams, {{and especially the}} content inherited from TORCS, are inspired from the design of existing racing cars; {{in order to avoid}} possible legal issues, the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> of brands and of models were replaced by fictional ones before release 1.4.0.|$|E
50|$|One challenge, {{especially}} in the US where there are many mergers and acquisitions, and in Europe where a consortium model is more common, is {{keeping track of the}} <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> As one example, the microwave surveillance systems business of Watkins-Johnson, a SIGINT electronics vendor with a long history, was acquired in 1995 by Condor Systems. Watkins-Johnson refocused to make its core business the manufacture of components. Condor Systems, in turn, was acquired by EDO Reconnaissance and Surveillance Systems Inc.(EDO RSS). An actual piece of equipment, however, might still have a Watkins-Johnson label.|$|E
50|$|Mobile data {{terminals}} {{feature a}} screen {{on which to}} view information and a keyboard or keypad for entering information, and may be connected to various peripheral devices. Standard peripherals include two-way radios and taximeters, both of which predate computer assisted dispatching. MDTs may be simple display and keypad units, intended {{to be connected to}} a separate black-box or AVL (see below) computer. While MDTs were originally dumb terminals most have been replaced with fully functional PC hardware, known as MDCs (Mobile Digital Computers). While the MDC term is more correct, MDT is still widely used. Other common terms include MVC (Motor Vehicle Computer) and <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturers</b> such as iMobile or KDT.|$|E
