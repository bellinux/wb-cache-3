40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the nature}} of industrial and technological development in Hong Kong in order to tease out the modes of innovation that existed in this Asian <b>Newly</b> <b>Industrialised</b> <b>Economy</b> (ANIE) since the 1950 s to the present. The mode of innovation in Hong Kong from the early 1950 s to mid- 1990 s was systemic in nature and that it conforms to {{a variant of the}} national innovation system (NIS). Embedded in the export-led industrialisation of Hong Kong is a framework of innovation that is different from the other ANIEs - South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. Since the mid- 1990 s, and especially after the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997, Hong Kong's innovation system has been more interactive and horizontal, which has some family resemblance to the `Triple Helix' government-industry-university system, which is a stylised version of NIS. The new innovation system is dynamic and appears to have been driven by an apparent objective of steering Hong Kong in the direction of an innovation-driven economy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Although FDI {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{to have a positive}} effect on economic growth, the exact mechanism of how FDI impacts upon the development process of the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies</b> is far from being well understood. This paper presents and tests two propositions on the role of FDI in economic growth from a <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economy’s</b> perspective. First, FDI is a mover of production efficiency because it helps reduce the gap between the actual level of production and a steady state production frontier. Second, FDI being embedded with advanced technologies and knowledge is a shifter of the host country’s production frontier. Due to its dual role as a mover of production efficiency and a shifter of production frontier, FDI is a powerful driver of economic growth for a <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economy</b> to catch up with the world’s most advanced countries. China’s economic success over the past decades provides an ideal example to test the hypotheses. JEL...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on the impact of R&D on economic performance is founded on the advanced countries, where the intensity of R&D expenditure has been relatively high and stable for many years. In this paper, we provide empirical estimates of the impact of R&D on the economic growth of a <b>Newly</b> <b>Industrialised</b> <b>Economy,</b> Singapore, where R&D expenditure intensity has been low initially, bur rising rapidly in recent years. The Cobb-Douglas based analysis provided empirical evidence that R&D investment in Singapore {{had a significant impact on}} its total factor productivity performance in the last 20 years and established a long-term equilibrium relationship between R&D investments and TFP. However, compared to the OECD nations, the impact of R&D investment on economic growth in Singapore is not as strong, as evidenced by lower estimated elasticity values. The long run elasticity of output with respect to R&D was computed to be 8. 1 % for Singapore compared to long run elasticities of over 10 % estimated by other researchers for OECD countries. This suggests that Singapore still has some way to go in catching up with the advanced nations in terms of R&D productivity. This not only means increasing the level of R&D intensity in Singapore but also more efficient exploitation of domestic R&D activity.

40|$|Vocational Education and Training {{systems are}} {{important}} elements of countries' economic development strategies. Improving {{the skills and knowledge}} of the workforce is crucial for achieving or maintaining economic competitiveness, especially in a context of progressing globalisation. As a consequence, governments around the world are engaging in improving their respective VET systems. The role of vocational education and training (VET) is regarded as key to economic development. In the same context, the Namibian government has initiated a comprehensive reform of its VET system. More than 10 years after passing the Vocational Training Act in 1994, the VET system still experiences many weaknesses in terms of high failure rates in trade examinations, high drop-out rates and not fully matching employers' skill needs. Many of the weaknesses have been {{known for a long time}} and various reform initiatives have been designed in the past, but the majority of them have not been implemented successfully. In the context of Namibia's Vision 2030 to become a <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>economy</b> by the year 2030, the education and training sector is again subject to comprehensive reform. The aim of reforming the VET sector is to improve its management, introduce competency based training standards to increase access, improve the responsiveness of skills supply to skills demand and increase the financial base through the introduction of a levy. The purpose of the paper is to analyse in greater detail the prospects of the current VET reform initiative and to identify factors that are likely to influence the outcome of the reform. One central question is: why, given past experiences, should the current reform initiative which is much broader and complex than in the past, be successful this time? The paper argues that the current reform looks promising in scope, but many caveats exist that might limit its successful implementation. Among the greatest dangers are a neglect of the micro-level of reform implementation due to an insufficient involvement of trainees and instructors, a low involvement of the private sector and the inappropriateness of introducing a training levy and the resulting lack of required financial resources...|$|E
40|$|The study {{arose from}} a {{research}} {{issue that is}} both practical and theoretical. The apparent challenges of a stakeholder management nature in the execution of urban development projects in South Africa led to the conception of the study. However, the most compelling need for the study was the theoretical gap – in the urban development theory, in the projects theory, {{and particularly in the}} stakeholder management theory – on the management of stakeholders in the South African urban development projects. As a result, the value of the study is both managerial and scholarly. The urban development concept is understood to be referring to the development of urban areas for the purpose of improving {{the quality of life in}} the cities, and the development of the infrastructure to enable economic growth. Urban development projects, as vehicles for accomplishing urban development, are important for a <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>economy</b> (NIE) like South Africa. Also, as a result of the political past – in the form of a systematic preferential development based on racial segregation by the previous government, and the two decades of subjection of South Africa to economic and cultural isolation by the international community – South Africa has a huge backlog with regard to the two general purposes of urban development: social progress and economic progress. Consequently, urban development projects in South Africa are very critical and important, particularly for geopolitical and socio-economic reasons. Judging by the extensive negative media coverage, many of the South African urban development projects demonstrate poor stakeholder management. The list of urban development projects that have experienced stakeholder related challenges in South Africa is endless: the Johannesburg BRT project, the Gauteng Freeway Improvement project, the Transnet multi-product pipeline-construction project, the Chapman’s Peak toll-road project, the Kusile and Medupi power stations construction projects, are some examples. The project management profession and body of knowledge view stakeholder management in a serious light, actually a failure in adequately implementing stakeholder management in a project is tantamount to a failure of the project itself. There is also a consensus among numerous researchers that there is a general lack of knowledge for project managers on how to manage stakeholders, particularly external stakeholders. Stakeholder management is a poorly understood and, usually a very badly implemented project management discipline. Managing projects in Africa, and by inference in South Africa, can be particularly complex – given the involvement of multiple stakeholders and their historical, geopolitical, economic relationships, and cultural differences. The study set out to develop a framework to improve the management of stakeholders in urban development projects – by investigating the critical success factors that have an influence on stakeholder management success in urban development projects in South Africa. This study is important primarily because there seems to be no previous research conducted on this important project management discipline, stakeholder management of urban development projects; and there seems to be a neglect of stakeholder management duties by urban development projects agencies, and by inference, projects practitioners in South Africa. A theoretical space was created for this study in the fraternal literature of previous studies on critical success factors and/or stakeholder management in construction projects – as there seem to be none undertaken in the urban development environment, particularly in the South African context...|$|E

40|$|The {{globalisation}} hypothesis {{has altered}} {{many of the}} common-sense ‘truths’ around which the social world is organised. * In particular, globalisation is thought to restrict {{the parameters of the}} politically and economically possible. Indeed, the notion of constrained choice is so pronounced that we are increasingly confronted with the image of globalisation’s ‘logic of no alternative’; an image which is predicated on the assumption of perfect capital mobility. Capital is considered to be sufficiently rational to take advantage of enhanced exit options from the national economy in circumstances in which its interests are served by moving off-shore. Moreover, global markets are also assumed to have exploited contemporary technological developments {{to such an extent that}} they now clear instantaneously; consequently, allowing capital to further its interests wherever in the world new profit opportunities arise. Thus, we are presented with the fundamental ‘reality’ of globalisation as currently narrated throughout much of the west: unless the market can be allowed to restore a competitive global equilibrium, capital will exit high-wage, high-cost western economies and re-locate in lower-wage, lower-cost, <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies.</b> Under the auspices of ever more hostile wage competition from the <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies,</b> globalisation is commonly presumed to act as a trigger for an ‘inevitable’ job displacement effect as capital deserts the advanced <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Among <b>newly</b> <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies,</b> Malaysia has mounted notably {{comprehensive}} {{efforts to}} build a national innovation system. Despite continuously updating Science and Technology (S&T) policies to reflect prevailing understandings of successful innovation strategy, its achievements in technology development are mixed. Invoking Ergas' (1987) binary typology, this study finds that Malaysia's mission-oriented technology policies have been less successful than diffusion-oriented interventions. The government's institutional capacities have often been unequal to its more ambitious technology development goals, but sufficient to create effective infrastructure for the deployment and diffusion of advanced technology from abroad. Weak linkages between public sector technology agencies and private enterprises are a second limiting factor. Malaysia's experience suggests that the scope for deliberate efforts to engineer national innovation systems is constrained by institutional and political factors even when technology policies themselves are comprehensive and up-to-date. science and technology policy; S&T; national innovation system; <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> economies; Malaysia; innovation strategy; technology development. ...|$|R

Furthermore, as democratisation movements gain voice, and as the transnationalisation of capital from within these economies proceeds, the high degree of autonomy associated with the developmental state is eroding, and its authoritarian uses of power are increasingly being challenged. ...|$|R

The panel data analysis, based on a Solow-Swan type growth model on China's 37 manufacturing industries from 1991 to 2002, reveals that the main sources of the strengthened competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector have been mainly from Total Factor Productivity (TFP), while labour productivity has been increasing and capital productivity has been falling.
