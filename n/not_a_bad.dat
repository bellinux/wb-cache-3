5|$|He {{has been}} called the radical {{conservative}} of his day — <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.|$|E

25|$|He {{played a}} few Second XI games for Worcestershire in 1972, but his {{first-class}} debut came against the touring New Zealanders at Worcester in late April 1973. In a match badly {{affected by the}} weather, he took only one wicket, but it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> one to start with: his county team-mate Glenn Turner, whom Inchmore bowled for 143.|$|E

25|$|Denmark were {{batted out}} of the game by Bas Zuiderent and Daan van Bunge who both made centuries as the Danish spin bowling was taken to all corners. Van Bunge made 137 and Zuiderent 107 as the Dutch amassed 314 for 6, also helped by Ryan ten Doeschate who made 32. Despite Thomas Hansen bowling a maiden and taking three for 41, it was not enough. In reply, the Danes were in with a shout as long as Frederik Klokker was at the crease, but when he was gone for 52, it was quickly over. The Danes crawled to 225 all out, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> score by their standards, but still {{defeated}} by 89 runs.|$|E
25|$|Oral tales, not {{recorded}} until much later, include the widely reported and possibly mythical one that Livingstone used to beat corpses at funerals with his walking stick {{to make sure}} they were dead and not simply shamming. His wife defended him passionately, claiming he was charitable to the hungry and sick. Her defence is quite plausible: Livingstone was quick-tempered and may have been violent and kind at different times. However, his distribution of food may have been limited to the headmen appointed by him to control the estate workforce rather than general. Her defence was that Livingstone was good master, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> one as the commission claimed. The concept of the master-servant relationship was at the heart of colonial society, but this concept was precisely what Chilembwe was fighting with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why Livingstone was killed.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{frequently}} {{compared the}} game to other games, including Crash Bandicoot, and commented on its simplicity and its price, which {{was thought to be}} low. A writer for Complex included it on a list of company-branded games that [...] "didn't suck", commenting that it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> game as long as the player can tolerate the large amount of advertisement in it.

AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine complimented the single's production and Durand's vocals, while fellow AllMusic writer Heather Phares enjoyed the intimacy of the song.|$|E

Slimes, like many monsters in the Dragon Quest series, have a certain verbal tic, [...] "slurp".

500|$|Jessica Morgan, however, from Television Without Pity, {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review. She criticized the {{character}} of Monica Reyes and called her [...] "Moronica".

500|$|Populous: The Beginning played very {{differently}} from earlier titles.

[...] PCGamer subsequently decided the game {{failed to live up to}} the previous games in the series.

[...] He {{went on to say}} the album was [...] "an {{outstanding}} blast of dark dancefloor destruction" [...] and saying the album should be on [...] "the top shelf". [...] Gregory Burkart of FearNet mostly praised the album, saying that while the band doesn't [...] "break new creative ground" [...] on WTF?!, which he said wasn't the [...] "heaviest, fastest or most experimental album", it was [...] "still rock-solid, sporting some outstanding melodies and rhythms, and many memorable moments". [...] Ilker Yücel of ReGen Magazine called WTF?! a [...] "hard-hitting dose of industrial rock that is as familiar as it is unusual". [...] He concluded his review by saying, [...] "In short, it’s KMFDM by-the-numbers, and after 27 years, that's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing at all." [...] Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, [...] "WTF? is typical: electronic used to augment electric to over-human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd-person". [...] He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, [...] "This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking for a bit of roughage on their playlist." [...] Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF?! [...] "a solid release bursting with power and determination". [...] She also said of KMFDM, [...] "musically they are not far of their centre and typical sound, which is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing".|$|E

This was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> neighborhood. There was no crime, no robbery. Murder, yes, but no crime!"
