5|$|Bogin {{observes that}} Thompson {{originated}} {{the use of}} transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions, but that without modern computers the method was tedious to apply and was <b>not</b> <b>often</b> used. Even so, the book stimulated and lent intellectual validity to the new field of growth and development research.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though many}} species of Stylidium may coexist in the same location, natural hybrids between species have <b>not</b> <b>often</b> been reported. Both natural {{hybridisation}} {{in the field and}} artificial hybridisation in cultivation are rare. The first natural hybrid, S.petiolare × S.pulchellum, was reported by Sherwin Carlquist in 1969 between Capel and Boyanup in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Temple of Set is an occult initiatory order {{founded in}} 1975. A new {{religious}} movement and form of Western esotericism, the Temple espouses a religion known as Setianism, whose practitioners are called Setians. This is sometimes identified {{as a form of}} Satanism, although this term is <b>not</b> <b>often</b> embraced by Setians and is contested by some academics.|$|E

Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not feel that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is <b>not</b> <b>often</b> that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E

5|$|Divorcing {{a spouse}} was {{permissible}} {{if there was}} mutual consent, while remarriage {{after the death of}} a spouse was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did <b>not</b> <b>often</b> remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} nonspecific character, these {{symptoms}} are <b>not</b> <b>often</b> recognized {{as signs of}} HIV infection. Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed {{as one of the}} many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is <b>not</b> <b>often</b> seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were <b>not</b> <b>often</b> dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E

The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's Take-Away Shows, its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. It's all quite endearing and personal – two words one might <b>not</b> <b>often</b> associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple.|$|E

The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies {{and can be used}} as a touch screen to target enemies to attack. The console's microphone is used to attract the attention of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Over time, some {{attributes}} now {{regarded as}} integral became {{incorporated into the}} vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though <b>not</b> <b>often</b> explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. Potassium hydroxide {{is a very strong}} base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. Potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. Potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is <b>not</b> <b>often</b> used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere <b>not</b> <b>often</b> used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E

5|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery syndrome (SMA) is {{an extremely}} rare life-threatening condition that can either be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is <b>not</b> <b>often</b> carried out.|$|E
