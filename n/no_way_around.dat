500|$|Nichols had a {{supporting}} role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 (2008), playing a jealous friend of America Ferrera's character. Overall, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert commented that Nichols as her character Julia [...] "proves a principle that {{should be in the}} Little Movie Glossary: If a short, curvy, sun-kissed heroine [...] has a tall, thin blond as a roommate, that blond is destined to be a bitch. <b>No</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> it." [...] Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, similarly said, [...] "It falls to Ms. Nichols to play the movie's designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine [...] triumphs in romance and onstage." [...] Nichols was cast in Star Trek (2009) in November 2007, but due to the project's secrecy her role was initially unknown even to her; she said that month she did not even know her character's name. It was speculated that she would play Janice Rand, but she would actually play an Orion cadet at Starfleet Academy, as revealed by TrekMovie.com the following month.|$|E

I am trying to remind myself that our legal system is predicated on lawyers sometimes representing people they don't personally admire, and the system really does depend on someone being {{willing to take on}} unpopular clients. I know Boies doesn't use email, or at least he didn't the last time I checked. So maybe he doesn't quite get the tech ... ah, hang it all, there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> it: I feel bad he's chosen to represent them, especially after I posted an Ode singing his praises, and I hope he loses.|$|E

In doing so, the collapsed area itself is no longer accessible and any workings beyond that point will become inaccessibe if there remains <b>no</b> other <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> There are many mines that have suffered a small collapse right at the entrance (often the most vulnerable part) sealing off significant sized workings beyond.|$|R

2500|$|Cain {{supports}} Israel, {{and believes}} that the US should aid Israel in defending itself. [...] After President Obama said that {{the starting point of}} negotiations for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians should be based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, Cain said: I was shocked at the president's position, and I was equally shocked that he would unilaterally suggest that Israel would move the borders back which they acquired 44 years ago. [...] This president threw Israel under the bus, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> it. It demonstrates once again the arrogant disregard of this president for the opinion of the American people who like the relationship we have with Israel, and for Israel having the right to make its own decisions.|$|E
2500|$|Kant {{argued that}} the {{structures}} of logic which organize, interpret and abstract observations were built into the human mind and were true and valid a priori. Mill, on the contrary, said that we believe them to be true because we have enough individual instances of their truth to generalize: in his words, [...] "From instances we have observed, we feel warranted in concluding that what we found true in those instances holds in all similar ones, past, present and future, however numerous they may be". Although the psychological or epistemological specifics given by Mill through which we build our logical apparatus may not be completely warranted, his explanation still nonetheless manages to demonstrate that there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> Kant's a priori logic. To recant Mill's original idea in an empiricist twist: [...] "Indeed, the very principles of logical deduction are true because we observe that using them leads to true conclusions", which is itself an a priori presupposition.|$|E

On top of this screen people could place pluses and minuses overlaying specific areas of Blackboard.

The All About Jazz review by Alex Henderson stated [...] "Lloyd, like Trane, has always been very spiritual, and there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> getting <b>around</b> the fact that spirituality is a crucial part of Canto. The rewarding post-bop session has a meditative quality, and Lloyd's modal improvisations draw heavily on Middle Eastern and Asian spiritual music... a strong addition to Lloyd's catalogue".|$|R

50|$|For {{many years}} troop trains were {{a feature of}} its {{operation}} about three times each year. The trains were operated with a locomotive at each end as there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to run <b>around</b> a train south of Topsham; the leading locomotive on arrival was dragged back to Exeter Central where it was detached. The trains were considerably longer than the platform and loading the passengers was a slow operation as {{they had to make}} their way through the train from the centre coaches.

50|$|On February 26, 2002, Blue World {{released}} Lasso 5, {{a radical}} departure from the FileMaker-centric language to date. (There was never a Lasso 4 release; the version number skipped from 3 to 5.) Lasso 5 included, among many updates, a completely rewritten architecture (for OS X, Windows, Linux), and an embedded MySQL database. Though Lasso 5 still spoke to a FileMaker database (but not to a FileMaker Server), FileMaker as a data source remained relatively slow compared to an SQL engine, and was prohibitively more expensive. Since v2.0, Lasso was fully multithreaded, allowing many connections at once, but succumbed to FileMaker's latency or lag in certain operations, and there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to get <b>around</b> it reliably other than to make major changes to the data source.|$|R

40|$|Death {{provides}} us {{with some of our}} very best folklore. Some fear it, some embrace it, and most have pretty firm ideas about what happens when we die. Although some people may not want to talk about dying, it’s the only thing that happens to all of us–and there’s <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to get <b>around</b> it. This Publication of the Texas Folklore Society examines the lore of death and whatever happens afterward. The first chapter examines places where people are buried, either permanently or temporarily. Chapter Two features articles about how people die and the rituals associated with funerals and burials. The third chapter explores some of the stranger stories about what happens after we’re gone, and the last chapter offers some philosophical musings about death in general, as well as our connection to those who have gone before...|$|R
