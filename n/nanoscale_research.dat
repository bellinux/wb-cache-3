40|$|Abstract. Great {{expectations}} and promises rest on interdisciplinarity in <b>nanoscale</b> <b>research.</b> Yet, although many {{science and engineering}} disciplines actually began to engage in this field, it is only poorly understood what interdisciplinarity actually is and what factors hinder and promote it. Part I provides an introduction to interdisciplinarity, its cognitive and social elements, and its related concepts, such as multiand transdisciplinary or super-interdisciplinary. Part II first presents empirical findings about the actual weakness of interdisciplinarity in current <b>nanoscale</b> <b>research</b> and then discusses two of the main conceptual reasons for this. I argue that definitions of <b>nanoscale</b> <b>research</b> are too vague to provide interdisciplinary integration and that current nanotechnological visions include discipline-rooted and metaphysically opposed technological paradigms, such as ‘self-assembly ’ vs. ‘atom-by-atommanipulation’, that pose strong barriers to interdisciplinary research...|$|E
