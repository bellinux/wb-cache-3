Olpomdp, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, was successfully applied to simulated <b>network</b> <b>routing</b> under a <b>number</b> of network models. Multiple distributed agents (routers) learned cooperative behavior without explicit interagent communication, and they avoided behavior which was individually desirable, but detrimental to the group's overall performance. Furthermore, shaping the reward signal by explicitly penalizing certain patterns of sub-optimal behavior was found to dramatically improve the convergence rate...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{deterministic}} protocol for routing arbitrary permutations in arbitrary networks. The protocol is analyzed {{in terms of the}} size of the <b>network</b> and the <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> of the <b>network.</b> Given a network H of n nodes, the <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> of H is defined as the maximum over all permutations on f 1; : : :; ng of the minimal number of steps to route offline in H. We show that for any network H of size n with <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> R our protocol needs O(log R n R) time to route any permutation in H using only constant size edge buffers. This significantly improves all previously known results on deterministic routing. In particular, our result yields optimal deterministic routing protocols for arbitrary networks with diameter n) or bisection width O(n 1), > 0 constant. Furthermore we can extend our result to deterministic compact routing. This yields, e. g., a deterministic routing protocol with runtime O(R log n) for arbitrary bounded degree networ [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are {{temporary}} formed, infrastructure-less networks. The performance metrics degrades due to {{the unstable}} channel conditions, network connectivity, and mobility and resource limitations. To improve different performance metrics, various cross-layering techniques are used where different layers from protocol stack communications with each other via exchange of information. Ad hoc on demand Routing Protocol (AODV) is a well reactive ad hoc routing protocol. We proposed RS-AODV (Route Stability based AODV), {{a modified version of}} AODV routing protocol, based on route discovery by utilizing Physical Layer information instead of the minimum hop count approach of the default distance vector algorithm. Our research will also elaborate how the proposed model uses the received Signal Strength (RSSI) to find its route. We will focus on parameters like traffic throughput, response, time, packet loss, delay, link stability, optimal usage of battery resource to increase overall lifetime of a network. And also use novel approach "make before break" that starts finding alternate route when it seems link failure due to mobility of node. Simulation results show that RS-AODV has performance better that AODV routing protocol in terms of the metrics: End-to-End delay, Packet Delivery Ratio, <b>Network</b> <b>Routing</b> Load and <b>number</b> of route repairs...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{advocates say}} network {{neutrality}} {{is needed in}} order to maintain the end-to-end principle. According to Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney, all content must be treated the same and must move at the same speed in order for net neutrality to be true. They say that it is this simple but brilliant end-to-end aspect that has allowed the Internet to act as a powerful force for economic and social good. Under this principle, a neutral network is a dumb network, merely passing packets regardless of the applications they support. This point of view was expressed by David S. Isenberg in his paper, [...] "The Rise of the Stupid Network". He states that the vision of an intelligent network is being replaced by a new network philosophy and architecture in which the network is designed for always-on use, not intermittence and scarcity. Rather than intelligence being designed into the network itself, the intelligence would be pushed out to the end-user's device; and the network would be designed simply to deliver bits without fancy <b>network</b> <b>routing</b> or smart <b>number</b> translation. The data would be in control, telling the network where it should be sent. End-user devices would then be allowed to behave flexibly, as bits would essentially be free and there would be no assumption that the data is of a single data rate or data type.|$|R
