40|$|This article {{provides}} a historical review of <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> control agreements from 1925 to 2011, describing how these agreements helped diminish the <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> threat and build up. As this article explains, <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> control agreements can be segmented into distinct periods reflecting {{different approaches to}} the <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> threat, with each stage addressing different focused objectives. As negotiations evolved throughout history, the United States and Soviet Union undertook a <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> race, each striving to gain a military advantage over the other by building more and more nuclear weapons {{and the means to}} deliver them. Accordingly, a debate evolved about a different means of dealing with the <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> race: arms control. Essentially, collective <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> control responses from 1945 – 1991 developed into three types of responses focusing on: 1) nonarmament; 2) confidence-building measures; and, 3) arms limitations. (Congressional Subcommittee on Arms Control, International Security 2 ̆ 6 Science of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Fundamentals of <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Arms</b> Control. Part I: <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Arms</b> Control: A Brief Historical Survey. Executive Summary IX-X (May 20, 1985)). Most recently, the dissolution of the Soviet Union brought <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> control to the political forefront due to its impact on the START Treaty. Recently, the relative merits of the New START Treaty were debated at great length during the ratification process in the United States and in the Russian Federation. This article describes how we arrived {{at this point in the}} global efforts to regulate nuclear weapons, how each approach differed and built on previous experience, and how world events impacted negotiations supporting the parties to achieve agreement, and what we can expect in the future of <b>nuclear</b> <b>arms</b> control...|$|R
