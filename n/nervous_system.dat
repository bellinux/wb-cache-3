40|$|If neurones are the answer, {{then what}} was the question? <b>Nervous</b> <b>systems</b> are remarkably conserved {{throughout}} the animal kingdom. This conserva-tion indicates that their core design and function features were established very early in their evolutionary history. It also indicates that all <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> solve the same fundamental task in essentially the same way, and have been doing so since their inception. Understanding when and why ani-mals evolved <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> could help us identify that fundamental task. It could also provide context to help us determine how <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> solve that task so well. This thesis studies the evolutionary origins of <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> and the eco-logical conditions under which they evolved. It outlines fossil, ecological, and molecular evidence to argue that animals evolved <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> soon after they started eating each other, 550 million years ago.

40|$|Miniaturized {{species have}} evolved in many animal lineages, {{including}} insects and vertebrates. Consequently, their <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> are constrained to fit within tiny volumes. These miniaturized <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> face two major challenges for information processing: noise and energy consumption. Fewer or smaller neurons with fewer molecular components will increase noise, affecting information processing and transmission. Smaller, more densely-packed neural processes {{will increase the}} density of energy consumption whilst reducing the space available for mitochondria, which supply energy. Although miniaturized <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> benefit from smaller distances between neurons, thus saving time, space and energy, they have also increased the space available for neural processing by expanding and contorting their <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> to fill any available space, sometimes {{at the expense of}} other structures. Other adaptations, such as multifunctional neurons or matched filters, may further alleviate the pressures on space within miniaturized <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite these adaptations, we argue that limitations on information processing are likely to affect the behaviour generated by miniaturized <b>nervous</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> and spares the sympathetic autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> oxygen {{toxicity}} {{may lead to}} incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage.

Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E

5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is divided into the somatic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> increasing secretion and the parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E

5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
