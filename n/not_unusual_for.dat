5|$|Although {{he became}} Emperor in 1434, Zara Yaqob was not crowned until 1436 at Axum, where he resided for three years. It was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> Ethiopian rulers to {{postpone}} their coronation until later in their reigns.|$|E
5|$|The reinterpretation of Anekantavada as a {{doctrine}} of religious tolerance is novel, popular but <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> the time for Jefferson to choose to do so. White society simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E
50|$|Crawshays Welsh XV {{have played}} {{all over the}} rugby playing world. There is also an under 19 team that travels {{extensively}} and it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> to <b>for</b> them to field a team in the international sevens tournaments.|$|R

25|$|The {{religious}} dedication {{exhibited by}} Cheevers and Evans was <b>not</b> entirely <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> {{women of the}} seventeenth century. Women religious communities were somewhat common, such as nunneries or sisterhood organizations, though {{they were in the}} decline {{by the middle of the}} century.|$|R
5|$|In 1918, Fred Whitlam was {{promoted}} to deputy Crown solicitor and transferred to Sydney. The family lived first in the North Shore suburb of Mosman and then in Turramurra. At age six, Gough began his education at Chatswood Church of England Girls' School (early primary schooling at a girls' school was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> small boys at the time). After a year there, he attended Mowbray House School and Knox Grammar School, {{in the suburbs of}} Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Survival of fairywrens {{from one}} season {{to the next}} is {{generally}} high for such small birds, and the red-winged fairywren has {{the highest rate of}} allwith 78% of breeding males and 77% of breeding females surviving from year to year. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> red-winged fairywrens to reach 10 years of age, and the oldest known individual to date attained an age of 16 years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> passers-by to {{accuse him of}} {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his}} way wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E

The {{consequence}} was inevitable and it's futile to complain. For that matter, it is <b>not</b> altogether <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a landlord and his steward to change places." ...|$|R
25|$|Only {{recently}} has ganga begun to address political issues, frequently adopting overtly nationalistic overtones and incorporating themes from the Croatian Homeland War. Although {{both men and}} women regularly perform ganga, it is extremely <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> them to perform songs together. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> at all <b>for</b> both Catholic and Muslim men to perform ganga together.|$|R
50|$|These {{problems}} {{increased with}} the size of the instrument, and it would <b>not</b> be <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a particular organ to contain over a hundred miles of wiring. The largest pipe organ in the world, the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ, is said to contain more than 137500 mi of wire. Modern electronic switching has largely overcome these physical problems.|$|R
5|$|Coveleski had 216 {{wins and}} 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts in a 14-year career. He had 224 {{complete}} games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, {{and it was}} <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a hit or a strike. In 2001, baseball statistician Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal) (21 March 1899 – 13 April 1994), a girl whom {{his mother}} had {{selected}} for him a year earlier, and who was {{was ten years old}} when they married. It was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> marriages to be arranged with young girls. She came from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur (Karur district) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony. As was common at that time, Janakiammal continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage till she attained puberty. In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in Madras.|$|E

I should rather call it love of influence, for, though I'm not sure Grace Coulthurst realizes it, one could fancy that the {{opportunity}} for dominating a man of position, or more especially character, would prove almost irresistible to her. Still, one must discriminate between that and the <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> fondness <b>for</b> love-making." ...|$|R
5000|$|Martha Clark, {{daughter}} of the former State senator, and Martha's daughter, Nora Crist, have continued the family tradition as operators of the Elioak Farm. Their produce stand on Maryland Route 108, where the Clarks sell fresh vegetables, is <b>not</b> particularly <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a family farm. It distinguishes itself somewhat by offering [...] "pasture-raised, grass-finished beef", raised in a low-stress, humane, natural environment.|$|R
50|$|Hat making was {{the main}} trade in Stockport where Carroll grew up, and it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> then <b>for</b> hatters to appear {{disturbed}} or confused; many died early {{as a result of}} mercury poisoning. However, the Hatter does not exhibit the symptoms of mercury poisoning, which include excessive timidity, diffidence, increasing shyness, loss of self-confidence, anxiety, and a desire to remain unobserved and unobtrusive.|$|R
5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York {{with the mission}} of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Army. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> the service academies to have high dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated. Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include Edgar Allan Poe (literature), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (art), Maynard James Keenan (music), Adam Vinatieri (football), and even the military: Jacob Zeilin, Lewis Addison Armistead, and Courtney Hodges.|$|E
5|$|The {{directors}} {{active in}} the Indies came from various backgrounds. Some, like The Teng Chun, Fred Young, and the Wongs, had been interested in film since their youth. Others, such as Njoo Cheong Seng and Andjar, had a background in theatre. Still others, including Albert Balink and Ismail, were journalists by trade. They were all men; {{the first woman to}} direct a film in the Indonesian archipelago, Ratna Asmara, made her debut after the Indies were dissolved. Between them, the 29men directed some 103films, at times working collaboratively; it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> them to take more than one role in production. However, they generally had less creative control than the producer.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{recorded}} football {{match in}} Sheffield occurred in 1794 when {{a game of}} mob football was played between Sheffield and Norton (at the time a Derbyshire village) that took place at Bents Green. The game lasted three days, which was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> matches at the time. It was noted that although there were some injuries no-one was killed during the match. The Clarkehouse Road Fencing Club had been playing football since 1852. The city was home {{to a number of}} sports clubs and the popularity of cricket had led to the chairman of Sheffield Cricket Club to suggest the construction of Bramall Lane.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>not</b> been <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> {{secretaries}} of the Senate to have devoted their entire careers to the Senate. Several began as pages, including Edwin Halsey, who served throughout the dramatic New Deal years; Leslie Biffle, a close confidant of President Harry Truman; Carl Loeffler and J. Mark Trice, secretaries during the Eightieth and Eighty-third congresses; and Walter J. Stewart, secretary from 1987 to 1994.|$|R

After the Armistice, 437 graves were concentrated in this enclosure from two nearby battlefield cemeteries, Ecole de Bienfaisance and Asylum British, that the Commission could <b>not</b> maintain. <b>Unusual</b> <b>for</b> a Commonwealth cemetery on the Western Front, there are collective burials in this enclosure, although individual headstones have still been provided, marked [...] "Buried near this spot".|$|R
5|$|Village Roadshow Theme Parks, {{the owners}} of Warner Bros. Movie World {{attributed}} a rise in attendance {{to the opening of}} the Green Lantern Coaster. The company labelled the launch of the ride as a success. The attraction's downtime has been reported several times by local media, however, this behaviour is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> amusement rides. Green Lantern Coaster, along with other El Loco roller coasters, ranked 182 out of the 365 steel roller coasters in the worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll for 2012.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
5|$|As the Industrial Revolution {{began in}} the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, the Welsh metal mines {{declined}} and mining in Cornwall and Devon became viable once more. Women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing. Women and children accounted for up to half the workers in the area's copper mines. Although machinery was capable of performing much of the work done by bal maidens, the industry grew so quickly that the number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of the workforce to 15–20% by 1850. At the peak of the Cornish mining boom, in around 1860, at least 6000 bal maidens were working at the region's mines; the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> girls to become bal maidens at the age of six and to work into old age, they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married.|$|E
5000|$|On average, the {{majority}} of contestants' items lose money: the teams are paying retail prices at fairs, whereas auction prices are generally lower. Large profits are fairly rare, though it is <b>not</b> particularly <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> contestants to take home a small profit. Teams achieving the difficult feat of earning a profit on all three items are awarded a [...] "golden gavel"; originally a wooden trophy, but latterly a lapel pin.|$|R
5000|$|It is <b>not</b> entirely <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> {{families}} of Egyptian origin (especially Coptic ones) to have names or family names {{beginning with the}} Egyptian masculine possessive pronoun pa (generally ba in Arabic, which lost the phoneme [...] {{in the course of}} developing from Proto-Semitic). For example, Bayoumi (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy) [...] "of Fayyoum", Fayyoum meaning [...] "of the big water (yom)", Bashandi, Bakhoum ("the eagle"), Bekhit, Bahur ("of Horus") and Banoub ("of Anubis").|$|R
5000|$|In 1851, Coghen {{returned}} to public life, {{this time the}} Senate; it has <b>not</b> been <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> aristocrats to be elected directly to that position. [...] Previously a Unionist, he broke with the Liberal party and then joined the Catholic party, [...] in the controversy over a new inheritance law. In 1855, he was re-elected to the Senate after returning to the Liberal party, and served as vice-president of the Senate {{at the time of}} his death.|$|R
5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves {{in order to be}} regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|During {{his search}} for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, a leading British {{magazine}} publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the Westminster Gazette, Tit-Bits, Country Life and the Strand Magazine. It was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson's expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000, (at least £3million in 2008 values). This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed {{ought to have been}} theirs. Markham maintained an attitude of hostility and contempt towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are similar}} {{versions}} of the bread {{in places such as}} Yemen and other regions of the Arabic world and Persia. All of these places in the Middle East were visited by Indian traders centuries ago and it would <b>not</b> be <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> them to have learned from each other or to have adopted each other's culinary habits and practices. However, the word [...] "mutabar" [...] is the original name for the egg, chilli, and onion flavoured multi-layered pancake.|$|R
50|$|The {{annual average}} {{precipitation}} at Moses Lake is 7.69 inches (195 mm). Although rainfall is fairly evenly {{distributed throughout the}} year, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> in mid-summer <b>for</b> a month or six weeks to pass without any measurable rainfall. The wettest month is December with an average rainfall of 1.19 inch (30 mm).|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1977, it was <b>not</b> {{considered}} <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> Manitoba's provincial premiers {{to reserve}} {{the position of}} Treasurer or Finance Minister for themselves. In the twentieth century, John Bracken, Stuart Garson, Douglas L. Campbell, Dufferin Roblin and Edward Schreyer all assumed this responsibility {{at one time or}} another (indeed, Roblin was his own Treasurer for the entire extent of his term in office). No premier has taken this responsibility since 1977, and such a combination of responsibilities would now be considered very unlikely.|$|R
