50|$|The <b>Next</b> <b>Hop</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Protocol</b> (NHRP) is an {{extension}} of the ATM ARP routing mechanism that is sometimes used to improve the efficiency of routing computer network traffic over Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) Networks. It is defined in IETF RFC 2332, and further described in RFC 2333. It can be used by a sender to determine a route with the fewest number of hops to a receiver. The protocol differs from ARP-type protocols in that it allows routing optimization across multiple IP subnets. NHRP is implemented by means of next-hop servers across IP subnets. The NHRP forms a part of the Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM (MPOA) protocol as described in RFC 2684. It also plays a role in Cisco's Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network. A limitation of NHRP is its inability to improve multicast protocols.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Recently, {{the core}} net routing table {{is growing at}} an {{alarming}} speed {{which has become a}} major concern to Internet Service Providers. One effective solution is Forwarding Information Base (FIB) aggregation. All the previous studies assume every prefix has only one <b>next</b> <b>hop.</b> In this paper, we argue that a packet can be delivered to its destination by multiple selectable <b>next</b> <b>hops.</b> Based on this observation, we propose Nexthop-Selectable FIB aggregation. Prefixes, including those which originally have different <b>next</b> <b>hops,</b> are aggregated if they share one common <b>next</b> <b>hop.</b> We provide a systematic study on this Nexthop-Selectable FIB aggregation problem. We present several practical choices to build selectable <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> for prefixes. We propose a non-trivial O(N) algorithm to optimally solve the problem. We then study a generalized problem where we assign weights for different <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> to bound path stretch.

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1998). All Rights Reserved. This document describes the NBMA <b>Next</b> <b>Hop</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Protocol</b> (NHRP). NHRP {{can be used by}} a source station (host or router) connected to a Non-Broadcast, Multi-Access (NBMA) subnetwork to determine the internetworking layer address and NBMA subnetwork addresses of the "NBMA next hop " towards a destination station. If the destination is connected to the NBMA subnetwork, then the NBMA next hop is the destination station itself. Otherwise, the NBMA next hop is the egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that is "nearest " to the destination station. NHRP is intended for use in a multiprotocol internetworking layer environment over NBMA subnetworks. Note that while this protocol was developed for use with NBMA subnetworks, it is possible, if not likely, that it will be applied to BMA subnetworks as well. However, this usage of NHRP is for further study. This document is intended to be a functional superset of the NBMA Address Resolution Protocol (NARP) documented in [1]. Luciani, et. al.
