25|$|Other, smaller, floppy {{sizes were}} proposed, {{especially}} for portable or pocket-sized devices that needed a smaller storage device. 3-inch disks similar in construction to 3½-inch were manufactured {{and used for}} a time, particularly by Amstrad computers and word processors. A 2-inch <b>nominal</b> <b>size</b> was introduced by Sony for compact pocket computers and was used with some electronic musical instrument controllers. Neither of these sizes achieved much market success.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} sizing systems for these punches. The two most common are those sized for {{standard}} electrical knockout sizes {{and those that}} are for true dimensional holes. A 3/4 inch conduit size punch actually punches a hole that is approximately 1.1 inches diameter for 3/4 <b>nominal</b> <b>size</b> conduit. A dimensional size punch makes a hole very close to the indicated size. Punch sets are available on both imperial and metric sizes.|$|E
25|$|A further {{contributory}} {{factor was}} {{the introduction of}} a new Establishment of Guns in 1716. Previously, gun establishments had catered for each ship, as there were often differences between ships of the same <b>nominal</b> <b>size</b> that would affect the armament they could carry. The 1716 gun establishment was intended to overturn that situation, so that all ships of a particular type (for example, 70 gun ships) would carry the same armament. The Navy Board highlighted {{the fact that there were}} still several ships in service that were physically incapable of carrying the prescribed armament, either due to the number and disposition of gunports, or to sturdiness of build. Essentially, however, the Navy Board resolved to undertake the task of having all ships rebuilt to common designs to facilitate the new gun establishment.|$|E

2500|$|IBM's first hard drive, the IBM350, used a {{stack of}} fifty 24-inch platters and was of a size {{comparable}} to two large refrigerators. In 1962, IBM introduced its model 1311 disk, which used six 14-inch (<b>nominal</b> <b>size)</b> platters in a removable pack and was {{roughly the size of}} a washing machine.

40|$|For sample-scanning atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM), the kinematics of tube scanner-sample-probe {{system is}} analyzed and the kinematics model is proposed. The model shows that transverse and longitudinal displacement at the point on sample touched by probe tip is dependent on probe tip offset to scanner axes, applied voltage or <b>nominal</b> scanning <b>size</b> and sample thickness. According to the model, two important errors caused by bow motion are quantitatively analyzed, which demonstrates scanning size error greatly affected by sample thickness and <b>nominal</b> scanning <b>size,</b> while Z axis cross-coupling error greatly affected by probe tip offset and <b>nominal</b> scanning <b>size.</b> Experiments verify the kinematics model and error calculation formulas.
