50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the wet}} wing is that every rivet, bolt, <b>nut</b> <b>plate,</b> hose and tube that penetrates the wing must be sealed to prevent fuel from leaking or seeping around these hardware components. This sealant must allow for expansion and contraction due to rapid temperature changes (such as when cold fuel is pumped into a warm wing tank) and must retain its sealing properties when submerged in fuel and when left dry {{for long periods of}} time. Working with this sealant can be difficult and replacing old sealant inside a small wing tank can be harder if the old sealant needs to be removed as well before new sealant can be applied.|$|E
50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a <b>nut</b> <b>plate,</b> anchor nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|E

Materials being considered for these fasteners are a polyetherertherketone (PEEK) resin with continuous quartz or carbon fiber for the screw. The screws were designed to have a shear strength equivalent to that of compact/trabecular bone and {{to be used with}} a conventional nut, <b>nut</b> <b>plate,</b> or an expandable shank/blind nut made of a ceramic filled polymer. Physical and finite element models of the mandible were developed in order to help select the best material fastener design. The models replicate the softer inner core of trabecular bone and the hard outer shell of compact bone. The inner core of the physical model consisted of an expanding foam and the hard outer shell consisted of ceramic particles in an epoxy matrix. This model has some of the cutting and drilling attributes of bone and may be appropriate as an educational tool for surgeons and medical students. The finite element model was exercised to establish boundary conditions consistent with the stress profiles associated with mandible bite forces and muscle loads. Work is continuing to compare stress/strain profiles of a reconstructed mandible with the results from the finite element model. When optimized, these design and fastening techniques may be applicable, not only to other skeletal structures, but to any composite structure...|$|E

There were the men who unloaded the trucks, the labourers who did the earth work, and the more skilled hands who levelled it. As fast as the trucks were emptied, gangs of men carried the sleepers forward, and laid them down roughly in position; others followed, and corrected the distance between each.

40|$|The wide {{choice of}} {{cross-sectional}} shapes obtainable by extrusion provides {{the possibility to}} individuate new joining solution for aluminium profiles. These joints, named “special” or “non-conventional” joints, are very competitive with respect to conventional solutions because {{of the possibility of}} rapid execution, optimization of parent material, treatments and machining reduction. For these reasons, the aluminium industry is very interested to enhance the knowledge about the structural behaviour of this joint typology. The work is focused on two different special joint systems: screw ports and bolt-channel joints. In particular, the first joint typology consists in a screw engaged in an open or closed slot of an extruded profile. The latter system consists in a track or channel section profile in which a bolt head, <b>nuts</b> or <b>plates</b> with threaded holes can be located. Special joints are used in several structural and non applications under low and moderate loads such as façades, door and window fixtures. But, in the last years, other structural applications like staircases, floors, pedestrian bridge, industrial furniture and shelves have been developed involving special joints. Nevertheless, very little literature is available for this system and no specifications are provided by aluminium structures codes. The main objective of this work is to overcome the lack of information about the mechanical behaviour of special joints. In order to evaluate the structural behaviour of such joint, a wide experimental campaign has been carried out.

Two types of joints, i. e. double lap simple and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints were prepared for testing. In order to measure the clamping force or pretension resulting from the tightening torque at different applied torques, for both types of joints, a special experimental method was designed using a steel bush that was placed between the <b>nut</b> and the <b>plate.</b> Two strain gauges were stuck to the outer surface of the bush to measure the compressive axial strain and also the stress in the bush using Hooke’s law. Finally, the axial force in the bush and subsequently the clamping force were determined.

The relationship between the applied tightening torques and the mean value of compressive strains for both types of joints are shown in graphs...|$|R

In this investigation a ferrocement roof truss {{has been designed}} which are of low in cost, light in weight and easy to maintain. The first step of design involves the calculation of dead load using IS 875 (part- 1) and wind load using IS 875 (part- 3) - 1987. The next step involves the calculation of tension and compression in each individual member of the truss. Sections of the truss are designed using the value of highest tension or compression. After designing all the sections, the truss is constructed. A 6 -mm diameter circular coil is used as reinforcing material for construction and angles of desired shape are made to hold the sections in position. Hexagonal wire mesh or chicken mess is cut into required sizes and are placed over the reinforced skeleton of the section. Conventional mortar of cement sand ratio of 1 : 2 is prepared.

40|$|In this research, both {{experimental}} and numerical methods {{were used to}} investigate the fatigue behaviour of bolted plates. In the experimental part of the research, a holed plate was clamped using a bolt and a nut, and then tested under axial cyclic load in a fatigue testing machine. In order to obtain S-N curves and investigate the direct effect of the isolated clamping force on the fatigue behaviour of the bolted plates, three batches of specimens each subjected to different clamping forces were fatigue tested. The clamping forces were obtained experimentally from the compressive axial strain of a steel bush which was placed between the <b>nut</b> and the <b>plate.</b> In the numerical method, to determine the stress and strain distributions due to combined clamping force and axial load in plate, 3 D finite element models were generated using a numerical package. Numerical simulation and experimental {{results showed that the}} fatigue life of bolted plates improve because of the compressive stresses created around the plate hole due to clamping force. The life improvement was greatest at the high cycle fatigue life region of the S-N curves. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the search}} for a seismic {{isolator}} for low-rise buildings, this paper proposes a marble-graphite slide seismic isolation system composed of marble-graphite slides, an upper foundation beam, the lower counter{{part of the}} upper beam, and the corresponding stop blocks, with the stop blocks consisting of restrictive screws, positioning <b>plates,</b> <b>nut</b> connectors and stop holes linking the two foundation beams. To provide the desired isolation performance, plain mortar bars can be included at the beam interface to better control the initiating loads for foundation slippage. Tests of low-reversed cyclic loading were performed on four different masonry specimens: a recycled brick wall, a clay brick wall, an integrated recycled brick wall with flay ash blocks sandwiched between, and its clay brick counterpart. The four specimens were provided with marble-graphite slide isolators placed at the foundations. The isolator thickness was 20 mm, and the graphite and the marble served as a lubricant and a bearing, respectively. This paper then analyses all of the specimens in terms of the damage that occurred, the initiating load for slippage, the hysteretic performance, the bearing capacity and the performance of the stop blocks. The results indicate that mortar bars embedded in the marble-graphite slide isolator offer effective control of the initiating load, and the isolation system delivers good hysteretic performance. The stop blocks are capable of withstanding a large-magnitude earthquake and are a good choice for constraining the slippage displacement. Damage or failure of the specimens occurs only when the low-reversed cyclic loading continues after slippage takes place. The design is shown to be an outstanding and flexible seismic scheme for use in low-rise buildings...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a review of}} different techniques to tighten a bolted joint and investigates {{the ability of the}} methods to tighten the joint to a prescribed bolt tension. A literature survey was undertaken which revealed that different opinions exist regarding the performance of certain tightening methods and the influence of several commonly encountered factors on them. Test equipment was designed and built to study the performance of five tightening methods: torque control, angle control - elastic range, angle control - yield range, yield control, and load indicating washers. The effects of a number of practical factors on the performance of these methods were investigated. The main factors investigated were: joint stiffness, <b>nut</b> and bolt <b>plating</b> and geometry, and washer type. The tests have shown that yield controlled tightening and angle control (yield range) provide the most accurate methods of tightening a bolted joint to a prescribed bolt tension (+/- 5 %). Torque control and load indicating washers (Coronet) can tighten the joint to +/- 10 %. Angle control (elastic range) gives relatively poor control over bolt tension (+/- 14 %), largely due to variations in snug position and tension-angle gradient. The deflections of the joint components influence the performance of the angle-related tightening methods. The deflection of the threaded connection itself is significant, especially for 'hard' joints. This contribution to the overall deflection has been largely neglected in previous studies. Methods to improve the accuracy of the tightening methods are discussed. In particular the use of hardened washers to improve the accuracy and repeatability of torque control is recommended. Furthermore, preliminary tests were conducted on the design of a washer, which would indicate when the joint has been tightened to a prescribed tension...|$|R

Both natural and artificially contaminated Brasil nuts were studied in the present work. The former were inoculated with either 1 x 106 or 1 x 107 conidia mL- 1 of A. flavus (MUM 9201). Previous assays were carried out to determine optimal parameters of the treatment. Different aqueous ozone contact time was assayed. The duration was controlled {{by the addition of}} a sodium formate solution. Such assays evidenced that the effect of ozone is almost immediate. Also, different ozone concentrations were assayed. The optimum ozone concentration depended on the initial viable spores on the nutshell. Also, the effect of the ozonization on the shell nut color was assessed by measuring chromaticity values of the treated fruits in the L*a*b* space coordinates. High concentrations of ozone affected both the luminosity and the hue of the nutshell. Finally, a concentrated aqueous ozone solution was assayed on both natural and artificially contaminated nuts. The remaining viable spores in the ozone solution were recorded and the rate of inactivation for each treatment was determined by assessing the ratio between the CFU of each treatment and the control. Ozonized <b>nuts</b> were also <b>plated</b> on MEA to recover the fungi population. Aqueous ozone was effective in reducing the conidia of Aspergillus flavus and the natural fungal population associated to Brazil nuts, although it seems to affect external appearance of the shell.
