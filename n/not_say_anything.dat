5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

Alex visits Christopher Sim’s home and the school where he taught before the war; both are maintained as shrines to his memory. He locates and meets with Hugh Scott, in spite of Scott’s obvious reluctance. Scott will <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about theTenandrome mission, except {{to confirm that the}} survey ship found something and that there was a good reason to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the Tenadrome had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will say no more.|$|E

The Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh provides a story in which Brian challenges High King Máel Sechnaill to a battle at the Hill of Tara {{in the province of}} Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. Máel Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.|$|E
25|$|According to Greek {{accounts}} Xandrammes was deposed by Sandrokottos, son of Sandrokottos. Chandragupta Maurya {{had opposed}} Dhanananda of the Nanda dynasty; {{his son was}} Bindusara. These names (Dhanananda and Bindusara) are dissimilar to the names Xandrammes and Sandrocyptus in the Greek accounts. However, {{as in the case}} of Amitraghata (Bindusara), Greek sources mention secondary (Sanskritic) names for Indian kings. The Greek accounts contain statements from Greek and Roman writers from the fourth century BC to the second century CE. None mention Kautilya or Ashoka. Kautilya, according to tradition, helped Chandragupta to the throne. Ashoka's empire was larger than Chandragupta's. Colebrook has pointed out that the Greek writers did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the Buddhist Bhikkhus (although that was the predominant religion of the time) due to Ashoka's patronage. Herodotos, in his Histories, about 420 BC, mentions ascetics in the Punjab.|$|E

25|$|Kathy returns a {{few days}} later and meets with Ben, who is furious to see her again after several years of believing she was dead. He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} the Welsh name [...] "Arthur" [...] remains a matter of debate. Some suggest it {{is derived from the}} Roman nomen gentile (family name) Artorius, of obscure and contested {{etymology}} (but possibly of Messapian or Etruscan origin). Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as Arthur, or Arturus, in early Latin Arthurian texts, never as Artōrius (though {{it should be noted that}} Classical Latin Artōrius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, this may <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the {{origin of the}} name Arthur, as Artōrius would regularly become Art(h)ur when borrowed into Welsh.|$|E

When Ganesan asked the reason for including it, Arur Doss mentioned that Ganesan's character would be looked upon by the theatre audiences in a negative light if he did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to confirm his love for Saroja Devi's character.

His prototypes included games based on Joe Montana (Joe Montana Wide Receiver Training Camp) and David Robinson, but when presented, the company asked for more shooting games and scrapped all license-based games (besides ToeJam & Earl, whose license was free) due to their added cost. His [...] "reverse Blockout game" [...] prototype was the only other title carried to the final cartridge. Senour recalled that upon his cubicle presentation to Sega Japan's president, the executive did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> besides [...] "very good" [...] before leaving.

Mulder tells Skinner that a bank near the police station took a picture of the detective, which shows him with Skinner, but the picture is too obscured for Mulder to identify him. Skinner calls Covarrubias, who does not have any evidence to provide him at this time. The entomologist is killed by a swarm of bees. The next day, Mulder and Skinner look at his body, which is infected with smallpox transmitted by the bees.

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained. When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the Kentish Note Book magazine a list appeared with [...] "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff". [...] Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term aptronym is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist Franklin P. Adams. Linguist Frank Nuessel coined aptonym, without an [...] "r", in 1992. Other synonyms include euonym, Perfect Fit Last Name (PFLN), and namephreak. In literary science a name that particularly suits a character is called a charactonym. Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include Charles Dickens (e.g., Mr. Gradgrind, the tyrannical schoolmaster) and William Shakespeare (e.g., the lost baby Perdita in The Winter's Tale). Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.|$|E
500|$|After {{his girlfriend}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) sues her former {{employer}} Dunder Mifflin for wrongful termination, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) finds himself forced by Jan to {{be a witness}} against his employer.

Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The deposition goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her breast augmentation. To counter evidence that she had a romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal diary, which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that she gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that [...] "you expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend."
