40|$|We {{report a}} method for {{accelerated}} <b>nanoscale</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging by detecting several signals in parallel. Our technique relies on phase multiplexing, where the signals from different nuclear spin ensembles are encoded in the phase of an ultrasensitive magnetic detector. We demonstrate this technique by simultaneously acquiring statistically polarized spin signals from two different nuclear species (1 H, 19 F) and from up to six spatial locations in a nanowire test sample using a magnetic resonance force microscope. We obtain one-dimensional imaging resolution better than 5 nm, and subnanometer positional accuracy. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Nanomagnetometry {{using the}} nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond has {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} interest because of the combined features of room temperature operation, nanoscale resolution and high sensitivity. One of the important goals for nano-magnetometry {{is to be able to}} detect <b>nanoscale</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) in individual molecules. Our theoretical analysis shows how a single molecule at the surface of diamond, with characteristic NMR frequencies, can be detected using a proximate NV centre on a time scale of order seconds with nanometer precision. We perform spatio-temporal resolution optimisation and also outline paths to greater sensitivity. In addition, the method is suitable for application in low and relatively inhomogeneous background magnetic fields in contrast to both conventional liquid and solid state NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{application}} of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy at progressively smaller length scales may eventually permit "chemical imaging" of spins at {{the surfaces of}} materials and biological complexes. In particular, the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centre in diamond has been exploited as an optical transducer for <b>nanoscale</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance.</b> However, the spectra of detected spins are generally broadened by their interaction with proximate paramagnetic NV- centres through coherent and incoherent mechanisms. Here we demonstrate a detection technique that can resolve the spectra of electron spins coupled to NV- centres, namely substitutional nitrogen (NS) and neutral nitrogen-vacancy (NV 0) centres in diamond, through optically detected cross-relaxation. The hyperfine spectra of these spins are a unique chemical identifier, suggesting the possibility, in combination with recent results in diamonds harbouring shallow NV- implants, that the spectra of spins external to the diamond can be similarly detected.

40|$|Progress {{in science}} is intimately {{connected}} with our {{insights into the}} processes and phenomena occurring in our surroundings. Since ancient times, people were puzzled by sophisticated apparatuses designed by the elite of the time. The transition from the Middle Ages into modern time, the period of Renaissance, {{is characterized by the}} purposeful application of such devices for a better and deeper understanding of our world. This fundamental issue of science remains unchanged even today and diffusion research is no exception. The first contribution, authored by Nikolaus Nestle, introduces us to the phenomenon of diffusion in general and to the options for its observation, by which diffusion {{turns out to be a}} "macroscale dwarf and <b>nanoscale</b> giant". <b>Nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) is among the most powerful techniques of diffusion research. Its arsenal includes options to trace diffusion phenomena over essentially all space and time scales, starting from the elementary steps of diffusion over fractions of nanometers up to tens of meters (for example in the study of concentration profiles in geological systems). We start with two contributions by William S. Price and Philip W. Kuchel, highlighting two aspects of the measuring technique related to sample-polydispersity an...|$|R

40|$|A super-resolution {{parameter}} estimation scheme for multi-dimensional <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy {{is presented in}} this paper. Multi-dimensional <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> signals can be modeled as the summation of multi-dimensional damped sinusoids. The frequencies and the damping factors of multi-dimensional damped sinusoids play important roles in protein structure determination using multi-dimensional <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy. A super-resolution frequency and damping factor estimation algorithm is proposed. Since this algorithm makes full use of the rank-deficiency and Hankel properties of the data matrix composed of multi-dimensional <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> data, compared with other <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> data analysis algorithms, it {{has the ability to}} resolve the spectrum using very few data points.
