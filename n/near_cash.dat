40|$|In this research, I {{surveyed}} merchant {{and customer}} preferences for cash, <b>near</b> <b>cash,</b> and electronic cash (e-cash). E-cash promises new but untested advantages in security, portability, and privacy. In this research, I conducted a large survey of e-cash acceptance by customers and retail merchants to provide 3 preference orderings for cash, <b>near</b> <b>cash,</b> and e-cash. Nonparametric hypothesis testing showed that e-cash was preferred to other payment methods, but the statistics were equivocal. Stochastic dominance statistics explained the equivocal results returned from nonparametric tests. E-cash dominated the hybrid card but was clearly dominated by traditional cash. E-cash neither dominated nor {{was dominated by}} credit cards and debit cards. After adjusting for technology adoption risk, a clear preference ordering was obtained: (a) cash and credit cards were preferred to e-cash, and (b) e-cash was preferred to debit cards and hybrids. I conclude that e-cash is unlikely to compete well against cash and credit cards for 3 reasons: (a) switching costs, (b) technology risk, and (c) insufficient market differentiation. The results suggest that {{there may not be}} a market niche for 6 -cash. Instead, successful products are likely to emerge in the form of vertical market cash substitutes that meet specific objectives. As commerce evolves toward customization to a focused cross-section of consumers, a "one-size-fits-all" e-cash is not likely to remain a viable product...|$|E

40|$|The {{cash and}} <b>near</b> <b>cash</b> safety net in the U. S. has {{undergone}} a dramatic transformation in the past fifteen years. Federal welfare reform {{has led to the}} “elimination of {{welfare as we know it}} ” and several tax reforms have substantially increased the role of “in-work” ' assistance. In 2010, we spent more than 5 dollars on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for every dollar spent on cash benefits through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), whereas in 1994 on the eve of federal welfare reform these programs were about equal in size. In this paper, we evaluate and test whether the EITC satisfies a defining feature of a safety net program—that it responds to economic need. In particular, we explore how EITC participation and expenditures change with the business cycle. The fact that the EITC requires earned income leads to a theoretical ambiguity in the cyclical responsiveness of the credit. We use administrative IRS data to examine the relationship between business cycles and the EITC program. Our empirical strategy relies on exploiting differences in the timing and severity of economic cycles across states. The results show that higher unemployment rates lead to higher EITC recipients and total dollar amounts of credits for married couples. On the other hand, the effect of business cycles on the EITC is insignificant for single individuals, whether measured by recipients or expenditures. In sum, our results show that the EITC serves to mitigat...|$|E
40|$|The term {{working capital}} refers to short term funds {{required}} for financing {{the duration of}} the operating cycle in a business often known as “Accounting year”. These funds are used for carrying out the routine or regular business operations consisting of purchase of raw materials, payment of direct and indirect expenses, carrying out of production, investment in stocks and stores and amount to be maintained in the form of cash. It represents funds with which business is carried on. It can also be regarded as that proportion of the company’s total capital, which is employed in short term operations. It is not necessary that the amount is always available in the form of cash. It can take the form of <b>near</b> <b>cash</b> assets or even assets a little further from cash, but yet in the process of moving towards the cash form in a short period. The study of working capital management occupies an important place in financial management. It has never received so much attention as in recent years. Working capital management {{is an integral part of}} overall financial management. The sphere of working capital throws a welcome challenge and opportunity to a financial manager. “Working capital management has been looked upon as the driving seat of financial manager. ” The management of working capital is synonymous with the management of short term financial liquidity. The importance of short term liquidity can best be gauged by examining the repercussions which stem from a lack of ability to meet short term obligations. After testing every industries liquidity, working capital efficiency level and financial leverage position, their performance has been compared through ratio analysis. There around 19 ratios have compared of every units...|$|E

40|$|Location-based {{services}} (LBS) and context-aware systems typically {{exploit the}} tracking {{of people to}} offer personalised services. Examples of these sorts of applications include allowing vulnerable people to summon help to their current location, providing personalised guidance, ordering a taxi and finding the <b>nearest</b> <b>cash</b> point. To provide such services, information about the users' location needs to be published {{to one or more}} service providers (possibly third party organisations.) Key factors in the acceptance of such systems are preservation of control and awareness of dissemination of this information; people using these services {{do not want to be}} under surveillance. The fundamental difference between tracking and surveillance is who is in control. There is little or no provision for access control to location information in current systems. In this paper we offer a scheme whereby users can reveal their position to trusted parties whenever they want to, and retain control over the dissemination of their position to others. Furthermore, our scheme does not compromise the ability of the service provider to offer their services to users or gather statistical and demographic information on the systems' usage...|$|R
