Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>policy</b> {{in the form of}} the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine. Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC.|$|E

Approach: The study reviewed the <b>national</b> information <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> of different courtiers, focusing on the dominant factors of all of these policies. These factors were compiled and compared in order to determine the common and the non-common policy considerations among these countries. The countries considered include: USA, Malaysia, Australia, Canada and China, in addition to the European Union. Results: Recognizing all the common and non-common dominant factors considered by the policies of all the countries considered, the study delivered a generic framework that incorporates all of these dominant factors. Conclusion: The resulted generic framework can be used as a guide for the improvement of existing <b>national</b> information <b>security</b> <b>policies</b> in different countries and for the future development of such policies in countries where they do not yet exist...|$|R
25|$|SSR is {{considered}} an instrument of international development aid; and attaining good SSG is seen by practitioners as a conflict prevention tool and as a post-conflict stabilizer. Examples of mechanisms that international actors reportedly use to perform security sector reform include disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes to try and synchronize reforms to the security sector—and rule of law reforms as justice and security sectors are often considered intertwined. Likewise, SSR can be performed along transitional justice processes if the security sector has a legacy of violence against the population—and during security policy discussions to use SSR in supporting the implementation and reviews of the states' <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>policy</b> and strategy.|$|E

SALT II limited both sides to 2,250 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (bombers, ICBMs, SLBMs, and air-to-surface ballistic missiles), including a sublimit of 1,200 launchers of MIRVed ballistic missiles, of which only 820 could be launchers of MIRVed ICBMs. It also placed restrictions on the number of warheads on each missile and on deployment of new land-based ballistic missile systems, except for one new type of light ICBM for each side. There was also a provision for verification by each side using its own national technical means.|$|E

25|$|The Conservative Party {{believes}} {{that in the}} 21st century defence and security are interlinked. It has pledged to break away from holding a traditional Strategic Defence Review and have committed to carrying out a more comprehensive Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) immediately upon coming into office. This review will include both defence and homeland security related matters. The Labour Government last conducted a review in 1998. To prevent a long gap in the future it also pledged to hold regular defence reviews every 4–5years, and if necessary will put this requirement into legislation. Party officials claim that the SDSR will be a major improvement, and will ensure that Britain maintains generic and flexible capability to adapt to any changing threats. It will be a cross-departmental review that will begin with foreign policy priorities and will bring together all the levers of domestic <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>policy</b> with overseas interests and defence priorities.|$|E
500|$|The Socreds {{proposed}} {{an increase in}} the old age pension to $100 per month.

The party called for a <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>policy</b> based on the need for defence, rather than [...] "aggression", and for a foreign policy which would include food aid to the less-developed nations.|$|E

In 1958, he was appointed Special Assistant to the President for Security Operations Coordination and vice chairman of the Operations Coordinating Board.

500|$|The SAMS {{course was}} {{designed}} {{to fill a gap}} in US military education between the CGSC's focus on tactics and the War College's focus on grand strategy and <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>policy.</b> In 1981, Colonel Huba Wass de Czege convinced Lieutenant General William R. Richardson, who was serving as Commander of the Combined Arms Center and Commandant of the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth from 1979 to 1981, that a second year of military education was needed for select officers. After receiving final approval, Wass de Czege helped plan and develop the school, which would open in mid-1983. Although there was some disagreement about the purpose of the course, army leaders and the course designers settled on a plan to provide officers with a [...] "broad, deep military education in the science and art of war." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 29, 2008, Clark made {{comments}} on Face the Nation that were critical of Republican John McCain, {{calling into question}} the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. [...] "I certainly honor [...] service as a prisoner of war", Clark said, [...] "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall." [...] When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he [...] "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down", Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is what drew rebuke. In referring to McCain's military experience, he stated: [...] "Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." [...] Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark's comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were [...] "inartful" [...] and were not intended to attack McCain's military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain's service, he has serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of <b>national</b> <b>security</b> <b>policy,</b> calling McCain [...] "untested and untried".|$|E
