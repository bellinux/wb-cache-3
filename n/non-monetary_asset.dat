50|$|The IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) {{committee}} {{developed the}} International Accounting System 38 {{with the purpose}} of prescribing the accounting treatment for intangible assets. IAS 38.8 defines an intangible asset as an identifiable <b>non-monetary</b> <b>asset</b> without physical substance. An asset is a resource that is controlled by the entity as the result of past events (for example purchase or self-creation) and from which future economic benefits (inflows of cash or other benefits) are expected.|$|E
5000|$|International Accounting Standards Board {{standard}} 38 (IAS 38) defines an {{intangible asset}} as: [...] "an identifiable <b>non-monetary</b> <b>asset</b> without physical substance." [...] This definition is {{in addition to}} the standard definition of an asset which requires a past event that has given rise to a resource that the entity controls and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow. Thus, the extra requirement for an intangible asset under IAS 38 is identifiability. This criterion requires that an intangible asset is separable from the entity or that it arises from a contractual or legal right.|$|E
30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{issue is}} whether investors derive non-monetary benefits from a firm’s CSP irrespective {{of the sort of}} financing (equity, debt) with which they are involved in a sustainable company or project. From a business ethics perspective, one can argue that being the owners, the shareholders of a company are indeed in charge of the social responsibility of the firm (Schaefer 2008). Following this argument, one can attribute the social responsibility of a company rather to its shareholders than to its bondholders. If investors follow this view, they should not be indifferent between debt or equity investments concerning the CSP. However, from the viewpoint of an entity approach, the value of a company’s assets is attributed partly to debt and partly to equity capital. The CSP can be seen as an additional <b>non-monetary</b> <b>asset,</b> which is appreciated by the investors through lower cost of capital (Goss and Roberts 2011; Ghoul et al. 2011). However, since debt as well as equity costs of capital are lowered by a strong CSP, one can argue that both forms of capital share a part of the <b>non-monetary</b> <b>asset.</b> This second argument suggests that individuals assess their participation in a company’s CSP independently of the form of financing. Summarizing, there is no clear prior concerning this question. Nevertheless, we propose the following hypothesis, without a clear expectation of confirming it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the current Belgian accounting reform. This reform treats the transition from a cameralistic/cash accounting to a system that integrates both the cameralistic and the accrual accounting in Flemish municipalities. The focus is on actual empirical outcomes of implementation and disclosure based on a sample of annual accounts. An important issue is the lack of a conceptual disclosing framework, which leads to a number of problems and shortcomings in the disclosed annual accounts. The empirical examination reveals that certain important information items such as pension provisions are not disclosed nor commented and that the disclosure considering <b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets</b> is questionable. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} monetary-asset user-cost risk {{adjustment}} of Barnett, Liu and Jensen (1997) and their risk-adjusted Divisia monetary aggregates {{to the case}} of multiple non-monetary assets and intertemporal non-separability. Our model can generate potentially larger and more accurate CCAPM user-cost risk adjustments than those found in Barnett, Liu and Jensen (1997). We show that the risk adjustment to a monetary asset’s user cost can be measured easily by its beta. We show that any risky <b>non-monetary</b> <b>asset</b> can be used as the benchmark asset, if its rate of return is adjusted in accordance with our formula. These extensions could be especially useful, when own rates of return are subject to exchange rate risk, as in Barnett (2003).

30|$|Several studies {{focus on}} {{accounting}} identification, accounting measurement, and accounting policy. The basis of accounting identification is accrual accounting, butliterature raises {{the concept of}} cash flow based accounting, adjusted from cash based accounting, that could provide more useful information for decision making and solve the limitations of accrual based accounting. For accounting measurement, Lin (1997) investigates the relationship between uncertainty and accounting which argues that accounting has a time-lag and that uncertainty comes from monetary measurement. Xie (1997) presents two <b>non-monetary</b> <b>asset</b> measure models on the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory of value which {{are different from the}} capital preservation concept of accounting. Meanwhile, with the development of financial derivatives, Huang (1997 a) believes that historical cost accounting will be replaced by fair value accounting in the twenty-first century and briefly introduces the concept of fair value accounting in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). With respect to accounting policy, Huang and Yang (1995) explore questions such as what is accounting policy and why there is accounting policy. They regard accounting policy as the principle, procedure and method by which a certain accounting unit is used to make financial statements, including macro-level accounting policy such as accounting standards, and firm-level accounting policy issued by the firms themselves according to their particular situations. Consistent with Huang and Yang (1995), Li and Zhu (1996) argue that accounting environment and firm operation should be taken into consideration for the choice of accounting policy. As well, Huang and Yang (1996) investigate accounting policy in details, that is the separation between financial accounting and tax accounting in accounting policy. Financial accounting and tax accounting are separated due to different objectives, legislative authority and calculation principles. Compared with accounting development internationally, Tang and Lu (1997) put forward the challenge for financial accounting in China, including accounting identification, accounting measurement, financial reporting, accounting theory, the release and diffusion of accounting information, and the combination of financial accounting and managerial accounting.|$|E
50|$|Historical cost {{does not}} {{generally}} reflect current market valuation. Alternative measurement bases {{to the historical}} cost measurement basis, which may be applied for some types of assets for which market values are readily available, require that the carrying value of an asset (or liability) be updated to the market price (mark-to-market valuation) or some other estimate of value that better approximates the real value. Accounting standards may also have different methods required or allowed (even for different types of balance sheet variable real value <b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets</b> or liabilities) {{as to how the}} resultant change in value of an asset or liability is recorded, as a part of income or as a direct change to shareholders' equity.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model in}} which panics are caused by the strategic behavior of agents who temporarily monopolize the supply of privately controlled cash reserves. The decision to exercise this "monopoly power" results in localized "corners" on the money market and hence an abrupt alteration {{in the rate of}} exchange between cash and <b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets.</b> This sudden appearance of a premium on liquidity produces the dramatic increase in interest rates, decrease in security prices and wave of "contagious" bank runs which are characteristic of panics. Since the nonzero probability of a panic's occurrence reduces the expected rate of return on bank deposits, individuals respond to the threat of this outcome by hoarding otherwise productive resources. As this has the effect of reducing investment­-and therefore output, consumption and government tax revenue [...] deposit insurance and an institutionalized of lender of last resort (which prevents panics by ensuring that the supply of legal tender is sufficiently elastic to guarantee competitive behavior among private holders of cash reserves) emerge endogenously as the result of utility maximizing behavior.

30|$|The {{sovereign}} money {{reform is}} obviously {{related to the}} proposals for full reserve banking and to the “Chicago plan,” where commercial banks are imposed a 100 % reserve requirement on deposits. Sovereign money is similar to full reserve coverage, but it goes one step further as it gives full control of sight deposits by the central bank. 3 Moreover, the initiative goes much further than the concept of sovereign money. It would introduce constraints on monetary policy and would imply that SNB liabilities are no longer matched by its assets.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of the international accounting standards in Brazil allowed the companies to value fixed asset items at their fair value, using the deemed cost as an authorized procedure to lend a new monetary translation to these items, with the net equity and possible reflections in the liabilities serving as the counterparts. This permission was restricted to {{the year of the}} initial {{adoption of}} the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), while its use was prohibited for subsequent periods. As the monetary update {{of the cost of the}} companies <b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets</b> had been revoked more than a decade earlier, the {{adoption of the}} deemed cost would signal a possibility of value recomposition and that this possibility could alter the magnitude of the structural indicators of the companies’ equity status. In this context, the objective of the article is to investigate and evidence whether the use of the deemed cost by the Brazilian companies listed on BM&F, in the initial adoption of the IFRS standard in 2009 significantly altered the quantum of the structural indicators Indebtedness Level (IL) and Return on Assets (ROA). To obtain the results, quantitative models were used, based on the variance analysis through the test of means, Pearson’s correlation matrix and descriptive statistics. The results, with a 95 % confidence level, suggest that, in statistical terms, the use of the deemed cost in Brazil was not attractive for the companies, did not produce significant alterations in the Indebtedness Level (IL) and Return on Assets (ROA) and did not reveal any significant undervaluation of the corporate fixed assets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the link between}} portfolio diversification models of exchange risk and the macroeconomics of exchange rate determination. A first part sets out the mean-variance model of portfolio choice for the case of two nominal assets with random real returns. From there the model is made "international" by a specification of the world inflation process. The concept of exchange risk is {{discussed in terms of}} the variability of the real exchange rate. The paper shows that when all randomness in real returns derives from variability of the real exchange rate, rather than from inflation variability, full hedging is possible. Even for the case of no real exchange rate variability, it is shown, variability of the nominal rate of depreciation is a determinant of the portfolio composition. The risk premium is derived and discussed in terms of the deviation of the anticipated rate of depreciation from the interest differential. The actual rate of depreciation may exceed the interest differential either because of news or because of a risk premium that depends on the relative asset supplies compared to their shares in a minimum variance portfolio. An appendix investigates the implications of tastes and differences and shows that there is an additional component of the premium due to differences in consumption patterns. The portfolio model is integrated In a macro-model to show how the relative supplies of <b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets,</b> through yield and valuation effects, determine the impact and long run consequences of real and nominal monetary disturbances. The integration of the portfolio and macro models relies crucially on the properties of the demand for money. A demand for money that depend. on the average return on securities, rather than on the domestic interest rate, implies that portfolio considerations do not affect exchange rates. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are clear}} {{indications}} that the present “old” industrial economy needs a serious adjustment to become compatible with the aims of a sustainable society. The main issues involved are the time factor, resource productivity and socio-cultural ecology. -the time factor: sustainability is a long-term societal vision concerned with the stewardship {{of natural resources and}} assets in order to safeguard the opportunities and choices of future generations. The industrial economy is often limited to a short-term optimization of throughput in monetary terms. Changing course towards a more sustainable society means to introduce the indeterministic time factor into economic thinking, which again implies an indeterministic vision of economics and the capability to deal with uncertainty. -resource productivity: in the present industrial economy, micro- and macro-economic success is directly coupled with resource flows (flows of matter and energy), due to its linear structure. The per capita resource consumption of this system cannot be generalized to the less developed countries without a world system collapse. In order to become sustainable, industrial economies must operate at a much higher level of resource productivity, i. e. be able to produce the same utilization value out of a greatly reduced resource throughput 1. This change of course can be achieved by decoupling economic success and resource throughput - one {{way to do this is}} to change to a service economy, in which the measure of success refers to the performance of assets (stocks) instead of flows, and to stock utilization (Giarini and Stahel, 1989 / 93). - social and cultural ecology: the industrial economy has been largely technology-focused, using monetarized values as its main yardstick. A sustainable society is result-focused and based on social and cultural values (<b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets),</b> as well as economic values. Changing course towards a more sustainable society means to take into account social and cultural factors as peers to economic ones. The role of money still needs to be better understood and accepted, but the creation of wealth will increasingly depend on nonmonetarized assets and activities. This adaptation corresponds to a fundamental change, or paradigm shift, as the objectives of a service economy are quite different from those of an industrial economy: to maintain or increase total wealth and welfare, i. e. the monetary and <b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets</b> of society, over long periods of time. Its focal point is the optimization of utilization, i. e. of the performance and the results achieved with goods, rather than the goods themselves. The central notion of economic value in the service economy is the value of utilization over time, in contrast to the momentary value of exchange at the POS (point of sale) in the industrial economy (the added value system is only a subsystem of a larger economic concept). Similarly, quality in the service economy is defined as long-term optimization of system functioning, not as a momentary quality at the POS. For this paradigm shift towards a sustainable society, new tools are needed to control liabilities and simultaneously speed up innovation in commercial and technical areas, and to provide benchmarks for assessing new solutions. Insurance is maybe the only quick way to provide free-market safety nets for real innovation, and the concept of insurability is probably the most efficient free market assessment tool to chose between different options. This means that insurance and insurability could play a key role in the transition towards sustainability. But as a higher resource productivity also induces reduced costs (the “double dividend” of reduced resource procurement costs and reduced waste costs), insurance could even be the hidden joker to achieve a higher and greener economic competitiveness. Today, only few people in insurance, politics or the economy are aware of these links and opportunities, which this paper will try to show. ...|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurial ventures {{are the key}} {{drivers of}} innovation, job {{creation}} and economic growth worldwide. These entrepreneurial ventures however require external assistance {{to be able to}} compete against bigger players in the global market. It has been recognized that the main issue in hindering growth of these entrepreneurial ventures relates to the lack of financial resources and also partly the lack of knowledge and expertise of global markets. Due to the shortages in available capital, alternative forms of financing have emerged in addition to the more traditional venture capital. One of these emerging forms of financing is called equity crowdfunding, which is essentially collecting monetary investments from a large pool of people through an online platform. With relation to the often highlighted resource shortages hindering the growth of entrepreneurial ventures, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the differences between venture capital and equity crowdfunding in the context of Finnish entrepreneurial ventures. In more detail, this research examines the strategic reasons that companies have on choosing their funding instruments and how this choice affects the company’s growth and internationalization in the subsequent years. The empirical part of this study has been conducted as a multiple case study with six entrepreneurial ventures all operating in the technology sector. In addition the empirical part of this study also utilizes three industry expert opinions in order to provide a more in-depth data collection process. Research data was collected through nine semi-structured thematic interviews, with six interviews with the entrepreneurs of the chosen case companies and three external industry experts, who represented the views and opinions of the venture capital and equity crowdfunding industries. The findings of this study demonstrate that Finnish entrepreneurial ventures primarily prefer venture capital as their financing instrument. The entrepreneurs perceive that venture capital aids them in their growth and international expansion through the connections and experience of the venture capitalist, while also future funding and exit opportunities were seen as major strategic reasons to choose venture capital. Equity crowdfunding on the other hand was primarily seen as a complicated financing instrument, which is still suffering from the previous legal restrictions, which prevented companies from utilizing online crowdfunding to the fullest potential. Strategic factors related to equity crowdfunding were focused on the additional visibility and market traction it creates, while also on the flexibility in terms of governance. Finally this study finds that both of these funding instruments can be seen to aid companies in growth and international expansion through the <b>non-monetary</b> <b>assets</b> they provide, however venture capital was found to provide even better foundations for this growth...|$|R
