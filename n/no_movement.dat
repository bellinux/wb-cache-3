5|$|On 6 November 1981, Thatcher and Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had {{established}} the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, {{a forum for}} meetings between the two governments. On 15 November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough Anglo-Irish Agreement, which {{marked the first time}} a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. In protest, the Ulster Says <b>No</b> <b>movement</b> led by Ian Paisley attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast, Ian Gow, later assassinated by the PIRA, resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury, and all 15 Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23 January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with <b>no</b> <b>movement,</b> the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. <b>No</b> <b>movement</b> is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|In the 17thcentury Civil Wars, townspeople of Poulton {{fought on}} both sides, {{although}} more {{men from the}} Fylde were {{on the side of}} the Royalists. No battles occurred in or close to Poulton but the area was affected with the rest of the county by the widespread poverty that resulted from the wars. In 1643 interest was stirred in the parish when a large Spanish vessel dropped anchor off the coast at Rossall. The ship made <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> for several days but fired its guns occasionally. Locals initially feared an invasion, but eventually realised that the crew was in distress and had been signalling for help. The vessel was carrying ammunition for the Parliamentarian forces and the crew had become sick and feeble. The ship was brought by Royalists into the mouth of the River Wyre and the Earl of Derby marched from across the River Ribble. He ordered the ship to be burnt and the Spanish crew to be set free.|$|E
5|$|Stopford {{had hoped}} that his attack on Jurien's {{squadron}} might draw Willaumez's fleet out of the anchorage in support, where they might be surprised and defeated by the British fleet. Willaumez however made <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> to prevent {{the destruction of the}} frigate squadron. Stopford returned to watch the French fleet from the anchorage at Basque Roads, where he was shortly after joined by the British fleet under Admiral Lord Gambier, and was present although not directly engaged in the Battle of Basque Roads in April at which the French fleet was defeated, losing five ships. Willaumez had been replaced in March by Zacharie Allemand, whose defensive positions were unable to prevent a major attack by fireships on 11 April followed by a bombardment by conventional warships. In the aftermath of the battle Gambier was accused of failing to effectively support the attack and faced a court-martial in July, although he was acquitted and returned to command.|$|E

25|$|The kolo is a {{collective}} folk dance common in various South Slavic regions, such as Serbia, {{named after the}} circle formed by the dancers. It is performed amongst groups of people (usually several dozen, {{at the very least}} three) holding each other's having their hands around each other's waists (ideally in a circle, hence the name). There is almost <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> above the waist.|$|E

25|$|The Niklashausen Journey, {{influenced}} by Jean-Luc Godard's Weekend and Glauber Rocha's Antonio das Mortes, consists {{of only about}} {{a dozen or so}} scenes, most of which are either theatrical tableaux where there is <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> of the characters and the camera darts from speaker to speaker or are shots where characters pace back and forth while giving revolutionary speeches about Marxist struggles and debates on economic theories.|$|E
25|$|French {{favourite}} Christophe Moreau finished {{more than}} three minutes after the leaders. He was caught napping when Astana hit the front shortly after going through the feed zone in Arles. Despite {{the best efforts of}} his AG2R team Moreau could not bridge the gap, which increased steadily as the leaders set a relentless pace. On a day in which <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> was expected {{at the top of the}} General Classification, Moreau, who crashed early in the stage, slipped from sixth to 14th after coming in three minutes 20 seconds back.|$|E
25|$|The Serbian {{folk music}} is both rural (izvorna muzika) and urban (starogradska muzika) and {{includes}} a two-beat dance called kolo, which is a circle dance with almost <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> above the waist, accompanied by instrumental music made most often with an accordion, but also with other instruments: frula (traditional kind of a recorder), tamburica, or accordion. The Kolos usually last for about 5–13 minutes. Modern accordionists include Mirko Kodić and Ljubiša Pavković. Some kolos {{are similar to the}} Hungarian csárdás in that they are slow at the onset and gradually increase their speed until reaching a climax towards the end.|$|E

He underwent intravenous antibiotic treatment and was {{expected to make a}} full recovery. Nearly a month after his spinal stroke, Luger was still in a quadriplegic state, having <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> in either his arms or legs. In June 2008, Luger was said to be able to stand on his own for short periods of time and walk using a walker. In 2010, Luger stated {{in an interview that he}} was able to walk more comfortably, and was now able to drive.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic troughs {{are used}} to {{concentrate}} sunlight for solar-energy purposes. Some solar cookers have been built that use {{them in the same}} way. Generally, the trough is aligned with its focal line horizontal and east-west. The food to be cooked is arranged along this line. The trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon. This requires the trough to be tilted up and down as the seasons progress. At the equinoxes, <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun. At other times of year, there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed. Usually, the cooker is used only during this period, so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it. This simplicity makes the design attractive, compared with using a paraboloid. Also, being a , the trough reflector is simpler to construct. However, it suffers from lower efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Confusion between {{ship and}} shore {{led to the}} South Saskatchewans {{reducing}} their defensive perimeter too quickly, yielding the western heights to German infantry. The original order for evacuation was for 10:00 but was changed to 11:00. The change proved disastrous for the assault troops, as the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada had already started to withdraw to the beach at 09:30, closely followed by the Saskatchewans. They would {{have to contend with}} the increasing enemy action for another hour, despite the perimeter now being too close to the beach. At about 10:30, all available craft were sent to Green Beach at Dieppe, which was still under intense fire from mortars and machine-guns. At 10:45, six LCAs came inshore to Green Beach under heavy fire. It was a mistake; the evacuation should have begun on Red Beach. As Alasdair Ferguson grounded his LCA, he could see <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> on the beach. Moments later, so many troops were rushing Ferguson's craft that it was swamped and, as he made out to sea, the craft was hit by a shell and capsized. He helped the survivors board another craft, and the traumatized sailors and soldiers returned to Newhaven. The other five LCAs participated in a chaotic evacuation, taking men aboard and clearing the beach successfully, but casualties mounted. A second flight of LCAs appeared soon after, but the state of the tide was changing markedly and the risk of becoming stranded kept the LCAs well off shore. The loss of the western heights and the receding tide made further attempts to evacuate most costly. Heavy losses occurred on the sand and in the water. By 11:30, the few men left on the beach were overwhelmed by an enemy attack and captured while attempting to disengage.|$|E

500|$|Carolina wrens are wary, and {{are more}} often heard than seen. When on the ground, they move in jerky hops pillaging through various objects, whether {{man-made}} or natural. While moving abruptly, they pause momentarily for chattering or singing. [...] When stationary, they move in twitched motions, jerking their breast around. They also sun- or sand-bathe. The wrens also displays a skittish behavior when encountered by humans, {{as they can be}} seen thrusting off into cover slowly if approaching is detected. However, they occasionally seek out humans that are near, so long as there is <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> from them. Other movements involve being capable of crawling like a creeper and hanging upside-down like a nuthatch.|$|E

500|$|Other writers {{suggest that}} the star was a comet. Halley's Comet was visible in 12 BC and another object, {{possibly}} a comet or nova, was seen by Chinese and Korean stargazers in about 5 BC. This object was observed for over seventy days with <b>no</b> <b>movement</b> recorded. Ancient writers described comets as [...] "hanging over" [...] specific cities, just as the Star of Bethlehem {{was said to have}} [...] "stood over" [...] the [...] "place" [...] where Jesus was (the town of Bethlehem). However, this is generally thought unlikely as in ancient times comets were generally seen as bad omens. [...] The comet explanation has been recently promoted by Colin Nicholl. His theory involves a hypothetical comet which could have appeared in 6 BC.|$|E
