5|$|<b>River</b> <b>otters</b> are not scavengers; {{they avoid}} {{consuming}} carrion. <b>Northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> do not generally handle prey {{of a large}} size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a <b>river</b> <b>otter)</b> are hibernating. Remains of the much larger American beaver {{have been found in}} otter scat in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where otters and beaver are sympatric do not show them to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that otters frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young beaver kits may be attacked.|$|R
5000|$|Redheads do {{not have}} many predators and {{are most likely to}} die of disease or {{indirect}} human impact. These ducks are not the most common waterfowl, as mallards are, so hunting is minimal. Adults can be preyed upon by <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters,</b> red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, bald eagles, golden eagles and to a greater extent, minks. [...] Most predation {{comes in the form of}} duckling predation and egg foraging. Northern pike and snapping turtles are known to eat ducklings whereas skunks, minks, crows and magpies will steal and eat redhead eggs.|$|R
50|$|Common {{snapping}} turtles {{have few}} predators when older, but eggs {{are subject to}} predation by crows, mink, skunks, foxes, and raccoons. As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack {{them as well as}} herons (mostly great blue herons), bitterns, hawks, owls, fishers, bullfrogs, large fish, and snakes. There are records during winter in Canada of hibernating adult common snapping turtles being ambushed and predated by <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters.</b> Other natural predators which have reportedly preyed on adults include coyotes, black bears, alligators and their larger cousins, alligator snapping turtles. Large, old male snapping turtles have very few natural threats due to their formidable size and defenses, and tend to have a very low annual mortality rate.|$|R

50|$|A {{major theme}} for this {{landlocked}} aquarium {{is the relationship}} between inland freshwater ecosystems and the ocean. The original design of the aquarium was zoogeographic. It focused on the path to the ocean taken by two rivers, the Colorado River in North America and the Kampar River in Indonesia. The Colorado River Journey included exhibits of endangered fish, including desert pupfish; gamefish such as bass; and <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters,</b> among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California), into which the actual Colorado River empties. The Indonesia River Journey included exhibits of animals such as Asian arowanas, rainbowfish, and endangered Sumatran tigers, among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the southern Pacific Ocean. In addition to these two journeys, the aquarium housed a large sea otter exhibit.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. <b>River</b> <b>otter</b> pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is also {{prevalent}} on Hunt Lake and Hunt Marsh. Able to swim {{for nearly}} a mile underwater when disturbed, they often seem to disappear without a trace.. When observed, they are without question {{one of the most}} amazing creatures to observe as they are often socially playful with one another. Of special note is the river otter's acute sensitivity to any form of environmental pollution, as it generally vacates any area with tainted water quality very quickly.

50|$|The diet of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> can be deduced by {{analyzing}} either scat {{obtained in the}} field, or gut contents removed from trapped otters.Fish are the primary component of the <b>river</b> <b>otter's</b> diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the <b>river</b> <b>otter's</b> diet at certain times of the year. However, <b>river</b> <b>otters,</b> as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.River otters are not scavengers; they avoid consuming carrion. <b>Northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> do not generally handle prey of a large size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a <b>river</b> <b>otter)</b> are hibernating.

50|$|The neotropical <b>otter</b> or neotropical <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra longicaudis) is an otter species {{found in}} Central America, South America {{and the island}} of Trinidad. It is {{physically}} similar to the <b>northern</b> and southern <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> which occur directly {{north and south of}} this species' range. The length of the neotropical otter can range from 90 - 150 cm, of which the tail comprises about a third. Body weight ranges from 5 - 15 kg. Otters are members of the family Mustelidae, the most species-rich (and therefore diverse) family in the order Carnivora.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2011 Baseline {{levels of}} stress hormones are {{necessary}} for maintaining physical homeostasis in mammals. Excessive amounts of stress, however, can cause serious pathologies. Chronic effects of stress include increased susceptibility to infectious diseases due to suppressed functioning of the immune system, diminished growth rates, protein loss, neuron cell death and inhibited reproduction. A myriad of external factors including unhealthy, human-induced environmental conditions as well as naturally occurring fluctuations in resources, habitat attributes, health and sociality {{have the potential to}} cause deleterious changes in stress response in mammals. I validated a non-invasive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for use in <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (Lontra canadensis) and used these techniques to evaluate stress hormone concentrations extracted from feces of <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> in coastal <b>northern</b> California. I assessed how stress was correlated with anthropogenic and socioecological factors. Fecal samples were collected from <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> latrines at seven coastal <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> activity centers. I evaluated the relative importance of several ecological variables including location (as a surrogate for <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> activity center contamination level), water turbidity, water temperature variation, diet, parasite presence and scat grouping size (as an index of conspecific interactions or group size) as predictors of cortisol stress hormone concentrations of the <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> using AICc and multiple regression. The best fit model included location, turbidity, diet and parasite presence which explained 23 % of the variation in stress response observed in this coastal <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> population. When the variables were assigned to one of two a priori models, anthropogenically influenced environmental conditions (location and turbidity) or socioecological variables (diet and parasite presence) and compared using multiple regression, the socioecological variables contributed {{more than twice as much}} to variations in stress levels than the anthropogenic variables. These results suggest that a complex combination of human induced and naturally occurring pressures are associated with physiological stress levels in this population of <b>river</b> <b>otters.</b> Indirect measures of <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> population health gained utilizing these techniques can be useful to help establish the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems that may affect many other wildlife species, as well as nearby human communities.

50|$|In captivity, {{members of}} this species have survived to 33 years old and, in the wild, have lived to at least 24 years. Young trumpeter swans may have as little as 40% chance of {{survival}} due variously to disturbance and destruction by humans, predation, nest flooding, and starvation. In some areas, though, the breeding success rate is considerably greater and, occasionally, all cygnets may reach maturity. Mortality in adults is quite low, usually being 80-100% annually, unless they are hunted by humans. Predators of trumpeter swan eggs include common raven (Corvus corax), common raccoon (Procyon lotor), wolverine (Gulo gulo), American black bear (Ursus americanus), brown bear (Ursus arctos), coyote (Canis latrans), wolves (Canis lupus), mountain lions (Puma concolor), and <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis). Nest location can provide partial protection from most mammalian nest predators, especially if placed on islands or floating vegetation in deep waters. Most of the same predators will prey on young cygnets, as will common snapping turtle (Chelhydra serpentina), California gull (Larus californicus), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and American mink (Mustela vison). Larger cygnets and, rarely, nesting adults may be ambushed by golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and coyote. When their eggs and young are threatened, the parents can be quite aggressive, initially displaying with head bobbing and hissing. If this is not sufficient, the adults will physically combat the predator, battering with their powerful wings and chomping down with their large bills, and have managed to kill predators equal to their own weight in confrontations. Predation of adults {{when they are not}} nesting is rare, although they may possibly be hunted by golden and bald eagles as well as wolves and mountain lions, although even most of these cases are anecdotal and unproven. Photos of a bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) exceptionally attacking an adult trumpeter swan in mid-flight were taken recently, although the swan managed to survive the predation attempt.|$|E

40|$|Indirect {{signs of}} species {{presence}} (e. g., tracks, scats, hairs) are frequently {{used to detect}} target species in occupancy, presence/absence, and other wildlife studies. Indirect signs are often more efficient than direct observation of elusive animals, making such signs well suited for long-term and broad-scale monitoring programs. However, error associated with misidentification of indirect signs can be high, and should be measured if meaningful inferences about population parameters are to be made. This study addressed the need for systematic approaches to estimate and minimize variation due to observer error in identifying indirect signs. I reanalyzed data from 4 replicates of a presence/absence survey of <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (Lontra canadensis) that had been conducted by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (1996 - 2003). Sixteen observers had recorded tracks at sample points under bridges (n = 250) distributed throughout 27 counties in the Piney-Woods ecoregion of east Texas. My objectives were to 1) determine if observers were a source of bias in the survey, 2) estimate the proportion of error associated with track identification skill, and 3) evaluate {{the use of an}} international certification procedure that measured observer tracking skill. The null hypothesis that observers had no effect on the variation in reported sign was rejected. Indeed, binary logistic regression tests indicated that observers were significantly associated with variation in reported track presence. Observers were not randomly distributed among bridge sites, and therefore were significantly correlated with 4 habitat variables that may have influenced heterogeneity in otter occupancy and probability of detection (watershed, vegetation-type, water-type, bridge-area). On average, experienced observers (n = 7) misidentified 44 % of otter tracks, with a range of 0 % to 100 % correct detection. Also, 13 % of the tracks of species determined to be 'otter-like' were misidentified as belonging to an otter. During the certification procedure, participants misidentified the tracks of 12 species as otter. Inaccurate identification of indirect signs is a likely source of error in wildlife studies. I recommend that observer skill in identification of indirect signs be measured in order to detect and control for observer bias in wildlife monitoring...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the presence and}} activity of northern river otters (Lontra canadensis) at latrines in relation to anthropogenic disturbances. I examined the validity of spraints as an index for latrine use and determined if diel activity or group size was related to anthropogenic disturbance. Latrine data were collected using boat surveys, and motion-activated camera traps were used to observe otter activity and group size. I found that disturbances such as logging, cabins or roads, did not differ between the locations of <b>northern</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> latrine sites. However, the level of activity was higher at latrines that were distant from them. I found that spraint counts are not a good index for latrine use intensity, but there is potential {{for them to be}} useful when investigating otter abundance within a large landscape. Diel patterns of otters were not influenced by disturbances, but overall amount of activity was low in areas with disturbances meaning otters tend to avoid latrines in such areas...|$|E
