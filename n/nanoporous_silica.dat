40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} and dynamics of benzene confined at 293 K in silica nanopores of different diameters (D = 2. 0 nm and D = 3. 6 nm) are investigated {{by means of}} grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. In order to account in a realistic way for the interactions between benzene and the silica surface, we consider a recent model that accounts for the π-electrons of the aromatic cycle in the benzene molecule. Confined benzene exhibits significant layering and orientational ordering {{in the vicinity of}} the silica surface (up to two adsorbed layers) and tends to recover its bulk properties in the pore center. Using suitable order parameters, we show that benzene molecules close to the pore surface tend to have their ring lying flat on the silica surface (and hence perpendicular to the pore axis). Such a preferential parallel orientation with respect to the silica surface suggests that a proper description of the π-electrons of the benzene aromatic ring and its specific Coulombic interaction with the partial charges carried by the silica atoms is crucial. The dynamics of benzene confined in the silica nanopores is always slower than in the bulk. Both the translational and rotational dynamics of confined benzene can be described as a bulklike contribution in the pore center that depends on the pore size and a surface contribution that is nearly insensitive to the pore size. These simulation results are discussed in the light of available experimental data on the {{structure and}} dynamics of benzene confined in <b>nanoporous</b> <b>silicas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Our current {{ability to}} produce {{mesoporous}} materials with ordered morphology has raised fascinating questions {{about the impact of}} geometrical disorder on adsorption and desorption states [1]. Many recent works have investigated the role of mild elements of disorder, such as local constriction or corrugation superimposed to otherwise geometrically ideal cylindrical pores [2, 3]. These works have notably shown that elements of disorder may act as nucleation sites and destabilize vapor-like metastable states. The relevance of these perturbation-like results to fundamentally disordered materials, such as gels, is unclear. In particular, do vapor-like metastable states exist at all in this type of very disordered material? In the present communication, we address this question using probabilistic models to investigate the role of disorder. We generalize the classical Gaussian field models of porous materials [4] and use them to analyze adsorption and desorption in the Derjaguin-Broekhof-de Boer approximation. Our approach differs from earlier contributions in that both the adsorbent and the adsorbate are described in terms of probabilities [5]. This enables us to analyze the adsorbate configuration in very disordered solids using a low-dimensional yet realistic configuration space. We notably show that vapor-like metastable states are unlikely in gel-like disordered materials. [1] D. Wallacher, N. Künzner, D. Kovalev, N. Knorr, K.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports a}} {{molecular}} simulation {{study on the}} adsorption of a simple fluid in <b>nanoporous</b> <b>silicas</b> with or without morphological defects (constrictions). All the pores considered in this work are of a finite length and are connected to a bulk reservoir so that they mimic real materials for which the confined fluid is always {{in contact with the}} external gas phase. The adsorption isotherms for the regular cylindrical pores conform to the typical experimental behavior for MCM- 41 as the adsorbed amount increases continuously in the multilayer adsorption regime until a jump occurs due to capillary condensation of the fluid within the pore. The evaporation pressures are lower than the condensation pressures, so that hysteresis loops are observed. The condensation and evaporation mechanisms for the pores with constrictions depart significantly from what is observed for regular non-defective nanopores. Depending on the size, length, and number of constrictions in the pores, the filling and emptying processes are found to be of different nature. In every case, these mechanisms involve the coexistence between the confined liquid and some gas nanobubbles that are trapped within the main cavities of the pore. It is also found that the finite length of the pore introduces some heterogeneity in the adsorption and desorption processes; the filling and emptying of the regions (constriction and/or cavities) near the pore surface differs from those of the regions in the pore center. The desorption process can occur through different mechanisms such as cavitation, pore blocking effects with at equilibrium evaporation, or several combined pore blocking effects. Adsorption isotherms can be used to assess and characterize morphological defects in nanopores. In contrast, our results suggest that microcalorimetry experiments such as measurements of the isosteric heat of adsorption cannot be used to gain information regarding such defects as all the data for the regular and constricted pores fall on the same curve...|$|R

We emphasise the increasing use of the technique as a non-invasive spectroscopic probe with intrinsic mass selectivity, as well as the concurrent use of neutron diffraction and first-principles computational materials modelling to guide and interpret experiments. To illustrate the state of the art, we discuss in detail a number of recent exemplars, chosen to highlight the use of electron-volt neutron spectroscopy across physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. These include: hydrides and proton conductors for energy applications; protons, deuterons, and oxygen atoms in bulk water; aqueous protons confined in <b>nanoporous</b> <b>silicas,</b> carbon nanotubes, and graphene-related materials; hydrated water in proteins and DNA; and the uptake of molecular hydrogen by soft nanostructured media, promising materials for energy-storage applications.

The continuous nanoporous films are synthesized on conducting electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is then used to quantitatively measure the accessible surface area of the underlying electrode via transport through the pore system. It is found that the double-gyroid-structure silica films expose a much higher fraction of the electrode than other commonly synthesized nanostructures such as 2 D centered rectangular or 3 D rhombohedral nanostructures. The double-gyroid nanoporous-film-coated electrodes are then used to fabricate inverse double-gyroid platinum nanostructures by electrodeposition, followed by etching to remove the silica. The structure of both the <b>nanoporous</b> <b>silica</b> films and the nanoporous platinum films (after etching) have been elucidated using high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), comparing measured and simulated 2 D grazing angle-of-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) patterns, and comparing observed and simulated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.

Ultimately we see two different motivations for protocell research and development: (1) to emulate life in order to understand it; and (2) to use biomimicry to engineer desired cellular interactions...|$|R
40|$|Two Minkowski functionals {{were tested}} in the {{capacity}} of morphological descriptors to quantitatively compare the arrays of vertically-aligned graphene flakes grown on smooth and <b>nanoporous</b> alumina and <b>silica</b> surfaces. Specifically, the Euler-Poincaré characteristic and fractal dimension graphs were used to characterize the degree of connectivity and order in the systems, i. e. in the graphene flake patterns of petal-like and tree-like morphologies on solid substrates, and mesh- like patterns (networks) grown on nanoporous alumina treated in low-temperature inductively- coupled plasma. It {{was found that the}} Minkowski functionals return higher connectivity and fractal dimension numbers for the graphene flakepatterns with more complex morphologies, and indeed can be used as morphological descriptors to differentiate among various configurations of vertically-aligned graphene flakes grown on surfaces...|$|R
