On each side of the panel are two busbars, for neutral and earth. The incoming neutral connects to the lower busbar {{on the right side of}} the panel, which is in turn connected to the neutral busbar at the top left. The incoming earth wire connects to the lower busbar on the left side of the panel, which is in turn connected to the earth busbar at the top right. The cover has been removed from the lower-right neutral bar; the <b>neutral</b> <b>bar</b> on the left side has its cover in place.|$|E
50|$|The {{picture on}} the left shows a North American dual panel {{configuration}}. The main panel (on the right with cover in place) and a subpanel (on the left, with cover removed). Notice that the subpanel is fed by two large hot wires and a neutral wire running through a small angled conduit. This configuration appears to display three violations of the current U.S. National Electric Code: the main panel {{does not have a}} grounding conductor(here it is fed through the subpanel instead), the connection between the main and subpanel lacks a grounding conductor (it must have 4 instead of 3 wires), and the subpanel <b>neutral</b> <b>bar</b> is bonded to the ground bar (these should be separate bars after the first service disconnect, which in this case is the main panel).|$|E
5000|$|A {{system could}} be made entirely ungrounded. In this case a fault between one phase and ground would not cause any {{significant}} current. In fact, {{this is not a}} good scheme. Commonly the neutral is grounded (earthed) through a bond between the <b>neutral</b> <b>bar</b> and the earth bar. It is common on larger systems to monitor any current flowing through the neutral-to-earth link and use this as the basis for neutral fault protection. The connection between neutral and earth allows any phase-to-earth fault to develop enough current flow to [...] "trip" [...] the circuit overcurrent protection device. In some jurisdictions, calculations are required to ensure the fault loop impedance is low enough so that fault current will trip the protection (In Australia, this is referred to in AS3000:2007 Fault loop impedance calculation). This may limit the length of a branch circuit. In the case of two phases sharing one neutral, the worst-case current draw is one side has zero load and the other has full load, or when both sides have full load. The latter case results in 1 + 1@120deg = 1@60deg, i.e. the magnitude of the current in the neutral equals that of the other two wires.|$|E

The Oregon University System on February 16, 2001 enacted a mandate that all institutions within the OUS choose business partners from a politically <b>neutral</b> standpoint, <b>barring</b> all universities in Oregon from membership in the WRC and the FLA. Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Phil Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over $50 million. Since then, activity on the subject died down and Frohnmayer believed that the leaders of the protest lost their foothold since they did not represent the majority of students on campus.|$|R
50|$|The {{picture to}} the right shows the {{interior}} of a standard residential service, North American General Electric style breaker panel. The three power wires - two hot and one neutral - can be seen coming in at the top. The neutral wire is connected to the neutral busbar to the left with all the white wires, and the other two are the hot wires attached to the main breaker. Below it are the two rows of circuit breakers with the circuits' red and black hot wires leading off. Three wires (hot black, neutral white, and bare ground) can be seen directly exiting the box and running to a NEMA 5-15 electrical receptacle with a power cord plugged into it. The incoming bare stranded ground wire can be seen {{near the bottom of the}} <b>neutral</b> bus <b>bar.</b>|$|R

(The bar is often referred to in journalist A.J. Liebling's boxing articles.) Several years before his death, Janiro returned to Youngstown, where he was employed at the Mahoning County Courthouse. In 1984, he was inducted into the Youngstown Curbstone Coaches Hall of Fame, and was honored at a testimonial banquet held in Boardman, Ohio. Speakers at the event included former boxing champions Willie Pep, Jake LaMotta, Beau Jack, and Carmen Basilio.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} the specificity and sensitivity of RTVue- 100, Optovue parameters at determining {{the presence of}} a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) by coupling their values with the instrument normative data base (NDB) and {{the presence of a}} RAPD.

Methods: Forty one subjects with a RAPD and glaucomatous or non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy participated. A <b>neutral</b> density filter <b>bar</b> was used to estimate the RAPD. The specificity and sensitivity of all parameters was analyzed using Fisher’s Exact test. The distribution of the FLV percentage was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey HSD post hoc test.

500|$|Even {{though the}} First World War did not touch Brazilian soil, it had {{crushing}} effects on Brazil's economy. Prices for rubber and coffee plummeted; {{the war had}} only a small need for rubber, and Britain allowed no coffee into Europe as space on merchant ships was reserved for [...] "essential items". In addition, coffee was declared to be contraband, so every Brazilian shipment to the Central Powers was subject to search and seizure; even shipments to some <b>neutral</b> countries were <b>barred</b> {{to ensure that no}} coffee would get through. Despite these restrictions, neutral Brazil was pro-Allied for {{the first three years of}} the war because of its sizable merchant fleet; as merchantmen from Allied countries were sunk, Brazilian ships were able to take over routes that had been vacated. This policy exposed them to attack by German submarines, and after the German declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917, several Brazilian ships were sunk, driving the country closer to declaring war on the Central Powers.|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies of}} human-tool {{interactions}} {{focus on the}} typical use of a tool (e. g., cutting {{in the case of}} a knife). However, little is known about situations requiring atypical tool use (e. g., using a knife to tighten a screw). The present study focused on a selection of atypical uses of everyday tools which might be in conflict with their typical use. Our objective was to study how tool function influences the selection of the relevant action. In Experiment 1, which involved visuomotor priming, two everyday tools (a knife and a screwdriver) and two <b>neutral</b> tools (two <b>bars,</b> with no strong functional affordance) were used as primes and targets. Participants had to use the target with the appropriate box (indicated by the color) that allowed to make an action. Longer initiation times were observed when the prime was an everyday tool, irrespective of the nature of the target. We therefore observed a conflict between functional and situational affordances. To investigate whether the priming effect is caused by the task-irrelevance of the prime, we asked the participants in Experiment 2 to perform an action associated with the prime. The results showed longer initiation times only when the prime and target were everyday tools, irrespective of their precise nature. This suggests that activation of the typical use of a tool might not be fully automatic but flexible depending on the situation...|$|R
5000|$|Tresca {{was also}} among the {{designers}} of the prototype meter bar {{that served as the}} first standard of length for the metric system. After the Convention of the Metre had been signed in 1875, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sèvres, France made 28 prototype line standards of platinum-iridium. The bars had a cross section shaped like a modified letter X, designed by Tresca, called the [...] "Tresca section". The Tresca section was designed to provide maximum stiffness. In addition, one surface of the central rib that joined the arms was designed to coincide with the <b>bar's</b> <b>neutral</b> plane, the mathematical plane inside the bar that didn't change length when the bar bent. The two marks near each end of the bar which defined the meter were ruled on this surface. Thus, to first order, the distance between the marks wouldn't change due to the slight sagging of the bar under its own weight between support points. One of the bars was selected as the International Meter. The United States received National Prototype Meters No. 27 and No. 21 in 1890. When the Mendenhall Order in 1893 declared the meter to be the fundamental length standard, No. 27 became the US primary national standard for all length measurements. It remained so until 1960.|$|R
