6000|$|The outer, or ocean side of {{this low}} and <b>narrow</b> <b>bank</b> of sand, is a smooth and regular beach, like that seen {{on most of the}} Jersey coast, while the inner is indented, in a manner to form several {{convenient}} anchoring-grounds, for ships that seek a shelter from easterly gales.

The harbor, or, as it is always called, the Cove, lies {{at the point where the}} cape joins the main, and the inlet just named communicates directly with its waters, whenever the passage is open. The Shrewsbury, a river of the fourth or fifth class, or in other words a stream of a few hundred feet in width, and of no great length, comes from the south, running nearly parallel with the coast, and becomes a tributary of the Bay, also, at a point near the Cove.

It is covered with a modest growth of pines and oaks, where it is not either subject to the labors of the husbandman, or in natural meadow.

40|$|Recent banking {{problems}} have prompted {{a variety of}} proposals for reforming deposit insurance and the banking system. Nearly all of these proposals, however, suffer from a common flaw - they would fail to create a banking system that is both stable and free to respond to market forces and financial developments. <b>Narrow</b> <b>banking</b> offers a possible means for accomplishing these objectives. <b>Narrow</b> <b>banking</b> would create a stable payments system by backing transaction deposits with only those assets that are truly appropriate for this task - marketable securities with virtually no interest rate or credit risk. As a result, <b>narrow</b> <b>banks</b> would essentially be "fail-safe" institutions and could operate without the inherent weaknesses of the current system. They would not pose a risk to depositors, taxpayers, or federal authorities and, unlike commercial banks, would not require extensive governmental support and intervention. These features of <b>narrow</b> <b>banks</b> would allow market forces to guide everyday banking decisions and the activities of any affiliated firms, thus returning the market to its proper role in allocating financial services. In many respects, <b>narrow</b> <b>banking</b> mirrors another banking reform {{that took place in}} the 1860 s - the use of U. S. Government securities to back national bank notes. This earlier reform and the following change to Federal Reserve Notes collateralized largely by U. S. obligations have produced a stable currency and ended any public concern about its acceptability. This success provides strong evidence that <b>narrow</b> <b>banking</b> is a workable system that could stabilize our deposit system and its transactions function. <b>Narrow</b> <b>banking,</b> much like this earlier reform, appears to involve a dramatic change in the banking system. However, recent financial trends are making <b>narrow</b> <b>banking</b> a less radical change than commonly believed. In addition, most of the other approaches to recent banking problems entail a movement toward greater regulatory and governmental control of our financial system and its credit allocation functions - a response that is unlikely to make banking a vibrant, competitive industry. All of these factors thus suggest that <b>narrow</b> <b>banking</b> deserves careful consideration in efforts to reform the financial system. ...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{the recent}} {{proposals}} on banking reform {{in the wake of}} the recent global economic crisis, this paper identifies some efficiency gains associated with <b>narrow</b> <b>banking</b> using an approach based on search theory.

When a non-financial agent (such as a household) bargains with a commercial bank, it succeeds in appropriating a share of the value associated with the financial services provided to other non-financial agents (such as entrepreneurs) because commercial banks are affected by search frictions on both the loan and credit markets. This cross-market sharing prevents commercial banks from sharing the value of financial services with non-financial agents efficiently, and can be the origin of credit rationing and multiple equilibria. Because the use of <b>narrow</b> <b>banking</b> suppresses this cross-market sharing, it makes the competitive equilibrium efficient...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{although}} financial consolidation creates some dangers {{because it is}} leading to larger institutions who might expose the U.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} money multiplier mechanism or <b>narrow</b> <b>bank</b> lending channel is operative in the monetary {{transmission of the}} Canadian banking system for the period 1968 - 2007. By employing Structural Vector Auto-Regression (SVAR) models, proposed by Bernanke & Blinder (1992) and Carpenter & Demiralp (2011), this paper concludes that the evidence for Canada indicates that the money multiplier is not the main transmission mechanism in Canada. This paper compares the Canadian results with an identical examination of the US banking system for the same time period. The evidence for the overall sample period indicates that the money multiplier mechanism has less of an impact in Canada than for the US. For both Canada and the US there is {{a break in the}} response of total loans and reservable deposits starting in the late 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s. This break in the data is likely caused by institutional, legislative and regulatory changes occurring in the respective banking and financial systems. In addition, the results also indicate significant differences between Canada and the US when the overall sample period is broken down into the subsamples 1968 - 1989 and 1990 - 2007. The results for the US, consistent with Carpenter and Demiralp (2011), suggest that the money multiplier was an operative monetary transmission mechanism in the 1968 - 1989 period but not in the 1990 - 2007 subsample. The results for the Canadian data, for the same subsample periods, are exactly the opposite.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on {{testimony}} presented on December 7, 2011, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The article provides an update and extension of my previous work showing that: (1) the U. S., U. K. and other developed nations provided enormous subsidies for “too-big-to-fail” (“TBTF”) financial institutions during the financial crisis, thereby creating dangerous distortions in our financial markets and economies; (2) large financial conglomerates follow a hazardous business model that is riddled with conflicts of interest and prone to speculative risk-taking; (3) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) creates helpful new tools for regulating systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”) and dealing with their potential failure, but Dodd-Frank does not completely close the door to government bailouts of creditors of SIFIs; (4) Dodd-Frank relies on the same regulatory techniques – including capital-based regulation and prudential supervision – that failed to prevent the banking and thrift crises of the 1980 s and the current financial crisis; and (5) Dodd-Frank also depends on many of the same federal agencies that failed to stop excessive risk-taking by financial institutions during the credit boom that preceded both crises. In view of Dodd-Frank’s shortcomings, the article reiterates my proposals for more extensive structural reforms and activity limitations that would (i) prevent SIFIs from using federal safety net subsidies to support their capital markets activities, and (ii) make it easier for regulators to separate banks from their nonbank affiliates when financial conglomerates fail. Congress should mandate a pre-funded Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”) and should require all bank and nonbank SIFIs to pay risk-based assessments to the OLF to provide for the future costs of resolving failed SIFIs. Congress should also mandate a “narrow bank” structure for financial conglomerates that would (a) protect the Deposit Insurance Fund from the risks created by nonbank affiliates of SIFI-owned banks, and (b) prevent narrow banks from transferring their FDIC-insured, low-cost funding advantages to their nonbank affiliates. My recommended reforms are similar to the “ring-fencing” proposal issued by the U. K. Independent Commission on Banking and endorsed by the Cameron coalition government. The <b>narrow</b> <b>bank</b> concept provides a promising way for the U. S. and the U. K. to adopt a common approach for regulating financial conglomerates. If the U. S. and the U. K. adopted consistent regimes for controlling the risks posed by SIFIs, they would place great pressure on other developed nations to follow suit...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{financial}} crisis has revealed fundamental {{weaknesses in the}} regulatory systems of the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations. In particular, publicly-funded bailouts of major banks have confirmed that “too big to fail” (TBTF) subsidies distort economic incentives and encourage excessive risk-taking by large, complex financial institutions (LCFIs). Accordingly, the primary goals of regulatory reform must be (i) to eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, TBTF subsidies and (ii) to force LCFIs to internalize the risks and costs of their activities. After surveying the causes and consequences of the {{financial crisis}}, this article proposes five regulatory reforms {{that are designed to}} shrink TBTF subsidies in the U. S. First, existing “size caps” on large banks should be strengthened. Second, LCFIs whose failure would pose a systemic threat to the stability of the financial system should be publicly designated as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). A special resolution regime administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation should be created to handle failures of SIFIs. This resolution regime should follow the essential principles of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, including (i) wiping out the investments of shareholders, (ii) dismissing senior executives and directors, and (iii) requiring creditors to accept “haircuts” in the form of less-than-full payment of their claims or conversion of their claims into equity interests in a successor institution. Third, SIFIs should be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and to enhanced capital requirements. Fourth, SIFIs should be required to pay insurance premiums to establish a systemic risk insurance fund (SRIF) to cover the future costs of resolving failed SIFIs. The SRIF should be kept strictly separate from the existing Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). To prevent the DIF from being used to support future bailouts of TBTF institutions, Congress should prohibit the DIF from making any payments to uninsured creditors of banking organizations. Fifth, to ensure that SIFIs cannot use the federal safety net to subsidize speculative activities in the capital markets, a two-tiered system of banking regulation and deposit insurance should be established. The first tier of “traditional” banking organizations could provide services that are “closely related” to banking. However, those entities {{would not be allowed to}} engage, or affiliate with firms engaged, in securities underwriting or dealing, insurance underwriting or derivatives dealing. First-tier banks would operate under their current supervisory arrangements, including their existing deposit insurance. In contrast, the second tier of “nontraditional” banking organizations would be allowed to engage in capital markets activities, but they would be required to conduct those activities solely in nonbank holding company subsidiaries. Second-tier banking organizations would also be required to operate their banking subsidiaries as “narrow banks. ” Narrow banks could not accept uninsured deposits and could not make any loans or other transfers of funds to their affiliates(except for lawful dividends paid to their parent holding companies). In addition, narrow banks could not purchase or sell derivatives except for bona fide hedging purposes. The primary objectives of the <b>narrow</b> <b>bank</b> requirement, in conjunction with the other four proposed reforms, would be (i) to prevent financial conglomerates from using FDIC-insured deposits as a source of low-cost funding for speculative activities in the capital markets, and (ii) to compel financial conglomerates to internalize the potential risks and costs of their activities. If financial conglomerates cannot produce attractive returns without exploiting public subsidies, they will face significant pressure from investors to break up voluntarily, in the same way that investors forced many industrial conglomerates to break up after 1980...|$|E
