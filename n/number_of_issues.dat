Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues.</b> It was increasingly polarised between moderate évolués and the more radical mass membership. A radical faction headed by Iléo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, which became most popular around the southern city of Élisabethville and among the Luba ethnic group.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> the U.S. government grew increasingly {{suspicious of the}} Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which {{saw it as a}} vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Great Britain VIII was a nine-day railtour from London to Cornwall, Scotland {{and back}} to London. Various steam {{locomotives}} were scheduled to haul the train on {{each day of the}} tour, which was to have been entirely steam hauled. Participants paid between £1,995 and £2,895 per person for the nine-day tour. Despite fears that the tour would be cancelled, it was run although with changes to the locomotives hauling it. DB Schenker agreed to operate the first two days of the tour. The tour suffered a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> including steam locomotives being replaced by diesels, and a lack of train heating; these resulted in a significant number of passengers leaving the tour early.|$|E
5|$|Henry and Becket quickly {{disagreed}} over a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> including Becket's {{attempts to}} regain control of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies. The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy who committed secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while Becket maintained that only church courts could try the cases. The matter came to a head in January 1164, when Henry forced through agreement to the Constitutions of Clarendon; under tremendous pressure, Becket temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards. The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002 Nunavut Tourism {{publication}} The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for Tourism Development in Nunavut, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> facing Nunavut tourism operators were highlighted. One {{major issue}} for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market. This limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory. Many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to their ranks, and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between tourism operators, inhibiting opportunities for inter-sector growth.|$|E

5|$|Taft {{maintained}} a cordial relationship with Wilson. The former president privately criticized his successor on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> but made his views known publicly only on Philippine policy. Taft was appalled when, after Justice Lamar's death in January 1916, Wilson nominated Brandeis, whom {{the former president}} had never forgiven {{for his role in}} the Ballinger–Pinchot affair. When hearings led to nothing discreditable about Brandeis, Taft intervened with a letter signed by himself and other former ABA presidents, stating that Brandeis was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis. Taft and Roosevelt remained embittered; they met only once in the first three years of the Wilson presidency, at a funeral at Yale. They spoke only for a moment, politely but formally.|$|E

5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite this success, Berger {{still had}} to {{negotiate}} with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by Generaloberst Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it {{did not want to see}} any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues.</b> In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government {{to pull the plug}} on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E
