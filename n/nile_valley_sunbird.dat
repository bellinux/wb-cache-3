50|$|The <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Hedydipna metallica) is {{a species}} of bird in the Nectariniidae family. It is found in Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen.|$|E
5000|$|The name Hedydipna {{comes from}} the Greek hēdudeipnos, meaning [...] "dainty-supping" [...] or [...] "sweet-eating" [...] — a {{reference}} to the nectar sipping habits of these species. These sunbirds are largely restricted to Africa and western islands in the Indian Ocean, though the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>sunbird</b> is found as far east as Yemen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> in Egypt {{is located}} {{to the west}} of the Red Sea Rift and to the south of the Mediterranean Sea. Recently, some {{moderate}} earthquakes were occurred along the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> at the eastern and western side. Tectonically, the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> is controlled by NW–SE, NE–SW, E–W and N–S tectonic trends due to the exerted forces and stresses. A program of studying the recent crustal movements in Egypt has been started since 1984 to cover some areas which are characterized by the occurrence of felt Earthquakes. One of these areas is the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley.</b> About 6 moderate earthquakes with magnitudes more than 4 were occurred on both sides of River Nile. The present study aimed to determine the recent crustal movement parameters along the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> using the Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. To achieve this mission, a GPS network consisting of ten geodetic stations has been established on both sides along the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> area. GPS measurements have been collected from 2007 to 2012. The collected data were processed using Bernese 5. 0 Software. The result of the data analysis indicates that the rate of local velocity is small ranging from 1 to 4 mm/year. This rate is consistent with the low rate of occurrence of recent earthquakes activity along the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> area. But, the results obtained from the calculation of the regional velocity indicated that the velocity of the GPS stations including the African Plate motion is about 25 mm/year in the northeast direction which is consistent with the African Plate motion direction...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{covering}} {{only about}} 6.5% {{of the total}} area of Egypt; the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> and <b>Nile</b> Delta {{are the most important}} regions, being the country's only cultivable regions and supporting about 99% of the population. The <b>Nile</b> <b>valley</b> extends approximately 800 km from Aswan to the outskirts of Cairo. The <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> is very cool and known as Upper Egypt, while the Nile Delta region is known as Lower Egypt. Steep rocky cliffs rise {{along the banks of the}} Nile in some stretches, while other areas along the Nile are flat, with space for agricultural production. In the past, flooding of the Nile during the summer provided silt and water to make agriculture possible on land that is otherwise very dry. Since construction of the Aswan Dam, agriculture in the <b>Nile</b> <b>valley</b> depends on irrigation. The Nile delta consists of flat, low-lying areas. Some parts of the delta are marshy and water-logged, and thus not suitable for agriculture. Other areas of the delta are used for agriculture.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} discusses Egypto-Aegean {{trade and}} exchange relations, the chronology and fluctuations of Late Bronze Age Aegean ceramic material in the New Kingdom <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley,</b> and the inferences that may be drawn from LBA Aegean ceramics and Egyptian ceramic preferences. The discussion of the Late Bronze Age (LBA) Aegean ceramic corpus includes the distribution of LBA ceramics in the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley,</b> as well as possible models for the relationships and exchange practices between the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> and the Aegean. ^ The research contains a database of LBA Aegean pottery from the New Kingdom <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> (Egypt and Nubia). The database was created in FileMaker Pro, and includes such information as Furumark Shape, if known, or a more general shape, if not, Furumark Motif, excavation site, if known, or museum collection, date, publication, etc. The database material ranges in date from LM I to LH III/LM III. A catalog of general Furumark Shapes (FS) in the <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley</b> is included {{to assist in the}} identification of vessel shapes, which may be found in Egypt and Nubia. ^ The Late Bronze Age Aegean ceramics exported to Egypt and Nubia indicate trade and diplomatic relations between the Aegean and <b>Nile</b> <b>Valley.</b> Diplomatic gift exchange and mercantile interactions were tempered by Egyptian cultural, economic, and political factors. Individual preference drove the selection of certain commodities that the ceramic shapes may have contained and influenced the ceramic forms chosen for display or feasting. Gift exchange, acquisition of tribute, royal trade, and private exchange were all mechanisms behind the Egyptian acquisition of Aegean ceramics. ...|$|R
