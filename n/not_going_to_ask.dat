That, sir, if I may say respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aldrete {{spoke to}} the press in 2003 and denied her {{participation}} in Kilroy's murder and in the cult killings. She stated {{that it was impossible}} for investigators to understand what had happened at Santa Elena because the biggest evidence in the case, Constanzo, was dead. Aldrete also stated that the police hid the names of famous people involved with Constanzo for their own convenience. She concluded by stating that she believed in God and was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> society for forgiveness because she was innocent of the crimes. The following year, Aldrete interviewed with the press again and stated that she had been tortured to confess. She said she had been stripped naked, blindfolded, beaten upside down, and then had her toenails yanked. Aldrete claimed she was beaten so severely that doctors told her she {{would never be able to}} have children.|$|E

Umar preferred {{his wives}} {{to remain at}} home and expressed his displeasure with silence. Atiqa {{told him that she}} was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>asking</b> permission, and that she would go to the mosque unless he specifically forbade her. He remained silent, presumably because he could not forbid something that Muhammad had permitted, and so Atiqa continued to attend.|$|R

60|$|Marcia {{accepted}} Mrs. Nash's {{invitation to}} come and sit with her till the chill was off the room; and she borrowed a pen and paper of her to write home. The note she sent was brief: she was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> seem <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> anything of her father. But she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do what was right; she told him where she was, and she sent her love to her mother. She would not speak of her things; he might send them or not, as he chose; but she knew he would. This was the spirit of her letter, and her training had not taught her to soften and sweeten her phrase; but no doubt the old man, who was like her, would understand that she felt no compunction for what she had done, and that she loved him though she still defied him.|$|R
50|$|After the First World War, Stein {{assisted}} Steiner {{in promoting}} Social Threefolding. When {{it became apparent}} in 1919 that these efforts were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> succeed, Steiner <b>asked</b> Stein <b>to</b> teach history and German literature at the first Waldorf School in Stuttgart. It was {{as part of this}} work that Stein began his research on the Grail, which culminated in 1928 with his book The Ninth Century and the Holy Grail. In this work, he attempted to identify historical people and events represented in the Grail epic and to interpret Parzival as an esoteric document representing the human path of inner development. Stein also wrote various articles on these themes.|$|R
500|$|The other {{predominant}} match {{from the}} Raw brand was an unsanctioned match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho. The {{build up to}} the match began at SummerSlam, when Michaels came to the ring to announce his storyline retirement.

On the August 18 episode of Raw, Jericho stated that he had no remorse for what he did to Michaels wife, claiming that Michaels [...] "had it coming". The following week on Raw, Michaels announced he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> retire and <b>asked</b> Jericho for an unsanctioned match.

5000|$|... "Get {{ready for}} blood, tears and sperm. This album {{talks about the}} present tense and the mankind, the {{boundaries}} of ones desires, dreams and mistakes. This is our statement to this rusted world, to these wasted dreams and plastic reality with real life and unreal people. We're sick of mediocrity in their bodies who walk empty streets without any real purpose. This album talks about them, about their sorrow, mistakes and inner demons. Without them we do not exist and without us they are nothing. This is about something real. It's about this fallen mankind. This world has become occupied, surrounded and unhealthy. We {{do not agree with}} this worlds systems of values. This is world without values, without inner boundaries that confront served mediocrity. We're so fucking sick of it all, and want to live in some better place, and really feel our childhood energy. So we named our album 'El Conquistadors' (proper Spanish title would be 'El Conquistador') but we want for those smart-ass motherfucking self-masturbating people to say that we're wrong, to say that they know better and to hear from their empty minds what do {{we need to do to}} live happy mediocrity life. And we're <b>not</b> even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> listen to this album, no - if you see it just run away from it, hate it, laugh at it, be the one of El Conquistadors who crush worlds without trying to feel them.

50|$|On 1 January 2013 Grimsby {{announced}} that they had made an enquiry about Devitt, but were waiting on the player and his agent {{to decide whether or}} <b>not</b> they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Hull for a pay-out if the situation was that he was not in the plans of the club. On 4 January 2013 Devitt re-joined Grimsby on loan {{for the rest of the}} 2012-13 season. In his second game back for Town he scored the equaliser in a 2-1 away win at Welling United that sent Grimsby into the quarter finals of the FA Trophy. In the quarter-final he opened the scoring with a free kick in Town's 3-0 victory over Luton Town. Town eventually made it through to the final at Wembley Stadium but were beaten by Wrexham on a penalty shootout after the game ended 1-1, Devitt was an unused substitute. In the league, Grimsby dropped off the pace and despite leading the Conference for majority of the season they eventually finished 4th and were defeated by Newport County in the play-offs. Devitt played 15 league matches for Grimsby, scoring two goals.|$|R

5000|$|In May 2012, it was rumoured {{that once}} Ryan would return he {{would now be}} a much darker {{character}} and would become involved in a drug storyline with Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Kym Marsh who plays Michelle Connor confirmed the storyline in June 2012, Marsh said: [...] "Ryan's been off doing his own thing, and has got heavily involved in drugs. Michelle expected {{him to come back}} as the same kid he was before he went away, but that's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen." [...] <b>Asked</b> how difficult this experience will be for Michelle, the actress replied: [...] "Very hard. Michelle's got her work cut out trying to get Ryan back on the straight and narrow, but we'll see her get support from outside influences." [...] Speaking of the storyline Sol Heras said: [...] "It’s a very serious storyline but in the real world it does happen. As long as it’s done professionally and done well, it’s great. I think it’ll be good for young people to see the consequences that come from drugs. You’ll see that the drugs are the reason that Ryan is falling out with everyone and causing trouble. There’s a loneliness to Ryan because no-one really trusts him. It just shows that it’s a bad way to go." [...] Speaking of being compared to Ben Thompson (who previously portrayed Ryan) he said: [...] "Ryan is not the way he was before and he’s picked up bad habits, so that’s enabled me to come in and essentially be a fresh character, He’s changed so much that I didn’t have to stick to how the previous actor had played him, which really helps when you’re coming into a new show." ...|$|R
