5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{notochord}} disappears in the sclerotome (vertebral body) segments, but {{persists in}} the region of the intervertebral discs as the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus.</b> The <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> and the fibers of the anulus fibrosus make up the intervertebral disc.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} locations have no discs and {{are therefore}} exempt from the risk of disc herniation: the upper two cervical intervertebral spaces, the sacrum, and the coccyx. Most disc herniations occur {{when a person is}} in their thirties or forties when the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> is still a gelatin-like substance. With age the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> changes ("dries out") and the risk of herniation is greatly reduced. After age 50 or 60, osteoarthritic degeneration (spondylosis) or spinal stenosis are more likely causes of low back pain or leg pain.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus.</b> When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E

2500|$|Spinal disc herniation, more {{commonly}} called a [...] "slipped disc", {{is the result}} of a tear in the outer ring (anulus fibrosus) of the intervertebral disc, which lets some of the soft gel-like material, the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus,</b> bulge out in a hernia.|$|E
2500|$|Most authors favour {{degeneration}} of the {{intervertebral disc}} {{as the major}} cause of spinal disc herniation and cite trauma as a low cause. [...] Disc degeneration occurs both with degenerative disc disease and aging. With degeneration, {{the contents of the}} disc, the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> and anulus fibrosus, are exposed to altered loads. [...] Specifically, the nucleus becomes fibrous and stiff and less able to bear load. [...] The load is transferred to the anulus, which, if it fails to bear the increased load, can lead to the development of fissures. [...] If the fissures reach the periphery of the anulus, the nuclear material can pass through as a disc herniation.|$|E
2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the sciatic nerve is compressed or pinched by the piriformis muscle of the hip. [...] It usually only affects one hip at a given time, though both hips may produce piriformis syndrome {{at some point in}} the patient's lifetime, and having had it once greatly increases the chance that it will recur in one hip or the other at some future point unless action is taken to prevent this. Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch. If the piriformis muscle can be located beneath the other gluteal muscles, it will feel noticeably cord-like and will be painful to compress or massage. [...] The pain is exacerbated with any activity that causes flexion of the hip including lifting, prolonged sitting, or walking. The diagnosis is largely clinical and is one of exclusion. During a physical examination, attempts may be made to stretch the irritated piriformis and provoke sciatic nerve compression, such as the Freiberg test, the Pace test, the FABER test (flexion, abduction, external rotation), and the FAIR test (flexion, adduction, internal rotation). Conditions to be ruled out include herniated <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> (HNP), facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, and lumbar muscle strain.|$|E
2500|$|Disc herniations {{can result}} from general wear and tear, such as {{constant}} sitting or squatting, driving, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, herniations can also result from the lifting of heavy loads. Professional athletes, especially those playing contact sports such as American football, are prone to disc herniations as well. Within such an athletic context, herniation is often the result of sudden blunt impacts against, or abrupt bending or torsional movements of, the lower back. When the spine is straight, such as in standing or lying down, internal pressure is equalized on {{all parts of the}} discs. While sitting or bending to lift, internal pressure on a disc can move from 17 psi (lying down) to over 300 psi (lifting with a rounded back)[...] Herniation of the contents of the disc into the spinal canal often occurs when the anterior side (stomach side) of the disc is compressed while sitting or bending forward, and the contents (<b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus)</b> get pressed against the tightly stretched and thinned membrane (anulus fibrosus) on the posterior side (back side) of the disc. The combination of membrane thinning from stretching and increased internal pressure (200 to 300 psi) results in the rupture of the confining membrane. The jelly-like contents of the disc then move into the spinal canal, pressing against the spinal nerves, which may produce intense and potentially disabling pain and other symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of a {{herniated disc}} can vary {{depending}} on the location of the herniation and the types of soft tissue that become involved. They can range from little or no pain if the disc is the only tissue injured, to severe and unrelenting neck or lower back pain that will radiate into the regions served by affected nerve roots that are irritated or impinged by the herniated material. Often, herniated discs are not diagnosed immediately, as the patients come with undefined pains in the thighs, knees, or feet. Other symptoms may include sensory changes such as numbness, tingling, [...] paresthesia, and motor changes such as muscular weakness, paralysis and affection of reflexes. If the herniated disc is in the lumbar region the patient may also experience sciatica due to irritation of one of the nerve roots of the sciatic nerve. Unlike a pulsating pain or pain that comes and goes, which can be caused by muscle spasm, pain from a herniated disc is usually continuous or at least is continuous in a specific position of the body. It is possible to have a herniated disc without any pain or noticeable symptoms, depending on its location. If the extruded <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> material doesn't press on soft tissues or nerves, it may not cause any symptoms. A small-sample study examining the cervical spine in symptom-free volunteers has found focal disc protrusions in 50% of participants, which suggests that a considerable part of the population can have focal herniated discs in their cervical region that do not cause noticeable symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc functions {{to separate the}} vertebrae {{from each other and}} provides the surface for the shock-absorbing gel of the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus.</b> The <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> of the disc functions to distribute hydraulic pressure in all directions within each {{intervertebral disc}} under compressive loads. The <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> consists of large vacuolated notochord cells, small chondrocyte-like cells, collagen fibrils, and aggrecan, a proteoglycan that aggregates by binding to hyaluronan. Attached to each aggrecan molecule are glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate. Aggrecan is highly negatively charged, allowing the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> to swell by imbibing water. The amount of glycosaminoglycans (and hence water) decreases with age and degeneration.|$|E

50|$|Fibrocartilage {{replaces the}} {{gelatinous}} mucoid material of the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> as the disc changes with age. There may be splits in the anulus fibrosus, permitting herniation of elements of <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus.</b> There {{may also be}} shrinkage of the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> that produces prolapse or folding of the anulus fibrosus with secondary osteophyte formation {{at the margins of}} the adjacent vertebral body. The pathologic findings in DDD include protrusion, spondylolysis, and/or subluxation of vertebrae (spondylolisthesis) and spinal stenosis. It has been hypothesized that Propionibacterium acnes may play a role.|$|E

50|$|Intervertebral discs {{consist of}} an outer fibrous ring, the annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis, which {{surrounds}} an inner gel-like center, the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus.</b> The anulus fibrosus consists of several layers (laminae) of fibrocartilage {{made up of}} both type I and type II collagen. Type I is concentrated towards {{the edge of the}} ring where it provides greater strength. The stiff laminae can withstand compressive forces. The fibrous intervertebral disc contains the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> and this helps to distribute pressure evenly across the disc. This prevents the development of stress concentrations which could cause damage to the underlying vertebrae or to their endplates. The <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> contains loose fibers suspended in a mucoprotein gel. The nucleus of the disc acts as a shock absorber, absorbing the impact of the body's activities and keeping the two vertebrae separated. It is the remnant of the notochord.|$|E
50|$|Schmorl's nodes or Schmorl's nodules are {{protrusions}} of the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> of the {{intervertebral disc}} through the vertebral body endplate {{and into the}} adjacent vertebra.|$|E

5000|$|The {{notochord}} {{will form}} the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> of interverterbral discs. There is some discussion {{as to whether}} these cells contributed from the notochord are replaced by others from the adjacent mesoderm.|$|E
50|$|Another kind of herniation, of the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus,</b> {{can also}} happen {{as a result}} of the {{formation}} of Schmorl's nodes on the intervertebral disc. This is referred to as vertical disc herniation.|$|E
5000|$|Based {{upon the}} {{intervertebral}} disc tissue analysis of unweighted animals, biochemical {{changes to the}} <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> during spaceflight will affect {{the ability of the}} osmotic pressure and elasticity of the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> to resist compressive loading. [...] Biochemical changes in the intervertebral discs of crewmembers after flight have not been identified, but there is in vitro research with bovine cartilage explants to use magnetic resonance technology to correlate changes in intervertebral disc proteoglycan content with the T1 rho relaxation of protons. [...] This biomarker will enable non-invasive monitoring of proteoglycan content as a method of assessing the biochemical impact of weightlessness.|$|E
50|$|A postembryonic {{vestige of}} the {{notochord}} {{is found in}} the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> of the intervertebral discs. Isolated notochordal remnants may escape their lineage-specific destination in the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> and instead attach to the outer surfaces of the vertebral bodies, from which notochordal cells largely regress. In humans, by the age of 4, all notochord residue is replaced by a population of chondrocyte-like cells of unclear origin. Persistence of notochordal cells within the vertebra may cause a pathologic condition: persistent notochordal canal. They are also found to persist in the nasopharyngeal space and, in such an unusual instance, may give rise to a Tornwaldt cyst.|$|E
50|$|There is a disc {{between each}} of the {{vertebrae}} in the spine. A healthy, well-hydrated disc will contain {{a great deal of}} water in its center, known as the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus,</b> which provides cushioning and flexibility for the spine. Much of the mechanical stress that is caused by everyday movements is transferred to the discs within the spine and the water content within them allows them to effectively absorb the shock. At birth, a typical human <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> will contain about 80% water. However natural daily stresses and minor injuries can cause these discs to gradually lose water as the annulus, or the rigid outer shell of a disc, weakens.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. a {{herniated disc}} when other non-surgical {{treatments}} have failed. The <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> (the jelly-like {{center of the}} disc) of the herniated disc bulges out through the annulus (surrounding wall) and presses on the nerve root next to it.|$|E
5000|$|Spinal disc herniation, more {{commonly}} called a [...] "slipped disc", {{is the result}} of a tear in the outer ring (anulus fibrosus) of the intervertebral disc, which lets some of the soft gel-like material, the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus,</b> bulge out in a hernia.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{should be}} {{initiated}} {{as early as}} possible, before any increase in muscle tone, which further intensifies the pain. Traction is recommended to decompress a compressed roots. Radiculopathy {{can be caused by}} herniated <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus.</b> Surgery is the last resort when conservative therapy is unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|Microdiscectomy (or microdecompression) is a minimally-invasive {{surgical}} procedure {{in which a}} portion of a herniated <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> is removed by way of a surgical instrument. The purpose of this procedure is to relieve the pressure and reduce the local inflammatory reaction around a nerve root, caused by the herniated nucleous pulposus.|$|E
50|$|Spinal disc herniation, more {{commonly}} called a slipped disc, {{is the result}} of a tear in the outer ring (anulus fibrosus) of the intervertebral disc, which lets some of the soft gel-like material, the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus,</b> bulge out in a hernia. This may be treated by a minimally-invasive endoscopic procedure called Tessys method.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{there is}} minimal in- and post-flight data that would {{characterize}} {{the changes in}} intervertebral discs in crewmembers to assess how these changes would predispose the discs to injury under re-loading. Herniated <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> is known to occur in aviators exposed to high G-force environments [...] and has occurred in astronauts after a mission.|$|E
5000|$|A {{retrospective}} chart {{review to}} evaluate the incidence of intervertebral disc damage after several astronauts developed cervical or lumbar herniated <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> in the immediate postflight period.

This review also ought to clarify {{whether there is an}} increased risk for intervertebral disc damage due to: ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{effect of}} ageing and disc {{degeneration}} {{is that the}} <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> begins to dehydrate and the concentration of proteoglycans in the matrix decreases, thus limiting {{the ability of the}} disc to absorb shock. This general shrinking of disc size is partially responsible for the common decrease in height as humans age. The anulus fibrosus also becomes weaker with age and has an increased risk of tearing. In addition, the cartilage endplates begin thinning, fissures begin to form, and there is sclerosis of the subchondral bone. As the fissures are formed in the anulus fibrosis due to osteo-arthritic bones or degeneration in general, the inner <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> can seep out and put pressure on any number of vertebral nerves. A herniated disc can cause mild to severe pain such as sciatica and treatment for herniated discs range from physical therapy to surgery. [...] Other degeneration of the vertebral column includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis(DISH) which is the calcification or ossification of the ligaments surrounding the vertebrae. This degeneration causes stiffness and sometimes even curvature in the lumbar and thoraco-lumbar spinal region.|$|E
50|$|This {{water loss}} makes the discs less {{flexible}} {{and results in}} the gradual collapse and narrowing of {{the gap in the}} spinal column. As the space between vertebrae gets smaller, extra pressure can be placed on the discs causing tiny cracks or tears to appear in the annulus. If enough pressure is exerted, it's possible for the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> material to seep out through the tears in the annulus and can cause what is known as a herniated disc.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogels {{existing}} {{naturally in}} the body include mucus, the vitreous humor of the eye, cartilage, tendons and blood clots. Their viscoelastic nature results in the soft tissue component of the body, disparate from the mineral-based hard tissue of the skeletal system. Researchers are actively developing synthetically derived tissue replacement technologies derived from hydrogels, for both temporary implants (degradable) and permanent implants (non-degradable). A review article on the subject discusses the use of hydrogels for <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> replacement, cartilage replacement, and synthetic tissue models.|$|E
50|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus.</b> When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{degenerative}} disc {{disease is}} one of the most common sources of back pain and affects approximately 30 million people every year. With symptomatic degenerative disc disease, the pain can vary depending on the location of the affected disc. A degenerated disc in the lower back can result in lower back pain, sometimes radiating to the hips, as well as pain in the buttocks, thighs or legs. If pressure is being placed on the nerves by exposed <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus,</b> sporadic tingling or weakness through the knees and legs can also occur.|$|E
50|$|Notochords {{are thought}} to be {{advantageous}} (both in an evolutionary and developmental context) because they provide(d) rigid structure for muscle attachment, but were still flexible. In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main structural support of the body, while in most vertebrates it becomes the <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> of the intervertebral disc. The notochord {{plays a key role in}} signaling and coordinating development. Embryos of vertebrates still form transient notochord structures today during the gastrulation phase of development. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube.|$|E
50|$|The meningeal {{branches}} of the spinal nerves (also known as recurrent meningeal nerves, sinuvertebral nerves, or recurrent nerves of Luschka) {{are a number of}} small nerves that branch from the spinal nerve near the origin of the anterior and posterior rami, but before the rami communicantes branch. They then re-enter the intervertebral foramen, and innervate the facet joints, the anulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc, and the ligaments and periosteum of the spinal canal, carrying pain sensation. The <b>nucleus</b> <b>pulposus</b> of the intervertebral disk has no pain innervation.|$|E
