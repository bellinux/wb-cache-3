5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is coincidentally in the area, {{taking a}} {{vacation}} in Maine. After stumbling upon the carnage in the grocery store, Scully telephones Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and describes the bizarre situation. Mulder tells Scully that the incident might {{be the result of}} witchcraft or sorcery. Scully, however, can find <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> that might support his theory. Assisted by the local police, Scully reviews the store's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene, the only customer unaffected. Jack Bonsaint, the police chief, tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch. Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventories}} of both 1514 and 1546 also list several hundred heavy darts and lime pots {{that were designed}} to be thrown onto the deck of enemy ships from the fighting tops, although <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of either of these weapon types has been identified. Of the 50 handguns listed in the Anthony Roll, the complete stocks of five matchlock muskets and fragments of another eleven have been found. They had been manufactured mainly in Italy, with some originating from Germany. Found in storage were several gunshields, a rare type of firearm consisting of a wooden shield with a small gun fixed in the middle.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} Tandy's {{apparent}} lack {{of concern for the}} CoCo market, there were rumors of the existence of a prototype CoCo 4 at Tandy's Fort Worth headquarters. Several first hand accounts of the prototype came from people like Mark Siegel of Tandy and Ken Kaplan of Microware, yet there exists <b>no</b> known <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of such a machine.|$|R
25|$|Carson {{had been}} shot several times, {{including}} a fatal shotgun blast to the head.

When Lawson preached as a guest in the Salem Village meetinghouse, he was interrupted several times by outbursts of the afflicted.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Zuse also {{suggested}} that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure (digital physics); in 1969, he published the book Rechnender Raum (translated into English as Calculating Space). This idea has attracted a lot of attention, since there is <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> against Zuse's thesis. Edward Fredkin (1980s), JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber (1990s), and others have expanded on it.|$|E
50|$|The {{publication}} of the name and photograph of the suspect has been criticized by some since it can hamper the police investigation, reduce the evidentiary value of a police lineup for the cases where there is <b>no</b> other <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> and since it causes emotional suffering for the victims, the suspects {{family and friends and}} the suspect himself if he is later acquitted.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, big cat {{sightings}} {{have been reported}} in widely separated parts of New Zealand, in both the North and South Islands.

5000|$|Obscurity shrouds {{the period}} between {{the decline of the}} Harappans and the {{definite}} historic period starting with the Mauryas, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was Buddhism. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidences</b> for these except textual references. Soon after the Buddhists initiated rock-cut caves, Hindus and Jains started to imitate them at Badami, Aihole, Ellora, Salsette, Elephanta, Aurangabad and Mamallapuram and Mughals. It appears to be a constant in Indian art that the different religions shared a very similar artistic style at any particular period and place, though naturally adapting the iconography to match the religion commissioning them. [...] Probably the same groups of artists worked for the different religions regardless of their own affiliations.|$|R
25|$|According to legend, {{the lake}} {{is home to a}} mysterious sea creature, known as the Lake Van Monster which is {{believed}} by some to lurk {{below the surface of the}} lake, described as being 30-40 ft long with brown scaly skin and with a elongated reptilian head and flippers, resembling an extinct mosasaurus or basilosaurus. Apart from some amateur photographs and videos, there is <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> to prove its existence.|$|E
25|$|Dahmer was {{not charged}} with the {{attempted}} murder of Tracy Edwards, nor {{with the murder of}} Steven Tuomi. He was not charged with Tuomi's murder because the Milwaukee County District Attorney only brought charges where murder could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and Dahmer had no memory of actually committing this particular murder, for which <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of the crime existed. At a scheduled preliminary hearing on January 13, 1992, Dahmer pleaded guilty but insane to 15 counts of murder.|$|E
25|$|Lieberman and Philip's {{family have}} {{strongly}} disputed {{some of the}} facts {{and many of the}} conclusions of the police report, insinuating that the police did poor work or even fabricated some of their evidence. Her family have pointed out that there are many other 9/11 victims whose remains were never found, and other victims who were added to the list despite equally tenuous connections to the attack. <b>No</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> has been found to suggest that she was killed in the attacks.|$|E

50|$|The {{former head}} of the {{respiratory}} care department at Loma Linda University, Tom Malinowski, led the internal investigation by Adventist Health. Statistical analysis indicates that the total number of murders committed by Saldivar could be as high as 200, but <b>no</b> convincing <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> will ever be available to confirm or refute this possibility due to bodies being cremated after death or simply the effects of bodily harm.|$|R
50|$|It was at {{the centre}} {{of a very large}} parish and its church of St John the Baptist was {{certainly}} of minster status. Bromsgrove, along with all the towns in north Worcestershire, was committed to defending the city of Worcester and is recorded to have contributed burgesses to Droitwich in 1086. There may also have been Anglo-Saxon or Norman fortifications in Bromsgrove, but other than in literature <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> archaeological <b>evidence</b> remains.|$|R
25|$|Despite this {{colorful}} history, {{there is}} no evidence that a pirate named Gaspar or Gasparilla ever operated off the Florida coast. Although the USS Enterprise was indeed attached to the pirate-hunting West Indies Squadron in 1821, the United States Navy has no record of any interaction with the mythical buccaneer or a person claiming to be member of his crew. In fact, researchers have found no contemporaneous records either in Spain or the United States that mention Gaspar's existence, and <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of his presence in Florida has ever been uncovered.|$|E
25|$|In March 1996, Rose {{announced}} her intentions to appeal her sentence, contending extensive press coverage had rendered witness testimony unreliable, that <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> existed to attest she {{had participated in}} any of the murders, that the final instructions delivered by the judge to the jury had been biased in favour of the prosecution, and that undue weight had been given to the similar fact evidence introduced at her trial. This appeal was rejected by Lord Chief Justice Taylor, who contended Rose had received both a fair trial and efficient legal representation.|$|E
25|$|Wareham Castle {{was built}} in the {{south-west}} corner of the old Anglo-Saxon earthworks, taking the form of a motte with an inner and outer bailey, protected with timber defences and a ditch. The original size of the motte is not known; 18th and 19th century records suggest it was between 55 and 60ft across. It is uncertain when the castle was built; it may have been constructed soon after the Norman conquest in 1066, although <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> survives today to prove this theory. If the castle was built soon after 1066, the construction work may have required the extensive demolition of houses {{in that part of the}} town, and the decision to place it in the south-west sector may have been linked to the presence of a former Anglo-Saxon royal residence there.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, skeptics {{have argued that}} UFOs are not a {{scientific}} problem at all, as there is <b>no</b> tangible <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> to study. Barry Markovsky argues that, under scrutiny by qualified investigators, {{the vast majority of}} UFO sightings turn out to have mundane explanations. Astronomer Carl Sagan stated on UFO sightings, [...] "The reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable. Unfortunately there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting." ...|$|R

25|$|It {{is still}} debated whether Horn {{committed}} the Nickells murder. Historians including Chip Carlson {{believe he did}} not, while others such as Dean Fenton Krakel believe that he did, but had not realized he was shooting a boy. The consensus is that regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others. Carlson, who extensively researched the Wyoming v. Tom Horn trial, concluded that although Horn could have committed the murder of Willie Nickell, he probably did not. According to Carlson's book, Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon (2001), there was <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day before it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession made it without value as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn's reputation and history made him {{an easy target for}} the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Dinas BrÃ¢n is in {{what was}} once the ancient Kingdom of Powys. The last Prince of Powys Gruffydd Maelor died in 1191 and the kingdom was divided into Powys Fadog in the north and Powys Wenwynwyn in the south. His son, Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor was lord of Powys Fadog and founded the nearby Valle Crucis Abbey. Although no archaeological {{evidence}} has been found some records suggest he ruled from Dinas BrÃ¢n. If a structure did exist {{it would have been a}} wooden fortification probably consisting of a wooden palisade surrounding a hall and other buildings. These early records further say it was destroyed by fire and then the new castle was built on the same site, therefore little prospect for finding any archaeological evidence of the early building remains. An even earlier structure has been suggested, belonging to Elisedd ap Gwylog from the 8th century (Ried, 1973). It was this Elisedd who is named on the Pillar of Eliseg and is one of the founders of the kingdom of Powys, but again <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> for any structure at Dinas BrÃ¢n has been found.|$|E
25|$|Allegation of cult-based {{abuse is}} the most extreme {{scenario}} of SRA. During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of Satan-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized conspiracy engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced prostitution, drug distribution and pornography. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and torture children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of Devil worship. Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as necrophilia, forced ingestion of semen, blood and feces, cannibalism, orgies, liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; infanticide, sacrificial abortions to eat fetuses and human sacrifice; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian graves. No evidence {{of any of these}} claims has ever been found; the proof presented by those who alleged the reality of cult-based abuse primarily consisted of the memories of adults recalling childhood abuse, the testimony of young children and extremely controversial confessions. The idea of a murderous Satanic conspiracy created a controversy dividing the professional child abuse community at the time, though no evidence has been found to support allegations {{of a large number of}} children being killed or abused in Satanic rituals. From a law enforcement perspective, an intergenerational conspiracy dedicated to ritual sacrifice whose members remain completely silent, make no mistakes and leave <b>no</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> is unlikely; cases of what the media incorrectly perceived as actual cult sacrifices (such as the 1989 case of Adolfo Constanzo) have supported this idea.|$|E

The Lenape lived in communities of bark- or grass-covered wigwams, and in their larger settlementsâtypically located on high ground adjacent to fresh water, and occupied in the fall, winter, and springâthey fished, harvested shellfish, trapped animals, gathered wild fruits and vegetables, and cultivated corn, tobacco, beans, and other crops.|$|R
