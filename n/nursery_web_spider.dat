25|$|Four species {{occur in}} New Zealand. Two are widespread: the large Dolomedes aquaticus of open riverbanks, and the similar size Dolomedes dondalei or New Zealand forest fishing spider (once {{referred}} to as Dolomedes III), which specialises in forested riverbanks. The largest of the New Zealand species Dolomedes schauinslandi or Rangatira spider occurs in the Chatham Islands, where it occurs on rodent-free islands where running water is rare. The fourth species, D. minor, is also not restricted to rivers.

50|$|D. schauinslandi {{is active}} {{at night in}} forest and {{scrubland}} habitat where it feeds on weta. Its predators could include mice and weka, which could explain its absence from Pitt Island, where it was described as common in the original species description. Mating has not been observed, but females have been observed carrying eggsacs in their chelicerae in November and December and guarding their nursery from December to February, {{as would be expected}} for a <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E
50|$|Depending on habitat, <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> {{hibernate}} once {{or twice}} during the nymphal stage. The period of hibernation (diapause) is spent in ground vegetation under leaves, moss, and stones. They {{can be found in}} garages and houses, as well. Some individuals in the south of France have been found under loose bark of the plane tree. The nymphs in stages 6 to 8 start hibernating in November and continue with their development towards the end of February to the beginning of March.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> have {{a one-year}} annual cycle in {{southern}} Europe. They grow in summer, hibernate in winter, reach adulthood in spring, and reproduce and then die in autumn. Their offspring are sexually mature {{in the following}} spring. Spiders from the north have a two-year cycle, {{having to go through}} two hibernations before reaching sexual maturity. Spiders in Western and Central Europe have a mix of both one- and two-year cycles. Males have a two-month period to reproduce; females three and a half.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> are spiders of {{the family}} Pisauridae. They {{resemble}} wolf spiders (family Lycosidae), but they carry their egg sacs by means of their jaws and pedipalps (instead of attaching them to their spinnerets). When the eggs are about to hatch, a mother spider builds a nursery [...] "tent", puts her egg sac inside, and mounts guard outside. The name [...] "nursery web spider" [...] is especially given to the European species Pisaura mirabilis, but the family also includes fishing spiders and raft spiders.|$|R

50|$|It seems no {{detailed}} survey {{has been done}} of the lake. As cattle often walk in the lake {{it is likely to}} be polluted. In the 1970s the dunes between the lake and the harbour were sown with tree lupin (Lupinus arboreus) and Marram Grass, which has reduced sand movement and provided a low quality pasture. Frogs can be heard croaking in the lake. The pompillid wasp (Cryptocheilus australis) and its prey, the <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> (Dolomedes minor), have been seen near the lake.|$|E
50|$|The six-spotted fishing spider, Dolomedes triton, is an {{arachnid}} {{from the}} <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> family Pisauridae. This species {{is from the}} genus Dolomedes, the fishing spiders. This species of fishing spider is named after the mythological Greek god Triton who is the messenger of the big sea {{and the son of}} Poseidon. These spiders can be seen scampering along the water’s surface when a person walks by in which they are often referred to as dock spiders because they are often witnessed as they quickly vanish through the cracks of a boat dock.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the wolf}} spiders, which have two very {{prominent}} eyes {{in addition to}} the other six, the eyes of the <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> are {{more or less the same}} size. Many species are able to walk on the surface of still bodies of water, and may even dive beneath the surface for a time to escape enemies. In escaping predators, they may very well jump a distance of 5-6 inches. However, they do not find it easy to make their way up extremely smooth surfaces such as glass.|$|R
50|$|Montgomery's {{earliest}} papers concerned ribbon worms (phylum Nemertea), a {{group on}} which he would write 10 papers. He also published 10 papers on horsehair worms (phylum Nematomorpha) and two on rotifers. Montgomery wrote 14 scientific articles on spiders, and {{he was known to}} keep large amounts in his laboratory and home from which he recorded observations of courtship, mating, and other behaviors. He wrote on the taxonomy of wolf spiders (family Lycosidae), lynx <b>spiders</b> (Oxyopidae), and <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> (Pisauridae). In a 1909 paper detailing the anatomy and development of various organs in spiders he rejected a prevalent idea at the time that arachnids evolved from Merostomata (a group including horseshoe crabs and extinct sea scorpions) adapting to a terrestrial life, and proposed instead that the aquatic lifestyle of horseshoe crabs evolved from terrestrial ancestors.|$|R
50|$|They {{belong to}} the RTA clade of spiders, spiders that all have a Retrolateral Tibial Apophysis on the male pedipalp. A recent phylogenetic {{analysis}} places Psechridae as close relatives of the Lynx spiders (Oxyopidae), as well as wolf <b>spiders</b> (Lycosidae) and <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spiders</b> (Pisauridae) (Agnarsson et al. 2013). With body lengths of up to 2 cm and funnel webs more than 1 m in diameter, {{they are among the}} biggest cribellate spiders. Psechrids construct cribellate webs and Fecenia construct webs that are similar to orb <b>webs</b> of Orbiculariae <b>spiders,</b> a remarkable example of evolutionary convergence (Blackledge et al. 2012, Agnarsson et al. 2013). Psechridae spiders are only found in SE Asia, where they occur in forests from lowland to altitudes exceeding 2000 m. Female Psechrus carry their egg-sac in the chelicerae, similar to their relatives, the ecribellate Pisauridae. They feature several characteristics normally found in ecribellate spiders, for example brood care behavior, and a colulus with no apparent function (Fang et al. 2000).|$|R

The third and most common species, Dolomedes minor, is not restricted to rivers. Known as the <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spider,</b> it makes white nursery webs on shrubs, but is still capable of fishing behaviour.

5000|$|Palaeoperenethis thaleri {{is known}} only from one fossil, the holotype, number [...] "ROM31304" [...] {{consisting}} of part and counterpart impressions {{that is currently}} residing in the paleontological collections in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada. It is a single adult male individual preserved as a compression fossil in the fine-grained lacustrian rock and thus has been flattened from its dimensions in life. The compression specimen was mentioned in publication by Dr. Mark Wilson in his 1977 paper discussing the paleoecology of the Horsefly Lagerstätte fossil sites. P. thaleri was first studied by Paul A. Selden and David Penney, with their 2009 type description being {{published in the journal}} Contributions to Natural History. The generic name was coined by P. Selden and D. Penney as a combination of the Greek word palaios meaning [...] "ancient" [...] and Perenethis, a modern <b>Nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> genus. This is in reference to the age of the type specimen and the African-Asian genus which Palaeoperenethis is similar in appearance to. The specific epithet [...] "thaleri" [...] was designated by P. Selden and D. Penney in honor of the late Dr. Konrad Thaler, past president of the International Society of Arachnology.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pisauridae, Pisaurina mira carries its eggs along with it in a sac that is secured both by a thread of silk linking it to the spider's spinnerets and by being held by the spider's chelicerae. When the eggs are nearly ready to hatch the mother will build a <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> within which the egg sac is then hung. After they hatch, and until they undergo their first molt, the infant spiders will inhabit the rather large volume {{enclosed}} by this <b>nursery</b> <b>web.</b> The mother <b>spider</b> will station herself nearby in order to defend the nursery.|$|R

40|$|In sexually cannibalistic animals, male {{fitness is}} {{influenced}} {{not only by}} successful mate acquisition and egg fertilization, but also by avoiding being eaten. In the cannibalistic <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spider,</b> Pisaurina mira, the legs of mature males are longer {{in relation to their}} body size than those of females, and males use these legs to aid in wrapping a female’s legs with silk prior to and during copulation. We hypothesized that elongated male legs and silk wrapping provide benefits to males, in part through a reduced likelihood of sexual cannibalism. To test this, we paired females of random size with males from one of two treatment groups—those capable of silk wrapping versus those incapable of silk wrapping. We found that males with relatively longer legs and larger body size were more likely to mate and {{were less likely to be}} cannibalized prior to copulation. Regardless of relative size, males capable of silk wrapping were less likely to be cannibalized during or following copulation and had more opportunities for sperm transfer (i. e. pedipalpal insertions). Our results suggest that male size and copulatory silk wrapping are sexually selected traits benefiting male reproductive success.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, ten {{different}} silk fibroin proteins (SFs) {{retrieved from}} Swiss-Prot database are analyzed and characterized using In silico tools. Primary structure analysis shows {{that all the}} SFs are hydrophobic in nature due to the high content of non-polar residues. The presence of very few or lack of cystein in SFs shows that disulphide links are absent in the silk fibroin proteins. The presence of extensive hydrogen bonds may provide the stability to protein in absence of disulphide bonds. The aliphatic index computed by ExPasy's ProtParam infers that SFs may be stable at wide range of temperature. Secondary structure analysis shows {{that most of the}} SFs have predominant ∝-helical structure, some have β-helical structure and the rest shows mixed secondary structure. The very high coil structural content of wild silk moth, <b>nursery</b> <b>web</b> <b>spider</b> and earth bumble bee is due to the rich content of highly flexible glycine and hydrophobic alanine amino acids. SOSUI server predicts one transmembrane region in wild silk moth, silk moth and pine moth SFs. The predicted transmembrane regions were visualized and analyzed using helical wheel plots generated by EMBOSS pepwheel tool. The absence of disulphide bonds in SFs were confirmed by SYC_REC tool and from 3 - Dimensional structure created by Rasmol tool. The cytein position identified by Rasmol tool might be correct as the evaluation parameters are within the acceptable limits for the modeled 3 D structure.
