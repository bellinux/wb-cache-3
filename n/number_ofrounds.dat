40|$|Abstract We {{develop a}} general {{technique}} for the quantitative analy-sis of iterative distributed load balancing schemes. We illustrate the technique by studying two simple, intuitivelyappealing models that are {{prevalent in the}} literature: the diffusive paradigm, and periodic balancing circuits (or thedimension exchange paradigm). It {{is well known that}} such load balancing schemes can be roughly modeled by Markovchains, but also that this approximation can be quite inaccurate. Our main contribution is an effective way of char-acterizing the deviation between the actual loads and the distribution generated by a related Markov chain, in termsof a natural quantity which we call the local divergence. We apply this technique to obtain bounds on the <b>number</b> <b>ofrounds</b> required to achieve coarse balancing in general networks, cycles and meshes in these models. For balancingcircuits, we also present bounds for the stronger requirement of perfect balancing, or counting...|$|E
