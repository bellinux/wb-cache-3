40|$|The {{purpose of}} this bachelor’s thesis “Reading the online-edition of Postimees among the 12 th grade students” {{was to examine the}} reading of the online-edition of Postimees among 12 th grade students. The {{outcomes}} were also compared to other theses previously composed at the University of Tartu. In order to obtain answers to the research questions the author used a form of questionnaire, think-aloud method and an interview. The selection of the form of questionnaire consisted of 52 students, of which 26 students study in 12 th grade at the Tamme Gymnasium in Tartu and 26 students study in 12 th grade at the Gymnasium of Art in Tartu. The selection of observation and interview consisted of ten students who all study in 12 th grade at the Kivilinna Gymnasium in Tartu. The age range of all the participants in the research was between 17 to 19 years. As a result of the research it appeared that the 12 th grade students read the online-edition of Postimees every day. The online-edition of Postimees is read rather in the evenings because in the morning they are at school where the usage of Internet is limited, but in the evenings they have enough free time to read the news from the Internet. Mostly they stay on the Postimees page up to 15 minutes per one reading; therefore they more likely read the headlines of the news and/or watch the pictures concerning the news, but for a more thorough reading they open the news less. The students of 12 th grade prefer to read the news which subject is close to them, such as school, education, studying, the life of young people and humor. They read less about politics, for example, about the politicians, political parties and the president, parliament and government. The attention of a 12 th grade student is grasped by news which has an interesting headline and an illustrative picture. The placement of the news is thereby second-rated. The perusal of articles appearing in the online-edition of Postimees is mostly influenced by the length of the story (the shorter, the better), after that how interesting the topic is and an auspicious text. The pointed out data refers clearly to the circumstance that young people read news from the Internet shallowly. The movement pattern of the 12 th grade students on the online-edition of the Postimees page is the following: they immediately open the attractive news and also read it immediately, and it is preferred to read the middle wide column rather than the side-columns. The main reason for that is the size of headlines and pictures. Comparing this thesis to the previously composed theses on this topic {{it can be said that}} similarities as well as differences were found. All the theses stated that the most important factor in opening the articles is the closeness of the subject, and the task of the picture and the headline is to act as a focus puller not the sole-reason for opening the article. The perusal of articles is influenced by the shortness, how interesting the topic is and how well the text is written, and only the middle big column of the online-edition of Postimees is read, not the side-columns. The differences in the theses emerged in the behavior patterns, because all the observable students did not open the attractive news immediately and also did not immediately read it. It also appeared that some of the people are grasped more by the news which is placed higher on the front page, but there are people who don’t find the placement of the <b>news</b> <b>important</b> at all. Even though the main reasons of choosing of the article, not reading it completely through and the perusal of the articles match, less important reasons can be found which were not mentioned in all the theses, such as the prominent persons, duplications in the text and other community-wise significant subjects. Of course when interpreting the outcomes of the research, into consideration should be taken the circumstance, that the selection of the observation and interview was small - only ten students...|$|E
40|$|Who’s {{to blame}} for the sorry state of Question Time, asks PETER BRENT OVER the past {{fortnight}} I’ve sat through Question Time in the House of Representatives several times. I had a clear view of our assembled servants, and can testify that occupying a position of power bequeaths charisma and gravitas to even the most ordinary individual. The men wore identical dark suits while the women enjoyed more sartorial latitude. There was nattering and a bit of juvenile behaviour. If anyone was under the weather they hid it well; those frazzled days are a thing of the past, apparently. But enough about the Press Gallery. Interesting as it was to observe Michelle, Laura, Dennis, Malcolm and all the others across the chamber, my task was to examine our 150 elected representatives seated below. Old-timers will recall the term “Dorothy Dixer. ” It denoted a question from a government backbencher to a minister that had obviously been planted. The minister would thank the honourable member and recite the answer. Dorothy Dixers were considered something of an abuse of the spirit of parliament. The phrase is no longer used because it is redundant. These days there is no other kind of government MP question, and a backbencher who dared write their own lines would be quickly reprimanded. Everything, on both sides, is choreographed and rehearsed. This was supposed to change with the new Labor government. In the first sitting of the year in February, deputy prime minister Julia Gillard was visibly miffed when she received a question that was ruled out of order by the new Speaker, Harry Jenkins. It had ended with the Howard era’s favourite open-ended invitation: “Does the minister know of any alternative policies?” This was now a no-no, according to Jenkins. But equilibrium quickly returned, and a new formulation has crept in: “How does the government’s [insert topic] plan stack up against any alternative promises?” This now passes without reprimand from the Speaker, after just a couple of months. Not all of “Questions without notice” (aka Question Time) is gunk, but most of it is. It is meant to be where the executive is held to account by the people’s representatives, but instead revolves around tactics, the “horse race” and maintaining the “psychological advantage. ” In a way, its sorry state reflects the general reporting of politics. As one becomes increasingly superficial, so does the other. But Question Time is only a tiny part of parliament. Visit either house online at the parliament house website, or listen on ABC NewsRadio, at any other time of the day when either house is sitting and you stand a chance of hearing someone expounding, if not eloquently, then earnestly, on a matter of policy, or of concern to their electorate. Brand new MPs often cut their teeth on committees - {{the nuts and bolts of}} parliament, where they discover the legislative process. Away from the nightly <b>news,</b> <b>important</b> issues are dealt with, often with great goodwill and bipartisanship. But these parliamentarians, if they’re successful (and in a major party), become ministers or shadow ministers, which means they must do question time. So they unlearn the admirable traits and start behaving badly. So what did happen in parliament over the last fortnight? I think you know already. A government obsessed with the 24 hour news cycle got bogged down in something beyond its control - petrol prices. Cabinet documents were leaked. The prime minister consoled himself by scolding lazy public servants. Ministers then scurried to reassure their own departments he didn’t mean them. When Newspoll didn’t follow the script (as polls often don’t), showing little change from the previous fortnight, the press gallery simply pretended otherwise (as journalists often do). Then this week, the government flicked the switch to Mogadon. Intent on showing they were back in the serious business of government, they held forth about anything but petrol. The regulation of international financial transactions was a popular topic. On the opposition side, Joe Hockey and Wilson Tuckey bellowed a lot. (“We will not be silenced!” thundered Big Joe), Chris Pyne and Steve Ciobo chortled over a magazine that seemed to be called Shooter, and Anthony Albanese’s pronunciation of the word “environmental” amused them all. On the government benches, Peter Garrett looked like he’d rather be surfing, Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen was way too confident for his callow boots and Gillard was funny. See what I mean? The dross is all most of us wanted to know, and it only required an hour and a half’s observation. The things that really matter would need hundreds of tedious hours - and probably make dull reading. Choose your clich©: a race to the bottom, or excrement floats to the top. That’s Question Time in the House of Reps. But don’t blame the politicians; they wouldn’t behave like that if we didn’t want them to. • Peter Brent is a member of the Democratic Audit of Australia and editor of mumble. com. au Photo, top of page: Opposition members (L to R) Joe Hockey, Julie Bishop, Warren Truss, Leader Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull react to Small Business Minister Craig Emerson during House of Representatives question time at Parliament House on 29 May.
