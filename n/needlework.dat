5|$|Although {{continental}} fashions in <b>needlework</b> {{were adopted}} in England, {{a number of}} popular styles were purely English in origin, including the embroidered linen jackets of {{the turn of the}} 17th century, stumpwork, and art <b>needlework.</b>|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{worked in}} art <b>needlework</b> styles were {{featured}} {{at the various}} Arts and Crafts exhibitions from the 1890s to the Great War.|$|E
5|$|As Duke and Duchess of York, George and May {{carried out}} a variety of public duties. In 1897, she became the patron of the London <b>Needlework</b> Guild in {{succession}} to her mother. The guild, initially established as The London Guild in 1882, was renamed several times and was named after May between 1914 and 2010. Samples of her own embroidery range from chair seats to tea cosies.|$|E

5|$|The Princess of Wales Bedroom {{is named}} after {{the wife of the}} future King Edward VII, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who stayed at Althorp in 1863 on a visit to see the Red Earl. Although the fabric of the four-poster bed was {{designed}} in 1911, the room is largely Georgian, with deep red walls and furnishings, and contains a notable portrait of a young princess by the Spanish court painter, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. The Queen Mary Bedroom {{is named after}} Mary, the wife of King George V, who visited Althorp in 1913. It contains a bed with an extremely tall structure, dated to the 18th century, draped in pea green taffet. Of particular note in the Queen Mary Bedroom are two chairs covered with <b>needlework</b> created by Albert, who was once the chairman of the Royal School of <b>Needlework.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anne's early {{education}} was typical {{for women of}} her class. In 1513, Anne was {{invited to join the}} schoolroom of Margaret of Austria and her four wards. Her academic education was limited to arithmetic, her family genealogy, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing. She developed domestic skills such as dancing, embroidery, good manners, household management, music, <b>needlework,</b> and singing. Anne learned to play games, such as cards, chess, and dice. She was also taught archery, falconry, horseback riding, and hunting.|$|E
5|$|As a young girl, {{she was an}} {{excellent}} student, but needed to quit school {{at the age of}} 11 to care for her ill grandmother. At 15, she taught school and a year later joined an academy in Providence, Rhode Island, where she earned her way through school by making and selling <b>needlework.</b> She graduated with highest honors and established a school that she operated for years. Paine gave the profits to her family, and she helped support them throughout most of her life.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{traditional}} <b>needleworks</b> with blue, black, and red threads are popular. They {{can be seen}} in the Volklore Museum of the village.|$|R
50|$|When {{she started}} {{designing}} patterns, {{she had some}} difficulty finding a publisher, so {{she and her husband}} formed their own publishing company, Artistic <b>Needleworks</b> Publications, through which she published both individual patterns and later entire pattern books.|$|R
50|$|According to Dai Watanabe, “Women {{were invited}} to teach western <b>needleworks</b> during that time.” She also {{identifies}} the first stuffed crocheted motif, 西洋毛糸編物教授 (Seiyo-keito-amimono-kyouju), a twigged loquat with a leaf and more fruit motifs which started appearing in 1920.|$|R
5|$|Like {{many other}} women {{of her class}} and era, Lady Rosebery patronised {{a great number of}} charities. Her chief causes appear to have all been {{connected}} specifically to the assistance and welfare of women. She was president of the Scottish Home Industries Association, a charity which encouraged Scottish women to work profitably from home making plaid or other items of <b>needlework</b> and the like. In this way women, especially widowed mothers, remained in their homes able to care for their often large families while still earning an income.|$|E
5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These samplers were stitched using a variety of <b>needlework</b> styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E
5|$|She {{was sent}} to a convent after her {{education}} in Manila. The convent she was studying in was the Santa Catalina College of the Dominican nuns, an exclusive school for girls, established in the Walled City of Intramuros where she finished her elementary and secondary education. In college, she learned Spanish, music, the feminine crafts and social graces. She spent her girlhood partly in their hometown and partly in the convent. Accordingly, Agoncillo was skilled in <b>needlework.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to her design work, Wilson published a syndicated newspaper column, Needleplay; was the host of two Public Television series on embroidery (1970s to 1980s); and wrote 16 books on embroidery. More recently she appeared as a guest on The Carol Duvall Show (HGTV). She also had a shop in New York City (Erica Wilson <b>Needleworks)</b> for 33 years.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the nobility}} {{there were many}} educated and cultured women, of which Queen Mary is the most obvious example. By the early eighteenth century their {{education}} was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, musical instruments (including lute, viol and keyboard), <b>needlework,</b> cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers. The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603. Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746). There are 50 autobiographies extant from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, of which 16 were written by women, {{all of which are}} largely religious in content.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, <b>needlework,</b> cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 percent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 percent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Overall literacy rates were slightly higher than in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for their English counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing <b>needlework,</b> and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1980s, Whiten's work took a {{new course}} when she began making {{small-scale}} stitched works. The cross-stitched <b>needlework's</b> imagery was sourced from daily newspapers. The first series focussed on the male newsmakers of the world, specifically political leaders, represented in a traditionally female craft. The second series of needlepoint works again used images from media as sources, but of women. The women represented by the media are typically in groups, either mourning or protesting.|$|R

60|$|Those of colours {{are also}} very various: some we take notice of as the {{different}} degrees, or as they were termed shades, of the same colour. But since we very seldom make assemblages of colours, either for use or delight, but figure is taken in also, and has its part in it, as in painting, weaving, <b>needleworks,</b> &c.;--those which are taken notice of do most commonly belong to MIXED MODES, as being made up of ideas of divers kinds, viz. figure and colour, such as beauty, rainbow, &c.|$|R
5|$|Toy spaniels {{continued}} to be popular in the British court {{during the reign of}} King James II, through that of Queen Anne. Popular types included those of the white and red variety. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the Pug was introduced into Britain which would eventually lead to drastic physical changes to the King Charles Spaniel. Comparisons between <b>needlework</b> pictures of English toy spaniels and the continental variety show that changes had already begun to take place in the English types by 1736, with a shorter nose being featured and the breed overall moving away from the one seen in earlier works by Anthony van Dyck during the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as <b>needlework</b> and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
5|$|Helena was {{the most}} {{active member of the}} royal family, {{carrying}} out an extensive programme of royal engagements at a time when royalty was not expected to appear often in public. She was also an active patron of charities, {{and was one of the}} founding members of the British Red Cross. She was founding president of the Royal School of <b>Needlework,</b> and president of the Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association and the Royal British Nurses' Association. As president of the latter, she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale. She became the first member of her family to celebrate her 50th wedding anniversary in 1916, but her husband died a year later. Helena outlived him by six years, and died aged 77 at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923.|$|E
50|$|Lavant {{had to stay}} at her parents' {{home and}} {{occupied}} herself with painting, writing, reading, and <b>needleworks.</b> A protracted middle ear infection left a single-sided hearing impairment. In the early 1930s, she came down with a major depression, but also focused on painting and writing and offered a first novel to a Graz publishing house. The manuscript was finally rejected in 1932, whereafter Lavant completely destroyed her writing and in 1935 resorted to a Klagenfurt sanatorium. Her financial condition worsened, after her parents had died in quick succession in 1937 and 1938. Supported by her knitting and subsidised by her siblings, she married the painter and former landowner Josef Habernig, about 35 years her senior.|$|R
40|$|Vencil v. Valmont Industries, Inc. {{solidified}} {{an earlier}} 1991 Nebraska Supreme Court ruling that injuries resulting from repetitive work-related trauma must be compensated as accidents under the Nebraska Workers 2 ̆ 7 Compensation Act {{and may not}} be compensated as occupational diseases under the Act. This Note analyzes the significance of the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision and criticizes the court 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on the rule of Maxson v. Michael Todd 2 ̆ 6 Co., Inc. which the court has construed to mandate that such injuries may be compensated only as accidents. The Note begins by stating the critical facts of Vencil and outlining the majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions. A brief history of the Nebraska Workers 2 ̆ 7 Compensation Act is given, followed by the criteria an injured worker must meet in order to receive compensation for an accident or an occupational disease under the Act. The Note then criticizes the rationale of the majority and points out five problems with the majority 2 ̆ 7 s analysis. First, the majority opinion rests solely on a misinterpretation of its 1980 decision in Crosby v. American Stores. Second, the majority decision is irreconcilable with other prior Nebraska case law. Third, the ruling has the effect of removing recovery for conditions that meet the criteria for occupational disease under the Act; the court both misreads the legislative intent and also encroaches upon a legislative function. Fourth, the decision distances Nebraska from mainstream workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation law. Finally, the Note analyzes the recent Nebraska Supreme Court ruling in Schiup v. Auburn <b>Needleworks,</b> which vividly illustrates the problems created by the removal of recovery for occupational diseases from the Nebraska Workers 2 ̆ 7 Compensation Act. The Note concludes that the decision reached by the court is unwarranted and will have an adverse effect on injured parties who have colorable claims for compensation due to occupational diseases under the Act by forcing the injured employees to seek recovery as accidents for what are properly characterized as occupational diseases...|$|R

5|$|Police {{arrived at}} the embassy almost {{immediately}} after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Dellow arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the Royal School of <b>Needlework</b> further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of D11, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, and officers with specialist surveillance equipment. Police negotiators made contact with Oan via a field telephone passed {{through one of the}} embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA's first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Khūzestān, and threatened to blow up the embassy and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.|$|E
5|$|Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona {{concluded}} a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen's role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important political decisions {{continued to be}} made by the much older and more experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, <b>needlework</b> and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London.|$|E
5|$|US113Business {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US113 (Worcester Highway) south of Snow Hill. The business route heads northeast as two-lane Market Street {{into the town}} limits and to the downtown area. US113Business passes near the neoclassical home Chanceford and by the Julia A.
