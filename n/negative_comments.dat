5|$|Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) call Angela's husband Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{to inform}} {{him that the}} {{documentary}} will probably out him and reveal that Angela slept with Dwight. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) becomes obsessed with online comments regarding his brief appearance in the promo, posting lengthy replies and even uploading his own video in response to negative reactions. The documentary crew discovers that Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has left {{at least some of}} the <b>negative</b> <b>comments,</b> taking pleasure in Andy's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Following this success, Jackson {{began to}} direct several {{personal}} insults at Silva, {{a gesture that}} infuriated the champion. Silva {{was in the midst}} of what would be a 17-fight unbeaten streak. He captured the championship from Sakuraba at Pride 17, and defeated him a total of three times. Jackson continued his <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> towards the champion, and directed his latest insult at Silva's training camp at the time, the Chute Boxe Academy.|$|E

Important theoretical and practical issues concerning the blogosphere are being addressed; do anonymity/pseudonimity within the blogosphere favour the <b>negative</b> <b>commenting</b> of individuals, especially or the protagonists in the public sphere? What are the indices of such <b>negative</b> <b>commenting</b> discourse? Which kinds of blogs {{are more likely to}} favour <b>negative</b> <b>commenting?</b> Do their authors provide evidence or other documentation...|$|R

5|$|In Japan, the Black Cat manga {{sold over}} 12 million copies, while in North America several volumes have been {{featured}} in weekly top ten lists of best-selling manga. The anime has also been popular in both Japan and North America. Manga and anime critics had praise for Black Cat action, differing views on the artwork and characters, and mainly <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> for its plot which {{has been criticized for}} having common shōnen manga elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{reviewed}} positively {{at the time}} of its release and subsequent reviews have remained highly favorable. <b>Negative</b> <b>comments</b> have concentrated on differences in playing style among the three musicians, brought about by the generational gap between Ellington and the others, and an argument that led to Mingus leaving the studio mid-session. Hundreds of musicians have been influenced by the recording, in particular by the freedom of individual expression within a small-group setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the main plot was {{inspired}} by a scene from the novel Sometimes a Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as he thought he was being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E

40|$|Despite of {{the fact}} that word-of-mouth {{phenomenon}} gained unseen dimensions, only few studies have focusedon its measurement and only three of them developed a word-of-mouth construct. Our study develops a bi-dimensionalscale which assigns usual word-of-mouth mechanisms available in online networking sites (eg: Recommend, Share,Like, Comment) into the WOM (+) - positive word-of-mouth valence dimension - respectively into the WOM (-) -negative word-of-mouth valence dimension. We adapted e-WOM construct developed by Goyette et al. (2010), and weobtained a word-of-mouth propensity scale, whose items include the usual online mechanisms. Our scale measuresword-of-mouth propensity on 6 items grouped in 2 dimensions: positive word-of-mouth (index: Recommend, Share,Like) and negative word-of-mouth (index: <b>negative</b> <b>Comment,</b> Share <b>negative</b> <b>comment,</b> Like <b>negative</b> <b>comment).</b> Scalewas tested along two studies, a German sampled one and a Romanian sampled other, highlighting adaptations tocultural specifics. High reliability was found in both studies. Providing an instrument that would easily work as acommon denominator between theory and practice, present paper contributes to the dissemination of research findingsinto the business and managerial area...|$|R
5|$|In August 2011, the Glazers were {{believed}} to have approached Credit Suisse {{in preparation for a}} $1billion (approx. £600million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2billion. However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.|$|E
5|$|Persona began {{development}} {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with the idea of creating a subseries around the positively received high school setting of If.... Multiple staff members from previous Megami Tensei titles were involved in development, including character designer Kazuma Kaneko, and director Kouji Okada. Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game has generally been positive, with most praising its approach to the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized. Its PSP port shared most points of praise with the original, along with the improved localization, but also drew <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> for its by-then dated mechanics and graphics.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} began as Zolciak {{was in the}} middle of her first {{pregnancy}} by her boyfriend Biermann; she later gave birth to their son. Leakes continued divorce proceedings with Gregg, while Whitfield found herself in financial difficulties after her ex-husband failed to pay child support. Meanwhile, Bailey opened her own modeling agency, while Parks looked to launch a family-operated funeral home. Leakes's new friendship with Hampton caused tension between all of the women, which escalated during a group vacation in South Africa; while Zolciak, who had remained home with her children, became upset by <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> Bailey (not Burruss) made about her during the group vacation. As the season closed, Leakes began to reconsider her divorce from Gregg.|$|E

50|$|Reviews of {{the album}} were <b>negative,</b> <b>commenting</b> on a lack of energy, formulaic songwriting, and {{indifferent}} sound. The album reached #5 on the Billboard 200 albums chart based on their previous popularity. The record had been highly anticipated a year earlier, but now the Allmans' moment was passing.|$|R
5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 {{of a decision}} on plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} was interpreted as an attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> about homosexuality.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, the {{university}} barred {{a student from}} participation in the 2011 commencement exercises because of a <b>negative</b> <b>comment</b> he had made on the College's Facebook page.

5|$|The 3rd Birthday {{was created}} as a {{conceptual}} rebirth for Aya's character, {{as well as a}} means of re-introducing her to the gaming community, with it being over a decade since the last game in the series. Among the staff were Hajime Tabata, Yoshinori Kitase, Motomu Toriyama, Isamu Kamikokuryo, and Aya's original designer Tetsuya Nomura. Originally announced as an episodic title for mobile phones, the game was later changed into a PSP exclusive. Upon release, the game reached sixth place in Japanese sales charts, and was among the top five games in North American and UK sales charts during its opening months. Reviews have been mixed; critics praised the presentation and several parts of the gameplay, while opinions were mixed about the story, and many cited difficulties with camera control and some of the shooter mechanics. Several reviewers have also made <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> on Aya's portrayal.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{generated}} several controversies {{related to its}} violence and depiction of women. A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers, who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste. The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups. The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women, particularly {{in the wake of}} backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit when she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review. After Petit's review webpage received more than 20,000 largely <b>negative</b> <b>comments,</b> many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses. Their lawsuits were later dismissed. Australian department store Target pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition against depictions of violence towards women in the game.|$|E

50|$|In July 2014, the Scottish Government {{issued an}} Expert Scientific Panel Report on Unconventional Oil & Gas which {{investigated}} the technical, and environmental challenges of this technology. After the third {{reading of the}} Infrastructure bill in January 2015, Scotland imposed a moratorium, pending another environmental review. This prompted <b>negative</b> <b>comment</b> from the original report authors.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{attracted}} <b>negative</b> <b>comment</b> from {{politicians in}} Washington, where Senator Thomas Dodd led a Congressional Committee into violence on television.

50|$|The {{stallion}} again had {{an impressive}} qualifier test at the 2005 World Championships, winning it yet again. The judges commented on his elasticity, suppleness, and engagement. His trot was bouncy, and his collected and extended walk work was considered excellent.

25|$|Another {{area which}} has been commented on {{is the role of}} the Kyoto {{flexibility}} mechanisms – emissions trading, Joint Implementation, and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The flexibility mechanisms have attracted both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>comments.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March 2007 a {{documentary}} series consisting of four one-hour episodes aired on SVT, chronicling Persson's time in office. The documentary became controversial due to Persson's <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> about both his party members and staff and against his political opponents.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, the Swiss TV Council {{announced}} that they had chosen BoBo out of over 200 applicants to represent Switzerland in Helsinki. The council earned some <b>negative</b> <b>comments</b> for the selection as not having been fair towards lesser known Swiss artists.|$|E

5000|$|Once the {{controversy}} {{surfaced in the}} media, The Whole Pantry began removing any comments made on its (since deleted) Facebook page that questioned the now suspect health and charitable claims that Gibson and the company had made, asserting that these comments only added to [...] "the misinformation" [...] of the initial Fairfax Media article. This selective deletion drew even more <b>negative</b> <b>comment.</b>|$|R
50|$|As pope his {{nationalism}} was {{a driving}} force; {{he used the}} office to preserve some liberties {{in the face of}} fourfold foreign occupation. Like Pope Paul III, he was an enemy of the Colonna family. His treatment of Giovanna d'Aragona, who had married into that family, drew further <b>negative</b> <b>comment</b> from Venice. This because she had long been a patron of artists and writers.|$|R
