40|$|Abstract: When {{wireless}} channels undergo fast fading, non-coherent {{frequency shift}} keying (FSK) (de) modulation schemes may be considered for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative com-munications. In this paper, we derive the bit-error-rate perfor-mance of partial <b>non-coherent</b> <b>receiver</b> as a lower bound of the optimal <b>non-coherent</b> <b>receiver</b> for FSK modulated AF cooperative communications. From the simulation and analytical results, {{it is found that}} the derived lower bound is very closed to simulation results. This result shows that knowing partial channel state infor-mation may not improve system performance significantly. On the other hand, conventional optimal <b>non-coherent</b> <b>receiver</b> involves complicated integration operation. To address the above complex-ity issue, we also propose a near optimal <b>non-coherent</b> <b>receiver</b> which does not involve integration operation. Simulation results have shown that the performance gap between the proposed near optimal receiver and the optimal receiver is small.

The receiver is derived using the generalized likelihood ratio test to eliminate dependence on the channel gains, applies to M-ary orthogonal signal sets, and is independent of the fading distribution.

40|$|Abstract—Network coding {{has been}} widely used in the {{wireless}} uplink. To do coherent detection at the receiver, channel estimation is performed to collect the channel state information (CSI). For multi-user channels, the channel estimation overhead is sometimes formidable and may even outweigh the network coding gain. To address this issue, we study the non-coherent network coding in this work. Both the analog network coding (ANC) and digital network coding (DNC) are studied. Depending on the available CSI, we first develop the coherent and <b>non-coherent</b> maximum likelihood <b>receivers.</b> For ANC, as the <b>non-coherent</b> <b>receivers</b> have no closed form, we develop two suboptimum receivers according to the average link qualities. Next we study the error rates, and show that full diversity can always be achieved at extremely high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) regardless of the CSI assumptions. However, the lack of perfect CSI would incur some diversity loss at modest SNRs. Besides, the performance loss of ANC is more serious due to the incapability to efficiently suppress multi-user interferences at the receivers. Extensive simulations are performed to verify our analytical results. Index Terms—Network coding, non-coherent modulations, diversity. I...|$|R

The simulation results show that in the UWB signal decomposed by wavelet transform, most of the signal energy is concentrated in the low-frequency band, while the energy of noise is evenly distributed over the entire frequency band. Therefore, this paper proposes a new threshold selection method based on wavelet decomposition and kurtosis analysis, that is, the UWB signal is decomposed by wavelet transform, the threshold is obtained based on the kurtosis of energy blocks of low-frequency wavelet coefficient, and then the first energy block exceeding the threshold is treated as the TOA of signal.

Yet, it has very critical drawbacks. First of all, noise-plus-interference uncertainty degrades the performance of the radiometer drastically [36]. In addition, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime leads to unsatisfactory results [37]. Combining these two issues, one could easily conclude that the radiometer performs poorly in detecting spread-spectrum signals [38]. Furthermore, it is clear that the performance of the radiometer is heavily dependent on the SNR/signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. For the sake of completeness, it is desirable to show how the performance of the radiometer is related to SNR.|$|E
