50|$|Ephedra {{was used}} 5000 {{years ago in}} China as a {{medicinal}} plant; its active ingredients are alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, <b>norephedrine</b> (phenylpropanolamine) and norpseudoephedrine (cathine).

50|$|The {{metabolites}} of cathinone, cathine and <b>norephedrine</b> also possess CNS stimulation, but create much weaker effects. The {{effects of}} cathinone {{on the body}} can be countered by a preceding administration of a dopamine-receptor antagonist.

5000|$|... 4-Methylaminorex {{exists as}} four {{stereoisomers}} - (±)-cis and (±)-trans. The (±)-cis isomers are the form used recreationally.The (±)-cis isomers (1:1-mixture) of the (4R,5S)-isomer generally synthesized from dl-phenylpropanolamine in one step by cyclization with cyanogen bromide (sometimes prepared in situ by reacting sodium cyanide with bromine). Alternate synthesis routes generally involve more steps, such as replacing cyanogen bromide with sodium or potassium cyanate {{to form an}} intermediate and then reacting it with concentrated hydrochloric acid. A method reported in microgram replaced {{the need for a}} separate addition of hydrochloric acid by starting with the hydrochloride salt of the dl-phenylpropanolamine but side-products are noted. The (±)-trans isomers (1:1-mixture) of the (4S,5S)-isomer are synthesized in the same manner above but dl-norephedrine is used as the starting material instead. The cyanate reaction proceeds differently from the cyanogen bromide and transforms <b>norephedrine</b> into trans-4-methylaminorex instead, as noted in the DEA micrograph. The cyanogen bromide, by comparison, transformed <b>norephedrine</b> into the cis isomer and norpseudoephedrine into the trans isomers of the final product.|$|E

5000|$|The {{synthesis}} of cathinone in khat begins with L-phenylalanine {{and the first}} step is carried out by L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), which cleaves off an ammonia group and creates a carbon-carbon double bond,forming cinnamic acid. [...] After this, the molecule can either go through a beta-oxidative pathway or a non-beta-oxidative pathway. The beta-oxidative pathway produces benzoyl-CoA while the non-beta-oxidative pathway produces benzoic acid. [...] Both of these molecules can be converted to 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione by a condensation reaction catalyzed by a ThDP-dependent enzyme (Thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme) with pyruvate and producing CO2. [...] 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione goes though a transaminase reaction to replace a ketone with an ammonia group to form (S)-cathinone. (S)-Cathinone can then undergo a reduction reaction to produce the less potent but structurally similar cathine or <b>norephedrine,</b> which are also found in the plant.|$|E
50|$|Earliest uses of Ephedra spp. (mahuang) for {{specific}} illnesses {{date back to}} 5000 BC. Ephedrine and isomers were already isolated in 1881 from Ephedra dystachia and characterized by the Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi of the 19th century. His work to access Ephedra drug materials to isolate a pure pharmaceutical substance, and the systematic production of semi-synthetic derivatives thereof is relevant still today as the three species Ephedra sinica, Ephedra vulgaris {{and to a lesser}} extent Ephedra equisetina are commercially grown in Mainland China as a source for natural ephedrines and isomers for use in pharmacy. E. sinica and E. vulgaris usually carry six optically active phenylethylamines, mostly ephedrine and pseudoephedrine with minor amounts of <b>norephedrine,</b> norpseudoephedrine as well as the three methylated analogs. Reliable information on the total alkaloid content of the crude drug is difficult to obtain. Based on HPLC analyses in industrial settings, the concentrations of total alkaloids in dried Herba Ephedra ranged between 1 and 4%, and in some cases up to 6%.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stimulant}} {{effect of}} the plant was originally attributed to [...] "katin", cathine, a phenethylamine-type substance isolated from the plant. However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than cathine. In 1975, the related alkaloid cathinone was isolated, and its absolute configuration was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and <b>norephedrine.</b> These chemicals belong to the PPA (phenylpropanolamine) family, {{a subset of the}} phenethylamines related to amphetamines and the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine. Khat is sometimes confused with methcathinone (also known as cat), a Schedule I substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component. However, both the side effects and the addictive properties of methcathinone are much stronger than those associated with khat use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} of cathinone {{is very similar}} to that of other molecules. By reducing the ketone, it becomes cathine if it retains its stereochemistry, or <b>norephedrine</b> if its stereochemistry is inverted. Cathine is a less potent version of cathinone and cathinone's spontaneous reduction is the reason that older khat plants are not as stimulating and younger ones. Cathinone and amphetamine are closely related in that amphetamine is only lacking the ketone C=O group. [...] Cathinone is structurally related to methcathinone, {{in much the same way}} as amphetamine is related to methamphetamine. Cathinone differs from amphetamine by possessing a ketone oxygen atom (C=O) on the β (beta) position of the side chain. The corresponding alcohol, cathine, is a less powerful stimulant. The biophysiological conversion from cathinone to cathine is to blame for the depotentiation of khat leaves over time. Fresh leaves have a greater ratio of cathinone to cathine than dried ones, therefore having more psychoactive effects.|$|E

40|$|Background: Amphetamine and {{amphetamine}} derivatives {{are suggested}} to induce an immunosuppressive effect. However, {{knowledge of how}} amphetamines modulate intracellular signaling pathways in cells {{of the immune system}} is limited. We have studied phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins (Akt, CREB, ERK 1 / 2, NF-κB, c-Cbl, STAT 1 / 3 / 5 / 6) and stress sensors (p 38 MAPK, p 53) in human leukocyte subsets following in vitro treatment with the natural amphetamine cathinone, the cathinone derivatives cathine and <b>norephedrine,</b> in comparison with a defined extract of the psychostimulating herb khat (Catha edulis Forsk.). Intracellular protein modifications in single cells were studied using immunostaining and flow cytometry, cell viability was determined by Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide staining, and T-lymphocyte proliferation was measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation. Results: Cathinone, cathine and <b>norephedrine</b> generally reduced post-translational modifications of intracellular signal transducers in T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes, most prominently affecting c-Cbl (pTyr 700), ERK 1 / 2 (p-Thr 202 /p-Tyr 204), p 38 MAPK (p-Thr 180 /p-Tyr 182) and p 53 (both total p 53 protein and p- Ser 15). In contrast, the botanical khat-extract induced protein phosphorylation of STAT 1 (p-Tyr 701), STAT 6 (p- Tyr 641), c-Cbl (pTyr 700), ERK 1 / 2 (p-Thr 202 /p-Tyr 204), NF-κB (p-Ser 529), Akt (p-Ser 473), p 38 MAPK (p-Thr 180 /p- Tyr 182), p 53 (Ser 15) as well as total p 53 protein. Cathinone, cathine and <b>norephedrine</b> resulted in unique signaling profiles, with B-lymphocytes and natural killer cells more responsive compared to T-lymphocytes and monocytes. Treatment with <b>norephedrine</b> resulted in significantly increased T-lymphocyte proliferation, whereas khat-extract reduced proliferation and induced cell death. Conclusions: Single-cell signal transduction analyses of leukocytes distinctively discriminated between stimulation with cathinone and the structurally similar derivatives cathine and <b>norephedrine.</b> Cathinone, cathine and <b>norephedrine</b> reduced phosphorylation of c-Cbl, ERK 1 / 2, p 38 MAPK and p 53 (Ser 15), and <b>norephedrine</b> induced Tlymphocyte proliferation. Khat-extract induced protein phosphorylation of signal transducers, p 38 MAPK and p 53, followed by reduced cell proliferation and cell death. This study suggests that protein modification-specific singlecell analysis of immune cells could unravel pharmacologic effects of amphetamines and amphetamine-like agents, and further could represent a valuable tool in elucidation of mechanism(s) of action of complex botanical extracts. </p...|$|E

40|$|In many industries, a {{regulator}} designs {{an auction}} to select ex-ante the firms that compete ex-post {{on the product}} market. This paper considers the optimal market structure when firms incur sunk costs before entering the market and when {{the government is not}} able to regulate firms in the market. We prove that a free entry equilibrium results in an excessive entry when the entry costs are private information. Then, we consider an auction mechanism selecting the firms allowed to serve the market and show that the optimal number of licences results in the socially optimal market structure. When all the potential candidates are actual bidders, the optimal number of firms in the market increases with the number of candidates and decreases with the social cost of public funds. When the market size is small, as the net profit in the market decreases with the number of selected firms, entry is endogenous. As increasing competition in the market reduces competition for the market, the optimal structure is more concentrated than in the previous case.

Haller, C. A. Benowitz, N. L. Verotta, D. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2005 - 03 British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 593335 - 45 <![CDATA[AIM: The combination of ephedrine and caffeine has been used in herbal products for weight loss and athletic performance-enhancement, but the pharmacokinetic profiles of these compounds have not been well characterized. This study aimed to develop a mechanistic model describing ephedrine, <b>norephedrine,</b> and caffeine pharmacokinetics and their interactions in healthy subjects. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic model was developed based on the simultaneous modelling using plasma samples gathered from two clinical trials. The treatments consisted of single-doses of pharmaceutical caffeine and ephedrine, given alone or together, and an herbal formulation containing both caffeine and ephedrine. We used a mixed-effect statistical model and the program NONMEM to take account of intersubject variability. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-nine ephedrine, 352 <b>norephedrine,</b> 417 caffeine plasma concentrations and 40 ephedrine urine concentrations were obtained from 24 subjects. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption described the caffeine data. Caffeine clearance was 0. 083 l min(- 1) (CV 38 %) and decreased to 0. 038 l min(- 1) in presence of oral contraceptive therapy, its volume of distribution was 38. 6 l (CV 20 %) and its absorption rate constant was 0. 064 l min(- 1) (CV 50 %). A four-compartment model described the pharmocokinetics of ephedrine and <b>norephedrine.</b> Ephedrine was eliminated mostly renally, with a clearance of 0. 34 l min(- 1) (CV 11 %), and a volume of distribution of 181 l (CV 19 %). Nonlinearity in the conversion of ephedrine to <b>norephedrine</b> was observed. Different models showed that the simultaneous administration of caffeine, or the amount of caffeine in the absorption compartment, was associated with a slower rate of absorption of ephedrine. A 32 % greater relative bioavailability of herbal compared with pharmaceutical ephedrine administration was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a mechanistic model for ephedrine, <b>norephedrine</b> and caffeine pharmacokinetics and their interactions. The relative bioavailability of ephedrine differed between the herbal supplement compared with the pharmaceutical formulation. Concomitant ingestion of caffeine slowed the absorption rate of ephedrine, which is mainly related to the amount of the former in the absorption compartment.
