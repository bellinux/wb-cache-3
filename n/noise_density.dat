30|$|Some methods only employ {{filtering}} {{without the}} detection of impulse noise whereas certain other methods first employ {{the detection of}} the impulse noise followed by the filtering. Over the past two decades, performance of the nonlinear filters particularly the two-stage median-based filters has improved multifold for the images corrupted by RVIN [1]. The existing state-of-the-art methods have attempted to remove the RVIN in images but are successful only at lower <b>noise</b> <b>densities.</b> At higher <b>noise</b> <b>densities</b> of RVIN, the image restoration by these methods is not satisfactory. Hence, various applications {{which are based on}} image denoising like medical imaging, face recognition, satellite imaging, and fisheries are rendered ineffective. The main focus areas of this research are quality image restoration at higher <b>noise</b> <b>densities</b> of RVIN and achievement of lower computational cost of the proposed detection and filtering technique.|$|R

5000|$|The {{statistics}} {{of the variation}} in threshold voltage of matched pairs across a wafer have been studied extensively. The standard deviation of the threshold voltage variation depends on the absolute size of the devices, the minimum feature size of the manufacturing process, and the body voltage and is typically 1 to 3 millivolts. Therefore to keep the contribution of the threshold voltage term in equation (9) to a percent or less requires biasing the transistors with the gate-source voltage exceeding the threshold by several tenths of a volt. This has the subsidiary effect of lowering the contribution of the mirror transistors to the output current noise because the drain current <b>noise</b> <b>density</b> in a MOSFET is proportional to the transconductance and therefore inversely proportional to [...]|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} based on noise {{signature}} is presented for effective removal of random-valued impulse noise in images. It {{is extremely difficult}} to restore images corrupted with very high <b>noise</b> <b>densities.</b> Most of the existing algorithms provide good results only up to low <b>noise</b> <b>densities.</b> Some of them use predefined thresholds for detection which may not be effective in case of randomly picked up images at higher <b>noise</b> <b>densities.</b> In contrast, the proposed noise signature-based triple threshold statistical detection method promises better results in the case of highly corrupted random images too. This is possible because it does not use any predefined threshold values. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this method in removing high <b>density</b> random-valued impulse <b>noise</b> while preserving image details. The proposed method is able to suppress up to 80 % of noise with a considerable level of satisfaction due to effective use of noise signature. Further, the results reveal that the method performs better than the existing state-of-the-art filtering approaches. Thus, the proposed triple threshold statistical detection method is an adaptive filtering approach which can be considered as a high-performance method in its class.|$|R

Similarly, ROAD [25] {{is also good}} only up to 50 % <b>noise</b> <b>density</b> beyond which miss detection is very high. The performance of ROLD [23] is better {{than that of the}} ROAD because it uses the logarithmic difference for detection, but after 60 % <b>noise</b> <b>density,</b> it also does not provide good results. TBLI [19] detection algorithm is based on triangle-based linear interpolation which is used to detect noisy and noise-free pixels. TBLI [19] is also good only up to 60 % <b>noise</b> <b>density</b> beyond which miss detection increases and picture quality worsens. In ASM’s detection stage, noisy pixels are detected using the absolute deviation between the mean value and the CP which is then compared with threshold value.
