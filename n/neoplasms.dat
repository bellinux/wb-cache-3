40|$|Pancreatic cystic <b>neoplasm</b> is a {{relatively}} rare potential <b>neoplasm</b> in clinical practice and has a low-grade malignancy. Pancreatic cystic <b>neoplasm</b> is classified as serous cystic <b>neoplasm,</b> mucinous cystic <b>neoplasm,</b> intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm,</b> and solid pseudopapillary <b>neoplasm.</b> Due to its complex pathological type and the deep location of the pancreas, patients often lack typical clinical symptoms and signs, which may easily lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. This article introduces the classification of pancreatic cystic <b>neoplasm</b> and research advances in serological examinations, cyst puncture and aspiration, and imaging examinations in the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic <b>neoplasm</b> and points out a combination of various examinations can improve the rate of confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cystic <b>neoplasm...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cystic lesions of the {{pancreas}} are increasingly recognized. While some lesions show benign behaviour (serous cystic <b>neoplasm),</b> others have an unequivocal malignant potential (mucinous cystic <b>neoplasm,</b> branch- and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm</b> and solid pseudo-papillary <b>neoplasm).</b> European expert pancreatologists provide updated recommendations: diagnostic computerized tomography and/or {{magnetic resonance imaging}} are indicated in all patients with cystic lesion of {{the pancreas}}. Endoscopic ultrasound with cyst fluid analysis may be used {{but there is no}} evidence to suggest this as a routine diagnostic method. The role of pancreatoscopy remains to be established. Resection should be considered in all symptomatic lesions, in mucinous cystic <b>neoplasm,</b> main duct intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm</b> and solid pseudo-papillary <b>neoplasm</b> as well as in branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm</b> with mural nodules, dilated main pancreatic duct > 6 mm and possibly if rapidly increasing in size. An oncological partial resection should be performed in main duct intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm</b> and in lesions with a suspicion of malignancy, otherwise organ preserving procedures may be considered. Frozen section of the transection margin in intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm</b> is suggested. Follow up after resection is recommended for intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm,</b> solid pseudo-papillary <b>neoplasm</b> and invasive cancer. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous cystic <b>neoplasms</b> (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they {{can usually be}} successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, <b>neoplasms</b> of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Pancreatic mucinous cystic <b>neoplasms</b> are a broad {{group of}} {{pancreas}} tumors that have varying malignant potential.

5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous <b>neoplasms</b> (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E

40|$|Within {{a cohort}} of 1, 915 {{consecutive}} patients with myeloproliferative <b>neoplasm</b> followed for a median time of 5. 2 years (range 0 - 33. 3), we investigated the occurrence of lymphoid <b>neoplasm</b> {{with the aim of}} defining this risk and to investigate the role of genetic predisposing factors.

We found that the risk of developing lymphoid <b>neoplasm</b> was 2. 79 -fold higher (95 % CI, 1. 80 - 4. 33; P< 0. 001) than that of the general Italian population. A tag SNP surrogate for JAK 2 GGCC haplotype was used to clarify a potential correlation between lymphoid-myeloid <b>neoplasm</b> occurrence and this genetic predisposing factor. As we did not find any difference in GGCC haplotype frequency between patients with both myeloid and lymphoid <b>neoplasm</b> and patients with myeloid <b>neoplasm,</b> JAK 2 GGCC haplotype should not be considered a genetic predisposing factor.

5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and <b>neoplasms,</b> but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, <b>neoplasms</b> and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and <b>neoplasms</b> of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E

40|$|A 69 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our hospital after incidental identification of a pancreatic mass during follow-up for diabetes mellitus. Various imaging examinations showed a tumor in the main pancreatic duct, without apparent hypersecretion of mucin. Brush cytologic examination revealed class V disease (adenocarcinoma). Because preoperative examination suggested an intraductal <b>neoplasm</b> with associated invasive cancer, total pancreatectomy was performed. Histological examination, based on current World Health Organization classifications, suggested a diagnosis of intraductal tubulopapillary <b>neoplasm.</b> A small cystic lesion adjacent to the intraductal tubulopapillary <b>neoplasm</b> was incidentally diagnosed as serous cystadenoma. The patient has remained well without recurrence as of 24 months postoperatively. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the intraductal tubulopapillary <b>neoplasm</b> suggested ductal cell carcinoma of the pancreas rather than intraductal papillary mucinous <b>neoplasm.</b> Distinguishing intraductal tubulopapillary <b>neoplasm</b> from ductal cell carcinoma is clinically important, as intraductal tubulopapillary <b>neoplasm</b> has a favorable prognosis after curative resection...|$|R

Other diseases in this category are juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, atypical CML; BCR-ABL1 negative and MDS/MPD unclassifiable.
