40|$|Theory {{suggests}} {{that government should}} {{as far as possible}} smooth taxes and its recurrent consumption spending, which means that government debt should act as a shock absorber, and any planned adjustments in debt should be gradual. This {{suggests that}} operational targets for governments (e. g. for 5 years ahead) should involve deficits rather than debt, because such rules will be more robust to shocks. Beyond that, fiscal rules need to reflect the constraints on monetary policy, {{and the extent to which}} governments are subject to deficit bias. Fiscal rules for countries in a monetary union or fixed exchange rate regime need to include a strong countercyclical element. Fiscal rules should also contain a ‘knock out’ if interest rates hit the zero lower bound: in that case the fiscal and monetary authorities should cooperate to formulate a fiscal expansion package that allows interest rates to rise above this bound. In more normal times, the design of fiscal policy rules is likely to depend on the extent to which governments are subject to deficit bias, and the effectiveness of any <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>council.</b> For example, governments that had not shown a history of deficit bias could aim to target deficits five years ahead (rolling targets), and these would not require cyclical adjustment. In contrast, governments that were more prone to bias could target a cyclically adjusted deficit at the end of their expected period of office. In both cases fiscal councils would have an important role to play, in ensuring plans were implemented in the first case and allowing for departures from target when external shocks occurred in the second...|$|E

40|$|Under {{the impact}} of the global {{economic}} crisis, the contemporary budget systems have been subject to extensive reforms. There is a growing number of scholars advocating the establishment of fully independent fiscal institutions which would be in charge of administering a sustainable fiscal policy. The bodies available in hitherto practice are <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils,</b> parliament committees on budgetary control or fiscal 'watchdogs'. The institutionalization of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> should provide for improving the quality of the public debate on fiscal policy and make the governments more fiscally accountable. The existing <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> generally have an advisory role and they are expected to contribute to strengthening the role of national parliaments in scrutinizing the national budget. In fact, the establishment of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> ensues only after introducing the fiscal rules which serve as statutory limitations on the activities of the executive branch in the budget-related matters. The current economic crisis has substantially hindered the efficient application of these fiscal restrictions. Some states see the solution in establishing independent fiscal institutions which would control the compliance with these rules. As one {{of the participants in the}} budgetary process, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> are in a position to provide better information to the voters on the current state of affairs in public finances and (thus) increase the political costs of the government's fiscal unaccountability. In practice, there are several models for the organization of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> which primarily focus on ex ante or ex post review and assessment concerning whether the relevant institutions have observed the fiscal rules and accomplished the fiscal goals. Considering that their role is to eliminate the asymmetry of information in relations between the legislative and executive breach of government, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> should contribute to reinforcing the legitimacy of the budgetary process and strengthening the fiscal discipline. In the new European fiscal governance framework, these institutions become particularly important in the context of mending the consequences of the current economic crisis. In their hitherto activities, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> have encountered some difficulties: their competences have been challenged, their assessment and recommendations have been disregarded, and their financial resources (aimed at promoting their activities) have been significantly restricted. Relying on this analysis, we may conclude that the independence and responsibility of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> largely depends on the government's resolve to be fully accountable in administering a sustainable fiscal policy...|$|R

The proxies of earnings quality used are: relevance of accounting information, timeliness, and conditional conservatism. The sample consists of Brazilian companies listed on the Brazilian Securities, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) with annual liquidity above 0. 001 within the period from 2010 to 2013. Data were collected from the database Comdinheiro and the Reference Forms of companies available on the website of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) or the BM&FBOVESPA. The samples used in the study totaled 718, 688, and 722 observations for the value relevance, timeliness, and conditional conservatism models, respectively. The results indicate that different arrangements of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>council</b> and the existence of the audit committee differently impact the accounting information properties.

40|$|Conclusion] The {{overall picture}} of {{the current status of}} {{implementation}} of the <b>Fiscal</b> Compact into <b>national</b> law is rather ambiguous. On the one side, there are countries like Spain and Portugal, which have been severely affected by the Euro crisis, and appeared to have learned a lesson and implemented promising and strong fiscal rules. On the other side, it is worrisome that Greece, of all countries, has not put forward any draft bill so far and failed to meet the deadlines set by the MoU. The overall picture is also somewhat ambiguous because many countries have not anchored their budget rules into their constitution, but rely on simple laws instead. While the vast majority of countries have created the legal basis for the creation of an independent <b>fiscal</b> <b>council,</b> only some have already appointed the members. There seems to be a general tendency towards staffing the councils with members who are rather not involved in politics but are academic economists, and in some cases even are recruited from other countries. This finding fuels the expectation that the <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> are not only de jure but also de facto independent in their work. However, one also has to note that the appointing process for <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> is still a much politicized procedure, with the parliament and the government being the key players. Thus, the question to what extent the independence of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> will also be ensured in the long run, remains unanswered for the moment. In some countries the independence is not institutionally secured, for instance, by explicitly prohibiting the appointment of active (or recently active) politicians for the <b>fiscal</b> <b>council...</b>|$|R

A dynamic model of fiscal policy shows that optimal institutions lack credibility unless the costs to bypass them are sufficiently high.

Under incomplete budgetary transparency, accountable governments may also use institutions as a signal of competence to increase their reelection chances, which in turn erodes the penchant for excessive deficits.
