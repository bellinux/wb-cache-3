5|$|In conclusion, {{the insistence}} of ahimsa is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about non-injury to others {{as it is about}} non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.|$|E
5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for buying things, but {{to interact with the}} people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the Thirteen Colonies, which retained an adherence to English common law, but it directly affected {{the relationship between}} Britain and the colonies. When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{dress is}} {{required}} for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held amongst the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum. This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote on <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow. In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.|$|E

5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{from a lack of}} interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{deal with the}} crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff. Unlike his predecessor, {{he was a}} competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, {{in spite of the}} ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four crematoria, a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to house people as to destroy them.|$|E

5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as in heavy draft breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> on the field of play as off it".|$|E
5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes {{had not yet been}} extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E

5|$|Bradman was on 89 {{and heading}} towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time {{courtesy}} of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's leg cutter moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times {{so far in the}} Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over square leg into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 {{at the end of the}} third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> a sign of an English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.|$|E
5|$|During the Contact period, it {{is known}} that certain {{military}} positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialized knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances. Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.|$|E
5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, Chandler focused his {{attacks on the}} Combs {{administration}} rather than the inexperienced Breathitt. A seasoned campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had {{voted in favor of}} declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter. He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not. Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried {{all but one of the}} state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> a result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler. This campaign ended Chandler's political career.|$|E
