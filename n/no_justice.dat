Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, {{there has been}} <b>no</b> <b>justice</b> for known victims.

25|$|According {{to federal}} statute, the Court {{normally}} {{consists of the}} Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed after impeachment (though <b>no</b> <b>justice</b> has ever been removed). In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. Each justice has one vote, and {{it is worth noting}} while a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously, decisions in cases of the highest profile have come down to just one single vote, thereby exposing the justices' ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories. The Court meets in the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C.|$|E

500|$|When Horne {{found out}} that the 14th RWF had not moved and that their attack had been pushed back to 8 July, he summoned Ivor Philipps to Corps {{headquarters}} and sacked him. General Douglas Haig, commander of the BEF, noted this event in his diary. He wrote: [...] "visited HQ XV Corps and saw General Horne. He was very disappointed with the work of the... 38th Welsh Div". Haig further commented that Philipps was relieved of his command as the majority of the division had [...] "never entered" [...] the woods despite the [...] "most adequate... bombard", had suffered [...] "under 150 casualties" [...] during their attack and that: [...] "a few bold men [...] entered the Wood found little opposition". Historian Don Farr wrote that Haig's entries are at odds with the facts and that he relied heavily on what Horne had told him. Farr states that Horne's account to Haig was self-serving, did <b>no</b> <b>justice</b> [...] "to the difficulties confronting the troops on the ground", and did not acknowledge the failure of the bombardment. He also suggests that the sacking of Philipps may have been political, by a distrusting officer corps towards a perceived political appointee.|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off.

2500|$|In Galicia, Russophilia {{emerged as}} early as the 1830s, when [...] "Society of scholars" [...] was {{organized}} in Przemyśl and was stimulated in part by the presence in Lviv [...] in 1835 and from 1839–1840 of Russian pan-Slavist Mikhail Pogodin who became acquainted with the local Ruthenian intelligentsia and became an influence on them. However, the movement did not come to dominate western Ukrainian society until the 1850s–60s. [...] Many proponents of Ruthenianism became disenchanted with Austria and linked themselves with the giant and powerful Russian state. The relative rise of Russia's power in comparison to that of Austria during the 19th century also played a role in such feelings. [...] Events of the 1860s helped to increase pro-Russian feelings in Galicia. [...] Traditionally, the local Ruthenians had a naive belief that the Habsburg Emperor was on their side and that he would defend them against the Polish nobility. [...] From the late 1850s, Austrian courts often sided with (primarily Polish) nobles in land disputes with peasants, during which forests and pastures that the peasants had traditionally been using were deemed the property of the nobles. [...] This led to significant economic harship for the peasants. [...] While this was happening, the Russian tsar had emancipated the peasants in Russian-ruled Ukraine. [...] In 1863-1864, an insurrection of Polish nobles in areas that included Russian-ruled Ukraine was brutally crushed by the Tsarist government, which in punishing the Polish rebels provided the Ukrainian peasants with relatively favorable compensation. Many Galicians began to approvingly contrast the Tsar's brutal treatment of the Polish nobles with the Austrians' seemingly taking the Polish side in the Polish-Ukrainian conflict. [...] Many of them came to believe that the plight of the Ukrainians was improving more under the Tsars than it was under the Austrians. In the testimony of one Austrian-Ukrainian peasant, [...] "if there is <b>no</b> <b>justice</b> in Vienna, we will find it in the Moskal." ...|$|E
