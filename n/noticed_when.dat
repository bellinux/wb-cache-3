5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|A {{second car}} was {{entered in the}} 1977 German Grand Prix for German touring car racer Hans Heyer. Heyer failed to qualify, but famously took the start anyway {{in front of his}} home crowd at the Hockenheimring. The race organisers only <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> he retired with a broken gear linkage. Hans Binder would then take the second car {{for the rest of the}} season, though the team missed the final three races of the year.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the start}} of the AIDS epidemic, PCP has been closely {{associated}} with AIDS. Because it only occurs in an immunocompromised host, it may be the first clue to a new AIDS diagnosis if the patient has no other reason to be immunocompromised (e.g. taking immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant). An unusual {{rise in the number of}} PCP cases in North America, <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> physicians began requesting large quantities of the rarely used antibiotic pentamidine, was the first clue to the existence of AIDS in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Hamilcar {{noticed the}} walls were now undefended when the {{inhabitants}} flocked to the port and exploited this mistake. He sent his strongest troops to the walls with scaling ladders and climbed the walls without being <b>noticed.</b> <b>When</b> {{they were about to}} occupy the walls, they were spotted and attacked by Greek guards on patrol. The guards were quickly joined by other defenders, who arrived before the Carthaginian reinforcements. The Greeks got the upper hand and killed some of the attackers, who retreated. Hamilcar withdrew his army from the walls. Because he {{had not been able to}} take Syracuse that day, he decided to send 5000 soldiers to the aid of Carthage in response to the request of the messengers.|$|E
25|$|Frost's {{work began}} to be <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> he joined the de Havilland Aircraft Company (UK), {{builders}} of the famed Mosquito bomber and fighter. After joining the de Havilland firm in 1942, Frost {{had become one of}} the senior members of the design team working on the Hornet fighter, based on the Mosquito, for which he designed a unique flap design. Later, as one of the team of designers on the D.H.100 Vampire, he was responsible for the design of the original flaps, dive brakes and ailerons for this fighter. The Vampire was the second British jet fighter designed in the Second World War, but other than its powerplant and plywood construction patterned on the Mosquito, the diminutive fighter was mainly conventional in design.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few years}} playing for non-league Strimonikos Serron, Charisteas {{eventually}} started his professional career with Greek side Aris Thessaloniki. It was during his first season at Aris that Charisteas started making a name for himself, scoring twice in nine matches as they won the Greek second division in 1997–98. Charisteas started well {{in his first season}} in the Greek top league and got further <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> he scored twice in the local derby against Thessaloniki rivals PAOK. The striker made twelve appearances in the Alpha Ethniki – six as a substitute – before a loan at Athinaikos in 1998–99. He returned to Aris the following season and made his European debut in a UEFA Cup defeat by Celta de Vigo at the age of 19. Charisteas was continuously developing and in the 2000–01 season, where he scored seven goals.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} side-effect of Ethiopian Christianity {{was the way}} it intersected with {{a belief}} that had long prevailed in Europe of the existence of a Christian kingdom in the far east, whose monarch was known as Prester John. Originally thought to have been in the Orient, eventually the search for Prester John's mythical kingdom focused on Africa and particularly, the Christian empire in Ethiopia. This was first <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> Zara Yaqob sent delegates to the Council of Florence in order to establish ties with the papacy and Western Christianity. They were confused when they arrived and council prelates insisted on calling their monarch Prester John, trying to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, the delegates' admonitions did little to stop Europeans from referring to the monarch as their mythical Christian king, Prester John.|$|E
25|$|Fogg {{had thought}} it was one day more than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, {{the concept of a}} de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware {{that it would be a}} day less than it used to be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a de facto date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite the tips of his surroundings).|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{the final}} , Fogg {{had thought it}} was one day later than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact: during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. In fact, {{at the time and}} until 1884, the concept of a de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, in the real world, Fogg's mistake would not have occurred because a de facto date line did exist. The UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times. He would have <b>noticed,</b> <b>when</b> he arrived in San Francisco, that the local date was actually one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. As a consequence he could not fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were actually one day earlier than his personal travel diary.|$|E

500|$|The IPCC {{told reporters}} that the {{post-mortem}} showed no bruising or scratches on Tomlinson's head and shoulders. When the family asked the City of London police, after the post-mortem, whether there had been marks on Tomlinson's body, they were told no; according to The Guardian, Detective Superintendent Anthony Crampton, who was leading the investigation, wrote in his log {{that he did not}} tell the family about a bruise and puncture marks on Tomlinson's leg to avoid causing [...] "unnecessary stress or alarm." [...] On 5 April The Observer published the first photograph of Tomlinson lying on the ground next to riot police. After it was published, Freddy Patel was asked to return to the mortuary, where he made a note of bruising on Tomlinson's head that he had not <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> he first examined him. On 24 April Sky News obtained an image of Tomlinson after he collapsed, which showed bruising {{on the right side of}} his forehead.|$|E

500|$|Secret Service agents {{initially}} {{rushed to}} respond. Snipers scanned the South Lawn, {{looking for an}} assailant. A supervisor then decided that the noises were backfires from a nearby construction site and told the agents, [...] "No shots have been fired... stand down", {{to the surprise of}} several officers. According to Carol D. Leonnig, agents who thought the building had been fired upon [...] "were largely ignored", with one reporting she had been afraid to doubt her superior's assertion. By the end of the night, it was confirmed that a shooting had occurred, although the Secret Service believed that gunfire was not aimed at the White House, but rather {{was the result of a}} gang fight nearby. A Secret Service dispatcher called emergency services and gave incorrect descriptions of both vehicles and suspects; police were told to look for two black men on Rock Creek Parkway. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. The evidence was only <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> a housekeeper discovered broken glass and pieces of cement on the Truman Balcony around midday on November 15.|$|E

2500|$|Parents of {{children}} with AS can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age, although diagnosis is not made on average {{until the age of}} 11. [...] By definition, children with AS develop language and self-help skills on schedule, so early signs may not be apparent and the condition may not be diagnosed until later childhood or even old age. [...] Impairment in social interaction is sometimes not in evidence until a child attains an age at which these behaviors become important; social disabilities are often first <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> children encounter peers in daycare or preschool. [...] Diagnosis is most commonly made between the ages of four and eleven, and one study suggests that diagnosis cannot be rendered reliably before age four.|$|E
