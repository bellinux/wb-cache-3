In the season opener, his Ferrari replacement Sebastian Vettel had finished on the podium, whilst McLaren occupied the last row with huge difficulties with the performance of the car and the new engine package. In spite of this, Alonso stated at the aforementioned press conference that he had <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> <b>about</b> leaving Ferrari for McLaren, saying that he was no longer content with just podium finishes after 14 years in Formula One and therefore was prepared to take risks in order to win. In the race, Alonso failed to finish after overheating issues with his car's hybrid system. Notably, Vettel won the race, prompting Alonso to once again a couple of weeks later publicly defend his decision saying that it was 'difficult to keep the trust' amid Ferrari's attempts to persuade him the 2015 car was going to be a big improvement. He said that he would only suggest the move was a mistake should Ferrari actually win the title in November. Having been lapped and outside the points in the , Alonso suggested he was just happy to finish the race to gather information about the car.

Kozyavin was oblivious, {{that they were going}} to swipe the whole items in this building. However, Kozyavin touched one of the man's shoulder and asked the same question said before. Surprised, they attended with Kozyavin by giving the alleged right turn to Sidorov. Early next day he pursued the same direction. He entered a pipeline on ground, which curves were unrealistically smoothed by Kozyavinhimself. He jumped from the pipeline onto the ground and trod a drought veld. Convinced to meet with Sidorov, Kozyavin went throughout the veld, until he climbed up to a mountain. With a good sight, he watched everything around him. Unfortunately he didn't find anyone and continued to move forward. He arrived a desert and got a view to a giant skeleton of a prehistoric animal. Walking through the backbone like a stair, he sawed an archaeologist, who currently researched the skeleton, and asked him the common question. With no reply and <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> <b>about</b> the destroyed skeleton by the archaeologist, Kozyavin continued walking. A body of stagnant water didn't block him to accomplish the task the boss gave him, so Kozyavin swam, until he reached the Antarctica. Kozyavin walked around the world, until he arrived his office. Kozyavin didn't accomplish his boss' accomplishment to find Sidorov. Kozyavin answered it with a shrug and went back to his working room.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} parents' {{views on}} autopsy after treatment withdrawal.  DESIGN—Face to face interviews with 59 sets of bereaved parents (108 individual parents) for whose 62 babies {{there had been}} discussion of treatment withdrawal.  RESULTS—All except one couple were asked for permission for postmortem examination; 38 % refused. The main reasons for declining were concerns about disfigurement, a wish to have the child left in peace, and a feeling that an autopsy was unnecessary because the parents had no unanswered questions. The diagnosis, {{the age of the}} child, and the approach of the consultant appeared to influence consent rates. Of those who agreed to autopsies, 92 % were given the results by the neonatologist concerned. Whether or not they had agreed to the procedure, at 13 months <b>no</b> parent expressed <b>regrets</b> <b>about</b> their decision.  CONCLUSIONS—Autopsy rates in the East of Scotland stand at 62 %. Parents' perceptions are an important element in consent to postmortem examination. ...|$|R

500|$|On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro {{lost the}} general {{election}} in a landslide. They received only 41percent {{of the popular vote}} compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro's to congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and [...] "It's morning again in America" [...] were quite strong, while Mondale's liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic.
