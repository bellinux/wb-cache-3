40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical technique for the <b>noise</b> ground <b>footprint</b> prediction for given helicopter flight trajectory and conditions. The methodology adopted is a two-step procedure which calculates first the unsteady aerodynamics of the simultaneously turning main- and tail rotor. The aerodynamic code {{is based on}} a 3 -D unsteady panel method which simulates all motions of an articulated rotor and the relative motion between main- and tail rotor blades. The fuselage is not simulated. The unsteady pressure distribution on the main- and tail rotor blades serves as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings (FWH) -equation based code to define the acoustic pressure on a hemispherical "noise source" surface beneath the aircraft. A flight trajectory may consist of a number of flight segments such as take-off, level flight and descent. For each of these flight sequences, a separate noise source surface is generated. Knowing the flight trajectory and the flight condition, the relevant noise source surface is moved along the flight segment with the desired speed. The propagation of the noise on to the ground is treated as "free" propagation with consideration of atmospheric absorption and ground reflection. To generate the <b>noise</b> <b>footprints,</b> the overflown area is overlaid with a lattice of discrete points. With a step by step movement of the noise source surface along the flight trajectory, the perceived noise on the ground is obtained as a sound pressure level time history at each ground point which is processed to obtain the desired noise metric.

As a result, minimal demand in computational time becomes a major requirement and rules out CPU intense Computational Aeroacoustic methods. Instead, aircraft noise is estimated through semi-empirical source models. The implemented noise source models are parametric, meaning that the effects on noise of individual sources can be monitored throughout a simulated flight operation. In addition to common noise evaluation methods, new approaches are implemented in PANAM. The variation of noise levels versus time can be captured and animated.

40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} a growing social, technical, {{economic}} and environmental problem, especially in developing countries like South Africa. It arises from the growth in air traffic, urbanization, uncoordinated planning around airports, and open-window living that makes physical insulation an ineffective mitigating solution. Cape Town International airport is a typical South African example of the phenomenon. Air traffic volume is steadily increasing and an additional runway has been proposed for the airport's efficient operation. The changing noise pattern requires the demarcation of a 'noise-controlled area' around the airport as the planning framework that is legally prescribed to manage this type of environmental nuisance. This paper reports the application of geographic Information system (GIS) technology to define a control zone using various spatial demarcation techniques.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of aircraft trajectory management aimed at producing noise abatement procedures. Area Navigation (RNAV) concepts {{play an important role}} in the design of flexible and, therefore, noise friendly depart or approach procedures. In addition, the lowest dispersion of RNAV tracks help to contain <b>noise</b> <b>footprints</b> in a smaller area if compared with footprints that are produced when conventional procedures are flown. However, RNAV turns still produce a significant amount of dispersion because of different aircraft performance and different Flight Management Systems (FMS) implementation. Noise exposure can be also mitigated if the aircraft trajectory is conveniently modified in the vertical plane. In this work, a brief overview of different lateral and vertical noise abatement strategies is given. Theoretical optimal trajectories are also assessed presenting some results of previous research done by the authors. The annoyance produced by aircraft noise in different noise sensitive locations is taken as minimization objective. This annoyance not only takes into account the measured acoustic values but also other important aspects that will affect the perceived annoyance by the population. The concept of equitable trajectories is also presented, where noise annoyance is minimized in the worst noise sensitive location and not as an average value for all locations...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} {{probably}} the most dominating contribution to community noise annoyance. The most effective way to reduce aircraft noise is 1) the reduction at the source and 2) the optimization of the actual flight operation of the aircraft. In order to identify promising concepts for such a noise reduction and to evaluate the impact on a system level, so-called scientific noise prediction tools have been developed. The overall aircraft noise is hereby described in a componential and parametric way, i. e. the major noise contributors are modelled individually under consideration of relevant parameters. The selected parameters reflect the influence of geometrical details and operational conditions on each modeled noise source and ultimately on the overall vehicle noise. The underlying models yield one-third-octave band SPL spectra for each emission angle. For typical applications this data is translated into time-level-histories on the ground and <b>noise</b> <b>footprints.</b> Obviously, much more information can be derived from the standard output, i. e. the spectral and directional SPL data. Access to this output data is very promising for new and unconventional application of the scientific aircraft noise simulation tools. Three exemplary applications are presented and discussed here.

It seems promising to reverse this process, i. e. starting with some selected noise goals and then tracing it back to a required modification to the underlying geometry or flight operation...|$|R
40|$|This {{handbook}} {{gives an}} overview of DLR Rotorcraft <b>Noise</b> Ground <b>Footprints</b> Model HEMISPHERE. This modular system {{is the basis for}} work on the prediction of flyover noise using either purely theoretical computation as input on a hemispherical ânoise sourceâ surface beneath the aircraft or measured sound fields on the ground. The present release contains both reverse propagation procedure and propagation procedure. Multi-segment quasi unsteady procedure can be considered. In propagation procedure, the hemispherical sound field in narrow band spectrum together with weather profile, flight trajectory and conditions are provided to a flyover noise prediction code, HEMISPHERE (propagation procedure) to fulfill footprints prediction. A flight trajectory may consist of a number of flight segments such as take-off, level flight and descent. For each of these flight sequences, a separate noise source surface is generated. Knowing the flight trajectory and the flight condition, the relevant noise source surface is moved along the flight segment with the desired speed. The propagation of the noise on to the ground is treated as âfreeâ propagation with consideration of Doppler effect correction, spherical spreading, atmospheric absorption and ground reflection. To generate the <b>noise</b> <b>footprints,</b> the overflown area is overlaid with a lattice of discrete points. With a step by step movement of the noise source surface along the flight trajectory, the perceived noise on the ground is obtained as a sound pressure level time history at each ground point which is processed to obtain the desired noise metric. A contour plot routine uses the data to map the foot print. The second methodology of generating acoustic ground footprints is to use measured acoustic data which were collected from e. g. a microphone array as input into the HEMISPHERE code to enable an estimation of acoustic footprints in a large area which were not directly measured. The ground to hemisphere transformation or reverse propagation procedure embedded in HEMISPHERE code is first used to transform ground measured acoustic data to a hemisphere surface beneath rotorcraft. The transformations are fulfilled by correcting for spherical spreading, atmosphere absorbing and ground reflection. The measured data including weather profile data, flight trajectory data and acoustic spectrum data are used in the reverse propagation procedure. After obtaining a free field lower hemisphere sound field, the propagation procedure in HEMISPHERE code can then be used for a footprint on a user-defined grid of observer locations...|$|R
