5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards the}} net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on {{either end of}} the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Laurence Krieg, a young fan, {{wrote to}} Lewis, {{asking him to}} {{adjudicate}} between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels – according to the sequence of events, with The Magician's Nephew being placed first – {{and that of his}} mother, who thought the order of publication was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.|$|E
25|$|Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in {{most large}} cities of Brazil, might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> choice {{because of the large}} car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common. Because of the {{organization}} of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighbourhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Américas).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> method of furthering the social {{object of the}} MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and {{so this was a}} question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed in November 2012 and premiered on 5 December 2012. The video has a metaphorical theme, and features Lewis {{in a giant}} bird cage in a dimly lit room, wearing the long ivory sleeved dress and [...] "jewelled eye decorations". Some scenes show the singer in a shadow and darker settings, while others are light and colourful. For most of the video, Lewis ponders {{about being able to}} escape her cage and experience freedom. At the end of the video, she realises that the cage is in fact unlocked and she is able to leave her confine, and leaves. Lucy Buckland for the Daily Mail felt that Lewis looks [...] "positively mournful" [...] in the video, and that while it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> advert for feminism, she looks [...] "beautiful".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the game's negative response, GameZone said {{that even though the}} game does not feature continuous play, [...] "the action flows well once into an event". GameZone's review praised the game's audio track, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] because the comedy is straight from the television show, and the characters will [...] "bring a smile to your face". Reiner also commented positively on the soundtrack and that the game may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wrestling game available, [...] "but it delivers what the cover advertises". GameSpot's Frank Provo said that [...] "wit" [...] and [...] "charm" [...] are the two most redeeming features of The Simpsons Wrestling, and in spite of the game's weak gameplay, it has [...] "plenty of laughs in store" [...] that devoted fans of The Simpsons will enjoy. The BBC's David Gibbon wrote that the end result of the track is one that will not [...] "fail to impress fans".|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club, Gillette's former employer, {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and noted that}} he did not like Todd Packer, nor the episodes where his {{character}} is intentionally supposed to be vile. He did, however, enjoy the fact that Packer's antics caused Jim and Dwight to unite {{in the face of a}} common enemy, a plot that McNutt said [...] "had a scrappy feel to it". McNutt also called Kevin being [...] "slowly broken by Packer's cruelty" [...] an effective way to show how terrible Packer was to the morale of the office. He was, however, more critical about the fact that Holly seemed unaware that [...] "Michael may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> judge of whether or not someone is funny". At the end of his review, McNutt reminded readers that The A.V. Club specifically selected him as their new reviewer for the show because he did not know Gillette, thus avoiding a conflict of interest.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is {{the sort of person who}} would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{originally}} {{aired on}} the Fox {{network in the}} United States on November 23, 2003, and on January 9, 2004 in the United Kingdom on Sky One. IGN.com named the episode {{the best of the}} fifteenth season, saying that [...] "It may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> episode ever, but hell if it isn't a lot of fun", as well as calling it [...] "extremely funny" [...] and a [...] "high point for the past few seasons". Tony Blair received criticism from a number of commentators for his appearance in the episode {{due to the fact that}} he recorded his part at the height of the war in Iraq. Sunday Telegraph journalist Jack Roberts noted that it was [...] "not [...] finest hour". On the other hand, Simon Crerar of The Times named Blair's appearance as one of the 33 best guest appearances in the show's history, and the BBC classified his appearance as a [...] "PR masterstroke". The episode is included on the Around the World in 80 D'ohs DVD.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time observed, [...] "NBC's public {{troubles}} {{have been}} 30 Rocks greatest blessing this season, providing it with satiric fodder from The Jay Leno Show to the Comcast acquisition. The show may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely {{the best work}} of NBC-criticism." [...] In regards to the main plot, he said it [...] "could have done even more with {{the premise of the}} Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, but it gets {{a lot of credit for}} the inspired idea." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot [...] "came at a perfect time" [...] in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were [...] "less impressive". Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was [...] "supremely clever and self-referential", and that the show's take on it was [...] "decidedly neutral, albeit very funny".|$|E

[...] Critic Maria Schurr of PopMatters wrote that [...] "one half of Fay's Life Is People proves worthy of such a long wait...those who Life Is People touches are unlikely to hear a more inspiring album this year."

500|$|The {{brothers}} {{stated that}} they created a live action feature in 2000 that made its way into comedy film festivals, {{and that they were}} planning to create a feature each year, hoping that one feature would soon help the brothers break into Hollywood. Despite winning young filmmaker awards, they soon {{came to the conclusion that}} this method would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> path, and decided their future would be on the internet, which they viewed at the time as the new film festival. The brothers created their first website in 2003, and uploaded their first web video in 2004. They broke their features into 10-to-15-minute chunks to showcase the feature to an audience. The brothers used their website and early online works as a discoverability tool that would launch them into traditional film. In 2004, the brothers created a feature-length live-action comedy, titled G.I. Joe: The Epic Saga, before beginning to upload more sketch and comedy content onto websites such as MySpace. The duo then moved from Orlando, Florida to Los Angeles, where they continued to upload more videos on their YouTube channel, which was created on June 4, 2007. New York wrote that the two entered the YouTube community as [...] "low-paid video producers for other companies, but kept making their own videos on the side." [...] Their earlier videos contain mature social satire humor.|$|E
