40|$|Part I : Synthesis of Novel Purely Planar Chiral Ferrocenes for Asymmetric Synthesis The {{first part}} of the thesis {{describes}} the design and synthesis of a series of 1, 2 -bidendate purely planar chiral ferrocenyl ligand (Ligand A, B, C). The planar chirality was established using Kagan’s Directed ortho Metallation (DoM) strategy. Introduction of the desired α–cyclopentadienyl moiety proved to be difficult using nucleophilic substitution. This was circumvented by utilising Stone’s fulvene formation method, followed by reduction of the corresponding fulvene. The synthesised ligands were then subjected to complexation studies. In general, the obtained complexes proved to be unstable. Despite the instability issue, their activity was tested in several asymmetric catalytic processes (Diels-Alder reaction, reconstitutive condensation, allylic substitution), however no enantio-induction was detected. In the course of extending the scope of the Stone method, it was applied to different cyclopentadienyl type (indenyl, fluorenyl, tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) systems successfully. In addition, the synthesis of a novel ferrocene linked dimer is given. This ligand showed moderate activity in allylic alkylation reaction. Part II : Synthesis of Novel Azaferrocenylboronic Acids Based on Whiting’s preliminary report a novel azaferrocenylboronic acid structure was envisaged. The best synthetic approach consisted of two steps. The aryl functionality was introduced at the 2 -position of the azaferrocene ring in a <b>Negishi</b> <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction,</b> which was followed by a lithium-halogen exchange/boronylation sequence. Boronylations under different conditions were tested, however, isolation of the target boronic acid was unsuccessful probably due to its instability. Introduction of the borane functionality was achieved by using a modified boronylating agent and the resulting azaferrocenylborane proved to be stable. A monohydroxyboronic acid was isolated, which might be a candidate for asymmetric direct amide bond forming reactions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{asymmetric}} synthesis palladium catalysis finds broad application and several name reactions such as Sonogashira and Stille coupling reactions or the Heck, Negishi and Suzuki cross-coupling, which was recently awarded with the Noble price in 2010, became standard tools in today’s synthesis. The right choice of an appropriate chiral ligand is crucial for the stereoselectivity and the successful synthesis of enantiopure chemicals. Raising interest could be observed in {{the field of}} monodentate phosphorligands in the last years. Using a combination of two simple monodentate ligands instead of one complex bidentate ligand opened up a new period in asymmetric catalysis. The great success of monodentate ligands is explained by the formation of noncovalent ligand-ligand interactions in the coordination sphere of the metal center. Thus by such a self-assemble two monodentate ligands can imitate the structural features of a classical bidentate, chelating ligand. Among monodentate ligands phosphoramidites became a ‘privileged class of ligands’. Despite several studies on diverse transition metal complexes there is still need for structural investigations on interaction mechanics of this class of ligands. This thesis mainly focuses on the NMR spectroscopic structural investigation of phosphoramidite palladium complexes and the inter- and intraligand interaction patterns within these complexes. For the first time the pseudo-bidentate character of this class of ligands in solution was proven on cis-Pd complexes, which structurally highly resemble the corresponding crystal structures. Each investigated complex exhibited altogether four interaction sites, two inter- and two intraligand interaction sites and moreover the additivity of the formed interaction patterns was proven: Upon specific structurally changes within one of these interaction sites the residual interaction patterns are hardly affected and the general complex structure is retained. Moreover the coexistence of interactions - mainly based on CH- and - interactions - and rotational processes was addressed. In the course of this study the role of the amine side chain NR(CH) Ar of phosphoramidite ligands is discussed which is supposed to form a planar interaction surface relevant for catalysis. We claim that interactions of this planar surface with the substrate lead to a precoordination of the substrate to the catalytic metal center. Depending on the configuration of the amine side chain the resulting interaction mode determines the relative orientation of the substrate towards the catalytic center and therefore controls the stereoselectivity. The theory of interaction surfaces of both the biaryl backbone and the amine side chains of phosphoramidite ligands was also transferred to other complexes of different transition metals. It was shown that the aggregation trends of phosphoramidite transition metal complexes is purely ligand dominated and independent of the transition metal or even the complex structure. This finding opened up the implementation of a new fast and easy method for the optimization of catalysis in terms of reaction temperature in an early development state. Furthermore it was shown that the validity of a ligand dominated aggregation is limited to phosphoramidites containing an NR(CH) Ar amine side chain which is capable to form an interaction surface essential for both aggregation and stereoselectivity in transition metal catalysis. In the course of the investigations of intermolecular interactions a method is presented to quantify the free energy difference between two heterocomplexes MLL’Xn. Moreover, {{for the first time the}} separation of supramolecular CH-π and π-π interactions in the coordination sphere from stereoelectronic and electrostatic interactions close to the metal center is presented. Thus the energetically stabilization of one heterocomplex compared to another by pure noncovalent ligand-ligand interactions can be determined. The reliability of the presented method was proven on the example of two phosphoramidite Pd complexes. Complex structures and interaction patterns were characterized by 1 H chemical shift analyses and 1 H 1 H NOESY measurements and in addition these results were correlated to the calculated stabilization energy. Another part of the thesis deals with mechanistic studies on different coupling reactions using palladium catalysts. Based on 1 H 31 P HMBC and a combination of various 2 D NMR spectra structural investigations on intermediates of the Pd catalyzed Umolung reaction between 2 -cyclohexenyl acetate and benzaldehyde are presented. The focus of these investigations lies on mechanistic differences between the employments of two diastereomeric phosphoramidite ligands providing different enantioselectivities. Besides various π-allyl palladium complexes the formation of σ-allyl complex species is described which is supposed to be the key intermediate for the Umpolung of the allyl from electrophilic to nucleophilic. Aside from the structural investigations on phosphoramidite Pd complexes the remote stereocontrol of a highly diastereoselective Csp 3 -Csp 2 <b>Negishi</b> <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction</b> of a 1, 3 -substituted cyclohexyl zinc chloride with aryl halides catalyzed by (TMPP) 2 PdCl 2 (TMPP: tris(2, 4, 6 -trimethoxyphenyl) phosphine) was investigated. By a careful optimization of measuring parameters the stereoselective step and the crucial palladium intermediate could unambiguously be characterized by NMR. Based on DFT calculations it was shown that after a diastereoselective transmetalation of the cyclohexyl compound from zinc to palladium exclusively the most stable palladium intermediate with all substituents in equatorial position is formed. In respect of intermolecular interactions the aggregation behavior of the organo-transition metal complex fac-Ir(ppy) 3 was investigated. This compound is a famous and high efficient triplet-emitter applied in electro-luminescent devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The mechanistic insights into structure changing processes, which also include aggregation, are crucial for the development of new matrices and the optimization of emitter properties. Therefore, the dependency of aggregation on temperature, concentration and solvent was investigated by 1 H DOSY measurements. Based on these studies the aggregation mechanism of Ir(ppy) 3 by mainly dipole-dipole interactions with only a small percentage of CH-π and π-π stacking was identified, which was additionally confirmed by disaggregation studies. In summary this thesis predominantly deals with the NMR spectroscopic investigation of different phosphoramidite palladium complexes and the interaction patterns within these complexes. The structural insight into inter- and intraligand interactions in palladium complexes using highly selective phosphoramidite ligands and the analyses of general structural motifs and interaction sites of this class of ligands deliver valuable information for the design and optimization of new catalysts. In addition the mechanistic studies on different Pd-catalyzed reactions such as the Umpolung reaction or the Negishi cross coupling essentially contributed to the elucidation of intermediate structures. ...|$|E

The recovered polymer can be reused several times although increased induction and reaction times are observed in consecutive uses from one run to the next. The reaction was followed up by in situ IR spectroscopy using the ν(C-Br) absorption of the electrophile, so there is no need of an additional functional group to apply this technique. 2017 - 12 - 15 Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad (CTQ 2013 - 48406 -P) Junta de Castilla y León (programa de apoyo a proyectos de investigación – Ref.
