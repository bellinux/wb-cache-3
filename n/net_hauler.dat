25|$|Set netters – also operate gillnets. However, during fishing {{operations}} the vessel is not {{attached to the}} nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven <b>net</b> <b>haulers.</b> Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.|$|R
25|$|The {{combined}} nets {{are maintained}} {{more or less}} vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on the target species, they are hauled on board. Traditional combined nets were hauled by hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven <b>net</b> <b>haulers</b> are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the net by hand. Of some concern with this method is ghost fishing by lost nets and bycatch of diving seabirds. Nets combined in this way were first used in the Mediterranean.|$|R
25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical <b>net</b> <b>haulers,</b> or <b>net</b> drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|R
500|$|Harmless to humans, the whiskery shark is fished commercially for its meat, {{which is}} sold fresh. It {{is one of}} the shark species marketed as [...] "flake". Along with the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and the gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus), it is {{targeted}} by a shark fishery operating off Western Australia, currently managed as the Western Australian Joint Authority Southern Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery. The fishery began in the 1940s with a small number of demersal longline vessels, though the whiskery shark was not caught in substantial numbers until the 1970s, with the introduction of monofilament gillnets, hydraulic <b>net</b> <b>haulers,</b> and additional vessels. Catches peaked in the early 1980s, when 400–600 tons were taken annually. Overfishing reduced the population to <30% of pre-exploitation levels by the mid-1980s, prompting the Western Australian government to enact a management plan that stabilized the population at 25–30% of pre-exploitation levels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. We {{compare the}} {{productivity}} of technology adopters to non-adopters using a cross-sectional survey of artisanal gillnet vessels {{on the east coast}} of Peninsular Malaysia. Technologies include cell phones, GPS, sonar, and mechanical winches for hauling nets. Stochastic frontier analysis is used to measure differences in production frontiers and technical efficiency scores. Adopters of mechanical <b>net</b> <b>haulers</b> had low technical efficiency, low labor productivity and high labor use. Electronics adopters were more productive than non-adopters on average, but difficult to distinguish from efficient non-adopters. This is the first paper that we know of to examine the role of new technologies in the production process of artisanal fishers. Our results suggest capital investments in new technology may tie the least successful participants to the fishery despite most respondents self-reported desire to exit. Impacts may be fishery-specific and ambiguous, so the consequences of technology subsidies should be carefully considered in development policy...|$|R

25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. <b>Net</b> <b>haulers</b> are usually {{used to set}} and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|R
25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic <b>net</b> <b>haulers</b> or <b>net</b> drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based {{on the relationship of}} fuel/fish.|$|R
40|$|Technological {{progress}} {{is associated with}} both excessive depletion and improved conservation of environmental resources. This dissertation explores the role of technological progress under different regulatory and producing institutions. The first chapter, "Firm Boundaries and Impure Public Goods'', establishes a relationship between property rights, firm structure, and productivity. I adapt {{the theory of the}} firm to show that reducing common-pool externalities can lead to mergers (distinct from permit consolidation among low cost firms) and greater human capital investments. These predictions are supported by data from the New England groundfish industry where some groups called "sectors'' were exempted from input controls and given a collective output quota. Sectors exhibited better managerial performance (i. e., higher productivity) relative to non-sector firms following the change, but the species composition of their harvest shifted considerably. The following two chapters investigate technology adoption and productivity in common -pool resource industries. The second chapter, "Technological Change and Managerial Ability : Evidence from a Malaysian Artisanal Fishery'', uses stochastic frontier analysis to compare the productivity of technology adopters in the gillnet fishery on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Technologies include cell phones, GPS, sonar, and mechanical winches for hauling nets. Electronics adopters were more productive than non- adopters on average but difficult to distinguish from efficient non-adopters, while adopters of mechanical <b>net</b> <b>haulers</b> had low technical efficiency, low labor productivity and high labor use. Our results suggest capital investments in new technology may tie the least successful participants to the fishery despite most respondents' self-reported desire to exit. The dynamic implications of these findings are explored in the third chapter, "Exogenous Productivity Shocks and Capital Investment in Common-pool Resources''. We develop a compound Poisson process to model rapid adoption of technologies in common-pool industries. Technology shocks lower the equilibrium resource stock while causing capital buildup based on transitory quasi-rents. The steady state changes from a stable node to a shifting focus with boom and bust cycles, even if only technology is uncertai...|$|R
