50|$|Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) aims at {{assessing}} {{the effects of}} stressors, often chemicals, on the local environment. A risk is an integrated assessment of likelihood and severity of an undesired event. In ERA, the undesired event often depends on the chemical of interest and on the risk assessment scenario. This undesired event is usually a detrimental effect on organisms, populations or ecosystems. Current ERAs usually compare an exposure to a <b>no-effect</b> <b>level,</b> such as the Predicted Environmental Concentration/Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PEC/PNEC) ratio in Europe. Although this type of ratio is useful and often used in regulation purposes, it is only an indication of an exceeded apparent threshold.

Within the ENRHES project a comprehensive and critical scientific review of publicly available health and safety information on four types of nanoparticles was performed. Based on the identified exposure and hazard data, basic human health risk assessment appraisals were carried out for fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nano-silver and nano-titanium dioxide. These risk assessment appraisals followed the structure of a regulatory risk assessment and if possible and relevant, it was attempted to derive indicative human <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> from key studies by applying assessment factors as suggested in the technical guidance document for REACH.

The experiment was performed in females only, because the effects were most marked in females in the pilot study. Doses of 0, 1, 2 and 4 mg glycyrrhizic acid/kg body weight were administered orally for 8 weeks to 39 healthy female volunteers aged 19 - 40 years. The experiment lasted 12 weeks including an adaptation and a "wash-out" period. A <b>no-effect</b> <b>level</b> of 2 mg/kg is proposed {{from the results of}} this study, from which an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0. 2 mg/kg body weight can be extrapolated with a safety factor of 10.

The proposed ADI is below the limit advised by the Dutch Nutrition Council of 200 mg glycyrrhizic acid/day. This reflects the relatively mild acute toxicity of glycyrrhizic acid, which is also emphasised by the "generally recognised as safe" (GRAS) status of glycyrrhizic acid in the USA in 1983.

It completely replaces the EUSES 1. 0 program and documentation. EUSES 2. 0 {{is designed to be}} a decision-support system for the evaluation of the risks of substances to man and the environment. The system is fully based on the EU Technical Guidance Documents for the risk assessment of new and existing substances and biocides. The documentation and program can be obtained from the European Chemicals Bureau, Ispra, Italy. EUSES {{is the result of a}} co-ordinated effort of EU Member States, the European Commission and the Europe-an Chemical Industry. This risk assessment is transparent and easy to perform: EUSES is well documented and available as a user-friendly computer program. Risks to man pertain to consumers, workers and man exposed through the environment. Protection goals in the environment include sewage treatment plant populations of micro-organisms, aquatic, terrestrial and sediment ecosystems and populations of predators. This assessment includes the marine environment. The risk assessment is carried out in a stepwise procedure starting with data input and estimation and further involving the estimation of emissions, the prediction of environmental distribution, the calculation of human and environmental exposure, the derivation of <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> and the risk characterisation. Virtually all default settings can be changed and all estimated parameter values and intermediate results can be overwritten by measured data. The exposure assessment in EUSES covers the whole life cycle of substances as well as their fate in all environmental compartments at three spatial scales: the personal scale for consumers and workers, the local scale for man and ecosystems near point sources and the regional scale for man and ecosystems exposed as a result of all releases in a larger region. Where appropriate, in the effects module <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> are derived for all ecosystems and populations considered. The human effects assessment covers all relevant endpoints for both threshold and non-threshold substances. The end-point of EUSES is a quantitative comparison per substance of the results of the effects and the exposure assessment. The resulting risk characterisation ratios (RCRs) can be regarded as indicators for the likelihood of adverse effects occurring...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{environmental}} risk of chemicals is rou-tinely assessed by comparing predicted exposure <b>levels</b> to predicted <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> for ecosystems. Although pro-cess-based models {{are commonly used}} in exposure assessment, the assessment of effects usually comprises purely descriptive models and rules-of-thumb. The prob-lems with this approach start with the analysis of labora-tory ecotoxicity tests, because only {{a limited amount of}} information is extracted. Standard summary statistics (NOEC, ECx, LC 50) are of limited use in part because they change with exposure duration in a manner that varies with the tested species and the toxicant. As an alternative, process-based models are available. These models allow for toxicity measures that are independent of exposure time, make efficient use of the available data from routine toxicity tests, and are better suited for edu-cated extrapolations (e. g., from individual to population, and from continuous to pulse exposure). These capabilities can be used to improve regulatory decisions and allow for a more efficient assessment of effects, which ultimately will reduce the need for animal testing. Process-based modeling also can help to achieve the goals laid out in REACH, the new strategy of the European Commission in dealing with chemicals.

Topics concerned the metrics for measuring NPs, the combined exposure to manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) and process-generated NPs, the use of the precautionary principle, the lack of information about the presence of nanomaterials, and the appropriateness of soft regulation for exposure control. The workshop concluded that the NRV, as an 8 -h time-weighted average, is a comprehensible and useful instrument for risk management of professional use of MNMs with a dispersible character. The question remains whether NRVs, as advised for risk management by the Dutch employers’ organization and trade unions, should be under soft regulation or that a more binding regulation is preferable...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} risk of chemicals is routinely assessed by comparing predicted exposure <b>levels</b> to predicted <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> for ecosystems. Although process-based models {{are commonly used}} in exposure assessment, the assessment of effects usually comprises purely descriptive models and rules-of-thumb. The problems with this approach start with the analysis of laboratory ecotoxicity tests, because only {{a limited amount of}} information is extracted. Standard summary statistics (NOEC, ECx, LC 50) are of limited use in part because they change with exposure duration in a manner that varies with the tested species and the toxicant. As an alternative, process-based models are available. These models allow for toxicity measures that are independent of exposure time, make efficient use of the available data from routine toxicity tests, and are better suited for educated extrapolations (e. g., from individual to population, and from continuous to pulse exposure). These capabilities can be used to improve regulatory decisions and allow for a more efficient assessment of effects, which ultimately will reduce the need for animal testing. Process-based modeling also can help to achieve the goals laid out in REACH, the new strategy of the European Commission in dealing with chemicals.

30|$|Acute-to-chronic {{extrapolation}} is {{an important}} approach to predict acceptable <b>no-effect</b> <b>levels</b> from acute data which has some uncertainties, but is valuable for risk assessment of chemical substances. The present study comprises a comprehensive dataset of studies on acute and chronic toxicity of Daphnia and fish that have been conducted in line with OECD guidelines recommended in the EU guidance documents. The evaluation of existing data on Daphnia and fish toxicity testing shows that acute-to-chronic extrapolation represents a reasonable approach for environmental hazard estimation by considering an adequate assessment factor. Based on the evaluated dataset, an AF of 100, as implied by the European guidance documents, is protective for more than 90  % of industrial chemicals to estimate Daphnia and fish toxicity. Moreover, a value of 1000 applied on the lowest acute effect level of a substance was not exceeded in any case for the aquatic compartment (ACRaqu). Data variability is of interest to predict uncertainties and refinement options. The study indicates that bioactive compounds such as pesticides as well as polar narcotics show increased ACRs. On the other hand, non-polar narcosis is associated with reduced ACRs. The physico-chemical parameter Kow is of minor value to predict increased ACRs or to address uncertainties of this approach, while the acute toxicity level may provide options for refinement of acute-to-chronic extrapolation.|$|R
