40|$|In {{this thesis}} the wave packet {{dynamics}} of <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> of polyatomic molecules after interaction with static and time-dependent magnetic fields and moderate intense non-resonant laser pulses is investigated. In particular, {{the process of}} inducing (internal) molecular rotation as well as alignment of molecules by manipulating their rotational or rotational-torsional degrees of freedom is studied. In {{the first part of}} the thesis all theoretical concepts for identifying <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> and for describing their quantum dynamics will be discussed. Especially the symmetrization postulate and the molecular symmetry group will be introduced and illustrated for some examples of molecules. These concepts will be extended to the case of identifying <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> in the presence of an external field. In the second part it is shown for nitromethane that magnetic fields are able to induce unidirectional rotations in opposite directions for different <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> of molecules containing methyl groups if the dipolar interaction is included. Additionally, it is demonstrated that different <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> of a chemical compound may show different alignment after the interaction with a moderate intense laser pulse. As shown for the rigid symmetric top propadien and the rigid asymmetric tops ethene and analogues, distinct pairs of <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> show at certain points in time a complementary behavior: while one isomer is showing alignment the partner isomer is showing anti-alignment. Moreover, it is illustrated that not every nuclear spin isomer can be aligned equally efficient. The alignment of non-rigid molecules is considered as well. As an example for a molecule with feasible torsion in the electronic ground state, the alignment of diboron tetrafluoride is investigated. It becomes apparent that not only rotational but also the torsional dynamics of the molecules is nuclear spin selective; different <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> have at distinct points in time a complementary molecular structure. As an application of nuclear spin selective quantum dynamics, the possibility is explored how two laser pulses can be used for exciting directed motions differently for different <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers.</b> Likewise, the separation of isotopomers is discussed. The thesis closes with a discussion of the models used here and an outlook on how the obtained results may be used to separate <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the high}} density of energy storage and the large cross section for its release, <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers</b> have {{attracted}} considerable recent interest. The triggering of induced gamma emission from them has encouraged efforts to develop intense sources of short-wavelength radiation. One {{of the more interesting}} examples is the 16 + 4 -qp isomer of 178 Hf which stores 2. 445 MeV for a half-life of 31 years meaning that as a material, such isomeric 178 Hf would store 1. 3 GJ/g. Recently, a sample containing 6. 3 × 1014 nuclei of the isomer of 178 Hf was irradiated with X-ray pulses derived from a device operated at 15 mA to produce bremsstrahlung radiation with end point energies set to values between 60 and 90 keV. Emission of gamma radiation from the sample was increased by 1 – 2 % above the quiescent value of spontaneous emission. Such an accelerated decay of the 178 Hf isomer is consistent with an integrated cross section of 2. 2 × 10 − 22 cm 2 keV if the resonant absorption of the X-rays takes place below 20 keV as indicated by the use of selective absorbing filters in the irradiating beam. The work reported here describes the current experimental focus and results recently obtained with the use of coincident detection of emitted gamma photons by several detectors.

This pulse modifies the angular distribution of the incident molecules, and causes the scattered molecules to rotate with a preferred sense of rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise). In the second scheme, two properly delayed laser pulses are applied to a molecular beam composed of two chemically close molecular species (isotopes, or <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>isomers).</b> As the result of the double pulse excitation, these species are selectively scattered to different angles after the collision with the surface.

40|$|Following {{excitation}} by {{a strong}} ultra-short laser pulse, molecules develop coordinated rotational motion, exhibiting transient alignment along {{the direction of the}} laser electric field, followed by periodic full and fractional revivals that depend on the molecular rotational constants. In mixtures, the different species undergo similar rotational dynamics, all starting together but evolving differently with each demonstrating its own periodic revival cycles. For a bimolecular mixture of linear molecules, at predetermined times, one species may attain a maximally aligned state while the other is anti-aligned (i. e. molecular axes are confined in a plane perpendicular to the laser electric field direction). By a properly timed second laser pulse, the rotational excitation of the undesired species may be almost completely removed leaving only the desired species to rotate and periodically realign, thus facilitating further selective manipulations by polarized light.

The role of ``direct'' ortho-para transitions is shown to be small. Various aspects of the conversion were investigated in detail: pressure and collision partner dependence, isotope effect, temperature dependence.
