25|$|<b>Noretynodrel</b> (and norethisterone) were {{subsequently}} discovered to be contaminated {{with a small}} percentage of the estrogen mestranol (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the <b>noretynodrel</b> in Rock's 1954–5 study containing 4–7% mestranol. When further purifying <b>noretynodrel</b> to contain less than 1% mestranol led to breakthrough bleeding, it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with breakthrough bleeding, in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1956. The <b>noretynodrel</b> and mestranol combination was given the proprietary name Enovid.|$|E
25|$|In March 1960, the Birmingham FPA began {{trials of}} <b>noretynodrel</b> 2.5mg + {{mestranol}} 50µg, but a high pregnancy rate initially {{occurred when the}} pills accidentally contained only 36µg of mestranol—the trials were continued with <b>noretynodrel</b> 5mg + mestranol 75µg (Conovid in Britain, Enovid 5mg in the U.S.).|$|E
25|$|In December 1954, Rock {{began the}} first {{studies of the}} ovulation-suppressing {{potential}} of 5–50mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5–25 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his infertility patients in Brookline, Massachusetts. Norethisterone or <b>noretynodrel</b> 5mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10mg and higher doses of norethisterone or <b>noretynodrel</b> suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding {{and led to a}} 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's <b>noretynodrel</b> for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's norethisterone very slight androgenicity in animal tests.|$|E
25|$|In August 1960, the Slough FPA began {{trials of}} <b>noretynodrel</b> 2.5mg + {{mestranol}} 100µg (Conovid-E in Britain, Enovid-E in the U.S.).|$|E
25|$|First {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestins <b>noretynodrel,</b> norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, or etynodiol acetate; and sometimes defined as all COCPs containing ≥ 50µg ethinylestradiol.|$|E
25|$|Pincus {{asked his}} {{contacts}} at pharmaceutical companies {{to send him}} chemical compounds with progestogenic activity. Chang screened nearly 200 chemical compounds in animals and found the three most promising were Syntex's norethisterone and Searle's <b>noretynodrel</b> and norethandrolone.|$|E
25|$|In general, pregnane {{derivatives}} (progesterone, dydrogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, etc.) do not virilize even in high dose; testosterone derivatives (ethisterone) and 19-nortestosterone (norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etc.) generally virilize, {{but there}} are exceptions (e.g. <b>noretynodrel)</b> that do not.|$|E
25|$|Although FDA-approved for {{contraceptive}} use, Searle never marketed Enovid 10mg as a contraceptive. Eight months later, on February 15, 1961, the FDA approved Enovid 5mg for contraceptive use. In July 1961, Searle {{finally began}} marketing Enovid 5mg (5mg <b>noretynodrel</b> and 75µg mestranol) to physicians as a contraceptive.|$|E
25|$|NET was {{synthesized}} for {{the first}} time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951. It was the first highly active oral progestogen to be synthesized, and was preceded (as a progestogen) by progesterone (1934), ethisterone (1938), 19-norprogesterone (1944), and 17α-methylprogesterone (1949), as well as by nandrolone (1950), whereas <b>noretynodrel</b> (1952), and norethandrolone (1953) followed the synthesis of NET. The drug was first introduced, alone as Norlutin, in the United States in 1957. NET was subsequently introduced in combination with mestranol as Ortho-Novum in the U.S. in 1963, and was the second progestin, after <b>noretynodrel</b> in 1960, to be used in an oral contraceptive. In 1964, additional contraceptive preparations containing NET in combination with mestranol or EE, such as Norlestrin and Norinyl, were marketed in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Chemists Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City had {{synthesized}} {{the first}} orally highly active progestin norethisterone in 1951. Frank B. Colton at Searle in Skokie, Illinois had synthesized the orally highly active progestins <b>noretynodrel</b> (an isomer of norethisterone) in 1952 and norethandrolone in 1953.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1957, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} Enovid 10mg (9.85mg <b>noretynodrel</b> and 150µg mestranol) for menstrual disorders, {{based on}} data from its use by more than 600 women. Numerous additional contraceptive trials showed Enovid at 10, 5, and 2.5mg doses to be highly effective. On July 23, 1959, Searle filed a supplemental application to add contraception as an approved indication for 10, 5, and 2.5mg doses of Enovid. The FDA refused to consider the application until Searle agreed to withdraw the lower dosage forms from the application. On May 9, 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10mg for contraceptive use, and did so on June 23, 1960. At that point, Enovid 10mg had been in general use for three years and, by conservative estimate, at least half a million women had used it.|$|E
2500|$|Alkynes {{occur in}} some pharmaceuticals, {{including}} the contraceptive <b>noretynodrel.</b> A carbon–carbon triple bond is {{also present in}} marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral Efavirenz and the antifungal Terbinafine. Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene ("ene") between two alkyne groups ("diyne"). These compounds, e.g. calicheamicin, {{are some of the}} most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a [...] "warhead". Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the Bergman cyclization, generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.|$|E
2500|$|Estradiol {{methyl ether}} (1, EME) is {{partially}} {{reduced to the}} 1,5-diene (2) as also occurs for {{the first step in}} the synthesis of nandrolone. Oppenauer oxidation then transforms the 17β alcohol into a ketone functionality (3). This is then reacted with metal acetylide into the corresponding 17α-ethynyl compound (4). Hydrolysis of the enolether under mild conditions leads directly to (5), which appears to be <b>noretynodrel</b> (although Lednicer states that it is [...] "etynodrel" [...] in his book (which may be a synonym etynodiol). Etynodrel is with a chlorine atom attached.) an orally active progestin. This is the progestogen component of the first oral contraceptive to be offered for sale (i.e., Enovid). Treatment of the ethynyl enol ether with strong acid leads to NET (6).|$|E
50|$|<b>Noretynodrel</b> is {{very closely}} related to {{norethisterone}} and tibolone, which are the Δ4-isomer and the 7α-methyl derivative of <b>noretynodrel,</b> respectively. <b>Noretynodrel</b> is metabolized in a very similar manner to tibolone, whereas the metabolism of norethisterone differs. Both <b>noretynodrel</b> and tibolone are transformed into 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites and a Δ4-isomer metabolite (in the case of <b>noretynodrel,</b> this being norethisterone), whereas norethisterone is not 3α- or 3β-hydroxylated (and of course does not form a Δ4-isomer metabolite). The major metabolites of <b>noretynodrel</b> are 3α-hydroxynoretynodrel {{and to a lesser}} extent 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel, formed by 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (AKR1C1-4), while the Δ4-isomer norethisterone is a minor metabolite formed in small amounts. Tibolone is considered to be a prodrug into both its 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated and Δ4-isomerized metabolites. <b>Noretynodrel</b> is also thought to be a prodrug, as it is rapidly metabolized and cleared from circulation (within 30 minutes) and shows very weak relative affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), although <b>noretynodrel</b> appears to form norethisterone in only minor quantities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noretynodrel</b> (and norethisterone) were {{subsequently}} discovered to be contaminated {{with a small}} percentage of the estrogen mestranol (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the <b>noretynodrel</b> in Rock's 1954-5 study containing 4-7% mestranol. When further purifying <b>noretynodrel</b> to contain less than 1% mestranol led to breakthrough bleeding, it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with breakthrough bleeding, in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1956. The <b>noretynodrel</b> and mestranol combination was given the proprietary name Enovid.|$|E
50|$|Relative to norethisterone, <b>noretynodrel</b> has 45% to 81% reduced {{affinity}} for the androgen receptor (AR). In contrast to norethisterone (which is mildly androgenic), <b>noretynodrel</b> {{is said to have}} no or only very weak androgenic activity. In accordance, no androgenic effects (such as hirsutism, clitoral enlargement, or voice changes) have been observed with <b>noretynodrel</b> even when used in large dosages (e.g., 60 mg/day) for prolonged periods of time (9-12 months) in the treatment of women with endometriosis. Additionally, <b>noretynodrel</b> has not been found to virilize female fetuses, in contrast to many other testosterone-derived progestins including ethisterone, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate. However, according to Korn (1961), at least one case of pseudohermaphroditism (virilized genitalia) has been observed that may have been due to <b>noretynodrel.</b> The Δ4-isomer metabolite of tibolone shows dramatically and disproportionately increased {{affinity for}} the AR relative to norethisterone and <b>noretynodrel</b> (5.7- to 18.5-fold greater than that of norethisterone), indicating that the 7α-methyl group of tibolone markedly increases its androgenic activity and is responsible for the greater androgenic effects of tibolone relative to <b>noretynodrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Noretynodrel,</b> or norethynodrel, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-nortestosterone {{group and}} an isomer of norethisterone. <b>Noretynodrel</b> {{was introduced in}} 1957 in Enovid, a combination formulation of <b>noretynodrel</b> and mestranol, {{for the treatment of}} gynecological and menstrual disorders. A few years later, in May 1960, Enovid was also approved as the first oral contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{norethisterone}} {{has virtually}} no {{affinity for the}} estrogen receptors (ERs), <b>noretynodrel</b> shows some, albeit very weak affinity for both the ERα and the ERβ (in terms of relative binding affinity, 0.7% and 0.22% of that of estradiol, respectively). The estrogenic activity of 3α- and 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel has never been assessed. However, while tibolone shows similar affinity for the ERs as <b>noretynodrel,</b> the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone have several-fold increased affinity for the ERs. As such, the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of <b>noretynodrel</b> may also show increased estrogenic activity, and this {{may account for the}} known estrogenic effects of <b>noretynodrel.</b> The Δ4-isomer of tibolone, similarly to norethisterone, is virtually devoid of affinity for the ERs. Neither tibolone nor its metabolites are aromatized, whereas trestolone is readily aromatized similarly to testosterone and 19-nortestosterone, and for these reasons, it is unlikely that <b>noretynodrel</b> or its metabolites are aromatized either. As such, aromatization likely does not {{play a role in the}} estrogenic activity of tibolone or <b>noretynodrel.</b> However, controversy on this matter exists, and other researchers have suggested that tibolone and <b>noretynodrel</b> may be aromatized in small amounts to highly potent estrogens (ethinylestradiol and its 7α-methyl derivative, respectively).|$|E
50|$|<b>Noretynodrel</b> is an estrane (C18) steroid and is {{also known}} {{chemically}} as 17α-ethynyl-δ5(10)-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynylestr-5(10)-en-17β-ol-3-one, as well as 17α-ethynyl-19-nor-5(10)-testosterone or 5(10)-norethisterone. It is a derivative of testosterone that has been ethynylated at the C17α position, demethylated at the C19 position, and dehydrogenated (i.e., has a double bond) between the C5 and C10 positions. As such, <b>noretynodrel</b> is also a combined derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone). In addition, it is an isomer of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) in which the C4 double bond has been replaced with a double bond between the C5 and C10 positions. For this reason, <b>noretynodrel</b> {{is also known as}} 5(10)-norethisterone. Few other 19-nortestosterone progestins share the C5(10) double bond of <b>noretynodrel,</b> but an example of one that does is tibolone, the 7α-methyl derivative of <b>noretynodrel</b> (i.e., 7α-methylnoretynodrel).|$|E

5000|$|First generation: Approved for {{marketing}} before 1973. Examples: <b>noretynodrel,</b> norethisterone (norethindrone), lynestrenol, levonorgestrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noretynodrel</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Frank B. Colton of G. D. Searle & Company in 1952, {{and this was}} preceded by the synthesis of norethisterone by Luis E. Miramontes and Carl Djerassi of Syntex in 1951. In 1957, both <b>noretynodrel</b> and norethisterone were approved in the United States {{for the treatment of}} menstrual disorders. In 1960, <b>noretynodrel,</b> in combination with mestranol (as Enovid), was introduced in the United States as the first oral contraceptive, and the combination of norethisterone and mestranol followed in 1963 as the second oral contraceptive to be introduced. In 1988, Enovid, along with other oral contraceptives containing high doses of estrogen, was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Syntex {{submitted}} its compound to {{a laboratory}} in Madison, Wisconsin, for biological evaluation, {{and found it}} was the most active, orally-effective progestational hormone of its time. Syntex submitted a patent application in November 1951. In August 1953, G.D. Searle & Co. filed for a patent for the synthesis of the double-bond isomer 13 of norethisterone called <b>noretynodrel.</b> <b>Noretynodrel</b> is converted into norethisterone under acidic conditions, such as those in the human stomach, and the new patent did not infringe on the Syntex patent. Searle obtained approval to market <b>noretynodrel</b> before Syntex received its approval. By 1964 three companies including Syntex were marketing 2-mg doses of the Syntex norethisterone.|$|E
50|$|Relative {{to other}} 19-nortestosterone progestins, <b>noretynodrel</b> {{is said to}} possess much {{stronger}} estrogenic activity.|$|E

50|$|In April 1956, <b>noretynodrel</b> was investigated, in Puerto Rico, in {{the first}} {{large-scale}} clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive. The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate {{in the country and}} concerns of moral censure in the United States. It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of <b>noretynodrel</b> had been contaminated with small amounts (1-2%) of the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol (<b>noretynodrel</b> having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol). When this impurity was removed, higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred. As a result, mestranol, that same year (1956), was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen (and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol), given its name, and added back to the formulation. This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company, the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg <b>noretynodrel</b> and 150 μg mestranol per pill.|$|E
50|$|In December 1954, Rock {{began the}} first {{studies of the}} ovulation-suppressing {{potential}} of 5-50 mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5-25 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his infertility patients in Brookline, Massachusetts. Norethisterone or <b>noretynodrel</b> 5 mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10 mg and higher doses of norethisterone or <b>noretynodrel</b> suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding {{and led to a}} 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's <b>noretynodrel</b> for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's norethisterone very slight androgenicity in animal tests.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the PR, <b>noretynodrel</b> {{possesses}} only about 6% to 19% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRA, whereas the affinity of the two drugs for the PRB is similar (<b>noretynodrel</b> possesses 94% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRB). Tibolone and the Δ4-isomer metabolite of tibolone have similar affinity for the PRs as <b>noretynodrel</b> and norethisterone, respectively, whereas the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone are virtually devoid of affinity for the PR. Since the structurally related anabolic-androgenic steroid trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) {{is known to be}} a potent progestogen, suggesting that a 7α-methyl substitution does not interfere with progestogenic activity, 3α- and 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel likely are devoid of affinity for the PR similarly to the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone.|$|E
50|$|Tibolone is a 19-nortestosterone {{derivative}} and {{is related}} structurally to other 19-nortestosterone progestins. It is the 7α-methyl derivative of <b>noretynodrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|A few progestins have weak estrogenic activity. These {{include the}} 19-nortestosterone {{derivatives}} norethisterone, <b>noretynodrel,</b> and tibolone, {{as well as}} the norethisterone prodrugs norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, and etynodiol diacetate. High dosages of norethisterone and <b>noretynodrel</b> have been associated with estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with alleviation of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, non-estrogenic progestins were not found to be associated with such effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noretynodrel</b> is {{no longer}} {{available}} in any formulation in the U.S., nor does it appear to still be marketed in any other country.|$|E
50|$|High dosages of {{norethisterone}} and <b>noretynodrel,</b> {{which are}} 19-nortestosterone derivatives of ethisterone, {{were found to}} be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, as well as with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, ethisterone and other progestogens such as progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone caproate were not associated with such effects, suggesting that they are either not estrogenic or are only weakly so. As such, ethisterone does not appear to share the estrogenic activity of norethisterone and <b>noretynodrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Noretynodrel</b> was {{formerly}} used {{in combination with}} the estrogen mestranol in the treatment of gynecological and menstrual disorders and as a combined oral contraceptive. It has since been discontinued.|$|E
