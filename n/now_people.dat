This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and <b>now</b> <b>people</b> not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.|$|E

Later, at the proposal of the MIÉP chairman, they went to the Hungarian Socialist Party's (MSZP) headquarters on Corvin Street, which was secured by the police. Traffic was blocked by the demonstrators in parts of the inner city.|$|E
25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail <b>now.</b> <b>People</b> speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E

[...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn <b>now,</b> <b>people</b> are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E

Discussing this association after Ugly Bettys 2007 Golden Globe win, Dale noted: [...] "Every article I read I'm always, 'Ex-soap star Jim Robinson'.

Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. [...] "We did {{a lot of things to}} fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever we cut to newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or we cut to surveillance cameras, or we cut to still photography within the film, which <b>now</b> <b>people</b> say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," [...] he explained.|$|E

Even <b>now,</b> <b>people</b> think were crazy when I tell them what we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 7543 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawlessa competition record. Their three victories that season included defeating the Canterbury Crusaders at Carisbrook, and the Waikato Chiefs at Taupowhere Doug Howlett scored three tries for the Highlanders.|$|E

The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think <b>now</b> <b>people</b> are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors.

I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious.

500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on <b>now,</b> <b>people</b> discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people.

500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995). Groening was not {{fond of the}} crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for The Critic. Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that <b>now</b> <b>people</b> may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time <b>now.</b> <b>People</b> go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E
