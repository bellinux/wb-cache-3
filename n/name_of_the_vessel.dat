25|$|Tina Louise is Ginger Grant, {{the movie}} star. Louise clashed with {{producer}} Sherwood Schwartz because {{she believed that}} she was hired as the central character. Her character was originally written as a hard-nosed, sharp-tongued temptress, but Louise argued that this portrayal was too harsh and refused to play it as written. A compromise was reached; Louise agreed to play her as a Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield type. Louise continued to clash with producers over her role and was the only cast member who refused to return {{for any of the}} post-series TV movies, saying that the role had killed her career as a serious actress. She did, however, appear in a reunion of the cast on a late-night television talk show in 1988 and on an episode of Roseanne in 1995 when the Roseanne cast re-enacted Gilligan's Island. In the first season, Ginger often wore gowns that looked as if they were tailored from Minnow tarpaulins or similar substitute cloth (some had the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> stenciled on them). In the pilot episode, the character of Ginger, no last name, (then a secretary) was played by actress Kit Smythe.|$|E

2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Lucy Walker is well documented, but nearly every source contains some contradictions, garbled names, or incomplete information. Eyewitnesses included Captain Dunham of the snagboat Gopher, an anonymous gentleman from Baltimore, the pilot Capt. Thompson, {{and a group of}} ministers and laymen aboard the Lucy Walker. [...] The latter told about their misadventures during and after the explosion, but somehow failed to notice or mention that the owner of the vessel was an American Indian, that drinking and gambling was present, or that the boat was engaged in a race with another boat. [...] Most of the newspaper accounts also failed to note this aspect of the accident. The owner of the ship was identified in most newspapers as Captain David Vann, possibly confusing him with a cousin of that name who had served as the Treasurer of the Cherokee Nation. This David Vann was a brother of Joseph ("Tenulte") Vann. [...] Various sources provide estimates of fatalities widely ranging from 18 to more than 100 deaths. [...] Albert Koch misheard the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> as [...] "Louise Walker." [...] Even the date of the accident has frequently been listed in error in many reference works, which have the date as October 22 or 25, 1844. Only the Cherokee sources note the role that [...] "Rich Joe" [...] Vann played in the sudden end of the Lucy Walker and his own demise.|$|E
