5000|$|The term [...] "nasal cavity" [...] {{can refer}} {{to each of the}} two sides of the nose or to the two sides combined. The two nasal {{cavities}} condition the air to be received by the other areas of the respiratory tract. Owing to the large surface area provided by the nasal conchae (also known as turbinates), the air passing through the nasal cavity is warmed or cooled to within 1 degree of body temperature. In addition, the air is humidified, and dust and other particulate matter is removed by vibrissae, short, thick hairs, present in the vestibule. The entire mucosa of the <b>nasal</b> <b>fossae</b> is covered by a blanket of mucus, which lies superficial to the microscopic cilia and also filters inspired air. The cilia of the respiratory epithelium move the secreted mucus and particulate matter posteriorly towards the pharynx where it passes into the esophagus and is digested in the stomach. The nasal cavity also houses our sense of smell and contributes greatly to taste sensation through its posterior communication with the mouth via the choanae.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Accurate {{measurement}} of bone height and width is essential prior to dental implant placement. The method of surgery as well as, {{the type and}} size of implants are determined according to dimensions of the residual bone. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the accuracy of linear tomography in localization of the floor of <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> and maxillary sinus, and to determine the width of maxillary bone at the designated site for implant placement. Materials and Methods: In this test evaluation study, the vertical distances between the alveolar crest and the floor of <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> and the floor of maxillary sinus was measured by the tomographic slices in 12 sites of three dry human skulls. In addition, the width of maxillary bone was measured at the same slices. The skulls were then sectioned through the marked places. Then the radiographic values were compared with the real values of bone sections. Results: After correction of tomographic values by the magnification factor of the unit, the mean absolute measurement error for vertical values at <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> and maxillary sinus area in tomographic slices were 0. 28 mm (SD= 0. 24) and 1. 1 mm (SD= 0. 68) respectively. The mean absolute measurement error for maxillary width at the <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> and maxillary sinus area were 0. 65 mm (SD= 0. 50) and 0. 55 mm (SD= 0. 45) respectively. 100 % of vertical values at <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> area and 50 % of vertical values at maxillary sinus area were within &plusmn; 1 mm error limit. In addition, 50 % of width measurements at <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> area and 83. 3 % at maxillary sinus area were within &plusmn; 1 mm error limit.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atrophic {{rhinitis}} is a distressing {{and socially}} crippling disease. Surgical treatment {{has been used}} for patients with severe disease that is unresponsive to medical therapy. METHODS: Eight patients with primary atrophic rhini-tis were treated surgically by narrowing of the <b>nasal</b> <b>fossae</b> with implantation of 2 Plastipore plates per affected side into submucosal pockets into the floor of the nose and septum, thus reducing the volume of the <b>nasal</b> <b>fossae.</b> RESULTS: Excellent results were obtained in 6 patients, with complete resolution of symptoms and good results and only minor crusting in 2 patients. One implant was extruded spontaneously 18 months after implantation and was reimplanted. Results in this patient before and after reimplantation were excellent. There were no cases of infection and no other complications. CONCLUSION: We implanted Plastipore, a high-density polyethylene sponge with micropores, which enables tissue ingrowth, anchoring the implants to the surrounding tissue. The surgical technique is performed with the patient under local anesthesia and is relatively easy and avoids com-plicated flap procedures, allogeneic bone harvest-ing, and the discomfort of nostril closure for pro-longed periods.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionLobular {{capillary}} hemangioma is {{a frequent}} benign vascular inflammatory lesion of the skin tissue. It rarely reaches the mucous membrane, and the <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> involvement is exceptional. Case reportA 68 -year-old woman presented with an ulcerous hemorrhagic mass blocking the left <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa,</b> which had appeared {{a few weeks after}} a wasp sting in the nose. The insect was evacuated only three weeks after the sting. The clinical and radiological data suggested malignancy. Biopsy under local anesthesia proved non-contributory and was complicated by 1 week's hospitalization for severe nosebleed. Surgical excision under video-endoscopy confirmed diagnosis. At 31 months’ follow-up, the patient was free of recurrence. Discussion/conclusionThe pathogeny of lobular capillary hemangioma is uncertain. No previous cases affecting the mucous membrane after insect sting have been reported. Except in the typical contexts of long-term packing or pregnancy, diagnosis can be difficult and misleading. It can mimic a malignant pathology. Its rich vascularization requires caution during biopsy, and the risk of recurrence requires excision to be complete...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To {{compare the}} extent of {{bleeding}} and patient discomfort during packing removal of three different polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) packs: 1) a standard PVA sponge (s-PVA) (Mondocel Standard 10 cm; Mondomed NV, Hamont-Achel, Belgium); 2) a PVA sponge with oxidized cellulose (oc-PVA) (Merocel Hemox 10 cm; Medtronic Xomed Surgical Products, Jacksonville, FL); and 3) a PVA sponge with polyethylene film (pf-PVA) (Merocel 2000 8 cm; Medtronic Xomed Surgical Products, Jacksonville, FL), after functional endoscopic sinus surgery and inferior turbinoplasty. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled trial. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients were enrolled and randomized to receive in each side one pack in the middle meatus and another pack of the same material in the <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa.</b> The patients were equally divided in three groups of 30 patients each. Group A received the pf-PVA; group B received oc-PVA; and group C received s-PVA. Postoperatively, bleeding after removal of the entire nasal packing was evaluated by an observer, whereas the severity of pain was rated by patients with visual analog scales. RESULTS: Our study evaluated three nasal packing materials, demonstrating that the pf-PVA is less painful than the others but with intermediate bleeding ratio. However, the oc-PVA has an intermediate pain score but minimum bleeding. The s-PVA showed the worst pain and bleeding results. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that removal of the second pack (middle meatus) is more painful than the first (<b>nasal</b> <b>fossa),</b> our results suggest that a pf-PVA can {{be placed in the}} middle meatus and a oc-PVA in the <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> in order to reduce patient's discomfort in terms of pain and bleeding...|$|R

From one case observation, we report the clinical features, the diagnosis difficulties and the therapeutic modalities of primary meningioma of the sinonasal tract. Case reportA seventeen-year-old girl consulted for a left unilateral nasal obstruction with progressive evolution without episodes of epistaxis, smell disorder or headaches over a year. Physical examination revealed a grayish polypoid tumor in the left <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa.</b> CT scan evidenced an isodense lesion of the left <b>nasal</b> <b>fossa</b> slightly enhanced pushing back the lateral nasal wall without invasion or intracranial connection. Biopsy was in favour of an inverted papilloma. The tumor was resected via endoscopic approach. Pathological examination established the diagnosis of meningothelial menigioma. The prognosis was favourable without recurrence after a six-month follow-up. ConclusionThe positive diagnosis of primary sinonasal meningioma is difficult to establish because of their infrequent occurrence in this ectopic site and of their non-specific clinical appearance. The final diagnosis rests on the histological examination. Immunohistochemical studies are helpful to establish the accurate diagnosis. Imaging confirms the primitive nature of these tumors.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Lateral {{cephalometry}} {{has been}} widely used to characterize facial and maxillary morphology in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. It is a useful tool to assess orthodontic and maxillofacial procedures, but transverse dimensions of the airway (e. g., nasal framework) have not been well described yet by cephalometry. We explored whether postero-anterior cephalometry could refine {{the analysis of the}} facial morphology, with a special attention paid to nasal morphology. We validated cephalometric measurements relevant to the diagnosis of OSA. Study Design: Controlled study. Methods: We explored postero-anterior and lateral cephalometric bony structures in OSA patients and in control subjects to determine which were predictive of an association with OSA. Healthy volunteers paired for age and sex to OSA patients underwent polysomnography and cephalometry. Data were analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk, Fisher, Wilcoxon, and paired t tests where appropriate. Results: <b>Nasal</b> <b>fossae</b> and maxillary bone proportions were positively and independently associated with the absence of OSA. Measurements of maxillary width, <b>nasal</b> <b>fossae</b> angle, and anterior skull base contributed to the characterization of OSA patients. Conclusions: Postero-anterior cephalometry is an easy, rapid, informative, and reliable technique, which is complementary to the lateral cephalometry in the assessment of OSA patients.

However, the complex anatomical variations seen in the irrigation of the nasal cavity poses a significant surgical challenge. Objective: This paper aims to describe the endoscopic anatomy of the SPA in human cadavers. Materials and Methods: This is a contemporary cross-sectional cohort study carried out between April 2010 and August 2011. The presence of the ethmoidal crest on the lamina perpendicular to the palatine bone and the location of the principal sphenopalatine foramen (PSF) and the accessory sphenopalatine foramen (ASF) were analyzed in 28 cadavers, and the branches emerging from the foramens were counted. Results: Fifty-six <b>nasal</b> <b>fossae</b> were analyzed. The ethmoidal crest was present in 96 % of the cases and was located anteriorly to the PSF in most cases. The PSF was located in the transition area between the middle and the superior meatus in all cases. The ASF was seen in 12 cases. Most <b>nasal</b> <b>fossae</b> (n = 12) presented a single bilateral arterial trunk emerging from the PSF.
