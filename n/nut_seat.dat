The use of CNC {{machine tools}} signal acquisition, two-way {{transmission}} of the temperature sensor data, the ladder design and macro program guide and other methods on {{the implementation of a}} temperature sensing system of smart lubrication function. It is not only low-end CNC machine tools can compensate for deficiencies in equipment protection features and maintenance-free function, but also enhance the diversity of processing. Ultimately by analyzing the different lubrication mode, the relationship between the lubricating oil pressure and temperature and other factors, to draw the function in the lubrication in a stabilizing effect on oil pressure and control bearings and <b>nut</b> <b>seat</b> temperature. It is simple and practical, has important theoretical significance and great value...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} mechanisms that cause bolt loosening, {{which is a}} concern for automobile manufacturers. Specifically, experimental analysis is conducted in order to ascertain stress distribution patterns when bolts loosen under vibration testing conditions. The insights gained from this analysis are then used to reproduce actual machine tests in a simulator based on a technical element model for highly accurate CAE analysis. Looking at pressure distribution on the <b>nut</b> <b>seating</b> surface (the trigger for thread loosening), the authors were able to clearly and rationally clarify {{the degree to which}} this pressure distribution CAE, bolt-loosening, thread portions of nuts and bolts impacted the contact points between nut and bolt threads. The results can contribute to the formulation of problem prevention methods for product design based on a predictive technical evaluation process that does not rely on actual machine testing. ...|$|R
40|$|Inexpensive, {{disposable}} polypropylene chambers {{for testing}} fluids on rat skin {{were made by}} removing the wings from polypropylene wing nuts and by cutting {{into the top of}} each <b>nut</b> a <b>seat</b> for an O-ring. Polypropylene screws with black heads were fabricated as seals for the chambers. After attachment to the backs of rats, these chambers provided a satisfactory means of keeping fluid in contact with the skin for 3 days...|$|R
50|$|On lap 26, Mansell's {{lead was}} 18.8 seconds over Senna, {{but he was}} {{beginning}} to experience cramps in his right leg. A stop for tyres on lap 34 took 18 seconds when the right rear wheel <b>nut</b> refused to <b>seat</b> properly. Holding the brakes on much longer than normal made the Englishman's cramp even worse. Prost, now in second, was struggling with brake and gearbox problems as he stopped for tyres.|$|R
60|$|I'm {{going to}} write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to tell, though I'm not a fine young lady {{traveling}} on the continent. When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less, hadn't diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread <b>nuts</b> over the <b>seat</b> every time they opened their mouths to roar.|$|R
2500|$|The 1979 VAM Pacer {{was exactly}} as the 1978 model {{in terms of}} appearance, with the {{exceptions}} of the previously standard wheel covers and a new hood bright molding with front ornament. All VAM Pacers were featured VAM's inhouse five-spoke wheels with trim rings and chrome volcano hubcaps with exposed lug <b>nuts.</b> New <b>seat</b> designs with a horizontally stripped pattern and Barcelona crests on the headrests as a luxury touch (the same ones used in the AMC Matador Barcelona models), a new steering wheel design with a soft rectangular center button, all-new door panels designs in plastic and vinyl with a rigid top pull strap and sliding locks with woodgrain accents. The headliner was changed to a cloth-wrapped unit. VAM started using {{for the first time}} the net rating system for measuring the output of its engines. This meant that the 1979 VAM [...] six-cylinder engine was now rated at [...] at 3900 rpm. The electrical system was revised with a new fuse box located under the dashboard on the driver's side. A total of 369 VAM Pacers were sold.|$|R
