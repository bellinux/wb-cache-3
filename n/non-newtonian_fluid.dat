40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new theory}} of turbulence in time-independent <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids.</b> The wall layer is modelled in terms of unsteady exchange of viscous momentum between {{the wall and the}} main stream, following the classic visualisation of inrush-sweep-ejection/burst. The thickness of the wall layer is found to be the same for Newtonian and purely viscous <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids,</b> when normalised with the instantaneous wall parameters at the onset of bursting. The results indicate that the mechanisms of turbulence in Newtonian and time-independent fluids are identical when structural similarity relations in turbulence are based on phase-locked parameters linked with the development of secondary flows rather than on time-averaged wall parameters. This similarity analysis collapses the local critical instantaneous friction factor data of both Newtonian and <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> at the point of bursting into a single curve. The method greatly simplifies the analysis of turbulent transport phenomena in <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids.</b> Keywords: Turbulence, time-independent non-Newtonian, Power law, pipe flow, wall layerComment: 28 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{motion and}} {{interactions}} of three equal-interval parallel bubbles in <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> were numerically simulated by {{volume of fluid}} method (VOF), in which the continuous surface tension model and the power-law model were adopted to represent surface tension and rheological properties of <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids,</b> respectively. The computational method was validated by the comparison of the processes of coalescence of two in-line bubbles and rising of two parallel bubbles between experiment and simulation. This method was then applied to study the effect of initial bubble diameter, initial horizontal bubble interval and rheological properties of <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> on lateral coalescence and rising of three parallel bubbles. The dimensionless critical horizontal interval of bubble coalescence was obtained under different physical property conditions. The critical horizontal interval of bubble coalescence decreases {{with the increase of}} initial bubble diameter and flow index of <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids.</b> When the initial horizontal bubble interval is less than the critical horizontal interval of bubble coalescence, three bubbles will coalesce into a bigger bubble. The coalescing bubble could breakup into two identical daughter bubbles when the initial bubble diameter was increased or the flow index of <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> was decreased. Three parallel bubbles rising in <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> will experience repulsive interactions once the initial horizontal bubble interval is greater than the critical horizontal interval of bubble coalescence, the horizontal bubble interval increased gradually owing to the repulsive effect, while the vertical distance between bubbles varied dramatically for spherical bubble and ellipsoidal bubble due to the differences of their flow field structures...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} theoretical {{study has}} been carried out on the flow behavior of both single and multiple phase <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> in porous media. This work is divided into three parts: (1) development of numerical and analytical solutions; (2) theoretical studies of transient flow of <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> in porous media; and (3) applications of well test analysis and displacement efficiency evaluation to field problems. A fully implicit, integral finite difference model has been developed for simulation of <b>non-Newtonian</b> and Newtonian <b>fluid</b> flow through porous media. Several commonly-used rheological models of power-law and Bingham plastic <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> have been incorporated in the simulator. A Buckley-Leverett type analytical solution for one-dimensional, immiscible displacement involving <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> in porous media has been developed. Based on this solution, a graphic approach for evaluating non-Newtonian displacement efficiency has been developed. The Buckley-Leverett-Welge theory is extended to flow problems with <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids.</b> An integral method is also presented for the study of transient flow of Bingham fluids in porous media. In addition, two well test analysis methods have been developed for analyzing pressure transient tests of power-law and Bingham fluids, respectively. Applications are included to demonstrate this new technology. The physical mechanisms involved in immiscible displacement with <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> in porous media have been studied using the Buckley-Leverett type analytical solution. The results show that this kind of displacement is a complicated process and is determined by the rheological properties of the <b>non-Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> and the flow conditions, in addition to relative permeability data. In another study, an idealized fracture model has been used to obtain some insights into the flow of a power-law fluid in a double-porosity medium. For flow at a constant rate, non-Newtonian flow behavior in a fractured medium is characterized by two-parallel straight lines on a log-log plot of injection pressure versus time. Transient flow of a general pseudoplastic fluid has been studied numerically and it has been found that the long time pressure responses tend to be equivalent to that of a Newtonian system...|$|R
