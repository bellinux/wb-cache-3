5|$|If {{the federal}} {{property}} is an enclave, then {{the federal government}} has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded the land to the federal government. The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E
5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party's leader, was a full day ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were {{to be taken care of}} by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} a Hindu belief that {{killing of a}} brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital {{punishment}} was <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> to them. Upper caste kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. {{if there were no}} male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue. Memorials containing hero stones (virkal) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.|$|E

5|$|In 1320 King Edward II of England confiscated the lordship of Gower on {{the grounds}} that Braose had given it to his {{son-in-law}} Mowbray without royal permission. Over the preceding years Braose had promised Gower to a number of persons, including Humphrey de Bohun, the Earl of Hereford, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. Mowbray then in late 1319 took custody of Gower to protect his rights. Despenser persuaded the king in 1320 to take Gower into royal hands in October, and was appointed keeper of the honour in November. The other lords in the Welsh Marches resented this seizure, feeling that the king's excuse for it was <b>not</b> <b>applicable.</b> The seizure was one of the precipitating causes of the baronial rebellion that led to the exile of the Despensers in 1321. In 1322 Gower was given to the younger Despenser again, who then traded it for the honours of Usk and Caerleon. Braose was then induced to sue the new holder of Gower for the return of the barony in April 1324, which action succeeded in June 1324. Braose then promptly gave Gower to the elder Despenser, returning the property to the Despenser family once more. The lordship of Gower eventually ended {{up in the hands of}} the Beauchamp family, but it was not until the 1350s that the issue was decided.|$|E
5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
