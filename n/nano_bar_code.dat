In this work, a novel method of hot embossing lithography for replication of multiple <b>nano</b> <b>bar</b> structure mould was conducted. The effects of hot embossing temperature and pressure on fabrication precision were studied. Linewidth of the pattern on the mould is from 71 nm to 980 nm. The replicas of <b>nano</b> <b>bar</b> structure were fabricated on the PMMA (polymer methyl methacrylate) layer with silicon substrate. The effects of hot embossing and demoulding temperature on replicating quality were also discussed. Experimental results indicate that higher demoulding temperature help to lessen PMMA leftover and improve the duplication quality. The hot embossing and dmoulding temperature of 110 °C～ 120 °C and 60 °C～ 70 °C were obtained to produce high quality duplication of multiple <b>nano</b> <b>bar</b> structures. Micro-grating replicas were also fabricated and demonstrated in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of camera phones provides {{people with a}} mobile platform for decoding <b>bar</b> <b>codes,</b> whereas conventional scanners lack mobility. However, using a normal camera phone in such applications is challenging due to the out-of-focus problem. In this paper, we present the research effort on the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> reading algorithms using a VGA camera phone, NOKIA 7650. EAN- 13, a widely used 1 D <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> standard, is taken as an example to show {{the efficiency of the}} method. A wavelet-based <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> region location and knowledge-based <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> segmentation scheme is applied to extract <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> characters from poor-quality images. All the segmented <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> characters are input to the recognition engine, and based on the recognition distance, the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> character string with the smallest total distance is output as the final recognition result of the <b>bar</b> <b>code.</b> In order to train an efficient recognition engine, the modified Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) method is designed for optimizing a feature extraction matrix and the class reference vectors. 19 584 samples segmented from more than 1000 <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> images captured by NOKIA 7650 are involved in the training process. Testing on 292 <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> images taken by the same phone, the correct recognition rate of the entire <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> set reaches 85. 62 %.

30|$|A <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> {{is made up}} {{of several}} numbers, letters, or symbols, and the same company’s <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> are often only {{slightly}} different [19]. These <b>bar</b> <b>codes,</b> as input elements, are equivalent to a large number of similar keys for Bloom filter. When the hash functions of Bloom filter have some similar input elements, they may ignore the small differences, resulting in the hash function producing the same output on the similar elements and generating false positives [20]. Because a company’s <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> are easy to focus on one section, this will result in more false positives. However, each <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> is unique, and {{the difference between the two}} <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> is certain. Therefore, the characteristic part of the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> can be extracted for mathematical transformation to indicate the difference between similar elements magnified. Thus, the difference between the keys in the hash function of Bloom filter can be enlarged and the false positive rate can be reduced [21].|$|R
