It is also defined by Cenelec {{standard}} EN50075 [...] "Flat <b>non-rewirable</b> two-pole <b>plugs,</b> 2.5 A 250 V, with cord, for the connection of class II-equipment for household and similar purposes", which has national equivalents in most European countries, as described in IEC60083. The Europlug is not rewirable and must be supplied with a flexible cord. Because it is unpolarised, it can be inserted in either direction into a socket, so line and neutral are connected arbitrarily.|$|R
