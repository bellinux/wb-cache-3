500|$|Former world {{champion}} Niki Lauda {{said that he}} did [...] "not understand this completely wrong decision", adding [...] "It's unbelievable how the best driver in yesterday's race makes no mistakes and only gets sixpoints". He called for the formation of permanent race stewards, instead of the temporary steward system currently in place. He called it [...] "the worst judgement in the history of F1", saying, [...] "It's absolutely unacceptable when three influence the championship like this". Three-time {{world champion}} Jackie Stewart said that [...] "F1 attracts the largest capital investment in sport, but it's being overseen by people who are <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> full-time and we get inconsistent decisions".|$|E
500|$|Edward, {{a morally}} {{conflicted}} troll enslaved by Muriel, was voiced by Robin Atkin Downes and played by Derek Mears (Jason Voorhees in 2009's Friday the 13th). Mears was using an elaborate animatronic suit that he compared to [...] "kind of like NASCAR where I’m piloting it but I'm <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> by myself...I think there’s like five guys controlling the individual {{parts of the}} character. There’s one person who does the eye brows, one person does the feet." [...] Janssen, who could not [...] "say enough things about Tommy [...] ", said she was especially impressed at how he stuck to his specific vision and [...] "fought" [...] hard to hire a number of unknown European actors {{that would otherwise be}} unlikely to appear in a big studio American film, in effect making it a much more international production.|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the first}} episode in which Kit Harington and Iwan Rheon filmed scenes {{together}} and met on-screen. Rheon {{said that he had}} always wanted to film scenes with Jon Snow: [...] "Anyone who has asked me, 'Who would you like Ramsay to meet?' My answer has always been, 'Jon Snow.' He's the antithesis of Ramsay. They're almost a yin and a yang. They both come from such a similar place yet they're so different. And even though they're enemies, they've both risen so far as bastards, which is almost incomprehensible, and now they're both here facing each other. They couldn't be any more different, yet more similar." [...] In an interview, Harington talked about the fight scene with Rheon: [...] "I actually did punch Iwan in the face twice by accident, which he took really well. He was really nice about it." [...] According to Rheon, [...] "The way I see it, if you don't get hit a couple of times doing that, you're <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> properly." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Nobody Sees" [...] was {{recorded}} by Powderfinger for their 2007 album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 with producer Rob Schnapf. In {{an interview with}} Jay and the Doctor on Triple J in November 2007, Fanning noted that the song is a [...] "bookend" [...] to Powderfinger's early breakout single [...] "Pick You Up" [...] from Double Allergic. He goes on to note that [...] "It's 'who's going {{to pick you up}} now?'. Cause I'm <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> any more." [...] Fanning also noted that he considers the song a [...] "spacey ballad". Though the band had previously released songs featuring piano, they had decided for this album to record with session pianist Benmont Tench, who previously had played for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who were one of the inspirations of the album. This was in contrast to previous efforts where piano parts had been performed by Fanning or local Australian pianists. Despite Tench's performance on the song, Fanning appears in the music video as playing piano.|$|E
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign that you're <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> right. I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong." ...|$|E

[...] After the race however, underwater camera footage showed winner van der Burgh did three illegal butterfly kicks on the underwater pullout (rules allow for one kick).

He's <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> because I'm telling him he has to go out, or because he's the face of Michigan State football. When he's out there, he's doing it because he believes in doing it." [...] His nephew, Northmont High School linebacker Kaleb Ringer, has recently committed to Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that a belief in a reward after death is poor {{motivation}} for moral behavior while alive. Sam Harris wrote, [...] "It is rather more noble to help people purely {{out of concern for}} their suffering than it is to help them because you think the Creator of the Universe wants you to do it, or will reward you for doing it, or will punish you for <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> The problem with this linkage between religion and morality is that it gives people bad reasons to help other human beings when good reasons are available." ...|$|E
2500|$|Danzig {{has said}} he wishes to avoid {{extensive}} and exhaustive touring in the future, preferring instead to focus on his various music, film and comic book projects: [...] "I don’t really want to tour. My reason for <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> is because I’m bored of it. I like being onstage, but I don’t like sitting around all day doing nothing. I could be home, working." [...] Danzig has started work on a third Black Aria album, and a covers album is set for release {{by the end of}} 2013. Danzig hopes to record a dark blues album involving Jerry Cantrell and Hank III. He is currently working on new Danzig material with Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly.|$|E
2500|$|Max {{teaches the}} {{children}} how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing {{on her way to}} rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with him about the imminent Anschluss, trying to convince him that it is inevitable ("No Way to Stop It"). When he refuses to compromise, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be [...] "An Ordinary Couple". As they marry, the nuns reprise [...] "Maria" [...] against the wedding processional.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eternal officially {{confirmed}} in late 2013 {{that they would}} be reforming for the ITV2 documentary The Big Reunion, although original member Louise Redknapp would not be rejoining the group. Eternal are now Managed by ASM Damage (under their Television Roster). Louise Redknapp {{confirmed in}} an interview with The Times that Eternal were reforming without her. She said: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> because I haven't spoken to the girls in, God, 15 years, and I found out they were doing it via the producers of the programme" [...] and wished them well saying [...] "But they'll be great on the Big Reunion, they're such talented girls". Following the announcement of the group's reformation, their 1997 Greatest Hits album climbed to number 1 on the ITunes hip hop chart in January 2014. Following the group's episode airing, their Greatest Hits album entered at number 27 in the official ITunes chart.

2500|$|Many of the {{executives}} {{involved in the}} botched transition and later changes subsequently left NBC. Zucker was fired by Comcast Executive Vice President Steve Burke, but stressed that the late-night conflict was not to blame, but rather Comcast's insistence to install their own team. Marc Graboff opted to leave his contract early that November, as did Gaspin. While O'Brien admitted in 2012 that he occasionally still felt resentment over the events that transpired, he noted that [...] "I had an amazing partnership with NBC and was very disappointed at the outcome, but I didn't feel entitled to Late Night or Tonight or to the TBS show. If you're in this business and haven't experienced profound pain at some point, you're <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> right. I strongly believe that." [...] He has had no contact with Leno, noting [...] "the odds are we will both leave this Earth without speaking to each other, which is fine. There's really nothing to say. We both know the deal.
