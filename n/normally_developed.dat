6000|$|Our ancestors, {{like the}} author of the [...] "Faery Queen," [...] {{translated}} and admired Du Bellay and Ronsard; to some critics of our own time this taste seems a modish affectation. For one, I have ever found an original charm in the lyrics of the Pleiad, and have taken great delight in Hugo's amazing variety of music, in the romance of Alfred de Musset, in the beautiful cameos of Gautier. What is poetical, if not the [...] "Song of Roland," [...] the only true national epic since Homer? What is frank, natural verse, if not that of the old Pastourelles? Where is there naivete of narrative and unconscious charm, if not in Aucassin et Nicolette? In the long <b>normally</b> <b>developed</b> literature of France, so variously rich, we find the nearest analogy to the literature of Greece, though that of England contains greater masterpieces, and her verse falls more winningly on the ear. France has no Shakespeare and no Milton; we have no Moliere and no [...] "Song of Roland." [...] One star differs from another in glory, but it is a fortunate moment when this planet of France swims into our ken. Many of our generation saw it first through Mr. Swinburne's telescope, heard of it in his criticisms, and are grateful to that watcher of the skies, even if we do not share all his transports. There then arose at Oxford, out of old French, and old oak, and old china, a [...] "school" [...] or [...] "movement." [...] It was aesthetic, and an early purchaser of Mr. William Morris's wall papers. It existed ten or twelve years before the public [...] "caught on," [...] as they say, to these delights. But, except {{one or two of the}} masters, the school were only playing at aesthetics, and laughing at their own performances. There was more fun than fashion in the cult, which was later revived, developed, and gossiped about more than enough.|$|E

Results indicated qualitative and quantitative differences in the use of scaffolding strategies by mothers of SLI children. Indeed, they produced significantly more linguistic scaffolding strategies than mothers of <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> and younger control children in both situations.

40|$|Phonological {{short-term}} memory capacity is generally {{measured with a}} word span task or a digit span task. Another way to measure it {{is to use a}} nonword repetition task. Gathercole and Adams (1993) claimed that this procedure can be used with children as young as two-years old. It seems that in <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children the quality of nonword repetition is influenced both by the length of nonwords and by the degree of wordlikeness. Can the phonological {{short-term memory}} of individuals with Down syndrome be assessed with a nonword repetition task? In order to answer this question, we decided to replicate Gathercole and collaborators' experiments (1991, 1993) but with individuals with Down syndrome. The quality of nonword repetition in individuals with Down syndrome is, as in <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children, influenced both by the length of nonwords and by their degree of wordlikeness. Furthermore, our results seem to confirm the hypothesis which states that nonwords are temporarily stored in the phonological short-term memory system. As this system has a limited capacity, both <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children and people with Down syndrome recall more short nonwords than long nonwords. In conclusion, nonword repetition is a reliable task with which to assess phonological short-term memory in individuals with Down syndrome as well as in <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children.

40|$|Background: The study {{investigated}} the development of theory-of-mind (ToM) knowledge in children with 'lesser variants' of autism (PDD-NOS) over a period thought to be critical for ToM development (i. e., 3 to 5 years of age). Method: The sample included 11 children with PDD-NOS; 23 <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children were included for cross-sectional comparison and 13 <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children for longitudinal comparison. The groups were comparable in verbal and non-verbal mental age. Two storybooks were used for repeated assessment of {{various aspects of the}} children's theory of mind: emotion recognition, the distinction between physical and mental entities, prediction of behaviour and emotions on the basis of desires and prediction of behaviour and emotions on the basis of beliefs. Results: The results showed that the children with PDD-NOS had specific difficulties in understanding and predicting other people's emotions on the basis of situational cues, desires and beliefs. However, their ability to predict actions from beliefs and desires were relatively intact. Compared to the <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children, these children achieved lower levels of theory-of-mind knowledge, both at time of initial assessment and approximately 6 months later. Conclusions: The data suggest that the theory-of-mind development of children with PDD-NOS is both delayed and deviant. The growth pattern of theory-of-mind skills in children with PDD-NOS seemed to be qualitatively different from the growth pattern found in the group of <b>normally</b> <b>developing</b> children...|$|R
