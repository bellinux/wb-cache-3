50|$|To arrest movement, {{the method}} {{commonly}} employs a small gravity or spring-actuated lever {{paired with a}} <b>notched</b> <b>wheel.</b> The lever is mounted on a pivot point in proximity to the wheel.|$|E
50|$|An anchor {{windlass}} is {{a machine}} that restrains and manipulates the anchor chain on a boat, allowing the anchor to be raised and lowered by means of chain cable. A <b>notched</b> <b>wheel</b> engages the links of the chain or the rope.|$|E
50|$|The {{parking pawl}} locks the {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a <b>notched</b> <b>wheel</b> on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|E
40|$|An {{assembly}} of three major components is disclosed {{which included a}} wrist interface plate which is secured to the wrist joint of a robotic arm, a tool interface plate which is secured to each tool intended {{for use by the}} robotic arm, and a tool holster for each tool attached to the interface plate. The wrist interface plate and a selected tool interface plate are mutually connectable together through an opening or recess in the upper face of the interface plate by means of a notched tongue protruding from the front face of the wrist interface plate which engages a pair of spring-biased rotatable <b>notched</b> <b>wheels</b> located within the body of the tool interface plate. The tool holster captures and locks onto the tool interface plate by means of a pair of actuation claws including a locking tab and an unlocking wedge which operate respective actuation bosses on each of the <b>notched</b> <b>wheels</b> in response to a forward and backward motion of the tool interface plate as a result of motion of the robotic arm to either park the tool or use the tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{specification}} discloses a robot {{for inspection}} adapted to travel virtually unlimited distances through small-diameter enclosed spaces such as conduits or ducts, preferably using a fluid-driven screw-drive propulsion system. The robot preferably includes {{a plurality of}} wheels inclined at an angle greater than zero degrees and less than ninety degrees to the longitudinal axis of the pipe, a plurality of wheels aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pipe, and a power system for causing relative rotation of the sections bearing the pitched and non-pitched wheels. The robot may include internal fluid flow passages, <b>notched</b> <b>wheels,</b> multiple retractable wheels, and is configured so as to have an operating diameter less than six and preferably less than two inches...|$|R
50|$|The {{angle of}} the {{backside}} of the notch is severe (usually 90 degrees or greater {{to the end of}} the lever) so that the lever cannot be pushed up or out of the <b>notch</b> if <b>wheel</b> attempts to turn in the opposite direction. The lever is jammed between the back of the notch and its pivot point, stopping movement in that direction against any force that the materials used can withstand. The wheel has little resistance moving in the direction desired, other than that required to lift or push the lever over the next notch.|$|R
50|$|Two early {{improvements}} were suspension {{wheels and}} rim gearing. Suspension wheels are {{constructed in the}} same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a <b>notched</b> <b>wheel</b> to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub gear engaged the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft rotation was geared up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by William Fairburn can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the Portland Basin Canal Warehouse.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1950s or before, Bendix Pacific designed, tested, and {{manufactured}} hydraulic components and systems, {{primarily for the}} military. In the same facility avionics and other electronic hardware was designed, manufactured, and documented in technical manuals. Much of this operation was relocated to a new facility in Sylmar, CA where they had a large deep indoor pool for testing sonar. Telemetry components for the RIM-8 Talos surface-to-air missile included transmitters and oscillators in various frequency bands; the missile itself was designed and built by Bendix. They built and installed the telemetry system in all the ground stations for the first manned space flights. For this program, they developed the first cardio tachometer and respiration rate monitor system so that a ground-based physician could observe an astronaut's vital signs. MK46 torpedo electronics also came from this facility. Other diverse products included radar detectors in aircraft that identified ground missile tracking and ground missile launch at the aircraft. In the 1960s they produced an anti-lock brake system for military aircraft using established technology similar to Dunlop's earlier Maxaret. The technology {{is similar to the}} <b>notched</b> <b>wheel</b> and reluctor now used in cars.|$|E
50|$|Wheeling played {{its first}} rugby sevens tournament in September 2012, where Wheeling {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} MAC Sevens despite fielding a team composed entirely of freshmen. <b>Wheeling</b> <b>notched</b> its first win in fifteens on September 8, 2012, when Wheeling defeated the West Virginia Mountaineers 10-6 at home {{in front of a}} large crowd at James Larosa Stadium.|$|R
5000|$|The styling for all Nash {{vehicles}} at {{that time}} was an amalgam of designs from Pininfarina of Italy and the in-house Nash design team. The different models from Ambassador down to the Metropolitan utilised very similar design features (fully enclosed front <b>wheels,</b> <b>notched</b> [...] "pillow" [...] style door pressing, bar style grille etc.). Whilst Nash used the fact that styling was by Pininfarina in their advertising for their larger models, Pininfarina refused to allow his name {{to be associated with the}} Metropolitan as he felt it would damage his reputation with other Italian car companies to be linked to such a small car.|$|R
