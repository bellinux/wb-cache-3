5000|$|The use of azurite and {{malachite}} as copper ore indicators led indirectly to {{the name}} of the element nickel in the English language.

This resemblance resulted in occasional attempts to smelt nickeline in the belief that it was copper ore, but such attempts always ended in failure due to high smelting temperatures needed to reduce nickel. In Germany this deceptive mineral {{came to be known as}} kupfernickel, literally [...] "copper demon". The Swedish alchemist Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (who had been trained by Georg Brandt, the discoverer of the nickel-like metal cobalt) realized that there was probably a new metal hiding within the kupfernickel ore, and in 1751 he succeeded in smelting kupfernickel to produce a previously unknown (except in certain meteorites) silvery white, iron-like metal.

To this end, two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study arsenic speciation under simulated U-leaching conditions, with the use of model arsenide minerals, namely <b>niccolite</b> (NiAs), rammelsbergite (NiAs$ sb 2 $) and gersdorffite (NiAsS); and (b) statistically designed tests involving actual leaching of samples of the Key Lake ore. <b>Niccolite</b> and rammelsbergite were found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ in solution as oppossed to gersdorffite, which was found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ was found to be metastable in the Fe$ sb 2 $(SO$ sb 4) sb 3 $ leaching system, while in the FeCl$ sb 3 $ and pressure (O$ sb 2 $) leaching systems, further oxidation to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $ was observed to take place at relatively slow rates. A mechanism has been advanced to account for the latter slow oxidation of H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. Finally, it was concluded that the formation of As(III) /As(V) in oxidative acid leaching is independent of the prevailing suspension redox potential which, in turn, renders impractical the possible stabilization of As(III) via potential control. The solubility of RaSO$ sb 4 $ in HCl-MeCl$ sb{ rm x}$ leaching media was quantitatively established by employing the "reduced activity coefficient" method.

Isochemical contact metamor-phism of an early skarn stage (stage I) is displayed by the presence of anhydrous Ca–Al–Mg skarn minerals at the contact between granite and recrystallized limestone.

40|$|Heteroepitaxial {{growth of}} {{magnetic}} materials (e. g. ferromagnets) onto III-V semiconductors (e. g. GaAs and InP) based on spin injection methods has received great attention {{due to their}} potential applications in spintronics. However, the formation of distinct surface states, highly mismatched heterointerfaces, and the consequent lower spin polarisation of the ferromagnets have been regarded as major challenges. Therefore, comprehensive understanding the surface and interface properties to select the better magnetic materials for growth are of great importance. In recent studies, MnSb thin films have been successfully grown on GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). During the thin film growth, significant surface variations including surface reconstruction, atomic diffusion, {{and the formation of}} secondary phases [cubic MnSb (c-MnSb) ] have been observed. Hence, the formation of the surface defects (atomic segregation/surface reconstruction) and secondary phases for the <b>niccolite</b> MnSb(n-MnSb) /GaAs heterostructures are presented in this thesis using first-principles calculations. Experimentally, a number of surface reconstructions of n-MnSb(0001) have been found after the growth of MnSb thin films on GaAs(111) B substrates, wherein the (2 × 2) surface reconstruction is prevalent. Therefore, quantitative surface structure of MnSb(0001) - (2 × 2) determination is presented, using density functional theory (DFT) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) data fitting methods. Atomic out-diffusion and surface segregation of Ga has been found in the MnSb(0001) /GaAs(111) system by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) measurements. DFT calculations are used to explain these results. In addition, an optimal concentration of the diffused Ga atoms has been shown by comparing the formation energy/surface energy change. Modifications in the structural and electronic properties [atomic bond length, atomic bond angle, charge density difference, and density of states (DOS) ] of the Ga-in-MnSb(0001) system are discussed. Finally, the formation mechanism of c-MnSb polymorph through thermodynamic phase transition caused by Ga segregation in MnSb(0001) /GaAs(111) B has been presented. Atomic relaxation of the model structures driven by Ga substitution into Mn sites at the subsurface layers provides critical insights for the evolution of secondary c-MnSb polymorph. Further theoretical prediction of the new system (MnSb/GaSb) with the cubic polymorph is also provided. All the theoretical models, calculations, and results presented give a crucial guideline for epitaxial growth of half-metallic c-MnSb {{for the next generation of}} magnetic applications. ...|$|E
40|$|The Rabbit Lake in-pit {{tailings}} body {{consisted of}} alternating layers of ice, frozen tailings and unfrozen tailings which varied in consistency from a slurry to a firm silty sand. The tailings solids are predominately composed of quartz (16 to 36 %), calcium sulphate (0. 3 to 54 %) and illite (3 and 14 %). Arsenic and Ni {{concentrations in the}} tailings showed similar patterns with depth, which were strongly related to historical changes in As and Ni concentrations in the mill feed. Mineralogy of the ore bodies indicated that As and Ni in the mill feed occurred primarily as 1 : 1 molar ratio arsenides such as <b>niccolite</b> and gersdorffite. SEM analysis suggested that solubilized arsenic is precipitated as Ca, Fe and Ni arsenates during the neutralization process. Dissolved arsenic concentrations in rive monitoring wells installed within the tailing body ranged from 9. 6 to 71 mg/L. Sequential extraction analyses of tailings samples showed that As above 34 in depth was primarily associated with amorphous iron and metal hydroxides while the As below 34 m depth was primarily amorphous calcium arsenate precipitates. The high Ca/As ratio during tailings neutralization would likely preferentially precipitate Ca 4 (OH) 2 (AsO 4) 2 : 4 H 2 O. Geochemical modeling suggested that the pore fluid calcium arsenate equilibrium As concentrations would range between 13 and 81 mg/L. The predicted pH and speciation of arsenic in the filter sand was dependent on the redox conditions (oxidizing or reducing) assigned to the regional groundwater. Reducing conditions in the regional groundwater cause As, the dominant species in the tailings, to be reduced to As 34 as arsenic diffuses from the tailings into the filter sand. Under reducing conditions, iron as Fe 2 + in the filter sand is oxidized to Fe 3 + as the sulphate (S 6 +) present in the tailings diffuses into the filter sand and is reduced to sulphide (S 2). The pH in the tailings will decrease as the high concentrations of protons (lower pH) in the filter sand diffuse into the tailings. As the solubility of calcium arsenate minerals present in the tailings are pH dependent, the decrease in pH in the tailings causes an increase in solubility of the calcium arsenate minerals resulting in the dissolution of calcium arsenate minerals...|$|E

40|$|A total field {{magnetic}} {{survey was conducted}} in Harwood valley in Northern Teesdale, and the neighbouring area, to investigate the igneous intrusions which could {{be the cause of}} a magnetic anomaly and metasomatism in the mineralization of the area. <b>Niccolite</b> and other nickel-bearing minerals had been found in magnetite-rich ore at three localities in Harwood valley by a team of the British Geological Survey. This mineral assemblage has only been sighted in a few other zones and the cause of mineralization was assumed to be metamorphism due to the emplacement of the Whin Sill and associated dykes during the late Carboniferous-early Permian age. Magnetic profiles recently acquired in the area confirm the existence of a dyke intruding the Teesdale fault along the Harwood valley. The average amplitude of the anomaly is 350 nT, reversed with respect to the present field. Further investigations to the south-east and north-west of the valley relate the intrusion with the known outcrops of the Cleveland dyke (Tertiary). An outcrop of an igneous intrusion that bears similar properties with samples of the Cleveland dyke rock was recently sighted by the author at lower Langdon Beck near the confluence of the Tees and Harwood rivers. Thin sections of this rock displayed an identical match in grain size and pigment composition with the Cleveland dyke samples from other known outcrops, confirming the dyke's presence along the Teesdale Fault. 2. 5 D modelling of the magnetic profiles was carried out and the results reflect the depth {{to the top of the}} dyke at Harwood to be about 30 m. Thickness of the body varies from 5 to 25 m but is 12 m at Harwood and about 14 m in Etters Gill. Further south of the valley at Langdon Beck is another geological formation; the Burtreeford Disturbance. This is a series of faulting and folding that was a result of compressional stress (Permian age) from a WSW direction. It also produced the E- facing monoclinal folds of the Dent Fault zone and the easterly directed Pennine thrusts of the Cross Fell Inlier before, during and after the emplacement of the Whin. The study here reflects the Disturbance as a magnetic high and its confluence with the Teesdale fault, the inferred Cleveland dyke and the Whin Sill offers a complex interpretation challenge. A GIS data base for the project area was created using Arc-GIS, GRAVMAG, SURFER,DIDGER and other Microsoft Office applications. General interpretation of the anomalies is conducted but conclusions raise several questions. The cause of the mineralization in Harwood Valley is still uncertain, though it could be due to the cooling Cleveland dyke (58 Ma) or the dyke could be forming a passage for the fluids of unknown age from the lower crust or mantle that cool and crystallize at shallower depths...|$|E
40|$|Rocks forming {{part of the}} Main-Bird Series and the Kimberley-Elsburg Series of the Upper Division of the Witwatersrand System {{are found}} in the mine. The {{sequence}} studied starts with the Middle or MB 6 Zone of the Livingstone Stage followed by the Upper or MB 5 Zone. The Vaal Roof, forming the base of the Vaal Stage, rests disconformably on the older rocks. The Stage is subdivided into the Vaal Reef Zone, the Lower Vaal Zone, the Argillaceous Zone and the Upper Vaal Zone. The lower and upper contacts of the Argillaceous Zone are gradational. The Kimberley Stage follows unconformably and comprises the basal Gold Estates Conglomerate Zone, the Denny's Zone and the Gold Estates Zone. The overlying Elsburg Stage may be subdivided into the Bastard Zone and the Upper Elsburg Zone on lithological grounds. Most of the rocks are indurated quartz wackes with only a few orthoquartzite horizons such as the Denny's Zone and the immediate hangingwall of the Vaal Reef. Microscopically the rocks consist of detrital quartz and chert grains in a fine-grained sericitic to partly siliceous matrix which may constitute more than 50 per cent of the rock. Heavy minerals, such as zircon, chromite, rutile, leucoxone, pyrite, tourmaline, epidete, apetite and magnetite, occur in most of the zones. The Vaal Reef, the economic horizon, is of small-pebble, oligomictic conglomerate, often containing thucholite seams and granules, and varying in thickness from a mere parting to more than five feet. There appears to be a correlation between greater pebble size and higher ore grade but no correlation of sorting coefficients and gold value. The mineralogy of the Vaal Reef was studied by means of polished sections and heavy mineral concentrates. The minerals identified include gold, pyrite of several ages, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, uraninite, galena, brannerite, gersdorffite or cobaltite, skutterudite, linnacite, danaite, <b>niccolite,</b> pentlandite, magnotite, zircon, chromite, rutile, leucoxine, monazite, sphalerite, tourmaline, and fluorite. From a study of the silver content of gold in the Vaal Roof it is concluded that the variations in apparent fineness are a reflection of the composition of the gold in the original source rocks. There is a definite uranium-gold relationship in the Vaal Roof. With increase in grade the amount of U₃O₈ increases but the U₃O₈:AU ratio decreases. Use of these reations may indciate the payability in cases of incomplete core recovery. The intrusive rocks were studies in detail. Six types of intrusive rocks were found. From oldest to youngest those are quartz diabase (of three varieties), amygdaloidal diabase, ilmenite mela-microdiorite, mottled microdiorite, olivine lamprophyre and ankeritic beforsite, ranging in age from Lower Ventersdorp to post-Karroo. Most of the intrusives are highly altered due to the effects of regional metamorphism and deuteric alteration.
