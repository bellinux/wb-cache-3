25|$|Erythropoietin {{has been}} shown to exert its effects by binding to the {{erythropoietin}} receptor (EpoR). EPO binds to the erythropoietin receptor on the red cell progenitor surface and activates a JAK2 signaling cascade. This initiates the STAT5, PIK3 and Ras MAPK pathways. This results in differentiation, survival and proliferation of the erythroid cell. SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS are also expressed which act as negative regulators of the cytokine signal. High level erythropoietin receptor expression is localized to erythroid progenitor cells. While there are reports that EPO receptors are found {{in a number of other}} tissues, such as heart, muscle, kidney and peripheral/central nervous tissue, those results are confounded by <b>nonspecificity</b> of reagents such as anti-EpoR antibodies.

5000|$|There are {{two methods}} {{involved}} in immunolabeling, {{the direct and}} the indirect methods. In the direct method of immunolabeling, the primary antibody is conjugated directly to the tag. [...] The direct method is useful in minimizing cross-reaction, a measure of <b>nonspecificity</b> that is inherent in all antibodies and that is multiplied with each additional antibody used to detect an antigen. However, the direct method is far less practical than the indirect method, and is not commonly used in laboratories, since the primary antibodies must be covalently labeled, which require an abundant supply of purified antibody. Also, the direct method is potentially far less sensitive than the indirect method. [...] Since several secondary antibodies are capable of binding to different parts, or domains, of a single primary antibody binding the target antigen, there is more tagged antibody associated with each antigen. More tag per antigen results in more signal per antigen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the {{reticulin}} silver stain is reviewed by Puchtler et al. (1978). The abstract of this paper says:Maresch (1905) introduced Bielschowsky's silver impregnation technic for neurofibrils as a stain for reticulum fibers, but emphasized the <b>nonspecificity</b> of such procedures. This lack of specificity has been confirmed repeatedly. Yet, since the 1920s the definition of [...] "reticulin" [...] and studies of its distribution were based solely on silver impregnation technics. The chemical mechanism and specificity of this group of stains is obscure. Application of Gömöri's and Wilder's methods to human tissues showed variations of staining patterns with the fixatives and technics employed. Besides reticulum fibers, various other tissue structures, e.g. I bands of striated muscle, fibers in nervous tissues, and model substances, e.g. polysaccharides, egg white, gliadin, were also stained. Deposition of silver compounds on reticulum fibers was limited to an easily removable substance; the remaining collagen component did not bind silver. These histochemical studies indicate that silver impregnation technics for reticulum fibers have no chemical significance and cannot be considered as histochemical technics for [...] "reticulin" [...] or type III collagen.|$|E
50|$|EPO {{is highly}} glycosylated (40% of total {{molecular}} weight), with half-life in blood around five hours. EPO's half-life may vary between endogenous and various recombinant versions. Additional glycosylation or other alterations of EPO via recombinant technology {{have led to}} the increase of EPO's stability in blood (thus requiring less frequent injections). EPO binds to the erythropoietin receptor on the red cell progenitor surface and activates a JAK2 signaling cascade. This initiates the STAT5, PIK3 and Ras MAPK pathways.

5000|$|Despite the {{functional}} {{evidence for a}} role for Rel-family transcription factors in the nervous system, {{it is still not}} clear that the neurological effects of NF-κB reflect transcriptional activation in neurons. Most manipulations and assays are performed in the mixed-cell environments found in vivo, in [...] "neuronal" [...] cell cultures that contain significant numbers of glia, or in tumor-derived [...] "neuronal" [...] cell lines. When transfections or other manipulations have been targeted specifically at neurons, the endpoints measured are typically electrophysiology or other parameters far removed from gene transcription. Careful tests of NF-κB-dependent transcription in highly purified cultures of neurons generally show little to no NF-κB activity. Some of the reports of NF-κB in neurons appear to have been an artifact of antibody <b>nonspecificity.</b> Of course, artifacts of cell culture—e.g., removal of neurons from the influence of glia—could create spurious results as well. But this has been addressed in at least two coculture approaches. Moerman et al. used a coculture format whereby neurons and glia could be separated after treatment for EMSA analysis, and they found that the NF-κB induced by glutamatergic stimuli was restricted to glia (and, intriguingly, only glia that had been in the presence of neurons for 48 hours). The same investigators explored the issue in another approach, utilizing neurons from an NF-κB reporter transgenic mouse cultured with wild-type glia; glutamatergic stimuli again failed to activate in neurons. Some of the DNA-binding activity noted under certain conditions (particularly that reported as constitutive) appears to result from Sp3 and Sp4 binding to a subset of κB enhancer sequences in neurons. This activity is actually inhibited by glutamate and other conditions that elevate intraneuronal calcium. In the final analysis, the role of NF-κB in neurons remains opaque due to the difficulty of measuring transcription in cells that are simultaneously identified for type. Certainly, learning and memory could be influenced by transcriptional changes in astrocytes and other glial elements. And it should be considered that there could be mechanistic effects of NF-κB aside from direct transactivation of genes.|$|E

These findings were further examined by analysis of a small number of samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results identified inadequacies in the specificity of the direct RIA and failed to provide evidence for an effect of feed intake on melatonin secretion. Instead, it appeared that feed restriction exacerbated <b>nonspecificity</b> in the direct RIA. The cause of <b>nonspecificity,</b> and its effect on analysis of daily plasma melatonin profiles, were examined. The plasma component(s) responsible for <b>nonspecificity</b> was (were) not identified. However, the results suggest that characteristics of the antiserum used in the direct RIA are involved in the mechanism by which <b>nonspecificity</b> is induced. Results obtained using the extracted assay revealed that plasma melatonin concentrations in prepubertal gilts and pregnant sows exhibit a diurnal pattern, in which concentrations are low during daylight and modestly increased during darkness. Using the direct RIA, the same profiles exhibited highly variable melatonin concentrations showing little association with the light-dark cycle. Thus, assay specificity was identified as a factor contributing to inconsistencies in the literature describing plasma melatonin in the domestic pig and the importance of rigorous validation of RIAs was demonstrated. Furthermore, the results indicate that plasma melatonin concentrations in domestic pigs, as in other mammalian species, are entrained by the light-dark cycle...|$|E

40|$|High {{throughput}} {{screening methods}} such as yeast surface display (YSD) are frequently able to isolate high affinity antibodies against clinical targets; however, {{the success of these}} candidates depends on selecting for both on-target binding and desirable biophysical characteristics. Development liabilities, including antibody aggregation and <b>nonspecificity,</b> can lead to problems during production and poor pharmacokinetics (PK). The exact structural and sequence determinants causing this poor developability are unknown, which leads to inexact methods to correct otherwise promising clinical candidates. In this thesis we outline the development of high throughput methods to interrogate developability of candidate antibodies on the surface of yeast and apply these methods to both determine the causes of <b>nonspecificity</b> and create new libraries with improved biophysical properties. We first analyzed methods for early stage assessment of monoclonal antibodies, finding a polyspecificity reagent (PSR) binding assay on the surface of yeast which can accurately predict antibody clearance rates in mice. While robust, this assay relies on production of a poorly defined mixture of protein components, and thus, we next looked at potential alternatives to a multicomponent PSR reagent. We found that chaperone proteins may work as well-defined, easily producible reagents with similar broad predictive power to predict downstream antibody behavior. Next, we applied these assays to assess core determinants of <b>nonspecificity.</b> We first analyzed a case study of two antibodies with identical target antigens but vastly different performance on preclinical assessments of biophysical characteristics. Through this matched case, we found differences in clearance rates can be driven wholly by variable-region mediated effects independent of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding. Focused on the antibody variable region, we next utilized our <b>nonspecificity</b> assay as a sorting tool to look at a naive repertoire library. We found significant <b>nonspecificity</b> in the VH 6 class of antibodies, driven by a poorly behaved complementarity determining region (CDR) H 2 sequence. Subsequently, we applied a similar sorting technique to two synthetic library designs to identify a set of motifs that can drive <b>nonspecificity.</b> These included motifs containing tryptophan, valine, glycine and arginine located in CDR H 3. We then applied these discoveries to the design of a new, semi-synthetic single chain variable fragment (scFv) library and demonstrated its ability to isolate high affinity, highly specific candidate clones against a panel of antigens. Finally, we explored the use of an alternate yeast display system capable of easily switching between scFv-Fc display and secretion, which may aid in the rapid development and testing of candidate antibodies. Taken in whole, the work in this thesis aids the clinical development of antibodies. We have presented both methods to assess <b>nonspecificity</b> at an early stage in the development process as well as a set of motifs to be eliminated in future library designs. With these combined findings, we hope to increase the utilization of in vitro screening {{methods such as}} yeast display for the isolation of clinical candidate antibodies with favorable biophysical characteristics. by Ryan L.

This paper examines the semantics, the measurement, {{and the combination}} of possibilistic support for evidential reasoning.

Using the ‘fuzzy sets as points’ representation, possibility distributions may be represented as points in an n-dimensional cube.

Employing this representation, geometric measures of uncertainty in possibilistic support are proposed. The <b>nonspecificity</b> of a possibility distribution, {{the degree to which}} the support assignment fails to designate a single hypothesis, is defined as the minimal distance to a distribution that uniquely designates a single hypothesis.

The use of <b>nonspecificity</b> of concrete cracking {{as a measure of}} cracking variability is proposed. Non-specificity is a type of uncertainty associated with having multiple alternatives to define variables (e. g. modulus of rupture, tensile strength to describe cracking). <b>Nonspecificity</b> in cracking can be described by considering cracking strength interval. Using a cracking strength interval, deflection intervals of FRP-RC beams are calculated. Deflection is modeled using cracked plane frame analysis integrated with recent models describing concrete tension stiffening with fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) reinforcement. A deflection database of FRP-RC beams is developed and examined. The uncertainty in deflection prediction is evaluated by comparing the measured deflection from the database with respect to the predicted deflection interval. The significance of deflection prediction parameters on the uncertainty in predicting deflection of FRP-RC beams was analyzed.
