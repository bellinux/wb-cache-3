40|$|Institutional {{and small}} investors, {{financial}} analysts {{and other key}} stakeholders are demanding more information about long-term strategies and profitability of companies. The growing information needs seemingly force managers to disclose more: (1) operational information, (2) performance analysis and (3) forward-looking data. However, little evidence is available concerning company’s disclosure policies addressed to stakeholders other than investors. This paper studies the <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> available on the web sites of 36 leading companies across Italy and U. S, the main objective is to describe companies’ information patterns {{in order to better}} understand voluntary disclosure choices. In particular, observed disclosures are presented through an original framework that purports to combine strategic and stakeholder reporting. This framework is based on seven perspectives that highlight information addressed to key stakeholders categories and information concerning business effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, an index attempts to measure the disclosure’s quality and it provides a first analysis of differences amongst industries and countries. A limited, but strategic, use of the <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> seems to influence the observed companies’ disclosure policies. Furthermore, cultural effects are likely to affect forms, quality and types of information released. These findings may be useful in providing an insight to further research on voluntary information addressed to stakeholders, other than investors, and they could also be helpful to accounting organizations that are attempting to regulate and control disclosure practices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Remote {{access to}} {{dynamically}} changing <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> is a required functionality for various network services, including routing and instances of context-sensitive networking. Three fundamentally different strategies for such access are investigated in this paper: (1) a reactive approach {{initiated by the}} requesting entity, and two versions of proactive approaches in which the entity that contains the <b>information</b> <b>element</b> actively propagates its changes to potential requesters, either (2) periodically or triggered by changes of the <b>information</b> <b>element</b> (3). This paper first develops a set of analytic models to compute different performance metrics for these approaches, with special focus on the so-called mismatch probability. The results of the analytic models allow for design decisions on which strategy to implement for specific input parameters (change rate of the <b>information</b> <b>element,</b> network delay characterization) and specific requirements on mismatch probability, traffic overhead, and access delay. Finally, the analysis {{is applied to the}} use-case of context-sensitive service discovery...|$|R
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{importance and}} utilization of 'party line' information by air carrier flight crews was investigated through pilot surveys and a flight simulation study. The Importance, Availability, and Accuracy of party line <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> were explored through surveys of pilots of several operational types. The survey identified numerous traffic and weather party line <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> which were considered important. These elements were scripted into a full-mission flight simulation which examined {{the utilization of}} party line information by studying subject responses to specific <b>information</b> <b>element</b> stimuli. The awareness of the different Party Line elements varied, and awareness was also affected by pilot workload. In addition, pilots were aware of some traffic <b>information</b> <b>elements,</b> but were reluctant to act on Party Line Information alone. Finally, the importance of party line information appears to be greatest for operations near or on the airport. This indicates that caution should be exercised when implementing datalink communications in tower and close-in terminal control sectors...|$|R

40|$|International audienceObjective The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether food package information is legible {{in a real}} purchase context; more specifically, it examined the level of legibility of non-mandatory, mandatory and nutritional information {{as well as the}} influence of age on legibility. This is an important issue, especially for older consumers who are usually advised to pay attention to their diet. Design An in-store study was conducted in a French hypermarket. Descriptive statistics were used to measure the overall level of legibility and then ANOVA tests were carried out to examine the influence of age on the legibility of information. Complementary results included the influence of level of education. Setting Participants were asked to read information on four food packages when they were food shopping. Subjects The sample included 196 consumers aged 18 – 82 years. Results An asymmetry was observed between the extremely high level of legibility of <b>non-mandatory</b> <b>information</b> and the low level of legibility of mandatory and nutritional information provided on food packages. Elderly respondents performed significantly worse than their younger counterparts. An interaction effect was found between age and level of education on the legibility of mandatory information. Conclusions Legibility of mandatory information is clearly unsatisfactory. There appears to be a hierarchy between significant, but <b>non-mandatory,</b> company <b>information</b> and important mandatory and nutritional information. The first type of information is promoted on food packages whereas the last two are all but concealed to older and less educated consumers...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review a {{particular}} connection between information theory and group theory. We formalize {{the notions of}} <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> and <b>information</b> lattices, first proposed by Shannon. Exploiting this formalization, we expose a comprehensive parallelism between information lattices and subgroup lattices. Qualitatively, isomorphisms between information lattices and subgroup lattices are demonstrated. Quantitatively, a decisive approximation relation between the entropy structures of information lattices and the log-index structures of the corresponding subgroup lattices, first discovered by Chan and Yeung, is highlighted. This approximation, addressing both joint and common entropies, extends the work of Chan and Yeung on joint entropy. A consequence of this approximation result is that any continuous law holds in general for the entropies of <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> {{if and only if}} the same law holds in general for the log-indices of subgroups. As an application, by constructing subgroup counterexamples, we find surprisingly that common information, unlike joint information, obeys neither the submodularity nor the supermodularity law. We emphasize that the notion of <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> is conceptually significant—formalizing it helps to reveal the deep connection between information theory and group theory. The parallelism established in this paper admits an appealing group-action explanation and provides useful insights into the intrinsic structure among <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> from a group-theoretic perspective...|$|R

Presentation at the 9 th International Conference on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), Hong Kong, China. Collaboration in virtual project teams heavily relies on interpersonal trust, for which perceived trustworthiness is an important determinant. This study provides insight in the foundation of trustors’ information preferences to assess a trustee’s professional trustworthiness in the initial phase of a virtual project team. We hypothesize that trustors in virtual teams prefer particular <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> since they provide them with relevant cues for trust warranting properties of a trustee. Starting from a list of commonly preferred <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> to inform trustworthiness assessments (n= 226), we analyze explanations for these preferences with the help of a theory-grounded coding scheme. Results show that indeed respondents prefer <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> as they provide them with multiple cues to assess the trustworthiness of a trustee. <b>Information</b> <b>elements</b> providing unique cues could not be identified.
