50|$|The wider {{applicability}} {{and increased}} robustness of <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> {{comes at a}} cost: in cases where a parametric test would be appropriate, <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> have less power.

40|$|<b>Non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> {{that deal}} with two samples include scores tests (such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test, normal scores test, {{logistic}} scores test, Cauchy scores test, etc.) and Fisher's randomization <b>test.</b> Because the <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> generally require {{a large amount of}} computational work, there are few studies on small-sample properties, although asymptotic properties with regard to various aspects were studied in the past. In this paper, the <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> are compared with the t -test through Monte Carlo experiments. Also, we consider testing structural changes as an application in economics. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{sign test}} is a <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test</b> which makes very few {{assumptions}} {{about the nature of}} the distributions under test - this means that it has very general applicability but may lack the statistical power of the alternative tests.|$|E
50|$|In the {{analysis}} of designed experiments, the Friedman test {{is the most common}} <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test</b> for complete block designs.

50|$|Z-tests are {{employed}} whenever {{it can be}} argued that a test statistic follows a normal distribution under the null hypothesis of interest. Many <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test</b> statistics, such as U statistics, are approximately normal for large enough sample sizes, and hence are often performed as Z-tests.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of considering statistical power in marine pollution studies is unequivocal. However, {{the vast majority}} of ecological literature on power analysis focuses on parametric rather than <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests.</b> This note describes a Monte Carlo simulation method for estimating the power of <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests.</b> The method is illustrated using ordinal data. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5000|$|For a Poisson point process, the [...] {{function}} is simply =1, hence {{why it is}} used as a <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test</b> for whether data behaves as though it were from a Poisson process.

50|$|Parametric tests, such {{as those}} {{described}} in exact statistics, are exact tests when the parametric assumptions are fully met, but in practice {{the use of the}} term exact (significance) test is reserved for those tests that do not rest on parametric assumptions - non-parametric tests. However, in practice most implementations of <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test</b> software use asymptotical algorithms for obtaining the significance value, which makes the implementation of the test non-exact.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test</b> for the one-factor {{model is the}} Kruskal-Wallis test. The Kruskal-Wallis test {{is based on the}} ranks of the data.

40|$|Revealed {{preference}} axioms {{provide a}} simple way of testing data from consumers or firms for consistency with optimizing behavior. The resulting <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> are very attractive, since they do not require any ad hoc functional form assumptions. A weakness of such tests, however, {{is that they are}} non-stochastic. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of two approaches {{that can be used to}} derive <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> for utility maximization, which can account for measurement errors in observed price or quantity data...|$|R
50|$|The above linear {{methods are}} {{appropriate}} for testing Granger causality in the mean. However they {{are not able to}} detect Granger causality in higher moments, e.g., in the variance. <b>Non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> for Granger causality are designed to address this problem. The definition of Granger causality in these test is general and does not involve any modelling assumptions, such as a linear autoregressive model. The <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> for Granger causality can be used as diagnostic tools to build better parametric models including higher order moments and/or non-linearity.|$|R
50|$|Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a data {{analysis}} technique for examining {{the significance of}} the factors (independent variables) in a multi-factor model. The one factor model {{can be thought of as}} a generalization of the two sample t-test. That is, the two sample t-test is a test of the hypothesis that two population means are equal. The one factor ANOVA tests the hypothesis that k population means are equal. The standard ANOVA assumes that the errors (i.e., residuals) are normally distributed. If this normality assumption is not valid, an alternative is to use a <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose a {{comprehensive}} multi-criteria validation test for rainfall-runoff modeling by artificial neural networks. This study applies 17 global statistics and 3 additional <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> to evaluate the ANNs. The weakness of global statistics for validation of ANN is demonstrated by rainfall-runoff modeling of the Plasjan Basin in the western region of the Zayandehrud watershed, Iran. Although the global statistics showed that the multi layer perceptron with 4 hidden layers (MLP 4) is the best ANN for the basin comparing with other MLP networks and empirical regression model, but the <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> illustrate that neither the ANNs nor the regression model are able to reproduce the probability distribution of observed runoff in validation phase. However, the MLP 4 network is the best network to reproduce the mean and variance of the observed runoff based on <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests.</b> The performance of ANNs and empirical model was also demonstrated for low-medium and high flows. Although the MLP 4 network gives the best performance among ANNs for low-medium and high flows based on different statistics but the empirical model shows better results. However, none of the models is able to simulate the frequency distribution of low-medium and high flows according to <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests.</b> This study illustrates that the modelers should select appropriate and relevant evaluation measures from the set of existing metrics based on the particular requirements of each individual applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{coefficient}} of variation is commonly used in medical and biological sciences. In this paper, several parametric and non-parametric tests for the equality of coefficients of variation in κ populations are reviewed. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the sizes and power of these tests. It is found that the parametric tests perform well if the data are normally distributed, but perform poorly if otherwise. The <b>non-parametric</b> <b>test,</b> however, is rather robust against the underlying distribution.

More precisely, using a very large dataset to estimate the whole "population", we analyzed the behavior of several statistical test, varying the class unbalance, the compared models, the performance measure, and the sample size.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} 30 years, the median {{sample size of}} {{research}} studies published in high-impact medical journals has increased manyfold, while the use of <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tests</b> has increased {{at the expense of}} t-tests. This paper explores this paradoxical practice and illustrates its consequences. Methods A simulation study is used to compare the rejection rates of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test and the two-sample t-test for increasing sample size. Samples are drawn from skewed distributions with equal means and medians but with a small difference in spread. A hypothetical case study is used for illustration and motivation. Results The WMW test produces, on average, smaller p -values than the t-test. This discrepancy increases with increasing sample size, skewness, and difference in spread.
