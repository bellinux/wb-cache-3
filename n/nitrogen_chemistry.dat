The total X-ray ionization rate is dominated by the “secondary” ionization rate of H 2 resulting from fast electrons. The abundance profiles of several molecular and atomic species are shown to depend on the X-ray luminosity and on the distance from the source.

Recently, additional absorption in HST WFC 3 transmission spectra around 1. 55 μm has {{been attributed to}} nitrogen-bearing chemical species: NH_ 3 or HCN. These species, if present in significant abundance, would be strong indicators of disequilibrium chemical processes [...] e. g. vertical mixing and photochemistry. The derived N abundance, in turn, could also place important constraints on planetary formation mechanisms. Here, we examine the detectability of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>chemistry</b> in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to the WFC 3 bandpass (1. 1 - 1. 7 μm), we find that observations in K-band at ∼ 2. 2 μm, achievable with present ground-based telescopes, sample a strong NH_ 3 feature, whilst observations at ∼ 3. 1 μm and ∼ 4. 0 μm sample strong HCN features. In anticipation of such observations, we predict absorption feature amplitudes due to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>chemistry</b> in the 1 - 5 μm spectral range possible for a typical hot Jupiter.

The chemistry of the bulk of the envelope mass is dominated by cosmic-ray induced reactions rather than by X-ray induced ionization for X-ray luminosities LX < 1 e+ 33 ergs/s. The calculated line intensities of HCO+ and HCS+ show that high-J lines are more affected than lower J lines by the presence of X-rays due to their higher critical densities, and that such differences are detectable even with large aperture single-dish telescopes. Future instruments such as Herschel-HIFI or SOFIA will be able to observe X-ray enhanced hydrides whereas the sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA is well-suited to measure the size and geometry of the region affected by X-rays.

Most of these models are based on a simplified description of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>chemistry,</b> while few of them attempt {{to take into account the}} whole NO chemistry and its interactions with carbon oxidation.

This paper describes the inclusion of detailed chemical reaction mechanisms into {{the framework of a}} turbulent flame simulation. Calculations are based on a finite-volume solution procedure including submodels for turbulent flow, combustion of fuel and radiative heat transfer. The interaction of chemical reactions and turbulence is modelled using the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC). The basic idea of incorporating the reaction mechanism into the EDC is described. The oxidation of methane is described with a detailed C 1 /C 2 mechanism. The proposed model is applied to a 400 kW turbulent diffusion methane flame in a cylindrical furnace. The measured trends in temperature and species concentrations of CH 4, O 2, CO and CO 2 are adequately reproduced by the predicted profiles. To demonstrate the benefits and limits of this approach, the method is applied to predict gas phase reactions of the DeNOx technology ‘reburning ’ using methane as reductive, which is applied to a pulverized coal flame.

30|$|The {{chemical}} {{effects of}} neutral winds {{also play a}} very important role in producing stormtime changes in the ionosphere. During a geomagnetic storm, intense Joule and particle heating causes a strong upwelling of the atmosphere around the auroral oval. The strong upwelling of the atmosphere transports oxygen-depleted, or nitrogen-rich, air up from much lower in the thermosphere into the F region (Mayr and Volland, 1972; Mayr et al., 1978; Prolss, 1980). Neutral winds then redistribute this nitrogen-rich/oxygen-depleted air over much of the high-latitude region and part of the mid-latitude region. The nitrogen-rich/oxygen-depleted air causes a reduction in the ionospheric electron density, and oxygen-rich/nitrogen-depleted air causes an increase in the ionospheric electron density. The transport is strongest during post-midnight hours owing to wind surges arising from ion convection and the associated momentum transfer to neutrals. It is known that, during daytime, the bottom side of the ionosphere (130 – 200 km) is “photochemically” governed, where photodissociation of molecular oxygen in the Schumann-Runge continuum (135 – 175 nm) leads to the generation of atomic oxygen, which, in turn, leads to the formation of ionization. At the same time, the ionization loss processes are mainly controlled by molecular <b>nitrogen</b> through <b>chemistry.</b> As a result, the ratio (O/N 2) at any time is taken as a measure of the net ionization in the lower F region (Forbes, 2007).|$|R
