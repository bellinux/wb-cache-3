40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine how}} people's {{collectivist}} tendencies {{may be related to}} their distributive judgments. A conceptual model was proposed. People with high collectivist tendencies might be more inclined to maintain good interpersonal relationships (vs. to increase productivity) than people with low collectivist tendencies in distributing rewards. Because of this, high collectivist subjects may consider and pay attention to interpersonal relations related information, such as the status difference (seniority) among the reward receivers and their "face" difference. Also high collectivists' distributive judgments might be affected by cognitive busyness because they might need cognitive capacity to infer face information from a worker's seniority. To test my conceptual model, two studies were conducted. Study 1 examined how people's distributive judgments might be affected by the relationship of the workers: (1) how cohesive they were as a group and (2) how long each worker had been serving in the work group (i. e., seniority). Also, subjects' collectivist tendencies were also measured. Results showed that high collectivists tended to maximize the rewards distributed to the senior worker. But this effect was not found among low collectivists. They seemed to distribute rewards based on the workers' contributions. To further explore the psychological processes that give rise to such distributive judgments, in Study 2, subjects were asked to distribute a bonus between two workers with high vs. low seniority and high vs. low contribution. In half of the conditions, the subjects made the judgments when they were cognitively busy, and in other conditions, when they were cognitively <b>non-busy.</b> Findings showed that, in distributing rewards, high collectivist subjects reported that they had considered the low contributor's face more when they were cognitively <b>non-busy,</b> than when they were cognitively busy. As such, it seemed that it was a relatively controlled process for high collectivists to consider face in distributing rewards. But there was no cognitive busyness effect among the low collectivist subjects. Also, regardless of their levels of cognitive busyness, high collectivist subjects judged that it would be more likely for the senior worker than the junior worker to lose face if he contributed less and was allocated less than 50 % of the bonus. This was not found among low collectivists. Implications of these findings were discussed...|$|E

Cutoff values for the thresholding operation are determined from histograms of multiple sensory parameters. Various discontinuities are often present in the histograms, and indicate an area possessing uniformity in some feature (e. g., hue or Intensity). The thresholding operation is utilized in a recursive descent control structure to isolate and refine segments of the picture. At each level of recursion the histograms are derived for the largest unprocessed region remaining in the image. Before recursive analysis begins, {{an estimate of the}} heavily textured (busy) areas is obtained. This estimate provides direction for the analytic process. If thresholding occurs over an area which is heavily textured, the output is handled in one of two ways.

40|$|Activity-based demand {{generation}} contructs complete all-day activity {{plans for}} {{each member of}} a population, and derives transportation demand {{from the fact that}} consecutive activities at different locations need to be connected by travel. Besides many other advantages, activity-based demand generation also fits well into the paradigm of multi-agent simulation, where each traveler is kept as an individual throughout the whole modeling process. In this paper, we present a new approach to the problem, which uses genetic algorithms (GA). Our GA keeps, for each member of the population, several instances of possible all-day activity plans in memory. Those plans are modified by mutation and crossover, while “bad ” instances are eventually discarded. Any GA needs a fitness function to evaluate the performance of each instance. For all-day activity plans, it makes sense to use a utility function to obtain such a fitness. In consequence, {{a significant part of the}} paper is spent discussing such a utility function.

Some of these frameworks best fit streaming data, while {{others can be}} applied to batch data. In this paper, we experimented two of these popular frameworks for our k-anonymity method. Both of Pig and Spark were examined in MDSBA anonymization process. Our aim was paving a reliable ground for MDSBA state-of-the-art anonymization with the most reliable performance. The experiments show few hurdles in each framework. However, Spark is faster in processing MDSBA, and more fault tolerant as an in-memory operations framework. In congested networks, Spark reduces data transmission between memory and disks on serializing data with RDD. Spark can be many times faster than Pig MapReduce in anonymization. To avoid SQL Spark performance degradation, the memory should be larger than the processed data. SQL Spark boosts performance on the large size of memory. Other Spark’s tuning methods that may leverage the anonymization performance are; UDF algorithm, filter/group commands, and caching data in memory. On the other side, MapReduce is an old framework that can perform better when memory resources are quite small. This is conditioned by the network traffic and congestion level. MapReduce may operate on small memory resources, but it requires <b>non-busy</b> network, because it relies on a heavy transmission between memory and disks. In the conclusion, It is recommended to implement MDSBA in Spark framework, however, the cluster infrastructure must be prepared well, by providing enough memory and processor resources for each node.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} dominates {{practically every}} aspect of the design of a wireless sensor network and duty cycling is an important tool for achieving high energy efficiencies. Duty cycling for wireless camera networks meant for tracking objects is made complex by the nodes having to anticipate the arrival of the objects in their field-of-view. The consequences of an object arriving in the view-region of a camera when it is sleeping need no elaboration. Our work presents a predictive framework to provide nodes with an ability to anticipate the arrival of objects in the field-of-view of their cameras. Our predictive framework differs from others in that the nodes whose duty cycles are increased are at least one step removed from the immediate neighborhood of the nodes where the objects are currently visible. By eliminating the need for the currently busiest nodes to also be in charge of informing their <b>non-busy</b> immediate neighbors to get ready for object arrival, we end up with a more robust strategy for updating the duty cycle at the nodes where the objects are highly likely to appear soon. The proposed scheme works by using an existing MAC header bit that is already in the 802. 15. 4 protocol and, in that sense, our anticipatory approach for notifying the nodes about {{the current state of the}} object location entails no additional expenditure of energy.

40|$|In {{cellular}} mobile communication system the existing distributed dynamic channel allocation algorithms suffer from high message complexity and channel acquisition time. To contend this problem, in this paper, a modified distributed dynamic channel allocation algorithm be called as Reduced Search In Update (RSU) is proposed, which takes into considerations the {{spatial and temporal}} variations of channel demand and adjusts channel allocation accordingly. In this scheme the set of all the cells are partitioned {{into a number of}} disjoint subsets and also the set of all the channels are grouped into a number of disjoint subsets optimally. One group of channels is allocated to one group of cells and will be known as primary channel for that group of cell. These primary channels become the secondary channels for other groups. Thus all channels are prioritized as primary or secondary for any cell. During <b>non-busy</b> hours the cell acquires its own primary channels and when the cell runs out of primary channels it tries to acquire a secondary channel which is basically primary channels of the other cells. In order to accomplish that each cell when idle computes from its local information a set of channels (denoted as ravlm) in which the first member channel of the set is that channel which is available in maximum number of cells and other member channels of the set is arranged in decreasing order of their availability. As and when a cell needs a channel it takes the first member of the set ravlm and finds its availability. The cell immediately occupies the available channel and informs the concerned cells about its acquisition of channel. If th...|$|E
30|$|The {{coexistence}} of WiMAX and DSRC in a heterogeneous environment {{has been discussed}} in[17], while this article is the first paper to design a new link layer protocol for the combined WiMAX and DSRC communication systems. There are many potential benefits to using this combined system rather than either WiMAX or DSRC on its own. Authors of[18] have found that using roadside stations for Internet access is impractical without a heavy investment in infrastructure. The improvement to the WiMAX system capacity minimizes the installation of costly WiMAX BS. On the other hand, {{one of the major}} problems with a DSRC-only system is the latency issues inherent with ad hoc routing systems. As the number of hops between the user and a network gateway is dynamic and the links can be fragile, it is difficult to provide bounds on the latency seen by the system. This can be a problem with Internet applications that are sensitive to latency, including voice communications and streaming media. A combined system also offers the ability to revert to WiMAX-only service, eliminating the sparse node problems seen in an ad hoc network where nodes are not dense enough to allow for continuous routing. This flexibility allows for rapid adaptation to changing system conditions such as exiting a busy highway onto a <b>non-busy</b> side road, without requiring the disruptive reestablishment of application-layer connections. Clustering and ad hoc routing becomes more effective as the road conditions become more congested, which are the conditions where traditional WiMAX routing is demonstrated to become ineffective. As such, the proposed system is far more robust {{to a wide variety of}} operating conditions, and provides bounds on the number of hops in the network, providing much more predictable latency conditions. Determining the conditions under which to run flat routing and when to cluster, as well as the size of the clusters and which vehicles to include in clusters, will be part of the cluster selection protocol through studies of real-world congested vehicle scenarios, using a test platform such as that described by Roccetti et al.[16]. In essence, this article extends the WiMAX protocol across DSRC for the purpose of providing broadband Internet access to DSRC connected clients, using a new link layer design.|$|E
40|$|Paper 1 : Pilot {{study of}} Swiss firms Abstract Using a fixed effects approach, we {{investigate}} whether {{the presence of}} specific individuals on Swiss firms’ boards affects firm performance and the policy choices they make. We find evidence for a substantial impact of these directors’ presence on their firms. Moreover, the director effects are correlated across policies and performance measures but uncorrelated to the directors’ background. We find these results interesting but conclude that they should to be substantiated on a dataset that is larger and better understood by researchers. Also, further tests are required to rule out methodological concerns. Paper 2 : Evidence from the S&P 1, 500 Abstract We ask whether directors on corporate boards contribute to firm performance as individuals. From the universe of the S&P 1, 500 firms since 1996 we track 2, 062 directors who serve on multiple boards over extended periods of time. Our initial {{findings suggest that the}} presence of these directors is associated with substantial performance shifts (director fixed effects). Closer examination shows that these effects are statistical artifacts and we conclude that directors are largely fungible. Moreover, we contribute to the discussion of the fixed effects method. In particular, we highlight that the selection of the randomization method is pivotal when generating placebo benchmarks. Paper 3 : Robustness, statistical power, and important directors Abstract This article provides a better understanding of Senn’s (2014) findings: The outcome that individual directors are unrelated to firm performance proves robust against different estimation models and testing strategies. By looking at CEOs, the statistical power of the placebo benchmarking test is evaluated. We find that only the stronger tests are able to detect CEO fixed effects. However, these tests are not suitable to analyze directors. The suitable tests would detect director effects if the inter quartile range of the true effects amounted to 3 percentage points ROA. As Senn (2014) finds no such effects for outside directors in general, we focus on groups of particularly important directors (e. g., COBs, <b>non-busy</b> directors, successful directors). Overall, our evidence suggests that the members of these groups are not individually associated with firm performance either. Thus, we confirm that individual directors are largely fungible. If the individual has an effect on performance, it is of small magnitude...|$|E
40|$|A {{distributed}} system {{is defined as}} a collection of autonomous computers connected by a network, and with the appropriate distributed software for the system to be seen by users as a single entity capable of providing computing facilities. Distributed systems with centralised control have a distinguished control node, called leader node. The main role of a leader node is to distribute and manage shared resources in a resource-efficient manner. A {{distributed system}} with centralised control can use stream processing networks for communication. In a stream processing system, applications typically act as continuous queries, ingesting data continuously, analyzing and correlating the data, and generating a stream of results. Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to process the information, even if it happens any failure or anomaly in the system. Fault tolerance has become an important requirement for distributed systems, due to the possibility of failure has currently risen to the increase in number of nodes and the runtime of applications in distributed system. Therefore, to resolve this problem, it is important to add fault tolerance mechanisms order to provide the internal capacity to preserve the execution of the tasks despite the occurrence of faults. If the leader on a centralised control system fails, it is necessary to elect a new leader. While leader election has received a lot of attention in message-passing systems, very few solutions have been proposed for shared memory systems, as we propose. In addition, rollback-recovery strategies are important fault tolerance mechanisms for distributed systems, since that it is based on storing information into a stable storage in failure-free state and when a failure affects a node, the system uses the information stored to recover the state of the node before the failure appears. In this thesis, we are focused on creating two fault tolerance mechanisms for distributed systems with centralised control that uses stream processing for communication. These two mechanism created are leader election and log-based rollback-recovery, implemented using LPEL. The leader election method proposed is based on an atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS) instruction, which is directly available on many processors. Our leader election method works with idle nodes, meaning that only the <b>non-busy</b> nodes compete to become the new leader while the busy nodes can continue with their tasks and later update their leader reference. Furthermore, this leader election method has short completion time and low space complexity. The log-based rollback-recovery method proposed for distributed systems with stream processing networks is a novel approach that is free from domino effect and does not generate orphan messages accomplishing the always-no-orphans consistency condition. Additionally, this approach has lower overhead impact into the system compared to other approaches, and it is a mechanism that provides scalability, because it is insensitive to the number of nodes in the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} demand of {{capacity}} by wireless services is challenging the mobile industry with a need of new deployment strategies. Besides, {{the nature of}} the spatial and temporal distribution of user traffic has become heterogeneous and fluctuating intermittently. Those challenges are currently tackled by network densification and tighter spatial reuse of radio resources by introducing a heterogeneous deployment of small cells embedded in a macro cell layout. Since user traffic is varying both spatially and temporally, a so called busy hour planning is typically applied where enough small cells are deployed at the corresponding locations to meet the expected capacity demand. This deployment strategy, however, is inefficient as it may leave plenty of network resources under-utilized during <b>non-busy</b> hour, i. e., most of the operation time. Such over-provisioning strategy incurs high capital investment on infrastructure (CAPEX) as well as operating cost (OPEX) for operators. Therefore, optimal would be a network with flexible capacity accommodation by following the dynamics of the traffic situation and evading the inefficiencies and the high cost of the fixed deployment approach. The advent of a revolutionizing base station antenna technology called Active Antenna Systems (AAS) is promising to deliver the required flexibility and dynamic deployment solution desired for adaptive capacity provisioning. Having the active radio frequency (RF) components integrated with the radiating elements, AAS supports advanced beamforming features. With AAS-equipped base station, multiple cell-specific beams can be simultaneously created to densify the cell layout by means of an enhanced form of sectorization. The radiation pattern of each cell-beam can be dynamically adjusted so that a conventional cell, for instance, can be split into two distinct cells, if a high traffic concentration is detected. The traffic in such an area is shared among the new cells and by spatially reusing the frequency spectrum, the cell-splitting (sectorization) doubles the total available radio resources at the cost of an increased co-channel interference between the cells. Despite the AAS capability, the realization of flexible sectorization for dynamic cell layout adaptation poses several challenges. One of the challenges is that the expected performance gain from cell densification can be offset by the ensuing co-channel interference in the system. It is also obvious that a self-organized autonomous management and configuration is needed, if cell deployment must follow the variation of the user traffic over time and space by means of a sectorization procedure. The automated mechanism is desired to enhance the system performance and optimize the user experience by automatically controlling the sectorization process. With such a dynamic adaptation scheme, the self-organizing network (SON) facilities are getting a new dimension in terms of controlling the flexible cell layout changes as the environment including the radio propagation characteristics cannot be assumed stationary any longer. To fully exploit the flexible sectorization feature in three-dimensional space, reliable and realistic propagation models are required which are able to incorporate the dependency of the radio channel characteristics in the elevation domain. Analysis of the complex relationship among various system parameters entails a comprehensive model that properly describes the AAS-sectorization for conducting detailed investigation and carrying out precise evaluation of the ensuing system performance. A novel SON algorithm that automates the AAS-sectorization procedure is developed. The algorithm controls the activation/deactivation of cell-beams enabling the sectorization based cell layout adjustment adaptively. In order to effectively meet the dynamically varying network capacity demand that varies according to the spatial user distribution, the developed SON algorithm monitors the load of the cell, the spatial traffic concentrations and adapts the underlying cell coverage layout by autonomously executing the sectorization either in the horizontal or vertical plane. The SON algorithm specifies various procedures which rely on real time network information collected using actual signal measurement reports from users. The particular capability of the algorithm is evading unforeseen system performance degradation by properly executing the sectorization not only where in the network and when it is needed, but also only if the ensuing co-channel interference does not have adverse impact on the user experience. To guarantee the optimality of the network performance after sectorization, a performance metric that takes both the expectable gain from radio resource and impact of the co-channel interference into account is developed. In order to combat the severity of the inter-cell interference problem that arises with AAS-sectorization between the co-channel operated cells, an interference mitigation scheme is developed in this thesis. The proposed scheme coordinates the data transmission between the co-sited cells by the transmission muting principle. To ensure that the transmission muting is not degrading the overall system performance by blanking more data transmission, a new SON algorithm that controls the optimal usage the proposed scheme is developed. To appropriately characterize the spatial separation of the cell beams being activated with sectorization, a novel propagation shadowing model that incorporates elevation tilt parameter is developed. The new model addresses the deficiencies of the existing tilt-independent shadowing model which inherently assumes a stationary propagation characteristics in the elevation domain. The tilt-dependent shadowing model is able to statistically characterize the elevation channel variability with respect to the tilt configuration settings. Simplified 3 D beamforming models and beam pattern synthesis approaches required for fast cell layout adaptation and dynamic configuration of the AAS parameters are developed for the realization of various forms of AAS-based sectorization. Horizontal and vertical sectorization are the two forms of AAS-based sectorization considered in this thesis where two beams are simultaneously created from a single AAS to split the underlying coverage layout in horizontal or vertical domain, respectively. The performance of the developed theoretical AAS-sectorization concepts and models are examined by means of system level simulations considering the Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) macro-site deployment within exemplifying scenarios. Simulation results have demonstrated that the SON mechanism is able to follow the different conditions when and where the sectorization delivers superior performance or adversely affects the user experience. Impacts on the performance of existing SON operations, like Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO), which are relying on stationary cell layout conditions have been studied. Further investigations are carried out in combination with the cell layout changes triggered by the dynamic AAS-based sectorization. The observed results have confirmed that proper coordination is needed between the SON scheme developed for AAS sectorization and the MRO operation to evade unforeseen performance degradation and to ensure a seamless user experience. The technical concepts developed in this thesis further have impacted the 3 ^rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) SON for AAS Work Item (WI) discussed in the Radio Access Network (RAN) - 3 Work Group (WG). In particular, the observed study results dealing with the interworking of the existing SON features and AAS sectorization have been noted in the standardization work...|$|E
