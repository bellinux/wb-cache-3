5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak low-level trough extended from the Caribbean Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began to drift eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico. Two days later a low-level circulation formed, and midday on October 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E while located about 250miles (410km) south-southwest of Huatulco in the state of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} network anomography, that is, {{the problem}} of inferring network-level anomalies from indirect link measurements. This problem is cast as a low-rank subspace tracking problem for <b>normal</b> <b>flows</b> under incomplete observations, and an outlier detection problem for abnormal flows. Since traffic data is large-scale time-structured data accompanied with noise and outliers under partial observations, an efficient modeling method is essential. To this end, this paper proposes an online subspace tracking of a Hankelized time-structured traffic tensor for <b>normal</b> <b>flows</b> based on the Candecomp/PARAFAC decomposition exploiting the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. We estimate abnormal flows as outlier sparse flows via sparsity maximization in the underlying under-constrained linear-inverse problem. A major advantage is that our algorithm estimates <b>normal</b> <b>flows</b> by low-dimensional matrices with time-directional features {{as well as the}} spatial correlation of multiple links without using the past observed measurements and the past model parameters. Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence per iteration of model approximation, and better volume anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Below the P signal on the same post is a punch box to allow the train operator to manually set the switch to the diverting direction (reverse) when the P Signal is lit. The P signal is only lit when a train occupies the two track circuit approaching the P Signal and all possible routes into the interlocking are not occupied.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being the}} twenty-eighth busiest {{airport in the}} world in terms of {{aircraft}} operations, the airport still maintains a large general aviation presence. In 2008, 19% of aircraft movements at the airport came from general aviation traffic. This is in contrast to most large airports, which encourage general aviation aircraft to use smaller or less busy airports in order to prevent delays to commercial traffic. The airport is able to effectively handle both commercial and general aviation traffic largely in part to the airport's layout and airspace structure. Nearly all general aviation operations are conducted on the east side of the airport, away from commercial traffic. Additionally, smaller and relatively slower general aviation aircraft arrive and depart the airport in ways which generally do not hinder the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> of arriving or departing commercial aircraft.|$|E

This would be achieved during the characterisation stage by classifying the issue as status and its incidents rather than contract because a party's status and lack of capacity would be in rem.|$|E

25|$|Traffic {{exiting the}} {{roundabout}} comes from one direction, rather than three, simplifying the pedestrian's visual environment. Traffic moves slowly {{enough to allow}} visual engagement with pedestrians, encouraging deference towards them. Other benefits include reduced driver confusion associated with perpendicular junctions and reduced queuing associated with traffic lights. They allow U-turns within the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> of traffic, which often are not possible at other forms of junction. Moreover, since vehicles on average spend less time idling at roundabouts than at signalled intersections, using a roundabout potentially leads to less pollution. Also, when entering vehicles only need to give way, they do not always perform a full stop. As a result, by keeping {{a part of their}} momentum, the engine will produce less work to regain the initial speed, resulting in lower emissions. Additionally, slow moving traffic in roundabouts makes less noise than traffic that must stop and start, speed up and brake.|$|E
25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes <b>normal</b> <b>flow.</b> An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E
500|$|A {{periodontal}} abscess (lateral abscess) is {{a collection}} of pus that forms in the gingival crevices, usually as a result of chronic periodontitis where the pockets are pathologically deepened greater than 3mm. A healthy gingival pocket will contain bacteria and some calculus kept in check by the immune system. As the pocket deepens, the balance is disrupted, and an acute inflammatory response results, forming pus. The debris and swelling then disrupt the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> of fluids {{into and out of the}} pocket, rapidly accelerating the inflammatory cycle. [...] Larger pockets also have a greater likelihood of collecting food debris, creating additional sources of infection.|$|E

500|$|The dogma is a {{framework}} for understanding the transfer of sequence information between information-carrying biopolymers, in the most common or general case, in living organisms. There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic acids), and protein. There are 3×3 = 9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these. The dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3: three general transfers (believed to occur normally in most cells), three special transfers (known to occur, but only under specific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory), and three unknown transfers (believed never to occur). The general transfers describe the <b>normal</b> <b>flow</b> of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), [...] DNA information can be copied into mRNA (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation). The special transfers describe: RNA being copied from RNA (RNA replication), DNA being synthesised using an RNA template (reverse transcription), and proteins being synthesised directly from a DNA template {{without the use of}} mRNA. The unknown transfers describe: a protein being copied from a protein, synthesis of RNA using the primary structure of a protein as a template, and DNA synthesis using the primary structure of a protein as a template - these are not thought to naturally occur.|$|E

40|$|A {{wireless}} ad-hoc {{network is}} a self-organized wireless network without fixed or backbone infrastructure. All nodes have routing capability and use peer-to-peer packet transmission or forward packets to other node using multi hop communication. Now days mobile ad-hoc networks {{are being used}} for different applications and traffics, so it require quality of service (QoS) support in routing protocol. In this paper, a modified QoS routing protocol using directional antenna has been proposed. High and normal priority can be assigned based on type of traffic. All the nodes in the path used by high priority flow are reserved as high priority flow for that <b>flow</b> and <b>normal</b> priority <b>flow</b> will avoid the paths used by high priority flows.
