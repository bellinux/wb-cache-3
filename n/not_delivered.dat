Gravel denied later press charges that he had promised but <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> on other committee chairmanships. As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature's committees and feuded with Alaska State Senate president Robert J. McNealy.|$|E

The tanks arrived too late to see action against the Soviets, but were instead used against the Germans during their withdrawal through Lapland. After the war, they served as training tanks, and one portrayed a Soviet KV-1 tank in the movie The Unknown Soldier in 1955.|$|E

5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1822, the {{schooner}} USS Alligator, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Allen, put into Matanzas, Cuba, intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy's West Indian Anti-Piracy Campaign. Upon arriving at the port, Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $7,000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels. If the ransom was <b>not</b> <b>delivered,</b> the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and rough up their crews. Learning from these men that the pirates were holed up some 15 leagues away, Allen took the civilians aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough had won his {{bridgehead}} {{over the}} Danube, and had put himself between the French and Vienna; yet {{the battle was}} followed by a curious, dragging anti-climax. The Duke was determined to lure the Elector into battle before Tallard arrived with reinforcements, but since the battle on the Schellenberg neither Allied commander could agree on their next move, resulting in a protracted siege of Rain. Due to the initial lack of heavy guns and ammunition (promised by the Empire but <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> on time) the town did not fall until 16 July. Nevertheless, Marlborough promptly occupied Neuburg which, together with Donauwörth and Rain, provided the Allies with enough fortified bridges across the Danube and Lech rivers to manoeuvre with ease.|$|E

5|$|Permission {{was granted}} {{for the first}} batch of fifteen {{locomotives}} in March 1928, but this was reduced to ten when {{it became apparent that}} they would not immediately be able to operate on the Hastings route. Production delays at Eastleigh railway works meant that they were <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> until between March and July 1930. Once the original batch had proved their worth and had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 for delivery between December 1932 and March 1934. A third batch of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 for delivery after the completion of the previous order, but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression. The final locomotive in the class was delivered in July 1935.|$|E
5|$|The Blackburn Firebrand was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E
5|$|By February 1945 the {{seventeen}} aircraft of {{the second}} increment were themselves in need of upgrades, particularly those of the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit. Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the 509th Composite Group) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a few at a time, {{a decision was made}} to start a new production series. The first five of this third increment, known as Project 98228-S, also went to the test unit. The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April. The final eight were <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> until after the two atomic bomb missions in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from Tinian. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|In April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{wrote in}} his journal Young India {{about the need for}} an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or {{spinning}} wheel at the centre. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.|$|E
5|$|In Maine, 20 {{counties}} were declared {{states of}} emergency. After the storm, Southern New England Telephone sent {{a crew of}} 100workers in 50trucks to Maine to assist in restoring power. Power was quickly restored, and in some places the outages were less severe than during Carol. For only {{the third time in}} its history, the Portland Evening Express was <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> due to the storm. Most primary roads were re-opened by two days after the storm, although rural areas and rail lines took longer to repair. There was a temporary travel ban for all but emergency vehicles in Maine due to washed out roads. Affecting densely populated portions of the state, Edna struck the day before the governor race between Republican Burton M. Cross and Democratic Edmund Muskie. Before the election, politicians commented how a suppressed turnout {{as a result of the}} storm would benefit Muskie, in a state where no Democrat had won governorship since 1934. Muskie ultimately won the election in a close race, which saw a lower turnout than 1950, likely due to Edna suppressing the rural, Republican turnout.|$|E
5|$|The four Borodino-class battlecruisers (also {{referred}} to as Izmail class) of the Imperial Russian Navy were all laid down in December 1912 at Saint Petersburg for service with the Baltic Fleet. Construction of the ships was delayed as many domestic factories were already overloaded with orders and some components had to be ordered from abroad. The start of World War I slowed their construction still further as the foreign orders were often <b>not</b> <b>delivered</b> and domestic production was diverted into things more immediately useful for the war effort. The ships were launched in 1915–16, but {{the outbreak of the}} Russian Revolution in 1917 put a stop to their construction, which never resumed. The Soviet Navy gave consideration to completing the ships; initially, Izmail and Borodino were looked at, with a view to finishing one or both to their original design, but the lack of available 12in guns, combined with the complexity of the originally designed electrical system, led to the idea being dropped. Subsequently, plans were raised to complete Kinburn and Navarin to a modified design with 16in guns, which again failed due to the difficulty in either obtaining guns from overseas, or manufacturing them domestically. Subsequent ideas included converting some of the hulls for cargo or passenger use, which again failed. The Navy made a serious proposal in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but this plan was later cancelled as a result of political maneuvering {{on the part of the}} Red Army. Eventually, all four hulls were broken up for scrap; the second, third and fourth were sold to a German company in 1923, while Izmail was broken up in Leningrad in 1931.|$|E
