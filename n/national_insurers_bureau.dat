The case for a single insurer rests on the intrinsic problems associated with having a number of insurers in the market.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed data mining technique, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) has been hailed {{by some as}} a viable competitor to neural networks that does not suffer from some of the limitations of neural networks. Like neural networks, it is effective when analyzing complex structures which are commonly found in data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. However, unlike neural networks, MARS is not a "black box", but produces models that are explainable to management. This paper will introduce MARS by showing its similarity to an already well-understood statistical technique: linear regression. It will illustrate MARS by applying it to insurance fraud data and will compare its performance to that of neural networks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: While it {{is common}} for an {{economic}} evaluation of health care to rely on trial participants for self-reported health service utilisation, there is variability in the accuracy of this data due to potential recall bias. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the level of recall bias in self-reported primary health care general practitioner (GP) visits following inpatient rehabilitation over a 12 month period. METHODS: This report is a secondary analysis from a larger randomised control trial of an economic evaluation of additional Saturday inpatient rehabilitation. Participants were adults who had been discharged into the community following admission to an acute general rehabilitation hospital. Participants were asked to recall primary health care visits, including community GP visits, via a telephone questionnaire which was administered at 6 and 12 months following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Participants were asked to recall health service utilisation over each preceding 6 month period. The self-reported data were compared to equivalent claims data from the <b>national</b> <b>insurer,</b> over the same period. RESULTS: 751 participants (75 % of the full trial) with a mean age of 74 years (SD 13) were included in this analysis. Over the 12 month period following discharge from rehabilitation there was an under-reporting of 14 % in self-reported health service utilisation for GP visits compared to <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> claims data over the same period. From 0 to 6 months following discharge from rehabilitation, there was an over-reporting of self-reported GP visits of 35 % and from 7 to 12 months there was an under-reporting of self-reported GP visits of 36 %, compared to <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> claims data over the same period. 46 % of patients reported the same or one number difference in self-reported GP visits between the 0 to 6 and the 7 to 12 month periods. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings we recommend that an economic evaluation alongside a clinical trial for an elderly adult rehabilitation population include a sensitivity analysis that inflates self-reported GP visits by 16 % over 12 months. However caution is required when utilising self-reported GP visits as the data may contain periods of both over and under reporting. Where general practitioner visits are expected to vary significantly between intervention and control groups we recommend that administrative data be included in the trial to accurately capture resources for an economic evaluation...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} new “data mining ” {{approaches}} for modeling data containing nonlinear and other complex dependencies have appeared in the literature. One of the key data mining techniques is decision trees, also referred to as classification and regression trees or C&RT (Breiman et al, 1993). These new methods are based on ensembles or networks of trees and carry names like Treenet and Random Forest. Viaene et al (2002) compared several data mining procedures, including tree methods and logistic regression, for prediction accuracy on a small fixed data set of fraud indicators or “red flags”. They found simple logistic regression did as well at predicting expert opinion on fraud/no fraud as the more sophisticated procedures. In this paper we will introduce some available regression tree approaches and explain how they are used to model proxies for fraud in insurance claim data. The data used for this analysis are the approximately 500, 000 auto injury claims reported to the Detailed Claim Database (DCD) of the Automobile <b>Insurers</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Massachusetts from accident years 1995 through 1997. The factual decision to order an independent medical examination or a special investigation for fraud, and the favorable outcomes of such decisions, are the modeling targets instead of expert opinion.

However there is scant comprehensive information readily available to assist clinicians to choose appropriate assessment instruments with sound psychometric and clinical properties. Objective: A <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> commissioned {{the development of a}} compendium of assessment instruments to identify adults with, or at-risk of developing, persistent pain. This paper reports on the instrument identification and review process. Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature review was undertaken of assessment instruments for persistent pain of noncancer origin, and their developmental literature. Only assessment instruments which were developed for patients with pain, or tested on them, were included. A purpose-built &lsquo;Ready Reckoner&rsquo; scored psychometric properties and clinical utility. Results: One hundred sixteen potentially useful instruments were identified, measuring severity, psychological, functional and/or quality of life constructs of persistent pain. Forty-five instruments were short-listed, with convincing psychometric properties and clinical utility. There were no standard tests for psychometric properties, and considerable overlap of instrument purpose, item construct, wording, and scoring. Conclusion: No one assessment instrument captured all the constructs of persistent pain.

Proposed reasons for these differences have included that women's self-rated health is more strongly influenced by psychosocial factors or negative affect and that women are likely to obtain services when at better levels of self-rated health, compared with men. Our study explored gender differences in the effects of non-health attributes on decisions to obtain primary medical services for an Australian community-based sample of 4140 adults from two age groups: 40 - 44 years and 60 - 64 years. Participants provided information on measures of physical and mental health, and on predisposing and enabling factors that could affect their levels of health service use.

From the observed results, we may state that: (1) independent of the target encoding scheme and the algorithm type, the inclusion of nonflag predictors allows us to significantly boost predictive performance; (2) for all the evaluated scenarios, the performance difference in terms of mean PCC and mean AUROC between many algorithm type operationalizations turns out to be rather small; visual comparison of the algorithm type ROC curve convex hulls also shows limited difference in performance over the range of operating conditions; (3) relatively simple and efficient techniques such as linear logistic regression and linear kernel least–squares support vector machine classification show excellent overall predictive capabilities, and (smoothed) naive Bayes also performs well; and (4) the C 4. 5 decision tree operationalization results are rather disappointing; none of the tree operationalizations are capable of attaining mean AUROC performance in line with the best.

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine lymphedema prevalence among cancer survivors and to characterize changes in clinical outcomes and costs associated with a defined therapeutic intervention (use of a pneumatic compression devices [PCD]) in a representative, privately insured population. Retrospective analysis of de-identified health claims data from a large <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> for calendar years 2007 through 2013. Patients were required to have 12 months of continuous insurance coverage prior to PCD receipt (baseline), as well as a 12 -month follow-up period. Analyses were performed for individuals with cancer-related lymphedema (n =  1, 065). Lymphedema prevalence was calculated: number of patients with a lymphedema claim in a calendar year divided by total number of enrollees. The impact of PCD use was evaluated by comparing rates of a pre-specified set of health outcomes and costs for the 12 months before and after, respectively, PCD receipt. Lymphedema prevalence among cancer survivors increased from 0. 95 % in 2007 to 1. 24 % in 2013. PCD use was associated with decreases in rates of hospitalizations (45 % to 32 %, p< 0. 0001), outpatient hospital visits (95 % to 90 %, p< 0. 0001), cellulitis diagnoses (28 % to 22 %, p =  0. 003), and physical therapy use (50 % to 41 %, p< 0. 0001).

Recurrence is prevalent, as is resultant chronicity. Psychosocial factors (yellow flags comprising depression and anxiety, negative pain beliefs, job dissatisfaction) {{are associated with the}} development of chronic LBP. Methods: A <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> (Accident Compensation Corporation, New Zealand [NZ]), in conjunction with a NZ primary health organization, piloted a strategy for more effective management of patients with ALBP, by following the NZ ALBP Guideline. The guidelines recommend the use of a psychosocial screening instrument (Yellow Flags Screening Instrument, a derivative of &Ouml;rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire). This instrument was recommended for administration on the second visit to a general medical practitioner (GP). This paper tests whether published cut-points of yellow flag scores to predict LBP claims length and costs were valid in this cohort. Results: Data was available for 902 claimants appropriately enrolled into the pilot. 25 % claimants consulted the GP once only, and thus were not requested to provide a yellow flag score. Yellow flag scores were provided by 48 % claimants who consumed two or more GP services. Approximately 60 % LBP presentations resolved within five GP visits. Yellow flag scores were significantly and positively associated with treatment costs and service use, although the association was nonlinear. Claimants with moderate yellow flag scores were similarly likely to incur lengthy claims as claimants with at-risk scores. Discussion: Capturing data on psychosocial factors for compensable patients with ALBP has merit in predicting lengthy claims. The validity of the published yellow flag cut-points requires further testing. Keywords: acute low back pain, yellow flags, clinical guideline, lengthy claim...|$|R

40|$|Background: Drug-induced QT {{interval}} prolongation {{is associated}} with rare but life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death. To study ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death associated with QT prolongation in large databases, an accurate operational definition of this outcome is needed. Frequently prescribed macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics are associated with torsades de pointes arrhythmia and sudden death. Due to the dose-dependent nature of the risk, concomitant use of multiple QT-prolonging drugs may pose a greater threat than singular use. Several observational epidemiologic studies suggest that azithromycin may have {{an increased risk of}} ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Meanwhile, other observational studies observed a relatively similar cardiac toxicity profile with azithromycin, as compared with no antibiotic use or other antibiotics. ^ Objectives: The purpose of the first manuscript in this dissertation is to identify operational definitions of arrhythmias and sudden death associated with QT prolongation used in retrospective database studies and to compare validation results between algorithms. The second manuscript focuses on quantifying the risk of cardiac adverse events related to concurrent concomitant use of QT-prolonging antibiotics and other drugs with similar pro-arrhythmic potential, and the risk factors associated with such events in a national, privately insured population in the United States. The third manuscript seeks to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death for macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics in a national, commercially insured population in the United States and to compare these results with previously published observational studies. ^ Methods: In the first manuscript, we conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed to identify retrospective studies published between January 1, 2000 and August 31, 2016. We identified and reviewed studies of ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death associated with QT prolongation in large administrative databases. Validation methods and results were also extracted where validation was conducted. ^ In the second manuscript, we performed a retrospective case-control study using an administrative health claims database from a large <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> from 2011 to 2013. Cases of ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death due to QT prolongation were selected using a validated algorithm identified from the first manuscript. Four controls were matched to each case on age, sex, and region. Concomitant drug use was defined as overlapping durations of prescriptions of a QT-prolonging antibiotic and one other QT drug of interest. Odds ratios of risk factors and concomitant QT prolonging medication use were calculated using conditional logistic regression. ^ In the third manuscript, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in the same administrative health claims database from a large <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> from 2011 to 2013. The study cohort consisted of patients who filled an outpatient prescription for macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, or amoxicillin. Amoxicillin episodes were 1 -to- 1 matched to macrolide and fluoroquinolone episodes on propensity scores. Inpatient admissions or emergency department visits with a primary diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia were assessed within 10 days and 30 days of the prescription dispensing. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio. ^ Findings: In the first manuscript, several algorithms for identifying QT prolongation in large databases have been developed and validated. We found a common algorithm for QT prolongation that was validated in Medicaid, Medicare, and the Italian National Health Service data. We also found a validated operational definition for sudden death in Medicaid data. ^ In the second manuscript, we found that concomitant and proximal use of QT-prolonging antibiotics with other QT medications predicted ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death. ^ In the third manuscript, azithromycin use and fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased cardiac risk compared with amoxicillin. Macrolide antibiotics, as a class, increased the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in the 10 days following the prescription dispensing. ...|$|R

The study cohort consisted of patients who filled an outpatient prescription for macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, or amoxicillin. Amoxicillin episodes were 1 -to- 1 matched to macrolide and fluoroquinolone episodes on propensity scores. Inpatient admissions or emergency department visits with a primary diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia were assessed within 10 days and 30 days of the prescription dispensing. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio. Findings In the first manuscript, several algorithms for identifying QT prolongation in large databases have been developed and validated. We found a common algorithm for QT prolongation that was validated in Medicaid, Medicare, and the Italian National Health Service data. We also found a validated operational definition for sudden death in Medicaid data. In the second manuscript, we found that concomitant and proximal use of QTprolonging antibiotics with other QT medications predicted ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death. In the third manuscript, azithromycin use and fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased cardiac risk compared with amoxicillin. Macrolide antibiotics, as a class, increased the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in the 10 days following the prescription dispensing...|$|R

40|$|This study {{considers}} the discretionary premium-setting behavior of municipalities in the Japanese system {{of long-term care}} insurance (LTCI). Although, the LTCI system is managed by the municipality, but the financial system is controlled by <b>national</b> health <b>insurers,</b> and the municipality {{seems to have no}} discretion in managing it. However, we find that the premium-setting forecast of each municipality is different, contrary to the intention of the LTCI system. Adjustment subsidy does not function in line with the intention of the system, affecting the standard premium-setting process. Moreover, our empirical results show that municipalities seem to have discretion in premium setting. Cities, in particular, set premiums low, reflecting elderly political power. In addition, premiums are influenced elderly political power when few neighboring municipalities are available for reference. Municipalities do have leeway in premium setting, contrary to the intention of the LTCI system...|$|R

It also advises starting vaccination {{as soon as}} available and continuing throughout the influenza season. This study examined US seasonal vaccination trends during five consecutive influenza seasons in privately-insured children and adults. MethodsThis retrospective, observational cohort study examined trends in influenza vaccination during the 2007 – 2008 through 2011 – 2012 influenza seasons using administrative claims data from a large <b>national</b> <b>insurer.</b> ResultsThe size of analysis population ranged from 1144, 098 to 1245, 487 (children, ≥ 6 months- 17 years of age) and from 3931, 622 to 4158, 223 (adults, 18 – 64 years of age). Vaccination frequency increased through 2010 – 2011, was most frequent in young children, and decreased with age. Vaccination rates were highest in the Northeast and lowest in the West and were higher in individuals with frequent outpatient office visits than in those with no or rare visits, with larger differences seen in children. Between 2007 and 2011, the use of preservative-free inactivated vaccine increased, the use of multidose vaccines containing preservatives decreased, {{and the use of}} live attenuated influenza vaccines increased among children 2 – 17 years of age. From 2007 – 2008 through 2009 – 2010, the timing of vaccination each year began earlier than the previous one; it remained stable from 2009 – 2010 through 2011 – 2012. ConclusionAnnual influenza vaccination claims for privately-insured children and adults increased and shifted earlier from 2007 through 2009 – 2011. During the 2011 – 2012 influenza season, 25. 4 % of children aged 6 months- 17 years and 12. 3 % of adults aged 18 – 64 years were vaccinated. Increasing influenza vaccination should remain a priority, and alternative venues for seasonal influenza vaccination should be considered {{in order to meet the}} Healthy People 2020 goal of 80 % to 90 % coverage among children...|$|R
40|$|The main etiologies of dementia, a {{neurodegenerative}} disease, consist of: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Vascular Dementia (VD), Frontotemporal Lobar Dementia (FTD), and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). AD {{the most}} common form of dementia is the sixth leading cause of death in the US, where currently 5. 3 million Americans are diagnosed with Late-Onset and 95 % of cases are 65 years and older. Early-Onset represents the remaining 5 % of cases where ages at diagnosis is younger than 65 years. AD is characterized by a progressive loss of neurons with impact on patient cognition, function, and behavior. ^ The 2015 Alzheimer’s Association Report estimated direct and indirect costs of AD and other dementias will reach $ 226 billion with an expected five-fold increase to $ 1. 1 trillion by the year 2050. With no treatment available that stops, or slows down progression of the disease places the cost estimates of AD and dementia on top of the list of most expensive chronic diseases. ^ The next generation of AD medications being investigated will target progression of the disease. Disease-modifying medications (DMMs) are being developed with a mechanism of action directed towards the main hallmarks found in AD patients: the amyloid-beta (A?) plaques, and the tau tangles. Tolfenamic acid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug, is being repurposed in the US as a DMM for AD treatment; human clinical trials still pending. Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody, binds A? and increases its clearance; Phase III human clinical trials are in progress. DMMs are anticipated to improve cognition, function and behavior. The objectives, hypotheses, methods and results of this dissertation follow the manuscript format, and are three fold: ^ Manuscript 1 : The objective was to estimate cost-effectiveness of novel disease-modifying medication (DMM) compared to standard medication care currently used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The hypothesis was that the DMM option will show a favorable cost-effectiveness when compared to standard care. Using a Markov Model with a study population comprised of a hypothetical 1000 patients, 65 years and older, we evaluated quality life years (QALYs) gained by the new DMM and an appropriate price to develop a cost-effectiveness framework for the new product. In the Markov model we were able to determine an increase in QALYs when compared to standard of care with a cost value for DMM much higher than current standard care while still showing cost-effectiveness as a new treatment option. ^ Manuscript 2 : The objective was to determine affordability to payer’s budget i. e. insurance or hospital upon the introduction of the new cost-effective disease-modifying medication (DMM) class in treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The hypothesis was that the introduction of DMM will have minimal budgetary changes to direct costs incurred by payers. Using a 1 -year budget impact analysis, a prospective short-term analysis was conducted using Optum™ (January 2010 -Decemeber 2012), a large <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> database with administrative health claims information, with a study population of patients 65 years and older. Two scenarios are to be compared: current mix treatment costs of medications used in Alzheimer’s versus a new mix treatment cost that included the addition of DMM to current mix treatment. The difference in total payer cost of the two scenarios represents the budget impact of the new therapy implementation, allowing us to predicate future cost of new treatment mix. The study estimated a total per-member-per-month (PMPM) treatment cost pre- and post- introduction of DMM that would be affordable to payer’s and recommended to be added to formulary. ^ Manuscript 3 : The objective was to describe prevalence, incidence, and direct total cost predicators associated with Early-Onset Dementia (EOD) and its etiologies. The hypothesis was that Alzheimer’s disease would be main predicator of overall EOD direct cost. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Optum™ (January 2010 -Decemeber 2012), a large <b>national</b> <b>insurer</b> database with administrative health claims information, with a study population of patients 21 - 64 years and older. Total cost components include: physician visits, hospital visits, nursing home care, and prescription drugs associated with EOD treatment. Using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to assess the relationships between total cost and the covariates of interest, we identified age, geographical regions, EOD subtypes, and comorbidities as total cost predicators of EOD. ...|$|R
