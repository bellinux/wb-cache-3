6000|$|I {{hold that}} the {{proposition}} that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false. It is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> I hold {{that the history of}} this country shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these [...] "police regulations" [...] which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it. Not only so, but is there not another fact,--how came this Dred Scott decision to be made? It was made upon the case of a negro being taken and actually held in slavery in Minnesota Territory, claiming his freedom because the act of Congress prohibited his being so held there. Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held there without police regulations? There is at least one matter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the Territory, not only without police regulations, but in the teeth of congressional legislation supposed to be valid at the time. This shows that there is vigour enough in slavery to plant itself in a new country, even against unfriendly legislation. It takes not only law, but the enforcement of law to keep it out. That is {{the history of this country}} upon the subject.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} clarify his {{philosophical}} proposal Peña {{has set up}} several systems of sentential and quantificational logic which he calls «transitive logic», TL, as partial implementations of his programme. TL {{is characterized by a}} couple of negations, one strong («not at all»), which has all classical properties, and a weak one (a mere «not»), which is degree-sensitive. The fragment of TL without strong negation is a non-conservative extension of Alan Ross Anderson and Nuel Belnap's logic of relevance, E, (by adding the funnel principle, namely that either A implies B or else A; in other words, what is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> implies anything). Transitive implication is partly similar to relevant implication (although much stronger), but its underlying philosophical motivation is entirely different, since it is read «to the extent least that...». The fragment of TL without weak negation and the implication operator is classical logic. TL is thus a logical blend or rather a crossbreed.|$|E

5000|$|As intellectuals {{began to}} {{question}} traditional understandings {{of the world and}} think on a global scale, new [...] "truths" [...] were created to help explain the world as placeless, free of cultural specificity, abstract and apolitical. [...] They began to manifest themselves in development policies, political apparatuses, and other institutions. In the late 19th and 20th century, Émile Durkheim wrote that [...] "the truths of modern science are independent of any local context", echoing the Enlightenment's philosophies and assuming an isotropic globe, thus allowing homogeneity to overtake difference. A sense of security and superiority was wielded as the world was now understood, which allowed for the continued teaching of and reliance upon universal [...] " [...] truths".One can see how saying that all knowledge is geographically located is widely taken as a way of saying that the knowledge in question is <b>not</b> authentically <b>true</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|R

As such, by the normal rules of feudal law the kingdom should be split amongst the direct descendants of the co-heiresses of David I. Unsurprisingly, a court made up of Scots nobles rejected these arguments out of hand.|$|R
50|$|David Fury, {{who wrote}} this episode, {{had written a}} script called ‘Corrupt’ in which Kate was a police officer working {{undercover}} as a prostitute who was actually becoming a prostitute and was addicted to crack. That was originally the introduction of Kate. Obviously we were {{still trying to figure}} out what the show was at that point. This was the first episode after the pilot, and it was written before the new staff arrived. They just went incredibly dark with this thing and decided at the end of the day that it was a little bit too hopeless, a little too grim. After that episode was written it was actually being prepped when the network, too, had some concerns about it.`It would seem that this was about the same time that the Internet ran rampant with rumors that the WB had shut down the show for retooling. You can’t really call it a shut down because we hadn’t really started,` Minear clarifies. `We just pushed back the shoot date for the first episode a week or two. It’s not like alarms went off and we had to pull plugs on everything. I’ve read on the Internet where people were saying the network freaked, and they told us to shut down, and that’s <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> We were still creating what the idea of the show was going to be, and basically we decided to rethink that first episode. The other thing that people don’t realize is that a lot of the other episodes that we’ve done this year were written much earlier and did not change significantly. It was really that first episode where we went back, rethought it, and we were lucky we had the luxury to do that.|$|E
5000|$|Ubaidullah then {{proceeded}} from Afghanistan to Russia, {{where he spent}} seven months {{at the invitation of}} the Soviet leadership, and was officially treated as a guest of the state. During this period, he studied the ideology of socialism. According to an article in a major newspaper of Pakistan, titled 'Of socialism and Islam', [...] "Islam showed not only deep sympathy for the poor and downtrodden but also condemned strongly the concentration of wealth in a number of Makkan surahs. Makkah, as an important centre of international trade, was home to the very rich (tribal chiefs) and the extremely poor." [...] In Russia, however, he was unable to meet Lenin who was severely ill at the time. Some people, at that time, thought that Sindhi was impressed by Communist ideals during his stay in Russia, however that is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> In 1923, Ubaidullah left Russia for Turkey where he initiated the third phase of the 'Shah Waliullah Movement' in 1924. He issued the 'Charter for the Independence of India' from Istanbul. Ubaidullah then left for Mecca, Arabia in 1927 and remained there until 1929. During this period, he brought the message of the rights of Muslims and other important religious issues to the people of Arabia. During his stay in Russia, he was not impressed by the Communist ideas but rather, after the Soviet revolution, he presented his belief to the Soviet government that: [...] "Communism is not a natural law system but rather is a reaction to oppression, the natural law is offered by Islam". He attempted to convince them in a very systematic and logical manner. But he could not give an answer at that time, when he was asked to provide an example of a state which was being run according to the laws of Islam.|$|E
40|$|There {{seems to}} be the idea that {{everything}} has been written on John Williams, because he is such a famous film composer. Yet, this is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> since academic studies of his work are rare. Moreover, when discussed critically, if not academically, the take on Williams's work is often oversimplified if not prejudiced. On the other hand, the stylistic influence of Williams’s work on contemporary scoring has also been overstated by fans and favourable critics. The use of big orchestras and dense sound textures is actually the only thing that contemporary mainstream Hollywood composers such as Hans Zimmer seem to have inherited from him, certainly not Williams’s leitmotivic, symphonic, and classical-hollywood-sounding style. This chapter aims at defining Williams's contribution to contemporary scoring in fairer terms. The essay surveys Williams's career in terms of his revival of the musical style and repertoire of Hollywood’s Golden Age, and compares his style with the general style of mainstream contemporary film music...|$|E
50|$|As mates, INTJs want {{harmony and}} order {{in the home and}} in relationships. The most {{independent}} of all types, INTJs trust their intuition when choosing friends and mates—even in spite of contradictory evidence or pressure from others. The emotions of an INTJ are hard to read, and neither male nor female INTJs are apt to express emotional reactions. At times, INTJs seem cold, reserved, and unresponsive, while in fact they are almost hypersensitive to signals of rejection from those they care for. In social situations, INTJs may also be unresponsive and may neglect small rituals designed to put others at ease. For example, INTJs may communicate that idle dialogue such as small talk is a waste of time. This may create the impression that the INTJ is rude or in a hurry—an impression that is not always intended, and may <b>not</b> be <b>true</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> In their interpersonal relationships, INTJs are usually better in a working situation than in a recreational situation.|$|R
5000|$|Cope's rule, {{named after}} American {{paleontologist}} Edward Drinker Cope, postulates that population lineages tend {{to increase in}} body size over evolutionary time. It was never actually stated by Cope, although he favoured the occurrence of linear evolutionary trends.
