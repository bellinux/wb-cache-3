25|$|In contrast, Jupiter-sized {{bodies that}} orbit {{too close to}} the {{habitable}} zone but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) make it very difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a strongly inclined orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{argued that}} new tests {{comparing}} DNA in the silencer {{to a sample}} from Sheila's biological mother suggested that the [...] "major component" [...] of the DNA in the silencer had not come from Sheila. A DNA sample from June's sister suggested that the major component had come from June, they argued. The court concluded that June's DNA was in the silencer, that Sheila's DNA {{may have been in}} the silencer, and that there was evidence of DNA from at least one male. The judges' conclusion was that the results were complex, incomplete, and also meaningless because they did not establish how June's DNA came to be in the silencer years after the trial, did not establish that Sheila's was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> and did not lead to a conclusion that Bamber's conviction was unsafe.|$|E
500|$|The concert's setlist {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} songs from Up!, with several hits from The Woman in Me (1995) and Come on Over (1997). The songs from Up! were not {{performed in a}} specific format from the three studio versions of the album. Shania desired to approach the live productions as their [...] "own beast". The show commenced with Shania, who was costumed by a [...] "Body Glove" [...] top and black cargo pants, arriving {{from the back of}} the stage to perform [...] "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" [...] alongside her band. The singer then followed with [...] "Up!" [...] and after talking with the audience the singer says it has been 3 and 1/2 years being up on the concert stage and then performed Honey I'm Home. Shania continued to perform a total of ten songs during the segment. At one point, she invited an audience member onstage to propose to his girlfriend. She accepted and the two slow danced onstage as Shania sang [...] "When You Kiss Me", sitting on a stool placed towards the end of the runway. The segment ended with a performance of [...] "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!", where Shania invited Shyanne, Meanny and Ashley to join her onstage. In the succeeding segment, Shania donned a tan, multi-patterned halter top with the words [...] "True Love" [...] spelled on the front and black, sequined wide leg trousers. She began with [...] "From This Moment On". Then, she performed [...] "No One Needs to Know" [...] with an acoustic guitar and [...] "Thank You Baby! (For Makin' Someday Come So Soon)" [...] with a small orchestra accompanying her. She concluded the nine-song segment with [...] "(If You're <b>Not</b> <b>in</b> <b>It</b> for Love) I'm Outta Here!". The singer returned to the stage for the third and final segment, wearing a black, long-sleeve top with an American flag imprinted in the center and denim capri pants. She performed a rendition of [...] "You're Still the One" [...] playing acoustic guitar and ended the show with [...] "Nah!" [...] and [...] "Rock This Country!".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{talks of}} a cease-fire, Fatah al-Islam militants {{continued}} battling the Lebanese army at {{the outskirts of}} the refugee camp for a third day. Fighting resumed when Lebanese tanks and artillery began shelling the members of the radical Fatah al-Islam group taking refuge in the camp. By mid-morning the battle intensified with heavy exchanges of small arms and machine-gun fire. Conditions inside the overcrowded Nahr al-Bared camp became increasingly unbearable as the army continued pounding militant positions there. Doctors in the camp have pleaded for a ceasefire because of the dead and wounded lying on the streets. Electricity has been cut and there is a limited supply of water. Brig. Gen.

2500|$|Canadian singer Shania Twain has {{released}} five studio albums, two compilation albums, three remix albums, one box set, two live albums, 38 singles, two promotional singles, and made six guest appearances. In 1992, Twain signed to Mercury Records Nashville in the United States and released her eponymous debut studio album, Shania Twain, the following year. It was a commercial failure, peaking at number 67 on Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and produced three singles, which were also commercial failures. However, the album attracted {{the interest of}} record producer Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange. He and Twain collaborated on her second release, The Woman in Me, which was released in 1995. The Woman in Me commenced with small sales but eventually led Twain to commercial success. It topped Top Country Albums and peaked at number five on the main-genre Billboard 200. The album was certified 12 times platinum (diamond) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and sold over 7.6 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Furthermore, The Woman in Me led to success in the singer's native country, Canada, where it was certified double diamond by Music Canada and was once the best-selling album by a female country singer; Twain later surpassed herself. The album spawned eight singles, four of which ("Any Man of Mine", [...] "(If You're <b>Not</b> <b>in</b> <b>It</b> for Love) I'm Outta Here!", [...] "You Win My Love", and [...] "No One Needs to Know") topped the US Hot Country Singles & Tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to October 2012, Deep Purple {{had never}} been {{nominated}} for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, [...] "they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? ...And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ...the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions." [...] Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement for the non-induction of Deep Purple; [...] "The {{list of people who}} haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling.. big one for me is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction. In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: [...] "I'm {{not going to get into}} the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language...'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?" [...] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: [...] "that Deep Purple are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> [...] It's bullshit.

Rabbi Meir calculated that the tablets were 6 handbreadths long, 6 wide, and 3 thick, and were placed {{next to each other}} in the Ark. Thus the tablets accounted for 12 handbreadths, leaving 3 handbreadths unaccounted for. Rabbi Meir subtracted 1 handbreadth for the two sides of the Ark (½ handbreadth for each side), leaving 2 handbreadths for the Torah scroll. Rabbi Meir deduced that a scroll was in the Ark from the words of [...] "There was nothing in the Ark save the two tablets of stone that Moses put there." [...] As the words [...] "nothing" [...] and [...] "save" [...] create a limitation followed by a limitation, Rabbi Meir followed the rule of Scriptural construction that a limitation on a limitation implies the opposite — here the presence of something not mentioned — the Torah scroll. Rabbi Judah, however, taught that the cubit of the Ark equaled only 5 handbreadths, meaning that the Ark was 12½ handbreadths long. The tablets (each 6 handbreadths wide) were deposited next {{to each other in the}} Ark, accounting for 12 handbreadths. There was thus left half a handbreadth, for which the two sides of the Ark accounted.
