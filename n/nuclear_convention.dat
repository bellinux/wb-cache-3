Complete separation of promotion and regulatory functions and responsibilities was achieved in 2001, when the President of Pakistan promulgated the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority Ordinance No.III of 2001. Consequently, Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) was created, dissolving the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Board and Directorate of Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection. The first chairman of PNRA was Jamshed Azim Hashmi who headed the authority till 2009. In 2009, the chairmanship was transferred to Anwar Habib.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objections}} raised against total {{elimination of}} nuclear weapons are built around a few arguments mostly of non-technical nature. Nuclear weapons and the strategies for their use {{have resulted in the}} establishment of a vicious circle within which the international community is trapped. The argument that the world will be unsafe without nuclear weapons is only meant to further the narrow self-interest of the nuclear weapon states and their allies. The World Court’s far-reaching 1996 advisory opinion concluded that almost any use or threat of use {{of nuclear weapons}} would violate international humanitarian law and law applicable in armed conflict, undermining most claims of nuclear weapon states regarding the legitimacy of possession, use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. The next logical step would be an initiative for a <b>nuclear</b> <b>convention</b> banning the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons in Asia and the adjoining oceans. But as long as the dominant elites in society and the nation-state believe in the utility of nuclear weapons for national security or as the currency of power, abolition of nuclear weapons will remain a mirage...|$|E
40|$|This Dissertation {{presents}} {{a study of}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the negotiation and early interpretation of the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), an instrument which remains the most important global nuclear arms control measure in international law. Using data from recently released Australian government documents, the study analyses {{the process by which}} Australia was transformed from an ambivalent nuclear sceptic within the Western alliance, into a steadfast global campaigner against the spread of nuclear weapons. It concludes that Australia 2 ̆ 7 s urgent search during 1967 and 1968 for coherence in its policy on nuclear weapons acquisition, largely played out within sections of the Australian bureaucracy and political leadership, was not only the catalyst for that transformation, but also an important step in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s search for 2 ̆ 2 middle power 2 ̆ 2 status in both a regional and wider sense. The study uses an interdisciplinary theoretical model which asserts the complementary nature of international law and international relations theory in explanations of relations between states. That model proposes that each discipline is capable of enhancing the insights of the other, in order to account - more closely in concert than each does individually - for the rule-following behaviour of nation-states. Beginning in Chapter One with a critique of the NPT and the regime of institutions and understandings which surround it, the study moves, in Chapter Two, to a review of the domestic and international context in which Australia 2 ̆ 7 s nuclear weapons policy debate was conducted, while introducing the elements of division within the Australian federal bureaucracy which largely prosecuted that debate. Chapters Three and Four analyse the debate in detail, concluding that its inconclusive result induced Australia 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to agree to America 2 ̆ 7 s request for immediate accession to the NPT. This, in tum, resulted in Australia exercising, through its recalcitrance, disproportionate influence over the US on the interpretation of the terms of the treaty. Chapter Five moves analysis to the international arena, and the forum of the United Nations General Assembly, in which Australia finally found the limit of America 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to accommodate the concerns of a small but significant Western ally located in a region of strategic importance. Chapter Six examines the process by which Australia 2 ̆ 7 s influence over the US on the interpretation of the terms of the NPT was translated into guidance to other nuclear threshold states through the Western alliance. It also examines the level of influence exerted by Australia through its bilateral discussions with other states over the terms of the treaty. It concludes that Australia, mainly through the former process, could claim {{a significant role in the}} formulation of the world 2 ̆ 7 s most important multilateral <b>nuclear</b> <b>convention</b> through its insistence on interpretative clarity. Finally, the study draws general conclusions on the significance of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s nuclear weapons debate for its aspirations to 2 ̆ 2 middle power 2 ̆ 2 status. It concludes that its indisputable leadership role, after 1972, in global nuclear disarmament efforts of many kinds, is an example of that status. Its most important theoretical conclusion concerns the demonstrated utility of an interdisciplinary model for the study of relations between states...|$|E

Themes such as gatekeeping, family microenvironments, intragenerational influence and individual/collaborative influence attempts emerge as ways through which individuals seek to restrict the power of others whilst maintaining or enhancing their own power levels in family decision-making...|$|R

It identifies two types of international methods to regulate labour problems -the International Labour Organisation <b>nuclear</b> <b>conventions</b> and the introduction of a social clause in trade agreements - and discuss there role in a democratic international community, where on the multiculturalism and the economic and social disparities must be taking into account.
