25|$|On July 31, {{with just}} hours {{left before the}} end of the MLB <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline, the Tigers traded pitcher Drew Smyly and shortstop Willy Adames to the Tampa Bay Rays, and Austin Jackson to the Seattle Mariners in a three-team deal to acquire pitcher David Price from the Rays. With the {{acquisition}} of Price, the Tigers became the first team in major league history with three consecutive Cy Young Award winners in its starting rotation.|$|E
25|$|When the 1998 season began, Johnson {{was upset}} the Mariners would not {{offer him a}} {{contract}} extension, given his contract was expiring after the season. Though the Mariners initially wanted to keep Johnson, turning down a trade offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers, they fell out of contention, going 8-20 in June. Minutes before the <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline, on July 31, the Mariners traded Johnson to the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers, Freddy García, Carlos Guillén, and John Halama.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>non-waiver</b> trade {{deadline}} of July 31 loomed, the Angels {{were seen as}} big contenders for Heath Bell, Cliff Lee and even Roy Halladay; however, all of these rumors fell through. Nearly a month later, however, on August 29, {{two days before the}} waiver trade deadline, the Angels acquired Tampa Bay Rays ace Scott Kazmir, in exchange for two low-level minor leaguers and prized prospect Sean Rodriguez. Ervin Santana shut-out the Texas Rangers for the West Division Title on September 28, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Supreme Court decided Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A. v. M/V Sky Reefer. Fruit {{shipped from}} Morocco to New England via a Panamanian-flagged boat {{was found by}} the buyer to have been {{improperly}} stored and damaged; the buyer's insurer pursued an in rem action against the ship to recover. The bill of lading contained a clause calling for disputes to be arbitrated in Japan by the Tokyo Maritime Arbitration Commission (TOMAC); the buyer had cited the <b>non-waiver</b> provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) in opposition. Both the district court and the First Circuit compelled arbitration.|$|E
25|$|The A's {{started out}} as a {{favorite}} to win the AL West again, and played up to that, having the best record in baseball at the All-Star break. To bolster their starting rotation, they acquired pitchers Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel from the Chicago Cubs for several top prospects on July 4, and later acquired Jon Lester from the Boston Red Sox at the July 31 <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline for Yoenis Céspedes. However, without the big bat of Cespedes, poor production from All-Stars Josh Donaldson and Brandon Moss, and an injury to closer Sean Doolittle, they struggled in August and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim caught up, sweeping them in a key 4-game series between the two teams. At the August 31 waiver trade deadline, the A's acquired first baseman Adam Dunn from the Chicago White Sox and cash considerations for a minor league player. Despite their struggles which continued into September, they made the playoffs {{on the last day of}} the season, and faced the Kansas City Royals in the Wild Card Game. While they carried a 7-3 lead going into the bottom of the 8th inning, they managed to relinquish it due to the Royals' baserunning skills coupled with ineffective pitching, allowing them to tie the game. They did regain the lead in the top of the 12th, but the Royals responded with 2 runs in the bottom of the inning, winning on a walk-off single by Salvador Pérez.|$|E
500|$|At {{of the end}} of June the Phillies, with a 36–46 record, were at {{the bottom}} of the NL East and most {{observers}} agreed that they should be [...] "sellers" [...] rather than [...] "buyers" [...] (trade better players for future prospects, rather than trading future prospects for established players) by the July 31 trade deadline. However, the Phillies management (including general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. and president Dave Montgomery) did not think a fire sale would benefit the organization. According to Amaro: [...] Marlon Byrd and closer Jonathan Papelbon were top trade candidates because of other teams' needs and the fact that neither had no-trade clauses. Papelbon expressed a willingness to be traded, saying that it was [...] "mind-boggling" [...] to him that some players would prefer to remain on a losing team. According to a USA Today article: [...] Although Amaro announced Cole Hamels' availability, his high asking price hindered the possibility of a deal. Cliff Lee had been available, but after re-injuring his elbow (and probably missing the rest of the season) the possibility of a deal evaporated. The <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline passed with no trades by the Phillies. Amaro was harshly criticized for holding onto Papelbon, Byrd, Hamels, Lee, A. J. Burnett and Antonio Bastardo. Although they did not make a deal before the <b>non-waiver</b> trading deadline, the team could still move a player on waivers; they did so, trading Roberto Hernandez to the Dodgers on August 7 for two players to be named later. The first named player was Jesmuel Valentin, son of former major leaguer José Valentín and a switch-hitting second baseman called a [...] "breakout candidate" [...] by a Baseball Prospectus writer. Observers generally considered Valentin a good fit for the Phillies, since the team did not give up much in return. Several weeks later the Phillies acquired their second named player, right-handed pitcher Victor Arano, to complete the trade. Arano, rated the Dodgers' 14th-best prospect by MLB.com, had a [...] fastball and a slider in his repertoire. According to a Dodgers source, he had potential as a back-of-the-rotation starter. Shortly before the September 1 waiver deadline, the Phillies traded [...] "perennial fourth outfielder" [...] John Mayberry, Jr. to the Toronto Blue Jays for third-base prospect Gustavo Pierre] ...|$|E
500|$|Two nights after San Diego Padres {{management}} informed Nevin that Xavier Nady {{would replace}} {{him as the}} starting first baseman, Nevin rejected a trade to the Baltimore Orioles for Sidney Ponson on July 25, 2005. Nevin exercised a clause in his contract that gave him the right to block transactions that would send him to any of eight franchises, {{one of which was}} the Orioles. He was instead traded on July 30, a day before the <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline, to the Texas Rangers for Chan Ho Park, whose salary the Rangers wanted to dump. In his first thirteen games with the Rangers, the team posted a 1–12 record as Nevin batted 5-for-44. That put his season batting average under [...]200, known as the [...] "Mendoza Line". The Rangers benched Nevin in September, giving his starts to prospect first baseman Adrian Gonzalez after the team was eliminated from playoff contention. In his first game back in the lineup on September 24, his average dropped to [...]182. He refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed.|$|E
500|$|One {{month after}} his first call-up, the Cardinals {{recalled}} Taveras on June 30. [...] He was batting [...]318 with a [...]502 SLG at Memphis. [...] To allow him more playing opportunities, the Cardinals traded slumping incumbent right fielder Allen Craig to the Boston Red Sox on the July 31 <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline. [...] His first career three-hit game was on September 7 against the Milwaukee Brewers. [...] That series, he played {{three of the four}} games, collecting five hits in eight at-bats with a home run and four RBI. [...] It was one of eight multi-hit games on the year. [...] Taveras finished the 2014 season with a batting average of [...]239 in 80 major league games. [...] He appeared on the postseason roster for the Cardinals, playing exclusively as a pinch hitter, and collected three hits and two runs scored in seven total at bats. [...] His postseason debut was in the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. [...] One hit was a home run that tied the score in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series against the Giants, the only game the Cardinals won in the series; as it turned out, it was the final hit in his career. [...] His final tweet was [...] "Thanks for all the fan support!" [...] on October 13.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{one of the}} three, the <b>non-waiver</b> provision, was {{identical}} in both statutes. Furthermore, the 1934 Act limited jurisdiction to federal courts and allowed for only an implied cause of action rather than an express one, resulting in a higher burden of proof for a plaintiff making allegations under the same sections as Byrd. Therefore, the 1934 Act's <b>non-waiver</b> language was inapplicable since it explicitly referred to [...] "any provision of this chapter" [...] and could not thus cover the 1933 Act as well.|$|E
2500|$|Cone was {{the lone}} Mets {{representative}} at the 1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, going 9–4 with a 2.56 ERA at the All-Star break. With a 56–67 record, and fourteen games behind the first place Pirates, the infamous [...] "worst team money could buy" [...] traded Cone to the Toronto Blue Jays for Jeff Kent and Ryan Thompson on August 27, 1992 after the <b>non-waiver</b> trading deadline.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Ludwick was {{activated}} {{from the}} DL on July 24, after having missed a month {{due to his}} calf injury. [...] One week later, on July 31, Ludwick was traded at the <b>non-waiver</b> deadline to the San Diego Padres {{as part of a}} three-way deal. [...] The Cardinals received minor league left-hand pitcher Nick Greenwood from the Padres and coveted starting pitcher Jake Westbrook from Cleveland along with cash considerations. [...] Minor-league pitcher Corey Kluber went from the Padres to the Indians to complete the deal.|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy {{argued that}} the {{language}} of the 1933 Act offered [...] "no sound basis" [...] for holding that the <b>non-waiver</b> provision reached predispute arbitration clauses. Since it allowed investors to file cases in state court without the possibility of removal to federal court and whatever additional procedural protections that venue would offer, it could not have been Congress's intent to have held investors to the statute's procedural provisions against their interests. In McMahon and Mitsubushi Motors, the Court had also held that similar language did not bar arbitration of claims.|$|E
2500|$|Wilko {{had been}} part of the respondent's {{argument}} against arbitration, since the deal had also included some stock. During his majority opinion holding for the petitioner, Justice Potter Stewart noted that [...] "a colorable argument could be made" [...] that Wilko did not reach the 1934 Act due to differences in the corresponding sections of the statutes. The <b>non-waiver</b> provision was narrower, the private right of action only implied, and the 1934 Act only provided for federal jurisdiction. Stewart found those concerns irrelevant to the case, since it concerned an international transaction under which arbitration might be a better solution.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{day before}} the <b>non-waiver</b> trade {{deadline}} this year (Mon. Aug. 1, 3pm), the Cardinals traded outfielder Charlie Tilson for LHP reliever Zach Duke, 33. Duke led the AL with 53 appearances mostly in a setup role which is how the Cardinals plan to use him, posting 2-0, 2.63 ERA and 1.25 WHIP over 37 [...] innings. Duke is under contract in 2017, earning $5 mil. this year and $5.5 mil. next year. LH batters hit [...]264 against him compared to [...]182 for righties, a backwards split contrasting with the usual split for pitchers. But RH batters have walked 13 times, giving them a [...]325 OBP against Duke, compared to him walking LH batters only 3 times for a [...]299 OBP.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] and 1999, the Mariners had losing records due {{primarily}} to {{their lack of}} pitching depth. Randy Johnson was traded at the 1998 July <b>non-waiver</b> trading deadline to the Houston Astros after GM Woody Woodard publicly stated he did not intend on offering Johnson (who was a free agent following the 1998 season) a long-term contract. Johnson subsequently requested to be traded. He had been inconsistent {{during the first half}} of the season; some fans and press thought he had been trying to force a trade through malaise. The trade that sent Johnson to the Astros turned out to be a major steal for the Mariners as although Randy Johnson went 10-1 with 116 Strikeouts down the stretch the Astros were eliminated by The San Diego Padres in the NLDS and Johnson would sign with The Arizona Diamondbacks in the offseason, While the Mariners got future stars in Pitcher Freddy Garcia and Shortstop Carlos Guillen. Strong pitching from aces Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer was not enough to fully offset the loss, and the bullpen's struggles continued. Midway through the 1999 season, the Mariners moved to Safeco Field. After the 1999 season, Ken Griffey, Jr. requested and attained a trade to the Cincinnati Reds, leaving Alex Rodriguez as the face of the franchise at the beginning of the high-expectation Safeco Field era, which was during the years 2000–03.|$|E
2500|$|After having traded Luzardo {{as part of}} {{the deal}} with the Athletics, the Nationals traded two more left-handed {{pitching}} prospects at the July <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline. First, they made a trade with the division rival Philadelphia Phillies on July 28, fencing 18th-ranked prospect McKenzie Mills to Philadelphia for veteran utilityman Howie Kendrick. Kendrick was activated the next day, with the Nationals placing infielder Stephen Drew on the 10-day disabled list and designating minor league first baseman Matt Skole for assignment to clear a spot on the 40-man roster. Kendrick lashed a pinch-hit double in his Nationals debut against Germán Márquez of the Colorado Rockies in the July 29 game and scored one of the team's two runs in the 4–2 loss, in which Harper's hitting streak came to an end at 19 games. Heading into a double-header against the Rockies on July 30 due to a rainout, the Nationals selected Fedde's contract to start the first game. In a corresponding move, they released veteran outfielder Heisey, who had hit [...]162 for Washington while spending considerable time on the disabled list during the season. In his major league debut, Fedde pitched four innings while giving up seven runs, five of them earned, and striking out three. He took the loss in the 10–6 contest, in which Zimmerman homered twice to set a new record in the history of Washington, D.C., professional baseball for career home runs, surpassing Frank Howard's mark of 237 for the Washington Senators. Severino was optioned July 30 but remained with the team for the day as an extra player allowed on the roster for the double-header. Minutes after the expiry of the July 31 trade deadline, the Nationals announced they had completed a trade with the Minnesota Twins to acquire closer Brandon Kintzler for 17th-ranked prospect Tyler J. Watson. Minor league reliever Jimmy Cordero was designated for assignment to clear space for Kintzler on the 40-man roster.|$|E
2500|$|Bell was {{the highest}} paid Padres player in 2011 at $7.5 million salary and would be {{eligible}} for free agency {{at the end of the}} season. He converted his first seven save opportunities of 2011, which tied him with Hoffman for the Padres club record of 41 consecutive successful save conversions. The streak also tied him with Hoffman and Rod Beck for the then-fourth longest in MLB history. Bell blew his next save opportunity, a 3–0 lead, after he opened the ninth inning walking the first two batters, and third baseman Chase Headley made a two-out, two-run throwing error to tie the game. On May 14, Bell recorded his 100th career save in a 9–7 win over the Colorado Rockies. Bell was selected to his third consecutive All-Star game. Entering the game in the eight inning, Bell sprinted from the bullpen and did a slide in front of the pitcher's mound, taking out a chunk of the infield grass and leaving grass stains on his pants. [...] "I wanted the fans to have fun with this", said Bell. With the team 12 games under [...]500 coming out of the All-Star break, general manager Jed Hoyer said the Padres would pursue a long-term contract with Bell if they did not get a desirable trade offer for him. Ultimately Bell was not traded at the <b>non-waiver</b> trade deadline on July 31, but Hoyer admitted Bell's greatest value to the team might come as a free agent if Bell refuses salary arbitration and signs elsewhere—the Padres would receive two first-round draft picks in June 2012 as compensation. Bell said he planned to accept arbitration from the Padres if they did not agree on a multi-year deal. He finished the season 43 of 48 in save opportunities with a 2.44ERA, but he struck out less than 30percent of all opponents’ at-bats for the first time as a Padre.|$|E
