5000|$|Some {{studies have}} found that safer needles reduce injuries, but others have shown mixed results or no benefit. The {{adherence}} to [...] "no-touch" [...] protocols that eliminate direct contact with needles during use and disposal greatly reduces the risk of needlestick injuries. In the surgical setting, especially in abdominal operations, blunt-tip suture needles were found to reduce needle stick injuries by 69%. Blunt-tip or tapered-tip suture needles can be used to sew muscle and fascia. Though they are more expensive than sharp-tipped needles, this cost is balanced by the reduction in injuries, which are expensive to treat. Sharp-tipped needles cause 51-77% of surgical needlestick injuries. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have endorsed the adoption of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> <b>for</b> <b>suturing</b> fascia and muscle. Hollow-bore needles pose a greater risk of injury than solid needles, but hollow-bore needle injuries are highly preventable: 25% of hollow-bore needle injuries to healthcare professionals can be prevented by using safer needles. Gloves can also provide better protection against injuries from tapered-tip as opposed to sharp-tipped needles. In addition, the use of two pairs of gloves (double gloving) can halve the risk of needle stick injury in surgical staff. Triple gloving may be more effective than double gloving, but using thicker gloves does not make a difference. However, the evidence is of low quality. A 2014 Cochrane review found low quality evidence showing that safety devices on IV start kits and venipuncture equipment reduce the frequency of needlestick injuries. However, these safety systems can increase the risk of exposure to splashed blood. Education with training for at-risk healthcare workers can reduce their risk of needlestick injuries.

40|$|A MODIFICATION of Gillies's plastic <b>needle</b> holder <b>for</b> {{ophthalmic}} use {{was described}} by the author 17 years ago (Foster, 1938). This consisted in a reduction in size of the handle and scissors-shank of Gillies's instrument, and {{the replacement of the}} curved jaws intended to hold <b>needles</b> <b>for</b> intradermal <b>suturing</b> by the jaws of a Quarry Silcock needle holder of average size. The instrument had all the great advantages of Gillies's instrument for the forceps tie-knot, though the scissor blades could only be used when cutting sutures in the lids on the temporal side of the eye, owing to limitations of space. With the development of corneo-corneal suturing in cataract extraction, and the corneal grafting made possible by the Bindehautnadel nach Professor Vogt (usually known in England by the Grieshaber catalogue designations 81 / 7 and 8 1 / 10) and the fil de suture corneenne de Marcel Kalt (usually referred to here as Kalt's silk, though it is in fact Sea Island cotton), it became obvious that the jaws were too big to control these tiny round needles and that the serrations on the jaws at times failed to maintain a grip on the fine threads when seized parallel to them. To correct this, the jaws have-how been reduced to a little below the size of the smallest Quarry Silcock needle holder obtainable as a pattern (about half the size of the 1938 model), {{and the rest of the}} instrument has been diminished in proportion. The length is now 4 j", whereas the design of 1938 was 5 " lon...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{division}} of adhesions, ovarian cystectomys, and/or the excision or coagulation of endometriosis, pelvic pain may continue because of re-formation of adhesions between the posterior surface of the ovary and the ovarian fossa. Various methods of adhesion prevention, {{such as the use}} of Interceed, Intergel or heparinized saline etc., have proved unsuccessful. Temporary ovarian suspension is a simple technique of sus-pending the ovary, for 5 – 7 days, by attachment to the anterior abdominal wall. This allows separation of the raw area on the ovary and the ovarian fossa until surface epithelialization has occurred. When the suture is removed, the ovary falls back to its anatomical position. Objective To describe and discuss this simple technique of suspending the ovaries. Intervention The anterior abdominal wall is transilluminated with the laporoscope to demonstrate any major blood vessels, especially the inferior epigastric vessels. The junction of the lateral one-quarter and the medial three-quarters, approximately 1 inch above the inguinal ligament is the site on the anterior abdominal wall used for ovarian suspension. Non-absorbable number 0 Prolene on a straight <b>needle</b> is used <b>for</b> <b>suturing.</b> The <b>needle</b> is pushed into the abdominal cavity at the abovementioned site; it picks up the ovary and comes out of the abdominal wall at the same site. The thread is tied on the anterior abdominal wall, with appropriate adjustment of the tension. The stitch is covered with a transparent dressing which is left in position until the day of removal of the stitch...|$|R

DesignPatency data for 1385 vascular access anastomoses (clipped or sutured) was obtained from 17 hospitals and dialysis centers (Appendix). Five hundred eighteen AVF (242 clip, 276 suture) and 827 AVG (440 clip, 384 suture) were analyzed.

ResultsAccess patency (primary, secondary, overall, and intention to treat) was significantly improved in access anastomoses constructed with clips.
