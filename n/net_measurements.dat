40|$|In {{evaluating}} energy cost (EC) of walking, {{referred to}} as walking efficiency, the use of net measurement protocols (i. e. net=gross-resting) has recently been recommended. However, nothing {{is known about the}} comparative reproducibility of net protocols and the commonly used gross protocols. Ten minutes of resting and 5 minutes of walking at a self-selected speed were used to determine gross and net EC in 13 children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP; seven males, six females; mean age 8 y 7 mo [SD 3 y 4 mo], range 4 y 1 mo- 13 y) and in 10 children (three males, seven females) with typical development. In the former, their Gross Motor Function Classification System levels ranged from Level I to Level III; and seven had hemiplegia and six diplegia. There were four repeated sessions on different days, with periods of 1 week between sessions. Reproducibility was assessed for speed, and gross and net EC, by using the standard error of measurement. The results of this preliminary study showed that EC measurements were more variable for children with CP than for children with typical development. Furthermore, in both groups there was considerably more variability in the <b>net</b> <b>measurements</b> than in the gross measurements. We conclude that, {{on the basis of the}} methodology used, the use of gross EC, rather than net EC, seems a more sensitive measure of walking efficiency to detect clinically relevant changes in an individual child with C...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Vertical {{distribution}} and trophic interactions of zooplankton and fish were studied at a 150 m deep station in Bunnefjorden â€“ the innermost {{part of the}} Oslofjord - during winter 2005 / 2006. Focus was on the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica, the small clupeid fish sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and gadoids, mainly whiting (Merlangius merlangus). Bunnefjorden is characterized by hypoxy in the bottom water, and the study was part of more long-lasting investigations addressing how hypoxy may influence the vertical {{distribution and}} the trophic interactions among the pelagic fauna in the fjord. An upward looking EK 60 120 kHz echo sounder deployed on the sea bed was used for collection of acoustic data of krill and fish. Krill and fish were sampled by trawling both day and night, to verify acoustic recordings, to establish size distributions and to examine feeding behavior of krill and fish. A CTD equipped with water bottles was used to obtain hydrographical data and water for oxygen and chlorophyll a measurements. Mesozooplankton was sampled using a WP 2 <b>net.</b> <b>Measurements</b> of pigment content of stomach and hindgut of krill were examined to quantify the herbivore diet, while the carnivore diet was assessed microscopically by quantifying copepod mandible in the krill guts. Fish stomachs were dissected out, and analyzed for prey. During daytime, acoustic scattering layers of the krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, and sprat, Sprattus sprattus were restricted to waters below 75 m and 130 m respectively. Krill and sprat ascended at dusk, a few migrated {{all the way to}} the surface, however upward migration was mainly arrested at 20 - 30 m for krill and 40 - 60 m for sprat. Sprat and krill were scattered throughout the water column at night. Haddock (Merlanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting, both foraging on krill, were found in the upper and middle part of krill scattering layer during the day and in upper water layers at night. Whiting were also found to 2 predate on sprat. Although found in much less quantity in whiting stomachs than krill, one sprat do have a greater energy value than one krill. The apparent avoidance of the surface layer by krill and sprat, even at night, could be a response to predators. It could not be explained by temperature, salinity, oxygen or chlorophyll a concentrations. Temperature and salinity below sill depth were fairly homogenous by depth, and did not have any explanatory power for the vertical distribution of krill and fish during the day, or the night distributions in deeper waters. Sprat and krill are fairly tolerable to low oxygen concentrations and did not seem to affect their distribution in this study, where oxygen levels never got below 1 ml O 2 l- 1. However, it has been proposed that sprat use the inner Oslofjord as a refuge for their gadoid predators during winter. In the case of this study, oxygen levels appeared to be just at the limit for gadoids to be able to exploit sprat in deep water. This could add to the antipredatory benefit of darkness at depth. Gut content of krill was higher during the night, yet both ambient chl a and gut pigment levels were low. Feeding on algae by krill increased in the upper layers at night, while krill appeared to forage on copepods both day and night and throughout the water column. Feeding on phytoplankton and copepods makes krill less transparent and more vulnerable to visual predators, suggesting an advantage of feeding in the dark. Sprat foraged on copepods in the upper water layers during the night and in mid-water during the day. Sprat is a visual feeder, itself having visual predators, and this might be the reason why sprat migrates to the upper layers at night to feed and in the middle layer during the day where light intensity may be sufficient to detect its prey while at the same time being sufficiently low to give shelter towards own predators. There appears to be a trade-off between food intake and predation risks for both krill and sprat. Smaller sized sprat did feed significantly more than larger sprat. Smaller sprat migrated to the surface waters at night, while larger appeared to stay in deeper 3 waters, suggesting that small sprat need more energy to survive and maybe take higher risks to reach maturity faster and hence prioritized feeding during winter. Krill and sprat feeding was related to prey abundance, and possibly also prey size and movements, which will affect both detectability and prey avoidance reactions...|$|E

The main {{purpose was to}} develop a high-resolution EPSI technique for clinical MR scanner, to visualise the bulk magnetic susceptibility (BMS) shifts of extra-myocellular lipid (EMCL) spectral lines, and to investigate the feasibility of this method for the assessment of intra-myocellular (IMCL) lipids. METHODS: The study group consisted of six healthy volunteers. A two dimensional EPSI sequence with point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) spatial localization was implemented on a 3 T clinical MR scanner. Measurements were performed by means of 64 Ã— 64 spatial matrix and nominal voxel size 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 15 mm(3). The total <b>net</b> <b>measurement</b> time was 3 min 12 sec for non-water-suppressed (1 acquisition) and 12 min 48 sec for water-suppressed scans (4 acquisitions). RESULTS: Spectra of the human calf had a very good signal-to-noise ratio and linewidths sufficient to differentiate IMCL resonances from EMCL. The use of a large spatial matrix reduces inter-voxel signal contamination of the strong EMCL signals. Small voxels enabled visualisation of the methylene EMCL spectral line splitting and their BMS shifts up to 0. 5 ppm relative to the correspondent IMCL line. The mean soleus muscle IMCL content of our six volunteers was 0. 30 Â± 0. 10 vol% (range 0. 18 - 0. 46) or 3. 6 Â± 1. 2 mmol/kg wet weight (range: 2. 1 - 5. 4).

40|$|Biofouling is {{a serious}} problem in marine {{aquaculture}} and it has a number of negative impacts including increased forces on aquaculture structures and reduced water exchange across nets. This in turn affects the behavior of fish cages in waves and currents and has an impact on the water volume and quality inside net pens. Even though these negative effects are acknowledged by the research community and governmental institutions, there is limited knowledge about fouling related effects on the flow past nets, and more detailed investigations distinguishing between different fouling types have been called for. This study evaluates the effect of hydroids, an important fouling organism in Norwegian aquaculture, on the forces acting on net panels. Drag forces on clean and fouled nets were measured in a flume tank, and net solidity including effect of fouling were determined using image analysis. The relationship between net solidity and drag was assessed, and it was found that a solidity increase due to hydroids caused less additional drag than a similar increase caused by change in clean net parameters. For solidities tested in this study, the difference in drag force increase could be as high as 43 % between fouled and clean nets with same solidity. The relationship between solidity and drag force is well described by exponential functions for clean as well as for fouled nets. A method is proposed to parameterize the effect of fouling in terms of an increase in net solidity. This allows existing numerical methods developed for clean nets to be used to model the effects of biofouling on <b>nets.</b> <b>Measurements</b> with other types of fouling can be added to build a database on effects of the accumulation of different fouling organisms on aquaculture nets...|$|R

It is predicted that pathfinder will thus substantially improve the amount of data that Giotto will gather from its fly-by of Halley's Comet March 14, 1986...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed of the possible error mechanisms which degraded the IR <b>net</b> flux <b>measurements</b> made by the three small atmospheric probes dispatched from the Pioneer Venus spacecraft. The larger errors began below 30 km, and caused the data to be inconsistent with previous estimates of the atmospheric opacity. Evaluations were made of the possible radiation field perturbations behind each probe, cloud particle deposition on the sensor windows, and thermal disturbances within the sensors because of gas flow through the window retainers. The gas flow through the retainers was identified as the most likely error source, and was demonstrated in laboratory tests. A strong Reynolds number dependence was also found. Radiative transfer calculations were performed {{to account for the}} errors, using the constraints defined by the tests. Upper and lower bounds were calculated for the true net flux for both day and night conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Minor styling {{revisions}} {{included a}} new cross-hatch grille {{up front and}} triple cluster taillights in back. Inside, the burled-elm trim {{was replaced by a}} new teakwood design and upholstery trim patterns for vinyl and cloth selections were revised for both bucket and bench seat offerings. Engine offerings remained the same as before with the major change being the change in power measurements from the previous gross method on a dynamometer to the new net ratings as installed in a vehicle with accessories and emission equipment which made the horsepower ratings of 1972 models much lower [...] "on paper" [...] than their 1971 counterparts though actual performance did not change much between the two years. Under the <b>net</b> horsepower <b>measurement</b> system, the standard 400 cid L V8 with four-barrel carburetor was rated at [...] while the optional 455 cid L with four-barrel carb was rated at [...]|$|R
