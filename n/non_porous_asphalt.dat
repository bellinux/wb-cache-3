40|$|<b>Porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{pavements}} {{offer an}} alternative technology for stormwater management. A <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement differs from traditional asphalt pavement designs in that the structure permits fluids to pass freely through it, reducing or controlling the amount of run-off from the surrounding area. By allowing precipitation and run-off to flow through the structure, this pavement type functions as an additional stormwater management technique. The overall benefits of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavements may include both environmental and safety benefits including improved stormwater management, improved skid resistance, reduction of spray to drivers and pedestrians, {{as well as a}} potential for noise reduction. With increasing environmental awareness and an evolving paradigm shift in stormwater management techniques, this research aims to provide guidance for Canadian engineers, contractors, and government agencies on the design of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement structures. One of the keys to the success of this pavement type is {{in the design of the}} asphalt mix. The air void percentage, which is ultimately related to the effectiveness of the pavement to adequately control the runoff, is a critical component of the mix. However, special consideration is required in order to obtain higher air void percentages while maintaining strength and durability within a cold climate. The objectives of this study were to evaluate several laboratory <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> mix designs for durability and strength in cold climate conditions.

40|$|<b>Porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> shows {{excellent}} {{performance in}} both noise reduction and water drainage. Although <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> has these great qualities, its service life is much shorter (sometimes only half) compared to dense graded asphalt roads. Ravelling, {{which is the}} loss of aggregate particles from the surface layer, is the main damage mechanism of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> surface wearing courses. In this research, an induction healing approach (namely, activating the healing process of asphalt concrete through induction heating) was developed to enhance the durability of the <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> roads. Steel fibers are added to a <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture to make it electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating. When micro cracks are expected to occur in the asphalt mastic of the pavement, the temperature of the mastic can be increased locally by induction heating of the steel fibers so that <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete can repair itself and close the cracks through the high temperature healing of the bitumen (diffusion and flow). The closure of micro cracks will prevent the formation of macro cracks. In such a way, ravelling can be avoided or delayed in the end. To make <b>asphalt</b> mastic and <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating, steel (wool) fibers were incorporated into them. The electrical conductivity and induction heating speed of <b>asphalt</b> mastic and <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete were first studied in this research. <b>Asphalt</b> mastic and <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel fibers can be heated with induction energy. There is an optimal volume content of steel fiber in <b>asphalt</b> mastic or <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete to obtain the highest induction heating speed. Adding more steel fiber above this optimal volume content does not increase the induction heating speed anymore. Furthermore, the highest induction heating speed corresponds to the minimum electrical resistivity. However, <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete {{does not need to be}} fully conductive for induction heating. Every single steel wool is a heating unit. Nonconductive samples with steel fiber can still be heated with induction heating, but at a low heating speed. The diameter, length and content of steel wool fiber are important for the conductivity and heating speed of asphalt concrete matrix. It is proven that induction heating does not cause extra ageing to bitumen. Addition of steel wool also reduces the binder drainage problem in <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete. The mechanical properties of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber were studied in this research. Adding moderate percentage steel wool to <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete reinforce it by increasing its particle loss resistance, indirect tensile strength and fracture energy, water damage resistance, stiffness and fatigue resistance. The steel wool was optimized to obtain the best particle loss resistance in <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete. 8 % steel wool type 00 (volume fraction of bitumen) was considered as the optimal content. The healing potential of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber was also evaluated in this research with both cylinder and beam samples. Damaged <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber can greatly restore its stiffness, strength and fatigue life with induction heating, which proves that the healing capacity of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber is enhanced by induction heating. The optimal induction heating temperature is 85 ºC for <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete to obtain the best healing rate. Reheating does not decrease the healing rate of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete, which means that heating can be repeated when cracks appear again. To apply the induction healing technology in real <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> road, a trial section was constructed on Dutch motorway A 58 in December 2010. This trial section survived the past two winters perfectly. Experiments were done on the cores drilled from the trial section and the results coincided with those on the laboratory made samples. The field cores showed good particle loss resistance, high strength, good fatigue resistance and high induction healing capacity. Based on the laboratory experiments and field experiences, induction healing can be a very good approach to enhance the durability of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement. Finally, some recommendations are given for further research. Steel fiber, mixing technology and induction generator need to be optimized. Modeling work is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms involved in induction healing. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Furthermore, a new multidirectional permeameter was designed which can control the rainfall intensity and adjust transverse slope to simulate the actual water flow process in pavement.

Increasing the air void content and the nominal maximum aggregate size of the mixtures can reduce the directional difference of the permeability.

Due to its open structure water is stored and moved horizontally within the layer which reduces splash and spray effects and thus increases the visibility of drivers during rainfall. On the other hand the major disadvantage of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> layers is durability. The decisive factor for the relative short lifetime of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> is the loss of aggregates from the surface, also known as ravelling. This type of distress leads to a rough surface and decreases the material’s noise reduction potential. Further on the loosened particles cause damage to cars. In the winter ravelling develops at a much higher speed. This results in totally damaged sections as was noticed during the winter of 2009 / 2010 in the Netherlands. In this research a recently developed Lifetime Optimization Tool for <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> was used to find out why different sections of the primary road network showed this type of excessive damage. Therefore LOT required information about the load, geometry and the response of these failed <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> sections. In this research eight different sections were studied. The required input for LOT was determined directly from these eight sections. The results showed that in the winter the main cause for this increase in damage is caused by the reduced relaxation potential of the mortar of the mixture. Further on the calculated performance of the eight different sections was compared with the observed performance during the winter of 2009 / 2010 and it was shown that they were in good agreement with each other. From this it was concluded that the Lifetime Optimization Tool is capable of explaining winter damage of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concreteRoad and Railroad EngineeringStructural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Permeable <b>asphalt</b> pavement or <b>porous</b> friction course is commonly knows as <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt.</b> The <b>porous</b> pavement used in Japanes and europe. The pavement consists in a porous overlay allowing rainwater to flow down to the botton the overlay and then to drain on the edges of the pavement. Quality of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> was developed to drain pavement surface flow through itâs pores, because of is specific propertis to mesure itâs ability to drain the water (Permeability), a special measuring device is required. This study is aimed to measure the coefficient of permebility using the constanthead permeability test at transportation laboratory Hasanuddin University. The result were compared with the previous study. The test included horizontal and vertical permeability. There types of gradation were in comporated to : British Graduation, Binamarga Gradation, and Australian Gradation. The tests were carried out at optimum bitumen content, the result shows that the vertical permeability of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> usig British Gradation were : 0, 0914, 0, 2841 and 0, 2912 Cm/sec. Respectively meanwhile for horizontal permeability were 0, 1168, 03212, 0, 2897 Cm/Sec. The Marshall stabilities were at in countary to the permeabilities, the porousity were comparable to the permeabilities.

The uniqueness of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> surface textures and internal structures allows the mixture to become a temporary storm-water retention and capable to channel excessive storm water. However, one of the major problems that affect the performance of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixtures is the clogging. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of clogging towards the permeability of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt.</b> A total of 30 gyratory compacted samples were fabricated according to aggregate gradation recommended by Malaysia Public Works Department. The clogging materials were collected from two different location, residential area and major highway. The composition and characteristics of the clogging materials were investigated using Plastic Limit, Liquid Limit and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The permeability test was conducted to investigate the permeability rate of the compacted samples based on different clogging material types, clogging concentrations and clogging cycles. In addition, the compacted samples were scanned using X-ray Computed Tomography to obtain the air voids distribution throughout the samples for comparison. It was found that higher concentration of clogging materials and clogging cycles reduced the rate of permeability. Clogging material collected from residential area has higher tendency to clog the void spaces compared to the one obtained from highway...|$|R
