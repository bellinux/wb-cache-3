25|$|According to many historians, most of Jesus' teachings were intelligible and {{acceptable}} {{in terms of}} Second Temple Judaism; what set Christians apart from Jews was their faith in Christ as the resurrected messiah. The belief in a resurrected Messiah is unacceptable to Jews today and to Rabbinic Judaism, and Jewish authorities have long used this fact to explain the break between Judaism and Christianity. Recent work by historians paints a more complex portrait of late Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Some historians have suggested that, before his death, Jesus forged among his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and {{the resurrection of the}} dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24-29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they had <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been resurrected, and that the restoration of the Kingdom and resurrection of the dead was at hand. These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism. In the following years the restoration of the Kingdom as Jews expected it failed to occur. Some Christians believed instead that Christ, rather than being the Jewish messiah, was God made flesh, who died for the sins of humanity, and that faith in Jesus Christ offered everlasting life (see Christology).|$|E

His opponents had <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would become a Test player.

500|$|Pickett {{today is}} widely {{perceived}} as being a tragic hero of sorts—a flamboyant officer who wanted to lead his troops into a glorious battle, but always missed the opportunity until the disastrous charge at Gettysburg. Historian John C. Waugh wrote of Pickett, [...] "An excellent brigade commander, he never proved he could handle a division." [...] He quotes George B. McClellan, the Union general, as saying: [...] "Perhaps there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the best infantry soldier developed on either side during the Civil War." ...|$|E

500|$|The German {{newspapers}} {{were among the}} many from across Europe that attacked Schumacher. Bild said [...] "Schumacher was {{to blame for the}} crash". [...] "He played for high stakes and lost everything – the World Championship and his reputation for fair play. There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to take out Villeneuve." [...] The Frankfurter Allgemeine called him [...] "a kamikaze without honour" [...] and commented that the [...] "monument is starting to crack because the foundations are faulty". A German TV station asked fans for their views and received the views of 63,081 votes. 28% said they could not support Schumacher any longer.|$|E
500|$|Polymath German intellect Johann Goethe (1749–1832) had {{interests}} and influence that extended into botany. In [...] (1790) he provided {{a theory of}} plant morphology (he coined the word [...] "morphology") and he included within his concept of [...] "metamorphosis" [...] modification during evolution, thus linking comparative morphology with phylogeny. Though the botanical basis of his work has been challenged there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> prompted discussion and research on the origin and function of floral parts. His theory probably stimulated the opposing views of German botanists Alexander Braun (1805–1877) and Matthias Schleiden who applied the experimental method {{to the principles of}} growth and form that were later extended by Augustin de Candolle (1778–1841).|$|E
500|$|Haley's {{warning to}} avoid [...] "telegraphing to readers" [...] and his advice about [...] "building {{suspense}} and drama" [...] demonstrate {{his efforts to}} influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to MalcolmX. In the above passage Haley asserts his authorial presence, reminding his subject that {{as a writer he}} has concerns about narrative direction and focus, but presenting himself {{in such a way as}} to give <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> deferred final approval to his subject. In the words of Eakin, [...] "Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the Autobiography, Alex Haley and MalcolmX were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old." [...] MalcolmX, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{have noted}} Andersen was {{attracted}} to {{both men and women}} during his middle years. Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager observes, [...] "Andersen's diaries leave <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was attracted to}} both sexes; that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men." [...] Andersen biographer Alison Prince comments, [...] "It is obvious that Andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others. This was partly due to the suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in the safer and more conventional image of the talented and hypersensitive poet..." [...] Both believe [...] "The Snowman" [...] has its source and inspiration in Andersen's relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Gilligan played for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval. In the first innings, he was struck heavily over his heart by a delivery from Frederick Pearson; {{it was obvious that}} he was hurt, and he was out shortly afterwards. Although the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval was less prestigious than its Lord's counterpart and generally mattered less to participants, Gilligan chose to bat the next day and scored a century batting at number 10. Even so, the Gentlemen lost the game by six wickets. Gilligan was never again as effective a cricketer, and he later conceded that batting in the second innings was a mistake. It is likely that the strain of the innings did as much harm as the original blow, although Gibson later wrote that Gilligan's subsequent long life suggests that he was not too badly hurt, and that it is unlikely too much damage was done. Nevertheless, Gibson concludes [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was badly shaken up, and whatever the reason, the magic departed".|$|E
500|$|Conversion to Christianity enabled Disraeli to {{contemplate}} {{a career in}} politics. Britain in the early-nineteenth century was not a greatly anti-Semitic society, {{and there had been}} Members of Parliament (MPs) from Jewish families since Samson Gideon in 1770. But until 1858, MPs were required to take the oath of allegiance [...] "on the true faith of a Christian", necessitating at least nominal conversion. It is not known whether Disraeli formed any ambition for a parliamentary career {{at the time of his}} baptism, but there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> bitterly regretted his parents' decision not to send him to Winchester College. As one of the great public schools of England, Winchester consistently provided recruits to the political elite. His two younger brothers were sent there, and it is not clear why Isaac D'Israeli chose to send his eldest son to a much less prestigious school. The boy evidently held his mother responsible for the decision; Bradford speculates that [...] "Benjamin's delicate health and his obviously Jewish appearance may have had something to do with it." [...] The school chosen for him was run by Eliezer Cogan at Higham Hill in Walthamstow. He began there in the autumn term of 1817; he later recalled his education: ...|$|E

500|$|Phips sailed {{from the}} Downs on 12 September 1686, and on 28 November arrived in Hispaniola, Samana Bay, where they {{spent two weeks}} {{restocking}} their water and provender. The weather was bad, and the search consequently did not get under way {{for a few more}} weeks. January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). There was a bit more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew exactly where he was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not know the name of the ship) wrecked in 1641. Over the next two days, the divers were able to bring up 3,000 coins and 3 silver bars. They decided to travel back to Phips' to let him know but {{this turned out to be}} a somewhat slow and treacherous trip among the reefs.|$|E
500|$|To this day, Reagan's {{role in the}} {{transactions}} is not definitively known; it is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages. Oliver North wrote that [...] "Ronald Reagan knew of and approved {{a great deal of}} what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both...I have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it. Enthusiastically." [...] Handwritten notes by Defense Secretary Weinberger indicate that the President was aware of potential hostages transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to what he was told were [...] "moderate elements" [...] within Iran. Notes taken on December 7, 1985, by Weinberger record that Reagan said that [...] "he could answer charges of illegality but he couldn't answer charge [...] that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free hostages'". The Republican-written [...] "Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair" [...] concluded, that There is some question and dispute about precisely the level at which he chose to follow the operation details. There is no doubt, however, ... the President set the US policy towards Nicaragua, with few if any ambiguities, and then left subordinates more or less free to implement it.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{appeared}} {{to the justice}} to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence {{and there was no}} evidence of provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened [...] "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he [...] "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb [...] "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.|$|E
