40|$|While {{charter schools}} differ widely in {{philosophy}} and pedagogical views, the United States’s most famous urban charter schools typically use the <b>No</b> <b>Excuses</b> approach. Enrolling mainly poor and minority students, these schools feature high academic standards, strict disciplinary codes, extended instructional time, and targeted supports for low-performing students. The strenuous and regimented style is controversial amongst some scholars, but others {{contend that the}} <b>No</b> <b>Excuses</b> approach is needed to rapidly close the achievement gap. We conduct the first meta-analysis of the achievement impacts of <b>No</b> <b>Excuses</b> charter schools. Focusing on experimental studies, we find that <b>No</b> <b>Excuses</b> charter schools significantly improve math scores and reading scores. We estimate gains of 0. 25 and 0. 16 standard deviations on math and literacy achievement, respectively, as the effect of attending a <b>No</b> <b>Excuses</b> charter school for one year. Though the effect is large and meaningful, we offer some caveats to this finding and discuss policy implications for the United States {{as well as other}} countries...|$|R

Noriko declines, explaining that she doesn't wish to marry anyone, because to do so would leave her father alone and helpless. Masa surprises Noriko by claiming that she is also trying to arrange a match between Shukichi and Mrs. Miwa (Kuniko Miyake), an attractive young widow known to Noriko. If Masa succeeds, Noriko would have <b>no</b> <b>excuse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Australia {{had held}} the Ashes since 1958–59 and Cowdrey was keen to return them to England, but he was {{frustrated}} by the damp summer. There was <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> for the First Test at Old Trafford where Australia made 357 and England fell from 86/0 to 165 all out to the part-time off-spin of Bob Cowper (4/48) and lost by 159 runs, though Basil D'Oliveira made 87 not out in the second innings. The Second Test was the 200th {{between the two countries}} and Colin Milburn hammered 83 and Cowdrey 45 in England's 351/7 while Australia were hustled out for 78 after a freak hail storm whitened the ground. 15 hours were lost to the weather and after following on Australia salvaged a draw with 127/4.|$|E

25|$|The band {{continued}} {{to take a}} more commercial direction. Innocence Is <b>No</b> <b>Excuse</b> released in 1985, created a division amongst fans as the band's once raw, heavy sound had been watered down to gain more attraction to the large US market. The album has, however, gained more appreciation both from fans and critics as time has passed since its initial release. A huge sold out world tour in support of the album followed, but tensions began to appear within the band and by early 1986, bassist Steve Dawson was fired from the band, and Saxon was forced to record their eighth studio album Rock the Nations without a replacement bassist. With Elton John making guest appearances as pianist on 2 tracks, and Byford recording the bass parts, the album charted higher than its predecessor and was considered a success. They hired bassist Paul Johnson to play for the band's European arena tour that followed.|$|E
25|$|Hamilcar Barca {{was blamed}} by the Carthaginian Leaders for causing the Mercenary War by making {{unrealistic}} promises to his soldiers, especially the Celts, during his command in Sicily. This event {{may have taken}} place as early as 241 BC or more likely in 237 BC. The influence Hamilcar enjoyed among {{the people and the}} opposition party enabled him to avoid standing trial. Furthermore, Hamilcar allied with Hasdrubal the Fair, his future son in law, to restrict the power of the aristocracy, which was led by Hanno the Great, as well as gain immunity from prosecution. Hamilcar's faction gained enough clout, if not supreme power in Carthage, for Hamilcar to implement his next agenda. Hamilcar's first priority, probably, was to ensure that the war indemnity was paid regularly so the Romans had <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> to interfere in Carthaginian affairs. His second was to implement his strategy for preparing Carthage for any future conflict with Rome, or enable Carthage to defend itself against any aggression.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{reaction}} to Mr Bigley's murder is {{fed by the}} fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune—its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union—and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.|$|E

500|$|Once Fillmore {{was back}} home in Buffalo, he had <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> to make speeches, and his {{campaign}} stagnated through {{the summer and fall}} of 1856. Political fixers who had been Whigs, such as Weed, tended to join the Republican Party, and the Know Nothings lacked experience at selling anything but nativism. [...] Accordingly, Fillmore's pro-Union stance mostly went unheard. [...] Although the South was friendly towards Fillmore, many there feared a Frémont victory would lead to secession, and some sympathetic to Fillmore moved into the Buchanan camp lest the anti-Frémont vote be split, which might elect the Republican. Scarry suggested that the events of 1856, including the conflict in Kansas Territory and the caning of Charles Sumner {{on the floor of the}} Senate polarized the nation, making Fillmore's moderate stance obsolete.|$|E
