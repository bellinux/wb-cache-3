50|$|<b>N-Acetylanthranilic</b> <b>acid</b> can be {{synthesized}} from 2-bromoacetanilide via palladium-catalyzed carbonylation in tri-n-butylamine-water at 110-130 Â°C, under 3 atm {{of carbon}} monoxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>N-Acetylanthranilic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the molecular formula C9H9NO3. It is an intermediate product in catabolism of quinaldine in Arthrobacter sp., and is further metabolized to anthranilic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>N-Acetylanthranilic</b> <b>acid</b> {{exhibits}} triboluminescence when crushed. The fractured crystals {{have large}} electrical potentials between areas {{of high and}} low charge. When the electrons suddenly migrate to neutralize these potentials, flashes of deep blue light are created.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} 4 -(un) {{substituted}} phenylcarbamoyl methyl ester-containing compounds 3 a-d, 5 a-d and 7 a-d were synthesized via reaction in N,N-dimethylformamide of (un) substituted chloroacetanilides 2 a-d with the potassium salts of ibuprofen (1), naproxen (4) and <b>N-acetylanthranilic</b> <b>acid</b> (6). Moreover, other 4 -(un) substituted phenylcarbamoylmethyl ester-containing compounds 10 a-d were synthesized via the attack of (un) substituted chloroacetanilides 2 a-d {{on one of}} the carboxylic acid groups of the potassium salt of 4 -(2 -carboxyethylcarboxamido) benzoic acid (8) in N,N-dimethylformamide, with subsequent cyclization of the other one giving finally a pyrrolidinone structure. Anti-inflammatory properties of the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vivo utilizing a standard acute carrageenan-induced paw oedema method in rats and the most promising prepared anti-inflammatory active agents were evaluated for ulcerogenic liability in rats using ibuprofen and naproxen as reference standards in both screenings. PGE 2 inhibitory properties of the highly promising anti-inflammatory agents synthesized and low gastric ulcerogenic liabilities were tested with a PGE 2 assay kit technique...|$|E
