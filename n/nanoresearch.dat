40|$|Abstract There is {{currently}} a strong focus on responsible research {{in relation to the}} development of nanoscience and nanotechnology. This study presents a series of conversations with nanoresearchers, with the ‘European Commission recommendation on a code of conduct for responsible nanosciences and nanotechnologies research ’ (EC-CoC) as its point of departure. Six types of reactions to the document are developed, illustrating the diversity existing within the scientific community in responses towards this kind of new approaches to governance. Three broad notions of responsible <b>nanoresearch</b> are presented. The article concludes by arguing that while the suggestion put forward in the EC-CoC brings the concept of responsible <b>nanoresearch</b> a long way, one crucial element is to be wanted, namely responsible <b>nanoresearch</b> as increased awareness of moral choices...|$|E

40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} the development of nanosciences and nanotechnologies (nanoST), a field that has gained tremendous political and economic momentum {{in the first decade}} of the 21 st century. It is also a field that has provided a frame for timely discussions and explorations of governance of emerging technology, in light of its potential to change social and environmental structures both for better and worse. The aim of this dissertation has been to understand better if, and in what way, new approaches to the governance of science could lead to ‘responsible development’ of nanoST, as commonly claimed. Through four empirical studies the research has searched for responsible practices in a) the research-field of Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects (ELSA) of nanoST, b) participatory exercises, c) uninvited public debate, and d) a code of conduct for <b>nanoresearch.</b> While the extent to which such new approaches to governance are succeeding individually has been a topic of much debate, one of the contributions of this dissertation is that it has studied four different practices as part of the same research project. The first paper is based upon a text study of ELSA literature, where 244 texts were systematised according to four key categories; Governance, Science, Perception and Philosophy. Most of the texts clearly raised questions from more than one category, and led to the conclusion that cross-category literature provided a potential for nanoELSA to develop into a more creative and integrated field. In the second paper, I studied the representations of nanoST in Norwegian newspapers, to get a sense of the perspectives available for those not particularly seeking out information about new technologies. The main conclusion of this study was that the dominating representations fail to constitute nanoST as a matter of concern, and that more voices and viewpoints about nanoST are desired in the public sphere. The third paper makes and analyses the claim that tensions stemming from unresolved theoretical conflict manifest as problems for the emerging practice of participatory approaches. It argues that for public engagement to prove successful, basic questions related to why, when, who, where and how should be openly confronted, as choices in relation to each one of these questions have consequences for the available choices in the others. In the fourth paper the European Commission ‘recommendation on a code of conduct for responsible nanosciences and nanotechnologies research’ is used as a frame for a series of conversations with nanoresearchers about the notion of responsible <b>nanoresearch.</b> Three different interpretations of the notion of responsible <b>nanoresearch</b> are suggested and discussed. The paper conclude that sensitivity towards own values and moral choices is as important as dialogue and communication for nanoST research to be truly responsible. In studying these different approaches, two overall conclusions are drawn. The first is that new approaches to governance have indeed provided an important step in the right direction towards a more ‘responsible development’. The level of reflexivity and willingness to debate the notion of responsibility across the sectors of <b>nanoresearch</b> in itself constitutes a more responsible practice. Responsible development of nanoST can never mean a guarantee of ‘good’ nanoST for all. Rather, it involves acknowledging precisely how this is unachievable. The broad focus and debate about the governance of nanoST has initiated processes where this is beginning to be more widely recognized. Secondly, mindfulness – in the sense of ongoing questioning of given ‘instructions’ and actions against personal values – is identified as a rather neglected aspect in the effort towards a responsible development of nanoST. As a supplement to deliberation and dialogue between roles, individuals who can challenge their roles themselves – the instructions and institutions –are necessary when faced with a scientific and technological development that may change more rapidly than the instructions and institutions can adapt...|$|E
40|$|Focused electron-beam-induced {{deposition}} (EBID) {{allows the}} rapid fabrication of three-dimensional nanodevices and metallic wiring of nanostructures, {{and is a}} promising technique for many applications in <b>nanoresearch.</b> The authors present two topics on platinum-containing nanostructures created by EBID. First, they report on a TEM study of the microstructure of nanodeposits created from Pt(PF 3) 4. They have performed imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The deposited material, composed mainly of platinum, phosphor, oxygen, and trace amounts of fluorine, is amorphous. Platinum is evenly distributed in the nanostructure, while phosphorus is observed to cluster. The size and amount of phosphorus clusters depend on {{the thickness of the}} structure. Second, they document an aging process in structures created from MeCpPtMe 3, which have a resistivity which increases with the time they are exposed to air, from 2 × 105 to 1. 8 × 108 ????cm over 55 ?days. They demonstrate that covering the structures with an EBID-deposited insulating protective layer of TEOS can prevent this oxidation. In doing so, they achieved the lowest reported resistivity for EBID from this platinum precursor, of 1. 5 × 103 ????cm. IST/Imaging Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E
40|$|Short single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) functionalized by PEGylated phospholipids are biologically non-toxic and long-circulating nanomaterials with intrinsic {{near infrared}} photoluminescence (NIR PL), characteristic Raman spectra, and strong optical absorbance {{in the near}} infrared (NIR). This work demonstrates the first dual application of intravenously injected SWNTs as photoluminescent agents for in vivo tumor imaging in the 1. 0 - 1. 4 μm emission region and as NIR absorbers and heaters at 808 nm for photothermal tumor elimination at the lowest injected dose (70 μg of SWNT/mouse, equivalent to 3. 6 mg/kg) and laser irradiation power (0. 6 W/cm 2) reported to date. Ex vivo resonance Raman imaging revealed the SWNT distribution within tumors at a high spatial resolution. Complete tumor elimination was achieved for large numbers of photothermally treated mice without any toxic side effects after {{more than six months}} post-treatment. Further, side-by-side experiments were carried out to compare the performance of SWNTs and gold nanorods (AuNRs) at an injected dose of 700 μg of AuNR/mouse (equivalent to 35 mg/kg) in NIR photothermal ablation of tumors in vivo. Highly effective tumor elimination with SWNTs was achieved at 10 times lower injected doses and lower irradiation powers than for AuNRs. These results suggest there are significant benefits of utilizing the intrinsic properties of biocompatible SWNTs for combined cancer imaging and therapy. Comment: <b>Nanoresearch,</b> in pres...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of whether or not geographical, cognitive, and collaborative proximity have an impact on citation probability in the scientific writings of Canadian nanotechnology. Even though a number of studies in the proximity literature deal with the effects of spatial distance, scientific specialization, and social network structure, to our knowledge no one has combined all three to explore the production of academic information. We generate a feature framework based on measurements from these factors, relying on statistical and classification approaches to assess their influence on effective citations. Specifically, by means of applying binary regression models along with tree-based machine learning algorithms, we found statistical significance proving that these features have both a verifiable impact and predictive potential. Importantly, our work is the first one that we have seen combining these techniques to infer the establishment of positive citation links. Moreover, we employed inductive network analysis comprehensively to examine the co-authorship links between authors publishing in nanoscience, considering additional network metrics to the ones usually adopted in the literature. Our findings reveal that cognitive proximity, closely followed by the collaborative aspect, are the most important elements inducing Canadian scholars to cite, with geography sometimes acting as their base. Our results enable us to reach better understanding related to the citation behavior of the <b>nanoresearch</b> community in Canada, making our work a valuable contribution to scholarly literature, also giving us ground to make policy recommendations...|$|E
