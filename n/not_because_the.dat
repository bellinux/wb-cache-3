5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was <b>not,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E

25|$|Ranks are {{assigned}} based on subjective dissimilarity, {{and do not}} fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species {{not because they are}} more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.|$|E
25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Mac Mini G4, the Intel-based Mac Mini uses a dual-channel {{architecture}} for memory.

25|$|The Book of Joshua takes forward Deuteronomy's {{theme of}} Israel {{as a single}} people worshipping Yahweh in the land God has given them. Yahweh, as the main {{character}} in the book, takes the initiative in conquering the land, and Yahweh's power wins the battles. For example, the walls of Jericho fall because Yahweh fights for Israel, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Israelites show superior fighting ability. The potential disunity of Israel is a constant theme, the greatest threat of disunity coming from the tribes east of the Jordan. Chapter 22:19 even hints that the land across the Jordan is unclean and that the tribes who live there have secondary status.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Jencks {{concludes that}} as a group African Americans have been harmed by the {{introduction}} of standardized entrance exams such as the SAT. This, according to him, is <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> tests themselves are flawed, but because of labeling bias and selection bias; the tests measure the skills that African Americans are less likely to develop in their socialization, rather than the skills {{they are more likely to}} develop. Furthermore, standardized entrance exams are often labeled as tests of general ability, rather than of certain aspects of ability. Thus, a situation is produced in which African American ability is consistently underestimated within the education and workplace environments, contributing in turn to selection bias against them which exacerbates underachievement.|$|E

25|$|Antagonistic {{pleiotropy}} is a prevailing theory today, {{but this}} is largely by default, and <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> theory has been well verified. In fact, experimental biologists have looked for the genes that cause ageing, and since about 1990 the technology has been available to find them efficiently. Of the many ageing genes that have been reported, some seem to enhance fertility early in life, or to carry other benefits. But there are other ageing genes for which no such corresponding benefit has been identified. This is not what Williams predicted. This may {{be thought of as}} partial validation of the theory, but logically it cuts to the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.|$|E
25|$|Paralleling nueva canción in Latin America is the Cuban Nueva trova, {{which dates}} from about 1967/68, after the Cuban Revolution. It {{differed}} from the traditional trova, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> musicians were younger, but because the content was, in the widest sense, political. Nueva trova is defined by its connection with Castro's revolution, and by its lyrics, which attempt to escape the banalities of life by concentrating on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar issues. Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of this style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time old trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.|$|E
