Stardust would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time since}} their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and smooth out the problems they were having. Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The <b>New</b> <b>Day,</b> Stardust hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached Stardust backstage, Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, and now his own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood.
