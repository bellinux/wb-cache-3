40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{a collection}} of five short stories and a critical essay. Each of the stories focuses on an aspect of inheritance, and various narrative strategies are employed, including fragmented construction, parallel stories and borrowed discourse. In 2 ̆ 7 Cradle of Shadows 2 ̆ 7 the first-person narrative {{of a young woman}} about to have an abortion is interwoven with the text of a 1917 report of the acquittal of her great-grandmother on a charge of infanticide. The resulting narrative is a study in ambiguity: the uncertainties of 2 ̆ 7 right 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 wrong 2 ̆ 7, the weight of the past and how it resonates in the present, the impulse to judge and the impotent desire to make reparation. The anchor of 2 ̆ 7 Renovation 2 ̆ 7 is a house in an old Perth suburb-a bearer of social and personal history. A series of vignettes about occupants at different periods during the twentieth century punctuate the musings of a prospective new buyer for the house, who can only speculate on the meaning of what she sees in the physical features of the building and its surrounds. 2 ̆ 7 Synapses 2 ̆ 7 is a story of an absent mother. It focuses on genetic inheritance and the impact of gaps in the narrative of self that we create through a combination of memory and knowledge. This is contrasted with the identity others often seek to construct through, for example, medical history. 2 ̆ 7 Sarah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ark</b> 2 ̆ 7 explores, in an irreverent way, the accumulation of material possessions that may eventually form an idiosyncratic legacy. It uses the biblical story 2 ̆ 7 Noah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ark</b> 2 ̆ 7 as an allusive framework, and swings between the events of a surreal present and those in the past that have brought the characters to their precarious situation. In 2 ̆ 7 Live Forever 2 ̆ 7 a terminally ill woman contemplates notions of immortality, generativity and remembrance. The artworks of colonial wildflower painter Margaret Forrest provide a way of exploring the links between art and illness, loss and value, what a community remembers and why. The focus of the critical essay is on the use, in fiction, of material from other sources and the notion of what constitutes an 2 ̆ 7 ethical discourse 2 ̆ 7. The essay makes reference to the stories in the collection-principally 2 ̆ 7 Cradle of Shadows 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Sarah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ark</b> 2 ̆ 7 -to canvass legal issues such as copyright and defamation; the slippery concept of 2 ̆ 7 universal morality 2 ̆ 7; aspects of postmodern writing such as hybridity, decentring and borrowed discourse; {{and the nature of the}} writing process...|$|R

No previously existing method appears to make this assessment easily available. This thesis predicts that architecture will fail in some combination of eleven predictable ways that a simple robot can observe and distinguish by measuring the slope of select points on the floor. This prediction was tested on a case study house, and the model predicted 78. 7 % of the observed contour. A compact robot was fabricated and measurements of inclination were compared with those of a standard digital inclinometer. The ratio of the angle measured with the robot to that measured with the inclinometer was found to be 1. 034 ± 0. 193.

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in search technology, few software {{systems have been}} developed which accurately categorize multimedia files. The most successful systems for searching images, sounds, or movies rely on keyword annotation to provide meaningful search terms for non-text documents. Unfortunately, such systems usually require the author to enter the keywords manually, a task that is commonly neglected, or is executed poorly. This thesis proposes an approach to document categorization called Interaction Harvesting, wherein systems establish document relationships based on organizational and curatorial cues, harvested from the mouse and click gestures of an online community. Specifically, the spatial and temporal proximity and placement of documents are taken as indicators of document similarity. We propose an expansion technique whereby such proximal documents exert weighted keyword influences on each other. We hypothesize that these approaches will form a document classification framework that relieves some {{of the difficulty of}} the annotation process, while providing keyword-equivalent retrieval performance. by <b>Noah</b> <b>S.</b> Fields.

The rain starts suddenly, hard and fast. After days of downpour, her family lost, Sebah takes shelter in a tree, eating pine cones and the raw meat of animals that float by. With each passing day, her companion, a boy named Aban, grows weaker. When their tree is struck by lightning, Sebah is tempted just to die in the flames rather than succumb to a slow, watery death. Instead, she and Aban build a raft. What they find on the stormy seas is beyond imagining: a gigantic ark. But Sebah does not know what she 2 ̆ 7 ll find on board, and Aban is too weak to leave their raft. Themes of family, loss, and ultimately, survival and love make for a timeless story.

40|$|General {{factors are}} {{outlined}} {{that may influence}} the support {{of members of the}} public for the conservation of different species of reptiles. Survey results are then summarised of the variations in the likeability of different species of reptiles as well as whether or not their survival is supported by those surveyed. The relationship between these two factors is outlined and its consequences for the survival of reptile species compared to birds and mammals is specified, assuming a decision situation like that depicted by the Noah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ark</b> problem. Furthermore, {{the extent to which the}} results support the similarity principle are considered. A substantial dichotomy in the likeability of different reptile species is observed: turtle species tend to be liked much more than species of crocodiles and snakes. This requires some modification to the similarity principle. This disparity is reflected in a dichotomy in public policies for the conservation of reptiles. Evidence in favour of this hypothesis is outlined and the hypothesis is illustrated by Australian policies for the consideration of reptiles. Some attention is also given to the changes in attitudes towards the conservation of reptiles that can occur as a result of knowledge provision and ecotourism...|$|R

However, the rectum tends to be the dose-limiting structure when treating prostate cancer, given its close proximity. Early and late toxicities can occur when the rectum receives large doses of radiation therapy. New technologies allow for prevention of these toxicities. In this review, we examine the evidence that supports various dose constraints employed to prevent these rectal injuries from occurring. We also examine the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and how this compares to older radiation therapy techniques that allow for further sparing of the rectum during a radiation therapy course. We then review the literature on endorectal balloons and the effects of their daily use throughout a radiation therapy course. Tissue spacers are now being investigated in greater detail; these devices are injected into the rectoprostatic fascia to physically increase the distance between the prostate and the anterior rectal wall.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{following}} study is to set forth, {{as far as a}} brief treatment will permit, Ralph Waldo Emerson 2 ̆ 7 s manner of using the Bible in his writing. That he had a wide knowledge of the book is proved by his numerous allusions to its characters and events, its rites and symbols, its philosophy and laws. Moreover, his method of supporting his contentions by Scripture, the pertinence of his many paraphrases of familiar Biblical allusions, and the ease with which he quotes and applies Scriptural passages clearly demonstrate his possession of remarkable Scriptural knowledge. He quoted the Bible as unconsciously as he breathed the air about him. Its philosophy became so embedded in his thought and its phraseology so familiar to him that he talked in Biblical phrases and thought in Scriptural philosophy.

"December 2012 "Increasing petroleum prices have developed a strong demand for an invention to reduce fuel consumption, as well as cut the produced amount of carbon dioxide via consumed fuel. Hybrid vehicles are an effective invention in terms of the hybrid research area because they can accomplish a low fuel consumption rate, thus dropping the carbon dioxide volume that is produced correspondingly. The main goal of this research is to design and model a hydraulic hybrid transmission that has a controlled pressure displacement pump and a controlled displacement motor. The design will show reasonable safety factor numbers in the worst conditions of operation. In addition, modeling was done for the entire drive train including 16 equations that signify the mechanical path and the hydraulic path, which represent the Hydraulic Hybrid Transmission (HHT). HHT consists of a manual gear box that is mounted in series with a split torque device. The output from the power split device delivers power to the two power paths then combines again via a downstream spur gear. A Proportional-Integral control was designed to make the engine work near a wide open throttle line (WOT), which is the most efficient way for an engine to produce power...|$|R
40|$|The secular {{process of}} {{convergence}} in income and product per capita among industrial countries has attracted much well-deserved attention. In Western Europe especially, {{the cradle of}} modern industry, this attention {{has focused on the}} ways in which follower countries have caught up with (or fallen behind) the long-time regional technological leader, Great Britain. In this context, a long tradition considers France as offering the standard alternative to modern British economic institutions and development (Kindleberger 1964). With regard to economic performance, however, it is only recently that claims have been backed by systematic quantitative evidence. Despite sometimes conflicting interpretations, a consensus view has gradually emerged (Crouzet 2003) which concludes that the Anglo-French gap in income and productive capacity slowly closed from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, reconciling ex post calculations with some of the conclusions of enlightened contemporaries and later historians (Bairoch 1982, Crafts 1984). After World War II and the introduction of standardised national accounts, the course of productivity and real income per head in both countries is much better documented and suggests the completion of the secular catching-up process by the 1960 <b>s</b> (Van <b>Ark</b> 1990). However, between the controlled conjectures of the pre-World War I era and the quasi-certainties of post- 1945, the interwar years still remain a grey zone. During the 1920 s, Britain s industry, marred by industrial unrest, mass unemployment and loss of competitiveness, is supposed to have fared especially poorly compared with its competitors, Germany and the US. In a book published in 1931, a French scholar, Andr Siegfried, claimed that Britain was descending along the path of industrial decline (Siegfried 1931). By this time, France had completed its postwar reconstruction, the value of the franc had been stabilised, and the French economy was in full swing: in 1930 French public opinion basked complacently in the belief that the country would be spared the devastating effects of the depression sparked by the Wall Street crash. ...|$|R
40|$|Technologies for {{long-term}} recording of cellular pathway activation are {{constrained by the}} difficultly to constantly monitor transient signaling events and expression of target genes. To overcome these limitations we designed a recording tool that uses the transcriptional output of a signaling pathway as the input for an engineered genome encoded memory. The mechanism of recording leverages the programmable nature of the bacterial immune system that consists of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat Sequences (CRISPR), which can recognize and cleave viral DNA using an RNA-guided directed endonuclease. Cuts left by the endonuclease are repaired by an error-prone DNA damage repair mechanism, namely non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), likely to leave mutations at the cut sites. Defining the cut site with pathway-dependent transcription of guide RNA, this genomic region is sequenced to measure pathway activation {{by the amount of}} accumulated mutations. To demonstrate a system to monitor cancer metabolism, guide RNA is expressed in mammalian cell culture with a NF-kappaB promoter. To demonstrate a system that can monitor sugar intake in an environment like the gut, guide RNA is expressed in bacteria with an arabinose promoter. by <b>Noah</b> Jakimo.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a model to}} quantify the economic costs and environmental impacts of producing fuels from hydroprocessed renewable oils (HRO) process. Aspen Plus was used to model bio-refinery operations and supporting utilities. Material and energy balances for electricity, carbon dioxide, and water requirements {{as well as economic}} costs were obtained from these models. A discounted-cash-flow-rate-of-return (DCFROR) economic model was used to evaluate minimum product values for diesel and jet fuels under various economic conditions. The baseline gate cost for distillate fuel production were found to range between $ 3. 80 and $ 4. 38 per gallon {{depending on the size of}} the facility. The additional cost for maximizing jet fuel production ranged between $ 0. 25 and $ 0. 30 per gallon. While the cost of feedstock is the most significant portion of fuel cost, facility size, financing, and capacity utilization were found to be sensitive parameters of the gate cost. The total water use of the system was found to be 0. 9 pounds of water per pound of vegetable oil processed. Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) for the processing step were found to range between 10. 1 and 13. 0 gCO 2 e per MJ of distillate fuel using an energy allocation method consistent with methods in the literature. Finally, the policy landscape for producing jet and diesel fuels from renewable oils was reviewed from the perspective of a fuel producer. It was found that the potential of HRO fuels penetrating the market is dependent on the availability of feedstocks and access to capital. by Matthew <b>Noah</b> Pearlson.

40|$|Sparse {{aperture}} designs use multiple primary mirrors in alignment {{to increase}} optical resolution, {{as opposed to}} using just one bigger primary mirror. Sparse apertures are defined to have a low amount of active optical area compared to the encircling area of the array. Previous works on sparse aperture systems have studied several configurations based on the gray-world assumption, where the spectral nature of the object, or scene, is assumed independent of its spatial location. In other words, the scene is the same color for every pixel. Robert Introne, Ph. D. (2004) and <b>Noah</b> Block, M. <b>S.</b> (2005) have tested this assumption and showed that in aberrated systems, or in extremely spectrally diverse scenes, the assumption fails. This work utilizes the spectral world model developed by Introne, but includes the Broadband Phase Diversity algorithm for phase retrieval. Phase retrieval mitigates misalignment errors between each of the sub apertures {{of the system that}} are extremely detrimental to the final image quality. Phase diversity uses multiple images of the same scene with the same system, except for one difference. Each image is captured with a different amount of a known additional aberration. Common choices are piston and defocus. This work will utilize defocus diversity. With the introduction of the defocus in the imagery, it is possible to estimate the misalignment errors (and other aberrations) of the optical system using minimization techniques. Knowledge of the misalignment errors aids in the restoration of the image. The gray-world assumption is the cornerstone of Broadband Phase Diversity (BPD). While the validity of the assumption has been examined, the effect of misalignment aberrations and spectrally diverse scenes on BPD performance has not been investigated until now. A trade-space is developed varying the aberration, the noise, and the bandwidths of imaging scenarios. Multiple scene types to simulate different levels of spatial and spectral variability were used to find image-independent trends in BPD performance and image quality. Human visual system based metrics were used to evaluate image quality. The relationship between BPD performance and image quality is examined. Methods of characterizing a hyperspectral image cube were developed in order to describe the spectral character that causes the gray-world assumption to fail. A model comparison was made between the spectral-world and gray-world forward models to evaluate the limits of the gray-world model...|$|R

PMS free full text: [URL] Over {{the past}} decade {{genome-wide}} association studies (GWAS) have been applied {{to aid in the}} understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) < 1. 15). Methods: We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls). Results: We observe a GWS locus at 10 q 24. 32 that overlaps several genes including PITX 3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC 2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0. 23; P = 9 × 10 − 6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP 1 at 3 p 13, ATP 2 B 2 at 3 p 25. 3, and a ‘neurodevelopmental hub’ on chromosome 8 p 11. 23. Conclusions: This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such as EXT 1, ASTN 2, MACROD 2, and HDAC 4.
