5|$|NY83 {{begins a}} more erratic routing, passing between West Mud Lake and Black Pond as {{it enters the}} town of Arkwright. For a short {{distance}} it is concurrent with CR85, and takes on the name Black Corner Street, so named because it is located within the hamlet of Black Corners. Although this portion of NY83 is cosigned with CR85, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. An intersection with CR79 is <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off,</b> as it passes {{just north of the}} town of Arkwright. NY83 proceeds west-northwest until it reaches its ending terminus at NY60 in the community of Laona, located just west of the Arkwright town line in Pomfret.|$|E
5|$|Near the city's western end, a {{historic}} C railroad station, {{as well as}} American Civil War battle sites near historic Lee Hall along U.S. Route 60 and several 19th century plantations have all been protected. Many are located along the roads leading to Yorktown and Williamsburg, where many sites of the Historic Triangle are of both American Revolutionary War and Civil War significance. The first modern duel of ironclad warships, the Battle of Hampton Roads, took place <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> Newport News Point in 1862.. December 2001.

25|$|Huntington Beach sits above a large natural fault {{structure}} containing oil. Although the oil {{is mostly}} depleted, extraction continues at a slow rate, and still provides significant local income. There are only two off-shore extraction facilities left, however, and the day is <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> when oil production in the city will cease and tourism will replace it as the primary revenue source for resident industry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> {{the coast}} of the North Pacific lies a {{spreading}} ridge; a divergent plate boundary made up of a series of breaks in the oceanic crust where new ocean crust is created.

25|$|A better {{solution}} came {{along in the}} form of the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E

25|$|A {{deal between}} TVNZ and Sky to have TVNZ 6 and 7 {{available}} to Sky subscribers {{in exchange for}} Prime finally being launched on Freeview with a virtual channel assignment of 10 on 17 August 2009. If Prime would have joined at launch then {{they may have been}} able to get a lower assignment, however virtual channel assignments are only enforced on certified receivers. It is also noted virtual channel 10 is <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> its usual tuning to push-button 9 on analogue television sets, due to its historic links with the Nine Network, its allocation on Sky's former analogue terrestrial service, and for compatibility with video recorders using the G-Code scheduling system.|$|E
25|$|The highway {{starts at}} a {{junction}} with US9 at Marist College and Saint Francis Hospital in the Dutchess County town of Poughkeepsie. It travels {{parallel to the}} Pulaski Park while heading south for a time. It turns sharply to the east for a time known as Parker Avenue. It passes north of College Hill Park and Morgan Lake prior to gradually turning north. Route9G passes west of the Dutchess Community College, now known as Violet Avenue. Proceeding north, off to the east is the Fallkill County Park. An intersection with County Route40 (CR40) is <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off,</b> while another intersection with CR40A follows. Past CR40A, it runs parallel to the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site while it travels west of the Union Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one should {{remember}} that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off.</b> Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will {{be left in the}} deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.|$|E

25|$|Other {{scenarios}} {{suppose that}} geological changes diverted the Sutlej towards the Indus and the Yamuna towards the Ganges, following which the river {{did not have}} enough water to reach the sea any more and dried up in the Thar desert. Active faults are present in the region, and lateral and vertical tectonic movements have frequently diverted streams in the past. The Saraswati may have migrated westward due to such uplift of the Aravallis. According to geologists Puri and Verma a major seismic activity in the Himalayan region caused the rising of the Bata-Markanda Divide. This resulted in the blockage of the westward flow of Sarasvati forcing the water back. Since the Yamunā Tear opening was <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off,</b> the blocked water exited from the opening into the Yamunā system.|$|E
25|$|She {{missed the}} 2008 Asian Indoor Championship in Doha {{and began the}} outdoor season with another {{national}} record, recording 51.75seconds at the Shizuoka International in May. She was expected to improve further at the Osaka GP, but wet conditions slowed the athletes and she finished third with 52.55seconds. At the national championships, which were also the trials for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she beat hurdles specialist Kubokura to the title and was selected to represent Japan at the Olympics. At the Olympics in August, she recorded 52.60seconds in the qualification rounds, which was not sufficient to progress. She returned to the track with the Japanese relay team. While their time of 3:30.52 was <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> the team's national record, it left them in eighth place at the heats stage.|$|E
25|$|The only Spanish ship in {{the area}} left from the Armada; the 120 ton Bear of Amsterdam had not seen any of her fellow cohorts. Poor {{navigation}} meant that she had missed Milford Haven and landed as far North at Aberdyfi via the Dyfi Estuary on October 26. They landed men ashore but were ambushed by the Merionethshire Militia losing two killed and four captured and retreated back to their ship. The Bear was unable to leave for ten days {{because of a lack}} of wind but at the same time could not be boarded by the militia as there was no suitable boats. An attempt to burn the ship was thwarted by the wind and the Bear of Amsterdam eventually left. She was driven around the Cornish peninsula & swept up the channel by an easterly gale suffering some damage. Hoping to see the Spanish already at Falmouth, the ship was captured <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> from there on November 10 by a waiting English squadron. She was led into Dartmouth with 70 Spaniards taken prisoner, and this being the last ship from the Armada to be captured.|$|E

25|$|This {{achievement}} was checked by {{the controversy over}} the use of graven images, and the proper interpretation of the Second Commandment, which led to the crisis of Iconoclasm or destruction of religious images, which racked the Empire between 726 and 843. The restoration of Orthodoxy resulted in a strict standardization of religious imagery within the Eastern Church. Byzantine art became increasingly conservative, as the form of images themselves, many accorded divine origin or thought to have been be painted by Saint Luke or other figures, was held to have a status <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> that of a scriptural text. They could be copied, but not improved upon. As a concession to Iconoclast sentiment, monumental religious sculpture was effectively banned. Neither of these attitudes were held in Western Europe, but Byzantine art nonetheless had great influence there until the High Middle Ages, and remained very popular long after that, with vast numbers of icons of the Cretan School exported to Europe as late as the Renaissance. Where possible, Byzantine artists were borrowed for projects such as mosaics in Venice and Palermo. The enigmatic frescoes at Castelseprio may be an example of work by a Greek artist working in Italy.|$|E

[...] On 3 June, he set off with Olga for the German spa town of Badenweiler in the Black Forest, from where he wrote outwardly jovial letters to his sister Masha, describing the food and surroundings, and assuring her and his mother {{that he was getting}} better. In his last letter, he complained about the way German women dressed.|$|E

500|$|Michael Westmore {{designed}} the make-up in the episode, drawing inspiration from an alligator {{he saw in}} National Geographic magazine to create Tosk's appearance. The Hunters were initially intended to appear more alien-like, with steam rising out of their masks as they opened to reveal a demonic [...] face with huge eyes and scaly skin. However, due to budgetary restraints, the original costume and make-up plans were scrapped and the description was revised to become [...] "a rather mundane humanoid face, <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> human." [...] The transporter effect used by the Hunters {{was inspired by the}} science fiction film Metropolis (1927), specifically by the scene in which the robot Maria undergoes a transformation.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{agreed to}} fly Oana to Atlanta {{and asked him}} to dress sharply and wear a lei. Abbott {{arranged}} for press and photographers to meet Oana at the Atlanta airport. [...] He later recalled: [...] "I sold them on the Hawaiian royalty stuff. [...] It was <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> the beam, either, for Hank comes from the best stock in the islands – and he looked like a prince, tall, dark and handsome." [...] Oana spent most of the 1934 season with the Crackers, compiling a [...]289 batting average and 17 home runs in 480 at bats. [...] Despite playing less than the full season in the Southern Association, he led the circuit in home runs and finished second in the league with 100 RBIs. [...] Finding no interest from major league clubs after his 1934 season in Atlanta, Oana reportedly expressed interest in pursuing a career as a professional wrestler, with one account indicating that he hoped to [...] "cash in" [...] on his [...] "wrestling experience on the island with Japanese grapplers." ...|$|E
500|$|Simcoe's {{troops were}} {{moving down the}} road toward Williamsburg, convoying some cattle with the {{infantry}} and jägers in the lead under Major Richard Armstrong, with Simcoe and the cavalry about an hour behind them. [...] At Spencer's Ordinary ("" [...] meaning tavern at the time), the troops rejoined and paused to rest. [...] Simcoe ordered fences in the area torn down since [...] "it was an admirable place for the chicanery of action". While they rested, some of the Loyalists went out to round up more cattle found in the area, and the cavalry went to a nearby farm to feed their horses. McPherson's men encountered the latter, whose sentries raised the alarm to the main body. [...] Simcoe's cavalry charged McPherson's formation, breaking it up. [...] McPherson {{and a number of}} his men were unhorsed in the melee, and several were taken prisoner before the leading edge of Butler's main force began to arrive. Simcoe ordered most of the infantry up to support his cavalry, and sent the jägers and light infantry into the woods on the right to flank the arriving enemy column. By questioning the prisoners, Simcoe learned that Lafayette was <b>not</b> <b>far</b> <b>off.</b> [...] He sent word to Cornwallis, dispatched the cattle convoy toward Williamsburg, and ordered trees to be felled to make a barricade across the road as a point of defense. [...] He then arrayed his troops in a way calculated to mislead the Americans into believing that more troops were in formation just over a rise. When Butler's force arrived, Simcoe ordered an infantry charge. [...] This scattered the first wave of Butler's men into the nearby woods, where the jägers then pushed them back. [...] However, Butler's men continued to advance. [...] Simcoe ordered a cavalry charge and fired a field cannon {{to give the impression that}} a larger force was arriving. [...] The charge forced Butler's men back, at which point the two forces disengaged, Simcoe because he was concerned that Lafayette was approaching, and Butler because his men were fooled by Simcoe's stratagem.|$|E
