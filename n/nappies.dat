25|$|Following the {{beaching}} of the MSC Napoli, as {{a result}} of severe damage incurred during European storm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the flotsam which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable <b>nappies</b> (diapers). The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the Receiver of Wreck. Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for theft by finding. After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach. A similar situation occurred after the wreck of the MV Cita in 1997.|$|E

When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money.

500|$|Forrest Highway {{has been}} criticised {{for the lack}} of {{roadside}} facilities. In January 2014, it was described as [...] "the busiest, most unserviced, long stretch of highway in the nation" [...] by MP Murray Cowper, Member for Murray-Wellington. With toilets only available at the John Tognela Rest Area near {{the southern end of the}} highway, travellers have reportedly stopped alongside the highway or side roads to urinate and change <b>nappies.</b> A farming family with property adjacent to the highway was willing to invest in a roadhouse near Herron Point, but Main Roads required roadhouses to be built on both sides of the highway. According to Cowper, traffic volume would need to increase from 17,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day to justify such an investment.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a postural support <b>nappy</b> and/or a postural support roll on neuromotor function in very preterm infants when nursed prone to term equivalent age. Methods: A randomized observer blind controlled trial of 123 very preterm infants was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of the sole tertiary referral centre in Western Australia. Infants were stratified by gestational age (< 29 weeks or 29 - 30 weeks), then randomized into one of three intervention groups: postural support <b>nappy,</b> postural support <b>nappy</b> and postural support roll, or disposable <b>nappy</b> and postural support roll. Interventions started when infants were stable and ceased when routine side-lying commenced. Measurements of shoulder and hip posture were performed pre-intervention, 5 weeks post-intervention and term postmenstrual age. Results: Infants nursed with a postural support roll and a postural support <b>nappy</b> demonstrated improved hip posture to term equivalent age compared with infants nursed with either a postural support roll only, or a postural support <b>nappy</b> only. Infants nursed with a postural support roll either with or without a postural support <b>nappy</b> demonstrated improved shoulder posture to term equivalent age. Conclusions: Combined use of a postural support roll and a postural support <b>nappy</b> while very preterm infants are nursed prone improves hip posture up to term postmenstrual age.

2500|$|In October 2008, [...] "An updated {{lifecycle}} assessment {{study for}} disposable and reusable nappies" [...] by the UK Environment Agency and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs stated that reusable diapers can cause significantly less (up to 40 per cent) or significantly {{more damage to}} the environment than disposable ones, depending mostly on how parents wash and dry them.

However, much better results (emission cuts of up to 40 per cent) could be achieved by using reusable diapers more rationally.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, the Puhdys {{decided to}} disband. Their 1988 album Neue Helden (New Heroes), {{recorded}} with an orchestra, was intended to be their last; its faintly political lyrics were written by singer-songwriter Kurt Demmler under a pseudonym. The album's original cover, which pictured two babies wearing diapers (<b>nappies)</b> in the flags of the Soviet Union and United States, was banned in the GDR; legend has it this was due to the presence of the American flag, not to the context. The cover was replaced for the domestic release with a simple green cover (the international release on Koch Records was unaltered). The band went on a 20th-anniversary [...] "Farewell Tour," [...] accompanied by Czechoslovak band Turbo and West German veterans The Lords.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Scottish {{housewife}} Valerie Hunter Gordon started {{developing and}} making Paddi, a 2-part system {{consisting of a}} disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old parachutes for the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949. [...] Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable <b>nappies.</b> In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until {{he had a chance}} meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, Boots UK agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the USA and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of 'all in one' diapers.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was still}} 11 days shy of his seventeenth {{birthday}} {{when he was}} selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut as a middle order batsman for New South Wales against Victoria in the 1952–53 season. He had played only 12 first grade matches prior to this. When he arrived to meet his teammates, Australian vice-captain Arthur Morris asked him where his <b>nappies</b> were. At the age of 16 years and 354 days, this made him the second youngest cricketer to be capped for New South Wales, just three months older than teammate Ian Craig {{when he made his}} debut. He scored 44 and 8, without being dismissed in either innings. According to Haigh, [...] "Great protectiveness was felt towards such a boy among men." [...] From the last ball of a drawn match, Simpson attempted to run two, but his misjudgment saw him caught short by half the pitch. Nevertheless, umpire Hugh McKinnon turned down the appeal, and after Victorian captain Sam Loxton reacted angrily, the arbiter said [...] "it's the last ball of the game and his first match". Simpson took his maiden wicket during the match, catching Test player Ian Johnson from his own bowling.|$|E

[...] Piers Martin of NME said, [...] "Busy yourself with those <b>nappies,</b> Madge – {{this is what it}} really feels like to be a girl. All For You finds Jackson in predatory mode, keen to reclaim both in the boudoir and on the dancefloor territory which is today dominated by pneumatic mini-Janets like Britney, Christina and J-Lo." [...] People Magazine ranked it among the year's best albums, stating, [...] "Take that, Britney! Move over, J.Lo! With a new generation of dance-pop divas following in her fancy footsteps, the baby Jackson shows who is still in control with this all-encompassing album that bounces from hip-hop to rock to classical—even during the same song—without missing a funky beat." [...] Dennis Kelly of The Morning Call added, [...] "If imitators such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, et al., are quiet the next few months, it's because the Queen of Pop has sent them back to class with new material to study." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon exclaimed Jackson [...] "has turned into a more interesting figure than Madonna, and a maker of better music." [...] The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan announced Jackson to be the highest paid recording artist in history, signing a contract with Virgin Records in the mid of the 90's worth $90 million, and was declared to have surpassed the influence of Michael Jackson. MTV News also noted the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of Michael's Invincible, released later that year.|$|E
