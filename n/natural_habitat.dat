5|$|After mating in August or September, {{the female}} katipo {{produces}} {{five or six}} egg sacs in November or December. The spiderlings hatch during January and February and disperse into surrounding plants. Due to habitat loss and colonisation of their <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> by other exotic spiders, the katipo is threatened with extinction.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} {{has resulted}} in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> for wild animals; {{one of the main}} reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E

5|$|Sea World Aquarium is a <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> lying {{opposite}} to the Rameswaram Bus Stand, having {{an assortment of}} underwater creatures â€“ {{it is the only}} one of its kind in the state, filled with such varied marine life forms including exotic species.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} bog turtles {{in the wild}} is a {{significant}} aid {{to the development of}} a conservation strategy. Radio telemetry has been used to track the turtles' movements in their <b>natural</b> <b>habitat.</b> Blood samples, fecal samples, and cloacal swabs are also commonly collected from wild populations and tested for signs of disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a weed outside its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare and endangered in its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease {{to which the}} species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E

5|$|Cattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus {{date back}} to the 1700s, and a handful of farmers {{continue}} to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls. Bullocks, which live outdoors year-round, grow slowly as they would in their <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> ultimately producing a distinctly tender meat. Around 2,200,000 cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 the Iranian {{government}} {{collaborated with}} the Cheetah Conservation Fund, the IUCN, Panthera, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey, to ensure that development projects do not hamper its survival, and to highlight {{the plight of the}} Asiatic cheetah. Iran declared 31August as National Cheetah Day in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rafflesiana {{is one of}} the {{few other}} Nepenthes species {{reliably}} documented as having caught mammalian prey in its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat.</b> In Brunei, frogs, geckos and skinks have been found in the pitchers of this species. The remains of mice have also been reported. On September 29, 2006, at the Jardin botanique de Lyon in France, a cultivated N. truncata was photographed containing the decomposing corpse of a mouse.|$|E

5|$|Several {{different}} {{habitat types}} {{are found in}} Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs {{and a variety of}} coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.|$|E
5|$|The Pseudonarcissus {{group in}} their <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> prefer humid {{situations}} such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats {{tend to be}} discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations. In Germany, which has relatively little limestone, Narcissus pseudonarcissus grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} {{is threatened by}} the loss of its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. In India, the species is protected under Schedule I the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Nepalese population is listed in CITES Appendix III. The {{four-horned antelope}} is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog survives {{in some areas}} of Sydney, such as the Brickpit at Sydney Olympic Park (the {{proposed}} site for the tennis courts for the 2000 Sydney Olympics). When the green and golden bell frog was found there, the tennis courts were built elsewhere, and the population has since been monitored. This frog has become an unofficial mascot for the Homebush Bay area. It has also been introduced to places in Sydney in its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> without much success.|$|E
5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> including the promotion of biodiversity. This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that this species has changed its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.|$|E
