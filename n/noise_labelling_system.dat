40|$|This {{report is}} the first {{deliverable}} of the NordFoU project NordTyre. The main purpose of the project is to establish scientific evidence of the tyre/road contribution to road traffic noise emission in the Nordic countries. Furthermore, to establish which combinations of tyres and road surfaces that will yield the lowest noise emissions. This report is a literature study mainly based on available literature from the period 2005 - 2011. Â  Focus has been on available data of tyre noise levels on ISO tracks, on other test track road surfaces and on road surfaces representative of pavements used in the Nordic countries. The main results are that the spread in noise levels on rough-textured road surfaces commonly found in Sweden and Norway is much less than found on ISO surfaces. The noise ranking seems to be significant different on rough-textured pavements compared to an ISO surface, but may be better on the smoother road surfaces, as found for example in Denmark. It is necessary to improve {{the knowledge of the}} performance of passenger car tyres on normally used Nordic road surface, compared to the coming <b>noise</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>system</b> of tyres in the EU. A measuring program of tyres on similar pavement types in Denmark, Sweden and Norway is proposed. Oppdragsgiver: Norwegian Public Roads Administratio...|$|E

40|$|<b>Label</b> <b>noise</b> is an {{important}} issue in classification, with many potential negative consequences. For example, the accuracy of predictions may decrease, whereas the complexity of inferred models and the number of necessary training samples may increase. Many works in the literature have been devoted to the study of <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> and the development of techniques to deal with <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey on the different types of <b>label</b> <b>noise,</b> their consequences and the algorithms that take <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> into account. This paper proposes to fill this gap. Firstly, the definitions and sources of <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> are considered and a taxonomy of the types of <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> is proposed. Secondly, the potential consequences of <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> are discussed. Thirdly, <b>label</b> noise-robust, <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> cleansing and <b>label</b> noise-tolerant algorithms are reviewed. For each category of approaches, a short discussion is proposed in order to help the practitioner to choose the most suitable technique in its own particular field of application. Eventually, the design of experiments is also discussed, what may interest the researchers who would like to test their own algorithms. In this survey, <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> consists of mislabelled instances: no additional information is assumed to be available, like e. g. confidences on labels...|$|R

Indeed, labels may be polluted by <b>label</b> <b>noise,</b> due to e. g. insufficient information, expert mistakes, and encoding errors.

40|$|International audienceFisher {{discriminant}} analysis (FDA) {{is a popular}} and powerful method for dimensionality reduction and classification. Unfortunately, the optimality of the dimension reduction provided by FDA is only proved in the homoscedastic case. In addition, FDA {{is known to have}} poor performances in the cases of <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> and sparse <b>labeled</b> data. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a probabilistic framework for FDA which relaxes the homoscedastic assumption on the class covariance matrices and adds a term to explicitly model the non-discriminative information. This allows the proposed method to be robust to <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> and {{to be used in the}} semi-supervised context.

40|$|In many applications, the {{training}} data, from which {{one needs to}} learn a classifier, is corrupted with <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> Many standard algorithms such as SVM perform poorly in presence of <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> In this paper we investigate the robustness of risk minimization to <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> We prove a sufficient condition on a loss function for the risk minimization under that loss to be tolerant to uniform <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> We show that the $ 0 - 1 $ loss, sigmoid loss, ramp loss and probit loss satisfy this condition though none of the standard convex loss functions satisfy it. We also prove that, by choosing a sufficiently large value of a parameter in the loss function, the sigmoid loss, ramp loss and probit loss can be made tolerant to non-uniform <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> also if we can assume the classes to be separable under noise-free data distribution. Through extensive empirical studies, we show that risk minimization under the $ 0 - 1 $ loss, the sigmoid loss and the ramp loss has much better robustness to <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> {{when compared to the}} SVM algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The food {{industry}} nowadays is becoming customer-oriented and needs faster response {{time to deal}} with food incidents. There is a deep need for good traceability systems to help the supply chain (SC) partners to minimize production and distribution of unsafe or poor quality products, which in turn will enhance the food SC performance. The current food <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> implemented in developing countries cannot guarantee that food is authentic, safe and of good quality. Therefore, the use of origin labels, mainly the geographical indications (GIs), allows SC partners to define quality standards and defend their products' reputation. According to our knowledge there are no studies discussed the use of GIs in developing countries. This research represents a research schema about the implementation of European quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> in developing countries and its impact on enhancing SC performance. An empirical study was conducted on the Egyptian traditional food sector based on a sample of seven restaurants implementing the Med-diet <b>labeling</b> <b>system.</b> First, in-depth interviews were carried out to analyze the Egyptian traditional food SC. Then, a framework was developed to link the European quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> and SC performance. Finally, a structured survey was conducted based on the applied framework to investigate the impact of Med-diet <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on the SC performance. The research provides an applied framework linking Med-diet quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> to SC performance of traditional food sector in developing countries generally and especially in the Egyptian traditional food sector.

40|$|The {{scientific}} community agrees that emission levels from food {{production and consumption}} have to decrease {{in order for the}} world to reach climate targets. Environmental food labeling is becoming a policy tool to motivate consumers in their behavior of food purchase and consumption. This study examined sales data over 42 days from a major student cafeteria at the University of Oslo before and after the introduction of a traffic-light <b>labeling</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, the traffic-light <b>labeling</b> <b>systemâs</b> effect on food purchase was compared to two other <b>labeling</b> <b>systems,</b> green-only and red-only <b>labeling</b> <b>systems.</b> The traffic-light <b>labeling</b> marked all dishes as red (highest environmental impact), yellow (medium environmental impact) or green (lowest environmental impact). The red-only <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> denoted only the highest environmental impact dish with red. In the green-only <b>label</b> <b>system</b> only the dish with the lowest environmental impact was labeled green. We analyzed two food products, meat and vegetarian dishes, investigating the percentage change in sales for the entire 42 days treatment period and for the 20 first and 22 last days separately. Independent t-test and ordinary least squares (OLS) method were used for analyzing the effectiveness of the food <b>labeling</b> <b>systems.</b> For the first 20 days of the experiment, traffic-light labeling led to a significant reduction in sales share of meat dishes (highest environmental impact dishes). Both statistical tests supported these results. Furthermore, the OLS method found a significant effect on sales share of meat dishes under traffic-light labeling for the whole 42 days treatment period. Traffic-light, red-only and green-only labeling did not {{have a significant effect on}} sales share of the vegetarian dishes (lowest environmental impact dishes). Looking at the results, one may claim that costumers need to compare the environmental information of one product to other products in order for an eco-label to influence purchase behavior. At the current level of evidence, eco-labels cannot be recommended as a single strategy for changing consumer behavior. Since the present study showed a small, but a significant, reduction of one <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on the purchase of meat dishes, further research on the influence of eco-labels are needed before these labeling formats can be recommended as a public environmental intervention...|$|R

40|$|Recycling {{has become}} a more {{prevalent}} practice {{in the last few}} decades. However, the <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on todayâs packaging is not always clear in indicating whether something is recyclable. Recently, there has {{been a great deal of}} attention directed at a new system, known as the How 2 Recycle label, an innovative <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> expected to launch in the next few years. As the population continues to grow at unprecedented levels and more strain is placed on the global environment, recycling becomes more crucial. In the United States, the lack of a standard system for recycling on labeling and packaging deters people from properly recycling recyclable matÂ­erials. However, if a well-designed, standardized system were developed and employed, more people would practice recycling and thus, less recycled material would be thrown away into landfills. The purpose of this study was to examine the disadvantages of the current <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on packaging and its efficiency in encouraging consumers to properly recycle. It also looks at the How 2 Recycle <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> and how it compares to the current system. A survey was conducted to gather data in order to establish how effective these two <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> are at communicating recyclability. The primary research objectives were to determine the efficiency of the current <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on packaging and evaluate the potential of the How 2 Recycle label. Results from the survey data demonstrated the inefficiency and weaknesses of the current system. The data showed that the How 2 Recycle label scheme was preferred to today 2 Ì 7 s system and had potential for success in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of traditional classification models can adversely be {{impacted by the}} presence of <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> in training observations. The pioneer work of Lawrence and SchÃ¶lkopf tackled this issue in data sets with independent observations by incorporating a statistical noise model within the inference algorithm. In this paper, the specific case of <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> in non-independent observations is rather considered. For this purpose, a label noise-tolerant expectation-maximisation algorithm is proposed in the frame of hidden Markov models.

40|$|In many {{applications}} of classifier learning, training data suffers from <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> Deep networks are learned using huge training data {{where the problem}} of noisy labels is particularly relevant. The current techniques proposed for learning deep networks under <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> focus on modifying the network architecture and on algorithms for estimating true labels from noisy labels. An alternate approach would be to look for loss functions that are inherently noise-tolerant. For binary classification there exist theoretical results on loss functions that are robust to <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions on a loss function so that risk minimization under that loss function would be inherently tolerant to <b>label</b> <b>noise</b> for multiclass classification problems. These results generalize the existing results on noise-tolerant loss functions for binary classification. We study some of the widely used loss functions in deep networks and show that the loss function based on mean absolute value of error is inherently robust to <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> Thus standard back propagation is enough to learn the true classifier even under <b>label</b> <b>noise.</b> Through experiments, we illustrate the robustness of risk minimization with such loss functions for learning neural networks.
