NUE definitions differ depending on whether plants are cultivated to produce biomass or grain yields. However, for most plant species, NUE mainly depends on how plants extract inorganic nitrogen from the soil, assimilate nitrate and ammonium, and recycle organic nitrogen. Efforts have been made to study the genetic basis as well as the biochemical and enzymatic mechanisms involved in <b>nitrogen</b> uptake, <b>assimilation,</b> and remobilization in crops and model plants. The detection of the limiting factors that could be manipulated to increase NUE is the major goal of such research. An overall examination of the physiological, metabolic, and genetic aspects of <b>nitrogen</b> uptake, <b>assimilation</b> and remobilization is presented in this review. The enzymes and regulatory processes manipulated to improve NUE components are presented. Results obtained from natural variation and quantitative trait loci studies are also discussed. This review presents the complexity of NUE and supports the idea that the integration of the numerous data coming from transcriptome studies, functional genomics, quantitative genetics, ecophysiology and soil science into explanatory models of whole-plant behaviour will be promising...|$|R

30|$|It is {{expected}} that ammonia in the wastewater is the transformed organic nitrogen by the ammonification process due to the microbial activities. It is further transformed by oxidation to nitrite and then finally to nitrate by nitrification process {{in the presence of}} oxygen. The direct uptake by plants contributes to the NH 4 +-N removal from the wastewater using ammonium as nutrients (Vymazal 2007), which can be stored as organic <b>nitrogen.</b> Biomass <b>assimilation</b> by microbiological processes also adsorbs NH 4 +-N, further reducing the nitrogen content of wastewater. Regression analysis revealed strong linear correlation (R 2 [*]=[*] 0.92) between mass loadings and mass removal rates of NH 4 -N similar to that of TKN (Fig.  2 b).

40|$|Because {{it plays}} an {{essential}} role in <b>nitrogen</b> (N) <b>assimilation</b> and photorespiration, the glutamine synthetase (GS) /glutamate synthase (GOGAT) system is widely accepted as occupying a central position in leaf N metabolism. However, the regulation of GOGAT at the post-transcriptional level is poorly understood. Here, we show that ACR 11, an ACT (acronym for aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA) domain-containing family protein, interacts with Glu 1 -encoded ferredoxin (Fd) -GOGAT in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. In addition, Arabidopsis acr 11 mutants have lost the capability to control Fd-GOGAT levels in response to light/dark diurnal cycles, nitrogen inputs, and changes in photorespiratory activity. Considering that ACR 11 has putative glutamine-binding domains, our results indicate that ACR 11 is necessary for post-transcriptional control of leaf Glu 1 -encoded Fd-GOGAT. This regulation takes place through direct interaction of ACR 11 and Fd-GOGAT, possibly in an allosteric manner...|$|R

40|$|Shallow, mixed raceway ponds {{can be used}} to grow microalgae for {{the dual}} {{purposes}} of wastewater treatment and biofuel feedstock production. To improve the environmental sustainability of microalgae biofuels and to alleviate resource limitations, nutrients remaining after biofuel production should be recycled for additional cultivation. This thesis considers three topics: wastewater treatment by algae, <b>nitrogen</b> and phosphorus <b>assimilation</b> by algae, and algae cell disruption to facilitate nutrient recovery. The main experimental work was done in pilot raceway ponds growing polycultures of microalgae on clarified municipal wastewater. In addition, two lab-scale pretreatment technologies were tested for their ability to disrupt cells, as indicated by subsequent biomass organic nitrogen and particulate phosphorus degradation during sequential anaerobic and aerobic digestion. The two pretreatment technologies were sonication and high-pressure homogenization. The raceway pond research was conducted at the City of San Luis Obispo Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF). Nine 30 -m 2, 0. 3 -m deep raceway ponds were operated continuously from March 1, 2013 to August 31, 2014. The ponds were arranged in three sets of triplicates. One set was operated at a 2 -day hydraulic residence time (HRT) on clarified wastewater throughout the study. A second set (“Round 1 ” of ponds-in-series) was operated at a 3 -day HRT, also on clarified wastewater. Its effluent was clarified and then discharged into the third set (“Round 2 ” of ponds-in-series), which initially operated at a 4 -day HRT but then later a 3 -day HRT. The nutrient removal and assimilation data were compared seasonally—summer (March–October) and winter (November–February). The triplicate raceways operating at a 2 -day HRT achieved average total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal efficiencies of 11 % in the winter and 71 % in the summer, while dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) removal remained similar throughout seasonality. In the first ponds-in-series experiment (3 -day HRT followed by 4 -day), average summer TAN removal efficiencies for Round 1 and 2 were 88 % and nearly 100 %, respectively. Round 1 and 2 average summer DRP removal efficiencies were 29 % and 67 %, respectively. The first ponds-in-series experiment was not conducted in the winter. In the second experiment, the Round 2 HRT was changed to 3 days. Average TAN removal efficiencies for Round 2 in the winter and summer were 88 % and 100 %, respectively. DRP removal for Round 2 increased from 38 % in the winter to 66 % in the summer. Total nitrogen (TN) mass balances on the raceway pond experiments were useful to illustrate the fate of influent nitrogen, including losses. In the first ponds-in-series experiment, 76 % of the influent soluble nitrogen was converted to organic <b>nitrogen</b> by <b>assimilation,</b> while 6 % of the influent ammonia was lost by volatilization. In the second ponds-in-series experiment, 81 % of the influent soluble nitrogen was converted to organic <b>nitrogen</b> by <b>assimilation</b> and only 1 % of the influent ammonia was lost by volatilization. The 2 -day HRT raceway experiment achieved 41 % conversion of influent soluble nitrogen to organic <b>nitrogen</b> by <b>assimilation,</b> with influent ammonia losses of 3 % by volatilization. In addition to these pilot-scale raceway pond experiments, laboratory experiments were conducted on re-solubilization of algae biomass nutrients to support additional algae growth. Algae harvested from the pilot ponds was pre-treated with either sonication or high-pressure homogenization. The pretreated biomass was then subjected to anaerobic digestion and then aerobic digestion to increased nitrogen and phosphorus solubilization. The laboratory anaerobic digestion simulated pilot digestion, also conducted at the pilot facility, and the aerobic digestion was meant to simulate further re-solubilization that would occur when algae digestate was returned to the aerobic raceway ponds to promote further algae growth. Neither pre-treatment technologies {{had a significant impact on}} degradation of biomass organic nitrogen and particulate phosphorus compared to controls. It was found that simple anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic digestion resolubilized 90 % of organic nitrogen and 50 % of particulate phosphorus...|$|R

30|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> uptake, <b>assimilation,</b> and {{recycling}} in plant roots {{were reported to}} determine plant development and productivity (Yamaya and Kusano 2014). However, numerous plant developmental processes such as root meristem specification, vascular development, and shoot and root growth, are determined by CKs (Zurcher and Muller 2016). In addition, CKs are key phytohormones for cell division and growth (Riou-Khamlichi et al. 1999). This study illustrates that elevated expression of OsNPF 7.2 promotes up-regulation of crucial genes in cell cycle (Fig. 5 d), which indicated that over-expression of OsNPF 7.2 might promote cell division. To explore the regulatory mechanism of OsNPF 7.2, we analyse expression of the major regulators in cell cycle, namely, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory partner cyclins. The analysis shows that up-regulation of OsNPF 7.2 significantly increases the expression level of CDKs, while down-regulation of OsNPF 7.2 reduces the level of expression of CDKs (Fig. 5 c). Based on these results, we conclude that altered expression of OsNPF 7.2 controls rice tillering by regulating CK contents, and further regulating the cell cycle in tiller bud.|$|R

We investigated changes in gene expression and cell physiology of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 during 96 h of nitrogen starvation. During the first 6 h, the transcriptome showed activation of <b>nitrogen</b> uptake and <b>assimilation</b> systems and of the core <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>assimilation</b> regulators. However, the nitrogen-deprived cells still grew {{at the same rate}} as the control and even showed transiently increased expression of phycobilisome genes. After 12 h, cell growth decreased and chlorosis started with degradation of the nitrogen-rich phycobilisomes. During this phase, the transcriptome showed suppression of genes for phycobilisomes, for carbon fixation and for de novo protein synthesis. Interestingly, photosynthetic activity of both photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II was retained quite well. Excess electrons were quenched by the induction of terminal oxidase and hydrogenase genes, compensating for the diminished carbon fixation and nitrate reduction activity. After 48 h, the cells ceased most activities. A marked exception was the retained PSI gene transcription, possibly this supports the viability of Synechocystis cells and enables rapid recovery after relieving from nitrogen starvation. During early recovery, many genes changed expression, supporting the resumed cellular activity. In total, our results distinguished three phases during gradual nitrogen depletion: (1) an immediate response, (2) short-term acclimation and (3) long-term survival. This shows that cyanobacteria respond to nitrogen starvation by a cascade of physiological adaptations reflected by numerous changes in the transcriptome unfolding at different timescales...|$|R

The hypothesis tested was that cyanobacteria produce and utilize siderophores and toxins in low iron conditions to scavenge iron, when P and N are not limiting algal growth, providing some cyanobacteria with a competitive advantage over other algal species. Among the naturally eutrophic lakes studied, cyanobacteria were dominant at low iron (3 ̆epFe 19) concentrations (Spearman r = 0. 73, p= 0. 004). Under these low iron conditions, the concentration of hydroxamate siderophores was significantly related to cyanobacteria biomass (r 2 = 0. 81, p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and the concentrations of extracellular microcystin were significantly correlated to the concentrations of hydroxamate siderophores (r 2 = 0. 98, p 3 ̆c 0. 001).
