Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. Findings Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53 % mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98 % sequence identity to <b>Ndumu</b> <b>virus</b> (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. Conclusions This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for <b>Ndumu</b> <b>virus.</b> NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact. </p...|$|E
40|$|Good science {{includes}} innovation, investigation, and rigor. This thesisâ€™ {{first study}} {{is related to}} rigor. This study was performed at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi, {{as part of the}} Arbovirus Incidence and Diversity (AVID) project. A field sample recording system was developed, which saves time and location metadata from the global positioning system (GPS), as well as a connected system monitoring the biobank, freezer, incubators and servers. This monitoring system more than once prevented loss of resources due to freezer failure by alerting responsible personnel, and was later published in 'Biopreservation and Biobanking'. The sampling system was re-used in the second study, a Ugandan project aimed to identify African swine fever (ASF) in pigs. In this study <b>Ndumu</b> <b>virus,</b> a relatively unstudied virus previously only found in culicine mosquitoes, was discovered in domestic pigs. For the third study, collaboration with ILRI continued with a study analyzing the 'Muguga Cocktail', the live vaccine currently used to control Theileria parva, a protozoan parasite causing East Coast Fever (ECF) in cattle. Live vaccines have many problems, such as high costs, difficult manufacturing, and the risk that misused vaccine will spread the disease. An in-depth study of the three parasite stocks included in the vaccine was performed, where genomic differences were identified with the goal of explaining the success of the vaccine, as well as identify a potential set of antigens which may in the future replace the live vaccine with a subunit vaccine. Finally, for the fourth study, the metagenomic theme continued with the development of the MetLab, a tool for experimental design and analysis for viral metagenomics projects. The tool consists of three parts: (i) tools to estimate the sequencing needs of a metagenomic project, (ii) simulation tools, allowing users to simulate metagenomics sequencing data, and (iii) the system runs metagenomic analysis pipelines...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{hybridoma}} {{cell lines}} secreting antibodies against the Semliki Forest virus nucleocapsid protein were established and employed for identification of conserved epitopes among 27 alphavirus types and subtypes. Using an antibody capture test, the antibodies {{were found to}} cross-react to variable degrees with alphaviruses belonging to the Semliki Forest, western encephalitis and eastern encephalitis complexes, as well as Middelburg and Ndumu. None of the antibodies reacted with either Venezuelan equine encephalitis or Barmah Forest virus. Due to their reactivity with Fort Morgan, Y 62 - 33, Whataroa and chikungunya, the monoclonal antibodies were divided into six reactive types. Competition assays showed that the epitopes for all the types were either identical or clustered on a single domain of the nucleocapsid protein. Antigenic relationships determined by haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and neutralization of infectivity (Calisher et al., 1980; Porterfield, 1980) are the present basis for the grouping of viruses from the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus (Westaway et al., 1985) into seven antigenic complexes. The Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), Semliki Forest (SF) and western equine encephalitis (WEE) complexes each comprise several viruses, while eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Barmah Forest (BF), Middelburg (MID) and <b>Ndumu</b> are individual <b>viruses</b> only distantly {{related to each other}} (Shope, 1985). Alphaviruses are composed of three or four structural proteins. While the two surface glycoproteins, E 1 and E 2, display the complex and species-specific reactivities, the group-reactive determinants reside on the nucleocapsi...|$|R
