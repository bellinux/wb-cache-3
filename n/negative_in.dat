5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>in</b> {{the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and <b>negative,</b> <b>in</b> the case of a local alignment.|$|E

5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more <b>negative.</b> <b>In</b> what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E

5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely <b>negative</b> <b>in</b> those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be <b>negative</b> <b>in</b> {{the early stages of the}} disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be <b>negative</b> <b>in</b> new infections.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is <b>negative,</b> <b>in</b> order to achieve Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed {{to be the father}} after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half and five minutes into the half Liverpool defender Josemi was shown a yellow card for fouling Miloš Krasić. Liverpool's poor play in front of goal {{continued}} after the restart; Josemi {{had a chance to}} score, but his shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area went over the crossbar. After the attack, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match; Florent Sinama Pongolle replaced Finnan. After just over an hour's play, a mix-up between Reina and Sami Hyypiä nearly contrived to present a goal to CSKA, before Hyypiä intervened to clear the ball. CSKA made their first substitution in the 66th minute with Deividas Šemberas replacing Yuri Zhirkov. Liverpool followed this by replacing Xabi Alonso with Mohamed Sissoko. Vágner Love had a chance to extend CSKA's lead in the 77th minute, but he was unable to control the ball after a high pass and lost possession. Despite their lead CSKA were <b>negative</b> <b>in</b> their play; they were punished when Liverpool replaced John Arne Riise with striker Djibril Cissé. Cissé made an immediate impact; he ran onto to a pass from García. The pass was cleared by CSKA defender Sergei Ignashevich but it ricocheted off Cissé and left him with an open goal after Akinfeev had come off his line in an attempt to clear the ball. Cissé's goal meant the match was now drawn at 1–1 and with no further goals the match went into extra-time.|$|E

40|$|Like for {{instance}} English, Dutch is a so-called double negation (DN) language. This {{means that if}} in Dutch you use two <b>negatives</b> <b>in</b> a single clause, they will negate each other's meaning and yield a positive interpretation. Another way to interpret double negatives is to have them together express a single negation with no cancellation; this is called negative concord (NC) {{and it is the}} expected meaning in, {{for instance}}, the NC languages Italian, Spanish, and Romanian. While Dutch is a DN language, which means we expect double <b>negatives</b> <b>in</b> Dutch to convey a DN meaning, it is still possible to convey an NC meaning in Dutch for double negatives. For this thesis, I performed a corpus study which confirmed a substantial occurrence of NC meanings for double <b>negatives</b> <b>in</b> Dutch. This lead to the main question of this thesis: to what extent do we use intonation to disambiguate between DN readings and NC readings for double <b>negatives</b> <b>in</b> Dutch? In order to answer this question I first performed a production experiment to explore the intonation patterns that are spontaneously produced when confronted with double <b>negatives</b> <b>in</b> either a DN context or an NC context. Afterwards I used the intonation patterns found in the production experiment to perform a perception experiment. This experiment aimed at finding out whether participants would indeed judge double negatives uttered with certain intonation patterns to convey either a DN meaning or an NC meaning...|$|R

40|$|Theories {{suggest that}} nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is {{strongly}} related to heightened negative emotion. However, it is unclear when and why those who engage in NSSI experience heightened <b>negative</b> emotion. <b>In</b> a series of studies, I examined whether individuals {{with a history of}} NSSI (versus controls) experience greater <b>negative</b> emotion <b>in</b> response to positive (but not negative) contexts. Results showed that in community, clinical, and college samples, after controlling for depression and anxiety, those with a history of NSSI (versus controls) do not experience heightened <b>negative</b> emotions <b>in</b> <b>negative</b> situations (Studies 1, 2, and 4). However, they consistently experience heightened <b>negative</b> emotions <b>in</b> positive situations (Studies 1 - 5) even when controlling for depression and anxiety symptoms (Studies 2 - 4).

However, experimentally manipulating negative self-beliefs was not shown to reduce negative self-beliefs or <b>negative</b> emotion <b>in</b> positive situations (Study 6).
