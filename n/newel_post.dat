Two later black marble mantels are in the reception room, which has a carved Louis XVI-style wooden screen supported by four Corinthian columns.|$|E
25|$|A paneled {{wooden door}} inside an entry with architrave, transom and {{sidelights}} in the westernmost bay {{leads to an}} entrance hall. The interior has been remodeled but retains some original features, most notably the staircase in that entrance hall. It has a turned mahogany <b>newel</b> <b>post,</b> round railing, and turned balusters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the front}} parlor the {{fireplace}} has its original wooden mantelpiece and chimney breast. The rear has been reconfigured, with some doors and walls removed. Upstairs is another original <b>newel</b> <b>post,</b> {{and some of}} the original lath and plaster on the walls. The basement has also been modified, but may have contained the original kitchen and dining room.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{staircase}} {{with square}} balusters, turned <b>newel</b> <b>post</b> and molded rail {{rises from the}} central hall to the second story. The balustrade continues along the stairwell in the second floor hallway. Like the first floor, many original finishes remain. A door in the hallway conceals a short stair to the attic, which also mostly remains as it was originally constructed. Modern metal suspension rods {{have been added to}} support the ceiling, and one of the original wooden tie beams has been replaced with a metal one.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} of the Valley View house has a two-room-deep, central-hallway floor plan. Its wide central hallway contains a staircase from the first floor to the attic, with a wooden handrail supported with square balusters and a modest wooden turned <b>newel</b> <b>post.</b> The ceilings are [...] high. Although the house's foundation is low, {{the height of the}} interior walls and the full-sized attic make it appear tall from the outside.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second floor}} is reached {{by means of}} an {{elliptical}} stairway in the cross-hall. Embedded into the <b>newel</b> <b>post</b> {{at the base of the}} stairs is glass [...] "peace stone", symbolizing the owners [...] "peace of mind" [...] after having paid off the mortgage. The living quarters for the inhabitants of Wheatland were located on the second floor. A bathroom, complete with bathtub, shower and a bidet, was installed in the west wing when the Willsons bought Wheatland in 1884. The third floor was primarily used as servants' quarters and has been left unrestored.|$|E
5000|$|Newels are {{sometimes}} called solid newels in distinction from hollow newels due to varying techniques of construction. <b>Newel</b> <b>posts</b> {{turned on a}} lathe are solid pieces that can be highly decorative, they typically need to be fixed to a square newel base for installation. [...] Hollow newels are known more accurately as box <b>newel</b> <b>posts.</b> In historic homes, {{it is believed that}} the house plans were placed in the newel upon completion of the house before the newel was capped.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} feature {{of the house is}} a very rare cage newel staircase; four inner <b>newel</b> <b>posts</b> rise to the full height of the stairwell without interruption.|$|R
50|$|The central {{stairway}} is an {{open well}} with a half-turn timber flight with landings and has very fine cedar joinery including turned balusters, prominent <b>newel</b> <b>posts</b> and spandrel panelling.|$|R
2500|$|In these {{countries}} the carver is unrivaled for deftness of hand. [...] Grotesque and imitative {{work of the}} utmost perfection is produced, {{and many of the}} carvings of {{these countries}}, Japan in particular, are beautiful works of art, especially when the carver copies the lotus, lily or other aquatic plant. A favorite form of decoration consists of breaking up the architectural surfaces, such as ceilings, friezes, and columns, into framed squares and filling each panel with a circle, or diamond of conventional treatment with a spandrels in each corner. [...] A very Chinese feature is the finial of the <b>newel</b> <b>post,</b> so constantly left more or less straight in profile and deeply carved with monsters and scrolls. A heavily enriched moulding bearing a strong resemblance to the gadroon pattern is commonly used to give emphasis to edges, and the dragon arranged in curves imitative of nature is frequently employed over a closely designed and subordinated background.|$|E
2500|$|The dark-varnished and galleried {{staircase}} retains faded gilding and stencilled motifs on {{its first}} floor ceiling and {{on the underside of}} the first landing, visible from the ground floor. The decorative, carved frieze around these ceilings also still has old and faded gilding. The <b>newel</b> <b>post</b> is of unusual design. There are four carved wood and plaster corbels supporting the first floor staircase ceiling. They represent a woman with grapes and flowers, a winged cherub, a man with harvest motifs and a full-bearded man in medieval costume, carrying scrolls. In the latter corbel which overlooks the stairwell, the bearded man's profile is similar to Barber's profile in [...] by David Wilkie Wynfield, and his scrolls are long and slim enough to be building plans. These details beg the question as to whether it is a portrait of the architect, placed to overlook his work. The plaster corbels on the ground floor staircase ceiling are carved with lions, in connection with the Holdsworth family crest.|$|E

5000|$|Lumberman Simmons' {{utilized}} oak extensively {{throughout the}} house. Features include a built-in oak china cabinet, carved oak <b>newel</b> <b>posts,</b> dentil molding, extensive oak panels, oak pocket doors, and oak flooring.|$|R
50|$|The next {{significant}} {{change to the}} house likely took place around 1860. At that time the Italianate style of the <b>newel</b> <b>posts</b> and balusters was current. They replaced a simpler, enclosed original stair.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} has a timber {{open well}} staircase with winders, and square balusters and <b>newel</b> <b>posts.</b> Ground floor internal walls are rendered masonry, and {{first and second}} floor walls are timber framed with recessed fibrous cement panels.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{numerous}} {{family was}} achieved {{in only two}} years, and succeeded her first child, which was brought from Sacramento at considerable expense by a Mr. William Dodd, also a teamster, on her seventh birthday. This, by {{one of those rare}} inventions known only to a child's vocabulary, she at once called [...] "Misery"--probably a combination of [...] "Missy," [...] as she herself was formerly termed by strangers, and [...] "Missouri," [...] her native State. It was an excessively large doll at first--Mr. Dodd wishing to get the worth of his money--but time, and perhaps an excess of maternal care, remedied the defect, and it lost flesh and certain unemployed parts of its limbs very rapidly. It was further reduced in bulk by falling under the wagon and having the whole train pass over it, but singularly enough its greatest attenuation was in the head and shoulders--the complexion peeling off as a solid layer, followed by the disappearance of distinct strata of its extraordinary composition. This continued until the head and shoulders were much too small for even its reduced frame, and all the devices of childish millinery--a shawl secured with tacks and well hammered in, and a hat which tilted backward and forward and never appeared at the same angle--failed to restore symmetry. Until one dreadful morning, after an imprudent bath, the whole upper structure disappeared, leaving two hideous iron prongs standing erect from the spinal column. Even an imaginative child like Mary could not accept this sort of thing as a head. Later in the day Jack Roper, the blacksmith at the [...] "Crossing," [...] was concerned at the plaintive appearance before his forge of a little girl clad in a bright-blue pinafore of the same color as her eyes, carrying her monstrous offspring in her arms. Jack recognized her and instantly divined the situation. [...] "You haven't," [...] he suggested kindly, [...] "got another head at home--suthin' left over," [...] Mary shook her head sadly; even her prolific maternity was not equal to the creation of children in detail. [...] "Nor anythin' like a head?" [...] he persisted sympathetically. Mary's loving eyes filled with tears. [...] "No, nuffen!" [...] "You couldn't," [...] he continued thoughtfully, [...] "use her the other side up?--we might get a fine pair o' legs outer them irons," [...] he added, touching the two prongs with artistic suggestion. [...] "Now look here"--he was about to tilt the doll over when a small cry of feminine distress and a swift movement of a matronly little arm arrested the evident indiscretion. [...] "I see," [...] he said gravely. [...] "Well, you come here tomorrow, and we'll fix up suthin' to work her." [...] Jack was thoughtful the rest of the day, more than usually impatient with certain stubborn mules to be shod, and even knocked off work an hour earlier to walk to Big Bend and a rival shop. But the next morning when the trustful and anxious mother appeared at the forge she uttered a scream of delight. Jack had neatly joined a hollow iron globe, taken from the <b>newel</b> <b>post</b> of some old iron staircase railing, to the two prongs, and covered it with a coat of red fireproof paint. It was true that its complexion was rather high, that it was inclined to be top-heavy, and {{that in the long run}} the other dolls suffered considerably by enforced association with this unyielding and implacable head and shoulders, but this did not diminish Mary's joy over her restored first-born. Even its utter absence of features was no defect in a family where features were as evanescent as in hers, and the most ordinary student of evolution could see that the [...] "Amplach" [...] ninepins were in legitimate succession to the globular-headed [...] "Misery." [...] For a time I think that Mary even preferred her to the others. Howbeit it was a pretty sight to see her on a summer afternoon sitting upon a wayside stump, her other children dutifully ranged around her, and the hard, unfeeling head of Misery pressed deep down into her loving little heart as she swayed from side to side, crooning her plaintive lullaby. Small wonder that the bees took up the song and droned a slumberous accompaniment, or that high above her head the enormous pines, stirred through their depths by the soft Sierran air--or Heaven knows what--let slip flickering lights and shadows to play over that cast-iron face, until the child, looking down upon it with the quick, transforming power of love, thought that it smiled.|$|E

50|$|The {{characteristic}} of a cage newel staircase, after which it is named, is that each of its <b>newel</b> <b>posts</b> extends throughout the full height of the staircase, the four posts and the banisters thus forming a stairwell which is not fully enclosed, but, rather, contained within a cage-like structure. In fact, at Staircase House, at some date before the first surviving descriptions of the staircase in nineteenth century, the <b>newel</b> <b>posts</b> were each sawn through, just below the stringer board and just above the handrail. That may have been done {{as a response to}} changing tastes, or possibly to overcome the practical difficulties of moving large objects, such as furniture, about the house.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{doors of the}} house has moulded gothic, or ogival, archways, decorated with fleur-de-lys detailing. The staircase is believed to either be original to the house or an early 17th-century replacement and features decorative balusters and <b>newel</b> <b>posts</b> with acorn-shaped caps.|$|R

All the fireplaces have been replaced with fireplaces of the period however and the <b>newel</b> <b>post</b> replaced with a similar period piece. The woodwork throughout the house is painted and is of a very robust and exuberant style, which is typical of Italianate homes of this period.|$|E
