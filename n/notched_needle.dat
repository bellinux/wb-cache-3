40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of needle tip design on the irrigant flow inside a prepared root canal during final irrigation with a syringe using a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. Methods A CFD model was created to simulate the irrigant flow inside a prepared root canal. Six different types of 30 -G needles, three open-ended needles and three close-ended needles, were tested. Using this CFD model, the irrigant flow in the apical root canal was calculated and visualized. As a result, the streaming velocity, the apical pressure, and the shear stress on the root canal wall were evaluated. Results The open-ended needles created a jet toward the apex and maximum irrigant replacement. Within this group, the <b>notched</b> <b>needle</b> appeared less efficient in terms of irrigant replacement than the other two types. Within the close-ended group, the side-vented and double side-vented needle created a series of vortices and a less efficient irrigant replacement; the side-vented needle was slightly more efficient. The multi-vented needle created almost no flow apically to its tip, and wall shear stress was concentrated on a limited area, but the apical pressure was significantly lower than the other types. Conclusions The flow pattern of the open-ended needles was different from the close-ended needles, resulting in more irrigant replacement in front of the open-ended needles but also higher apical pressure...|$|E
5000|$|Needle felting is {{a method}} of {{creating}} felted objects without using water. The special needles used to make 3D sculpture, jewelry, adornments and 2D art have notches along the shaft of the needle that catch fibers and tangle them with other fibers to produce felt. These notches are sometimes erroneously called [...] "barbs", but barbs are protrusion (like barbed wire) {{and that would be}} difficult to thrust in to the wool and nearly impossible to pull out. There are many sizes and types of <b>notched</b> <b>needles</b> for different uses while working. Needle felting is used in industrial processes as well as in individual crafting.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a total hip {{arthroplasty}} infection caused by Ruminococcus gnavus in a 62 -year-old man with ulcerative coli-tis. The bacteriumwas perfectly identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry. CASE REPORT A 62 -year-old man was referred to the orthopedic surgery de-partment of a suburban clinic with suspected prosthetic joint infection (PJI) of the right hip. This patient had undergone total right hip replacement 13 years earlier and had shown no signs of prosthesis dysfunction since surgery. On admission, the patient presented with right hip pain and fever. Biological tests showed elevated white blood cell (18. 3 109 cells/liter) and C-reactive protein (137 mg/liter) levels. No blood culture was collected. Radiological evaluation of the total hip arthroplasty showed a 5 -mm subsidence of the femoral stem. Three bone biopsies were performed with a <b>notch</b> <b>needle,</b> and the samples were sent to the microbiology laboratory of the Hôpi-taux Universitaires Paris Ile de France Ouest, Greater Paris, fo...|$|R
5000|$|The Flagstaff fire (also called Bison fire) was {{forest fire}} located {{a few miles}} {{southwest}} {{of the city of}} Boulder in Boulder County. The fire was started by a lightning strike at 1:15 p.m., Mountain Daylight Time, on Tuesday, June 26, 2012, near the intersection of Flagstaff Road and Bison Drive, about three miles south of Flagstaff Mountain. Evacuation was ordered for 26 households in the Pine <b>Needle</b> <b>Notch</b> mountain subdivision. A pre-evacuation order was issued Tuesday evening, June 26, for 2400 households in southwestern Boulder proper. [...] The pre-evacuation order was lifted late the next day, Wednesday, June 27.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{effectiveness}} of different intracanal irrigation techniques in removing intracanal medicaments prior to obturation. A total of 168 single roots were prepared with ProTaper® rotary files and medicament pastes applied (Ledermix®, Odontopaste®, Doxypaste and Pulpdent®), left in for 2 weeks, then removed using filing followed by one of four methods: irrigation with an open-ended <b>notched</b> irrigation <b>needle</b> (Appli-Vac) either at the working length or 5 mm from the canal orifice, or the Max-I-probe or EndoActivator® at the working length. Following the removal of medicaments, the roots were split into two and the internal surfaces photographed, for digital image analysis of the overall percentage of residual medicament. With the exception of canals irrigated 5 mm apical to the root canal orifice, all four irrigation techniques achieved an average of 95 % for removal of Ledermix®, Odontopaste® and Doxypaste. Calcium hydroxide paste {{was the most difficult}} medicament to remove, with no difference between irrigation techniques. Up to 27 % of the Pulpdent® material remained after irrigation. No irrigation technique could completely remove all traces of medicaments. The position of the irrigational needle and the type of medicament used are key factors, which influence the effectiveness of irrigation in removing medicaments...|$|R

30|$|We used a MaxCore System (MC 1416) by BARD Biopsy Systems: {{penetration}} depth 22  mm, length and {{width of the}} original biopsy rift: 19  ×  2.1  mm. In a first step the original <b>needle</b> <b>notch</b> including the rift was cut away which shortened the needle by ca. 22  mm. We then manufactured a positioning frame to keep the needle under tension and mounted it on a fine metal milling machine. Two parallel 19  mm in length rifts were then milled into the needle’s shaft {{in such a way}} that a 100  µm thin sheet remained standing between them. The tip of the needle was then sharpened in the original angle to reconstitute a fully functioning needle. The cutting cylinder, which is running over the needle was adapted to the new needle length and the notch sharpened accordingly. No other modification to the biopsy system were necessary. The modifications were neither initiated by BARD Biopsy Systems nor are they covered by the company’s liability regulations. The modified biopsy system is not certified for in patient use. Prototype testing has been performed with ex vivo radical prostatectomy samples within this research project approved by our local ethics committee (328 / 15). Samples were biopsied within 15  min after resection. The patient gave written consent prior to the procedure.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this work}} were to image and analyze the needle {{behavior}} at automated core biopsy, to investigate the clinical utility of an alternative core biopsy technique using a semiautomated gun in breast and axillary lesions, and also to compare core biopsy with surgical specimens in malignant breast lesions regarding histologic features and hormone receptor expression. In two experimental studies, using butter and silicon phantoms, respectively, the needle pass was imaged and its dynamic behavior studied. It was shown that the needle took a curved course in phantoms. It deviated to the same side as where the tip lay, {{and the degree of}} the curvature increased with increasing hardness of the phantoms. Our experimental methods can be applied for imaging of needle behavior and thereby improvement of needle configuration. In two clinical studies, a semiautomated gun was used for large needle core biopsy of breast and axillary lesions in two series of 145 and 21 patients, respectively. The sensitivity of the method for diagnosis of malignancy was 87 % (108 / 124), and in 37 % (31 / 83) of cases the full length of the <b>needle</b> <b>notch</b> was filled with specimen. No injury to the neurovascular structures of the axillary area was observed. It was concluded that the semiautomated gun can be used {{as an alternative to the}} automated gun when the size and location of the lesion render use of the automatic device uncertain or dangerous, e. g., in small breast lesions or lesions located in the axilla. In a series of 129 cases of breast cancer, comparison of core biopsy and surgical specimens showed that core biopsy provided enough information on the histologic type and grade of the lesions. Also, there was moderate to high concordance between the two methods for assessment of progesterone receptors and estrogen receptors (Spearman`s kappa 0. 67 and 0. 89, respectively) ...|$|R
