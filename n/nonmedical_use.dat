40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{discussions of}} the ethics of human gene therapy, it has become {{standard}} to draw {{a distinction between the}} use of human gene transfer tech-niques to treat health problems and their use to enhance or improve normal human traits. Some dispute the normative force of this distinction by arguing that it is undercut by the legitimate medical use of human gene transfer tech-niques to prevent disease- such as genetic engineering to bolster immune func-tion, improve the efficiency of DNA repair, or add cellular receptors to capture and process cholesterol. If disease prevention is a proper goal of medicine, these critics argue, and the use of gene transfer techniques to enhance human health maintenance capacities will help achieve that goal, then the "treatment/enhance-ment " distinction cannot define the limits of legitimate gene therapy. In this paper, I argue that a line can be drawn between prevention and enhancement for gene therapy (and thus between properly medical and <b>nonmedical</b> <b>uses</b> of gene therapy), but only if one is willing to accept two rather old-fashioned claims: 1) Some health problems are best understood as if they were entities in their own right, reifiable as processes or parts in a biological system, with at least as much ontological objectivity and theoretical significance as the functions that they inhibit. 2) Legitimate preventive genetic health care should be limited to efforts to defend people from attack by these more robust pathological entities, rather than changing their bodies to evade social injustices...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundNonmedical {{prescription}} drug use is prevalent among young adults, yet {{little is known about}} modifiable determinants of use. We examined whether maternal-offspring attachment reported at mean age 21 was associated with <b>nonmedical</b> prescription opioid <b>use</b> at mean age 26, and investigated whether a history of depressive symptoms and substance use played a role in associations between maternal-offspring attachment and <b>nonmedical</b> prescription opioid <b>use.</b> MethodsWe used data from the Growing Up Today Study, a longitudinal cohort of United States adolescents followed into young adulthood. Maternal-offspring attachment was reported by young adults and their mothers, and defined as mutual low, mutual medium or high, and dissonant. Analyses were carried out in the full sample using generalized estimating equation models, and in a sibling subsample, using conditional fixed effects models to control for stable aspects of the family environment. ResultsAnalyses with the full sample and the sibling subsample both showed that mutual medium/high maternal-offspring attachment at age 21 was associated with lower odds of <b>nonmedical</b> prescription opioid <b>use</b> at age 26 (RR= 0. 74; 95 % CI= 0. 57 - 0. 97 in full sample). The association was partly mediated by mean age 23 offspring smoking, heavy episodic drinking, and illicit drug use. ConclusionsPromoting reciprocal attachment in the maternal-offspring dyad should be investigated as a strategy to prevent <b>nonmedical</b> prescription opioid <b>use</b> by young adulthood. Even in young adulthood, programs that target both parents and offspring may have greater impact on offspring substance use than programs that target offspring alone.

40|$|Abstract Background Illicit methamphetamine use {{continues}} to be a public health concern in the United States. The goal of the current study was to use a relatively inexpensive methodology to examine the prevalence and demographic correlates of <b>nonmedical</b> methamphetamine <b>use</b> in the United States. Methods The sample was obtained through an internet survey of noninstitutionalized adults (n = 4, 297) aged 18 to 49 in the United States in 2005. Propensity weighting methods using information from the U. S. Census and the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were used to estimate national-level prevalence rates. Results The overall prevalence of current <b>nonmedical</b> methamphetamine <b>use</b> was estimated to be 0. 27 %. Lifetime use was estimated to be 8. 6 %. Current use rates for men (0. 32 %) and women (0. 23 %) did not differ, although men had a higher 3 -year prevalence rate (3. 1 %) than women (1. 1 %). Within the age subgroup with the highest overall methamphetamine use (18 to 25 year olds), non-students had substantially higher methamphetamine use (0. 85 % current; 2. 4 % past year) than students (0. 23 % current; 0. 79 % past year). Methamphetamine use was not constrained to those with publicly funded health care insurance. Conclusion Through the use of an internet panel weighted to reflect U.
