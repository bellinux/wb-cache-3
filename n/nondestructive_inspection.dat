50|$|Selection of {{inspection}} type is, of course, {{largely based on}} the material in question. FPI is a <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> process {{which means that the}} part is not in any way damaged by the test process.

40|$|An {{efficient}} and economical method is proposed to mitigate fatigue and fracture damage of steel infrastructure using information from <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections</b> and maintenance. In spite of {{improvements in the}} design of fatigue-sensitive structures, periodic <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections</b> are still required by the profession to ensure an acceptable level of structural integrity. A linear elastic fracture mechanics-based reliability model is proposed which incorporates uncertainties from many different sources, including uncertainty in the results obtained from the <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections.</b> The model updating technique has been used in this study to obtain the updated information about random variables and underlying reliability index. Furthermore, the updated information on the target reliability {{has been used as a}} decision making tool as what to do next, in terms of whether to do nothing, reschedule the next inspection at an earlier date, or repair or replace the structure immediately. Also, a strategy is proposed for estimating the optimal time interval to the next inspection. Since more than one fatigue sensitive structural detail is expected to be present in a real structure, the method has been extended to consider system reliability problems. The use of system reliability to mitigate fatigue risk management is also explored. The entire procedure has been extended to consider the reliability and maintainability due to the deformation-induced fatigue as well as low cycle fatigue. The potential application of the method is demonstrated with the help of examples of steel highway bridges. It is shown that the proposed method is much superior to the current S-N curve-based AASHTO method and can be used as an alternative...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} drive towards using {{military aircraft}} beyond their initial design life {{has created a}} great interest in damage-tolerance (DT) based maintenance philosophy. The DT approach relies on routine <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections</b> (NDI) and requires the NDI performance to be quantified in terms of probability of detection (POD). From the POD-flaw size relationship, the detection limit of inspection techniques, in terms of flaw size, is established and then used to calculate safe inspection interval [1]...|$|R

However, the major drawbacks of the current techniques are the lack of in situ and distributed sensing [6, 8, 9, 10].

This non-contact, single-sided terahertz electromagnetic measurement and imaging method characterizes micro-structure and thickness variation in dielectric (insulating) materials. This method was demonstrated for the Space Shuttle external tank sprayed-on foam insulation {{and has been}} designed for use as an inspection method for current and future NASA thermal protection systems and other dielectric material inspection applications where no contact {{can be made with}} the sample due to fragility and it is impractical to use ultrasonic methods.|$|E
50|$|Nondestructive testing or {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT) {{is a wide}} group of analysis techniques used {{in science and technology}} industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.The terms nondestructive examination (NDE), <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, and visual testing. NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art.

50|$|NRL has a {{long history}} of {{contributions}} to materials science, dating back to the use of Industrial radiography with gamma rays for the <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> of metal casings and welds on Navy vessels beginning in the 1920s. Modern mechanical fracture mechanics were pioneered at NRL and were subsequently applied to solve fracture problems in Navy vessels, commercial aircraft and Polaris missiles. That knowledge is in widespread use today in applications ranging from design of nuclear reactors to aircraft, submarines and toxic material storage tanks. NRL developed the synthesis of high-purity GaAs crystals used in a myriad of modern high frequency transceivers including cellular phones, satellite communication systems, commercial and military radar systems including those aboard all US combat aircraft and ARM, Phoenix, AIM-9L and AMRAAM missiles. NRL's GaAs inventions were licensed by Rockwell, Westinghouse, Texas Instruments and Hughes Research. High-purity GaAs is also used for high-efficiency solar cells like those aboard NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers currently on Mars.|$|E

It has proved to be effective in <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> of layers in paints and coatings, detecting structural defects in ceramic and composite materials and imaging the physical structure of paintings and manuscripts. The use of THz waves for non-destructive evaluation enables inspection of multi-layered structures and can identify abnormalities from foreign material inclusions, disbond and delamination, mechanical impact damage, heat damage, and water or hydraulic fluid ingression. The company's Chief Scientific Director, Sir Michael Pepper, explains that THz imaging can measure thickness across a substrate precisely and it can also obtain the density of the coating: [...] "The radiation is reflected each time there is a change in material. The time of arrival is measured and then various algorithms complete the picture by developing 3D fine feature images and precise material identifications". Further research by the company and active collaboration with the University of Cambridge is aiming to develop a terahertz sensor that {{can be used}} to measure the quality of paint coatings on cars.|$|E

40|$|Maintaining the {{reliability}} of components or systems that are subject to degradation failures is an old and challenging problem. The traditional {{way to deal with}} this problem has been to systematically replace parts so that certain reliability, and possibly cost, criteria are satisfied. More recently, new technologies have been developed that allow <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections</b> of increasing precision. Thus, replacements may be based now on observations made at these inspections. In a first model, we consider the important case where degradation and failure result from the growth of a crack that has developed within the component of interest, this growth being assumed deterministic. A probabilistic model is presented for the fatigue reliability and cost analysis of such components subject to periodic <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections.</b> Some figures of merit considered include the hazard function, an approximation of the cost per unit of service time, and the mean time between failures. A numerical example is given that focuses on the effect of inspections on the hazard function. This model is then extended in order both to handle the possible stochasticity of different parameters, and to allow the dynamic scheduling of inspections from observations. The model is not restricted to the crack growth type degradation. Finally, a computer code with an interface between the Fortran and S-plus languages is developed so that important quantities like the probabilities of failure, of replacements, or the hazard function are calculated in the case where the degradation law parameters are random. The code also provides graphs for the failure time density and the hazard function. Thus, for these functions, the effect of modifying model inputs may be appreciated both numerically and graphically. Numerical examples are given for two crack growth degradation cases, where the growth obeys Paris Law...|$|R

A feasibility study was performed on a dummy wafer with various sizes of TSVs to evaluate this method. From the image reconstruction of B-scan SAM, the depth of TSVs can be clearly identified. In addition, cross-section inspections were performed to verify this <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> method. It was found that, for TSV sizes larger than φ 30 μm, the depth measured by the ultrasonic scanning method could be {{very close to the}} results of cross-section inspection (less than 5 % error).

40|$|Development and {{application}} of linear array imaging technologies to address specific aging-aircraft inspection issues is described. Real-time video-taped images were obtained from an unmodified commercial linear-array medical scanner of specimens constructed to simulate typical types of flaws encountered in the inspection of aircraft structures. Results suggest that information regarding the characteristics, location, and interface properties of specific types of flaws in materials and structures may {{be obtained from the}} images acquired with a linear array. Furthermore, linear array imaging may offer the advantage of being able to compare 'good' regions with 'flawed' regions simultaneously, and in real time. Real-time imaging permits the inspector to obtain image information from various views and provides the opportunity for observing the effects of introducing specific interventions. Observation of an image in real-time can offer the operator the ability to 'interact' with the inspection process, thus providing new capabilities, and perhaps, new approaches to <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Drilling {{of carbon}} fibre {{reinforced}} plates – CFRP – causes typical damages such as delamination and others. These damages, that cannot be visually detected, {{can cause the}} premature collapse of structures. Damage assessment is usually carried out using <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections</b> like radiography and ultrasonic C-scan. Damage extent can be evaluated {{by the use of}} damage criteria. One of them – delamination factor – was proposed by Chen, establishing a ratio between the maximum damaged diameter and the hole nominal diameter. Another one – damage ratio – was presented by Mehta comparing the damaged area with the hole average area. Both ratios allow for comparison between different drilling conditions. In this paper the images obtained are processed and analyzed using standard techniques from Computational Vision together with a processing platform already developed.

40|$|<b>Nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> (NDI) {{is often}} the primary basis for {{establishing}} the initial flaw size that is {{used as the basis}} safe life analysis of components, structures and systems. It is often desirable to use a small initial flaw size for purposes of fatigue and fracture analysis, thus the capability of applied the <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> procedure often becomes a primary design constraint. The introduction of fracture mechanics analysis in design applications has established requirements to quantify the capabilities of applied <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspection</b> procedures for purposes of determining the “largest flaw that might be missed”. That flaw size, in turn, becomes the starting point for fracture mechanics analysis and for crack growth in fatigue life analyses. It is clearly desirable to start with a very small flaw size. In recent years, considerable effort has been expended in both meeting “attainable” flaw requirements and in improving NDI procedures capabilities to detect smaller flaws. Such efforts have identified uncertainties in fracture mechanics analysis procedures in predicting the behavior of small flaws and have greatly increased the complexity and sophistication of NDI procedures being applied...|$|E

When the Test Director commanded a should pitch maneuver to lift the arm from its payload bay pedestal, the yaw controls failed. This, coupled with a gravitational forces (due to the angle of the shoulder joint with respect to vertical), resulted in uncontrolled arm motion. The shoulder yaw joint moved approximately 20 degrees, causing the extended arm to strike and severely damage the port side MDF catwalk handrails.

40|$|<b>Nondestructive</b> <b>inspections</b> {{currently}} play, {{and will}} continue to play, a critical role in the manufacturing of composite materials by identifying parts that pass/fail quality targets {{at the end of the}} production line. However, there is an urgent need for a paradigm shift to enable high volume composite manufacturing by supplementing end-of-line NDE tools with in-line NDE technologies to inform process decision making. This new approach has the potential to significantly reduce scrap and increase throughput while reducing part variation. The key to in- line NDE is to harness process dynamics by exploiting measurement signatures for diagnosing changes in the material state including deviations or flaws in the material. This talk will discuss case studies in which process signatures in the manufacture of composites are monitored for the purpose of in-line NDE to inform the process. Case studies will focus on carbon fiber manufacturing whereby NDE is used during the process to identify tow form and flaws including broken filaments...|$|R
40|$|For most <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections,</b> {{quantitative}} evaluations have to {{be performed}} to correlate the measured signals and the desired material properties. In some applications, the relationship between the signals and the material parameters is simple and straightforward. An analytic mathematical function can be easily constructed and solved to describe the interaction. The inverse function also can be readily determined to transform the measured data into the desired information. In some cases, such as defect characterizations, the interaction between the sensing field and the test object is often too complicated for such an approach. Advanced signal analysis techniques with complex assumptions, approximations, and computations are required to interpret the signals. Such an intricate approach is frequently time consuming and beyond general comprehension. Alternative methods that enable the direct correlation of the signals with the test piece are being sought. Imaging techniques which provide a unique capability of correlating NDE signals with component geometry, are gaining in popularity...|$|R

Compared to conventional wire-wound pick-up coil based eddy current NDI methods, Giant Magneto-resistive (GMR) sensor based eddy current methods have shown a much better sensitivity (20 – 50 times) for a given driving current and frequency. In addition to the higher sensitivity of the GMR sensors, {{it has been shown}} that the interpretation of GMR sensor detected signals is much less complicated than the conventional eddy current signals that are normally displayed on an impedance plane. Unlike wire-wound pick up coils, solid-state GMR sensors detect magnetic fields directly, where the magnitudes of magnetic fields are displayed in terms of voltage. Flaw signals detected with GMR sensors (voltage and distance) are similar to flaw signals detected with ultrasonic transducers (voltage and time).

40|$|Harsh {{environments and}} {{confined}} spaces require that <b>nondestructive</b> <b>inspections</b> be conducted with robotic systems. Ultrasonic guided waves are {{well suited for}} robotic systems because they can provide efficient volumetric coverage when inspecting for various types of damage, including cracks and corrosion. Shear horizontal guided waves are especially well suited for robotic inspection because they are sensitive to cracks oriented perpendicular or parallel to the wave propagation direction and can be generated with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) and magnetostrictive transducers (MSTs). Both types of transducers are investigated for crack detection in a stainless steel plate. The MSTs require the robot to apply a compressive normal force that creates frictional force coupling. However, the coupling is observed to be very dependent upon surface roughness and surface debris.
