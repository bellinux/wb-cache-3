25|$|During 1981 and 1982, Webb {{recorded}} {{her next}} album, I'm <b>Not</b> <b>That</b> <b>Kind</b> of Girl, which was eventually released in 1983. Although {{not based on}} a musical, the album had a running story concerning {{a woman who is}} reunited with a former lover. The album culminates with her on the way to their wedding. The songs were composed by David Hentschel and Don Black and were very much in a contemporary pop vein. Phil Collins played drums on the album and Kiki Dee contributed backing vocals. Despite the album's strong pedigree in terms of personnel, it failed to chart and was Webb's final album on the Polydor label.|$|E

I'm <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of Indian." [...] Track released the album in the UK on December 1, 1967, where it peaked at number five, spending 16 weeks on the charts.

He's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of guy at all. He's a very liberal parent for the 1900s." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{warned of}} {{potential}} domination by a Stalin dictatorship over part of Europe, Roosevelt {{responded with a}} statement summarizing his rationale for relations with Stalin: [...] "I just have a hunch that Stalin is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a man[...] [...] [...] I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work {{with me for a}} world of democracy and peace." [...] While meeting with Stalin and Roosevelt in Tehran in 1943, Churchill stated that Britain was vitally interested in restoring Poland as an independent country. Britain did not press the matter for fear that it would become a source of inter-allied friction.|$|E
