500|$|The Master Chief has {{appeared}} or has been referenced {{several times in}} non-canon media. He is mentioned several times in Rooster Teeth Productions' Halo-based machinima parody series Red vs. Blue. In the first episode of the series, Grif, talking to teammate , says, [...] "I signed up to fight some aliens. <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know, Master Chief blows up the whole Covenant Armada, and I'm {{stuck in the middle}} of nowhere, fighting [...]" [...] In the Halo Zune exclusive video titled [...] "Turn On, Tune In, Zune Out", Doc has a segment on his radio broadcast called [...] "You're not Master Chief, and that's okay". Team Ninja approached Bungie Studios and asked to use the Master Chief in their 2006 video game Dead or Alive 4. Although the Chief could not be used due to storyline restrictions, Bungie's interest in the idea resulted in the development of Nicole (Spartan-458).|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E

500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with New York magazine, Hersh regretted that [...] "I actually didn't quite say what I {{wanted to say}} correctly. ...

And I just realized then, the power of—and so you have to try and be more careful."

2500|$|When he was 16, {{and still}} in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish {{children}} in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then {{became aware of the}} possibility of writing his own songs. [...] "And the <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> got a guitar {{when we got back to}} Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs," [...] he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the [...] "first real interest" [...] he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful [...] "frustrations".|$|E
2500|$|Jordan's script {{called for}} a group of five con artists or [...] "grifters", {{with a wide range of}} ages, {{appearances}} and experience. [...] The production team cast Adrian Lester, at the time playing Henry V at the National Theatre, as Michael Stone, the leader of the group; Marc Warren as Danny Blue, Stone's younger protégé; and Robert Glenister as Ash Morgan, the [...] "fixer"; in August 2003. Although having numerous credits in film and on the stage, Lester was an unknown face in television, having had less than two hours' broadcast screen time prior to the first Hustle series. Lester explained that he [...] "couldn't imagine playing the same character for years, but Hustle was completely different. In the very first rehearsal we were doing a dance routine and then the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know I'm whacking out several different accents and I just thought, 'I'm in heaven, this is great!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{when the}} time came for the steamer to start, the young man said to Toby: [...] "Now, my boy, you won't feel hard at me for {{shooting}} the monkey, will you?

60|$|And {{with that}} he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They spoke {{together}} for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't go home, to be {{laughed at}} by Chris and Abner. I'll shoot something, if I stay all night. Who cares for hunger and {{mosquito}} bites? Not I.

A pretty hard prospect, either way." ...|$|R
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

On one occasion the jeep ahead hit a mine... <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: You get used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eden Riegel {{was cast}} in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian {{daughter}} of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show. [...] "I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could," [...] she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. [...] " [...] <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time {{it was the fact that}} they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun. [...] "It means so much [...] because it shows how committed AMC is to this pairing," [...] Riegel said in an interview with Soap Opera Weekly. [...] "We're going to have some serious stuff to play- they aren't going to waste her talents." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{is dealing}} with the Champions League. Targets of this work are to summarize the history of the Champions League and to describe its structure. <b>Next</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> explore are factors which lead to success in the Champions League and what prestige has the Champions League between people. The first part of the work is dedicated to the structure of the competition. In the next part is included European Champion Club's Cup, the predecessor of the Champions League. In the next part I summarize every single season of the Champions League. Then I explored whether favorites are successful in the event, whether the richest clubs tend to win the Champions League more likely, whether it is better to play either offensively or defensively, I explore whether there is an increase or a decrease of scored goals and whether winners of the Champions League are successful in their national league. I also give an outcome of questionnaire focus on popularity of the Champions League between people...|$|R
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> {{remember}} is {{the coming of}} the men of Agger. This cannot have been very long after Steinar went to Lesso, for he had not yet returned. Being still weak from my great illness, I was seated in the sun in the shelter of the house, wrapped up in a cloak of deerskins--for the northern wind blew bitter. By me stood my father, who was in a happy mood now he knew that I should live and be strong again.|$|R
