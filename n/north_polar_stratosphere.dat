Two specially instrumented NASA aircraft were flown over the Arctic region.

Results confirm the <b>north</b> <b>polar</b> HCN enrichment previously observed using mid-IR data and support the conclusion that Titan's nitrile species are significantly more enriched than hydrocarbons species with similar predicted photochemical lifetimes. This suggests Titan's photochemical cycle includes an additional sink for nitrogen bearing species. The abundance of CO was also determined, and had a mean value of 55 +/- 6 ppm at 20 mbar.

40|$|The {{water vapor}} of the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> {{possibly}} {{plays an important}} role in various aeronomical processes; for example, OH radical formation through photodissociation of H 2 O, formation of water cluster ions, radiative energy transfer in the lower stratosphere, condensation onto particulate matter, and so on. In addition to these, it has been speculated, from the viewpoint of global transport and/or budget of water vapor, that the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> functions as an active sink. STANFORD (1973) emphasized the existence of the stratospheric Cist cloud in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> which brought a large loss rate of stratospheric water vapor through a so-called freeze-out of cloud particles from the stratosphere into the troposphere. However, these geophysically interesting problems unfortunately remain to be solved, owing to the lack of measurements on water vapor distribution and its temporal variation in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The water vapor content measured at Syowa Station (69. 00 deg S, 39. 35 deg E), Antarctica using a balloon-borne hygrometer (Lyman - alpha/OH fluorescence type) is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change in}} the Southern Hemisphere (SH) <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is {{associated}} with substantial changes in the atmospheric circulation that extend to the earth's surface. The mechanisms that drive {{the changes in the}} SH troposphere are not fully understood, but most previous hypotheses have focused on the role of atmospheric dynamics rather than that of radiation. This study quantifies the radiative response of temperatures in the SH polar troposphere to the forcing from long-term temperature and ozone trends in the SH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> A novel methodology is employed that explicitly neglects changes in tropospheric dynamics and hence isolates the component of the tropospheric temperature response that is radiatively driven by the overlying stratospheric trends. The results reveal that both the amplitude and seasonality of the observed cooling of the middle and upper SH polar troposphere {{over the past few decades}} are consistent with a reduction in downwelling longwave radiation induced by cooling in the SH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The results are compared with analogous calculations for trends in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Both the observations and radiative calculations imply that the comparatively weak trends in the NH <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> have not played a central role in driving NH tropospheric climate change. Overall, the results suggest that radiative processes play a key role in coupling the large trends in SH polar stratospheric temperatures to tropospheric levels. The tropospheric radiative temperature response documented here could be important for triggering the changes in internal tropospheric dynamics associated with stratosphere-troposphere coupling...|$|R

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the 11 year solar cycle on the Northern Hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> have been analyzed in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 3 {{in the absence}} of the quasi-biennial oscillation. The polar response to ENSO agrees with previous studies during solar minimum; composites of warm minus cold ENSO events show a warmer <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and a weaker polar vortex, propagating downward as the winter evolves. During solar maximum conditions, little downward propagation of the ENSO signal is simulated, leading to colder temperatures and stronger winds in the <b>polar</b> lower <b>stratosphere.</b> The analysis of the Eliassen-Palm flux and wave index of refraction shows that this is mainly due to a reduction of upward propagating extratropical planetary wave number 1 component caused by changes in the background winds in the subtropics related to a warmer tropical upper stratosphere during solar maximum. The effect of the 11 year solar cycle variability on the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is not significant during cold ENSO events until February. During warm ENSO events, a statistically significant colder <b>polar</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> and stronger <b>polar</b> vortex are simulated throughout the winter, and no downward propagation of this signal occurs. This is mainly due to the combined effects of solar maximum and warm ENSO conditions on the wave mean flow interaction. These results show a nonlinear behavior of the extratropical stratosphere response to the combination of the two forcings and highlight the need to stratify with respect to ENSO and solar conditions and analyze the seasonal march throughout the winter...|$|R

In recent years chemical ozone loss has also been found in the arctic stratosphere. Transient events like the presence of volcanic aerosols can additionally remove ozone in the lower <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Balloon-borne ozone observations and sun photometer measurements performed in the Antarctic and Arctic as well as satellite data are used to review interannual and seasonal changes in the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> For the arctic region tropospheric ozone and aerosol variations are briefly discussed.

30|$|A sudden stratospheric {{warming is}} a {{large-scale}} {{disruption of the}} wind and temperature fields of the wintertime <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> SSW are usually classified as major or minor, although a continuum of warmings states may occur (Coughlin and Gray 2009). A major SSW is one in which the zonal-mean eastward winds around the pole cap temporarily reverse to summer-like conditions and the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> warms so the NS temperature gradient is reversed from the normal wintertime situation. A minor warming is conventionally defined as one in which the temperature gradient reverses but the winds do not. Major SSW are primarily a northern hemisphere phenomena and occur approximately once or twice each winter. Only one major SSW has been observed in the southern hemisphere, in 2002 (e.g Krüger et al. 2005).|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the Arctic <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is {{observed}} to be similar in many respects {{to that of the}} Antarctic <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> where an ozone hole has been identified. Most of the available chlorine (CHl and ClONO 2) was converted by reactions on polar stratospheric clouds to reactive ClO and Cl 2 O 2 thoroughout the Arctic polar vortex before midwinter. Reactive nitrogen was converted to HNO 3, and some, with spatial inhomogeneity, fell out of the stratosphere. These chemical changes ensured characteristic ozone losses of 10 to 15 percent at altitudes inside the polar vortex where polar stratospheric clouds had occurred. These local losses can translate into 5 to 8 percent losses in the vertical column abundance of ozone. As the amount of stratospheric chlorine inevitably increases by 50 percent over the next two decades, ozone losses recognizable as an ozone hole may well appear...|$|R

Some of the observed differences may be due to improper weighting of the ground-based network data, slowly changing planetary wave structure over the fixed station, of small inter-annual changes in meridional transport parameters. There is also some evidence which indicates that the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> at high latitudes may represent an important ozone storage resevoir which tends to compensate for large scale changes observed in the regions outside of the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Possible consequences of this are that the global trends derived from ground based ozone measurements may not be valid and furthermore that the current satellite techniques by themselves may be sufficient.

A layer of mature Mt. Pinatubo aerosols was identified near 21 km and a layer of fresh Cerro Hudson aerosols was identified near 12 km. This altitude separation of the Mt.

Below 15 km, the <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> was subject to episodes of strong wave activity which transported the Cerro Hudson aerosols poleward and, after the middle of September, they became a persistent feature beneath the vortex.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{evolution of}} Saturn's polar atmospheric temperatures and hydrocarbon composition {{is derived from}} a decade of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) 7 - 16 μm thermal infrared spectroscopy. We construct a near-continuous record of atmospheric variability poleward of 60 ^∘ from northern winter/southern summer (2004, L_s= 293 ^∘) through the equinox (2009, L_s= 0 ^∘) to northern spring/southern autumn (2014, L_s= 56 ^∘). The hot tropospheric polar cyclones and the hexagonal shape of the <b>north</b> <b>polar</b> belt are both persistent features throughout the decade of observations. The hexagon vertices rotated westward by ≈ 30 ^∘ longitude between March 2007 and April 2013, confirming {{that they are not}} stationary in the Voyager-defined System III longitude system as previously thought. The extended region of south polar stratospheric emission has cooled dramatically poleward of the sharp temperature gradient near 75 ^∘S, coinciding with a depletion in the abundances of acetylene and ethane, and suggestive of stratospheric upwelling with vertical wind speeds of w≈+ 0. 1 mm/s. This is mirrored by a general warming of the northern <b>polar</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and an enhancement in acetylene and ethane abundances that appears to be most intense poleward of 75 ^∘N, suggesting subsidence at w≈- 0. 15 mm/s. However, the sharp gradient in stratospheric emission expected to form near 75 ^∘N by northern summer solstice (2017, L_s= 90 ^∘) has not yet been observed, so we continue to await the development of a northern summer stratospheric vortex. <b>North</b> <b>polar</b> minima in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were detected in 2008 - 2010 (lagging one season, or 6 - 8 years, behind winter solstice); south polar maxima appear to have occurred {{before the start of the}} Cassini observations (1 - 2 years after summer solstice).

Since the mid- 1980 s, rapid chemical ozone loss has been recorded in the lower Antarctic stratosphere during the spring season. Using coordinated ozone soundings in some Arctic winters, similar chemical ozone loss rates have been detected related to periods of low temperatures. The currently observed cooling trend of the stratosphere, potentially caused by the increase of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, may further strengthen chemical ozone removal in the Arctic. However, the role of internal climate oscillations in observed temperature trends is still uncertain.
