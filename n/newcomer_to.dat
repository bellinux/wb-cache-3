5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} {{with one}} of his planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over a proposed landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt that this would be too risky. While Fellers was a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E

5|$|Heath, {{who had not}} {{previously}} {{been a member of}} the U.S. national team, won the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events at the 1984 U.S. Olympic trials, and thereby qualified to compete in the two Olympic individual events and for the U.S. relay teams. As a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. trials, he made a dramatic statement by setting a new American record in the preliminary heats of the 200-meter freestyle. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he won three gold medals and a silver.|$|E
5|$|Razor Ramon and Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.) began feuding {{prior to}} SummerSlam 1993 {{because of an}} angle in which Money Inc.

5|$|The Massachusetts popular party gained {{ground in}} the May 1766 elections. Adams was re-elected to the House and {{selected}} as its clerk, in which position {{he was responsible for}} official House papers. In the coming years, Adams used his position as clerk to great effect in promoting his political message. Joining Adams in the House was John Hancock, a new representative from Boston. Hancock was a wealthy merchant—perhaps the richest man in Massachusetts—but a relative <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> politics. He was initially a protégé of Adams, and he used his wealth to promote the Whig cause.|$|E
5|$|With Vikram cast in {{the title}} role, Saran was searching for a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> play the female lead role of a Marwari woman. Kiran Rathod {{is a native of}} Rajasthan, the place where the Marwaris {{originate}} from. She is a relative of actress Raveena Tandon, whose manager brought Rathod the offer to act in Gemini. Saran was convinced after seeing a photograph of Rathod and cast her; Gemini thus became her debut Tamil film. Malayalam actors Kalabhavan Mani and Murali were approached to play significant roles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> the Castro District, Milk {{had shown}} {{leadership}} in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-and-white}} film starred Rd Soekarno, Oedjang, Boen Sofiati, and Soehaena; it {{also featured}} Ratna Djoewita, Ratnasih, Gamari Fadjar, and Moesa. Oedjang had acted for Union since its first film, Kedok Ketawa (The Laughing Mask; 1940), while Soekarno and Soehaena {{had made their}} debuts in Soeara Berbisa. Sofiati, a stage actress who operated her own troupe, was a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> cinema. This cast was of various socio-economic backgrounds, including noblemen and stage actors. Although Union stated that the film was made along realist lines and aimed at educated viewers, owing to the inclusion of stage actors– people who usually entertained lower class audiences– the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that this was untrue.|$|E
5|$|A <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> the Carter {{administration}} and to national politics, Goldschmidt traded {{not only on}} his experience in transportation planning, but on his political acumen as well; following Carter's unsuccessful bid for re-election, Goldschmidt expressed doubts about the Democratic Party's future if it couldn't learn to cultivate political allies more effectively. Goldschmidt's time in Washington, DC, informed his own understanding of politics, as well. He remained in office through {{the remainder of the}} Carter administration. In late 1979, Republican presidential hopeful John B. Anderson called for Goldschmidt's resignation, and members of the United States Senate Banking Committee later chastised him, for having suggested that he would withhold transportation funds from municipalities, such as Chicago and Philadelphia, whose mayors supported Ted Kennedy in his primary election bid against Carter. Goldschmidt resigned at the conclusion of Carter's term on January 20, 1981.|$|E

5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
5|$|BS Fire Emblem: Archanea Senki-hen, {{commonly}} referred to as BS Fire Emblem, is an episodic tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and released in 1997 following the release of Genealogy of the Holy War. It acts as a prequel to the events of the first Fire Emblem title and Mystery of the Emblem. The four episodes of BS Fire Emblem were broadcast between September and October 1997 on the Satellaview peripheral service, a system where short games were downloaded via satellite at given times of day. While it employs the same tactical gameplay as the mainline titles, it throws waves of enemies at the main party during a three-hour time limit. BS Fire Emblem was directed and designed by Kaga, while the music was composed by Tsujiyoko in her role as composer and sound director. The character artwork was done by Rika Suzuki, a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> the Fire Emblem series who would later go on to create character illustrations for Fire Emblem Awakening. It was the first title in the Fire Emblem series to include voice acting, created using livestreaming during the original broadcast. The game used the technology created for Mystery of the Emblem.|$|E

5|$|More than 30 actresses were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, and Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar on the same day. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the River Kwai. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the colorful Sheik Ilderim. The role of Jesus was played by Claude Heater (uncredited), an American opera singer performing with the Vienna State Opera in Rome when he was asked to do a screen test for the film.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E

Gin, John DiMaggio as Uka Uka, Chris Williams as Crunch and Amy Gross as Nina Cortex. The role of Doctor Nitrus Brio is played by Maurice LaMarche, a <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> the series.
