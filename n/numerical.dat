5|$|To be able {{to choose}} the more {{appropriate}} algorithm for each specific problem, it is important to determine both the effectiveness and precision of all the available algorithms. The domain studying these matters is called <b>numerical</b> linear algebra.

25|$|In <b>numerical</b> analysis, <b>numerical</b> {{integration}} {{constitutes a}} broad family of algorithms for calculating the <b>numerical</b> {{value of a}} definite integral, and by extension, the term is also sometimes {{used to describe the}} <b>numerical</b> solution of differential equations. This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term <b>numerical</b> quadrature (often abbreviated to quadrature) is more or less a synonym for <b>numerical</b> integration, especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to <b>numerical</b> integration over more than one dimension as cubature; others take quadrature to include higher-dimensional integration.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Numerical</b> Stroop effect {{demonstrates}} the {{close relationship between}} <b>numerical</b> values and physical sizes. Digits symbolize <b>numerical</b> values {{but they also have}} physical sizes. A digit can be presented as big or small (e.g., 5 vs. 5), irrespective of its <b>numerical</b> value. Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., 3 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., 5 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the <b>numerical</b> Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant <b>numerical</b> values on physical comparisons (similar to the effect of irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that <b>numerical</b> values are processed automatically (i.e., even when they are irrelevant to the task).|$|E

25|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{is commonly used}} to obtain the flow field with shock waves. Though shock waves are sharp discontinuities, in <b>numerical</b> solutions of fluid flow with discontinuities (shock wave, contact discontinuity or slip line), the shock wave can be smoothed out by low-order <b>numerical</b> method (due to <b>numerical</b> dissipation) or there are spurious oscillations near shock surface by high-order <b>numerical</b> method (due to Gibbs phenomena).|$|E

Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{classical}} <b>numerical</b> analysis {{can not be}} transferred one-to-one into interval-valued algorithms, as dependencies between <b>numerical</b> values are usually not taken into account.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} finite differences is in <b>numerical</b> analysis, especially in <b>numerical</b> differential equations, which {{aim at the}} <b>numerical</b> solution of ordinary and partial differential equations respectively. The idea is to replace the derivatives appearing in the differential equation by finite differences that approximate them. The resulting methods are called finite difference methods.|$|E
25|$|The root {{language}} of a <b>numerical</b> prefix {{need not be}} related to the root {{language of}} the word that it prefixes. Some words comprising <b>numerical</b> prefixes are hybrid words.|$|E
25|$|<b>Numerical</b> {{analysis}} continues {{this long}} tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the Babylonian approximation of the square root of 2, modern <b>numerical</b> analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of <b>numerical</b> analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.|$|E

Maintenance of <b>numerical</b> addresses, called the Assigned Numbers List, was handled by Jon Postel at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI.|$|E
25|$|Usually the Cartesian {{coordinate}} system {{is applied to}} manipulate equations for planes, straight lines, and squares, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the Euclidean plane (two dimensions) and Euclidean space (three dimensions). As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in a <b>numerical</b> way and extracting <b>numerical</b> information from shapes' <b>numerical</b> definitions and representations. The <b>numerical</b> output, however, might also be a vector or a shape. That the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the Cantor–Dedekind axiom.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between digital and <b>numerical</b> protection relay rests on points of fine technical detail, and is rarely found in areas other than Protection. <b>Numerical</b> relays {{are the product}} of the advances in technology from digital relays. Generally, there are several different types of <b>numerical</b> protection relays. Each type, however, shares a similar architecture, thus enabling designers to build an entire system solution that is based on {{a relatively small number of}} flexible components. They use high speed processors executing appropriate algorithms. Most <b>numerical</b> relays are also multifunctional and have multiple setting groups each often with tens or hundreds of settings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Numerical</b> prefixes are not {{restricted}} to denoting integers. Some of the SI prefixes denote negative powers of 10, i.e. division by a multiple of 10 rather than multiplication by it. Several common-use <b>numerical</b> prefixes denote vulgar fractions.|$|E

The majority of statistical computer packages contain facilities for regression analysis that make use of linear least squares computations.
