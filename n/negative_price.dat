For more typical slow grid-level electricity storage, we numerically establish that ignoring <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> could result in a considerable loss of value when <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> occur more than 5 % of the time. <b>Negative</b> <b>prices</b> raise another possibility: rather than storing surpluses, a merchant might buy negatively priced electricity surpluses and dispose of them, e. g., using load banks. We find that the value of such disposal strategy is substantial, e. g., about 118 $/kW-year when <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> occur 10 % of the time, but smaller than that of the storage strategy, e. g., about 391 $/kW-year using a typical battery.

5000|$|In {{virtually}} all power systems electricity {{is produced by}} generators that are dispatched in merit order, i.e., generators with the lowest marginal cost (lowest variable cost of production) are used first, followed by the next cheapest, etc., until the instantaneous electricity demand is satisfied. In most power systems the wholesale price of electricity will be equal to the marginal cost of the highest cost generator that is injecting energy, which will vary {{with the level of}} demand. Thus the variation in pricing can be significant: for example, in Ontario between August and September 2006, wholesale prices (in Canadian Dollars) paid to producers ranged from a peak of $318 per MW·h to a minimum of - (negative) $3.10 per MW·h. [...] It is not unusual for the price to vary by a factor of two to five due to the daily demand cycle. A <b>negative</b> <b>price</b> indicates that producers were being charged to provide electricity to the grid (and consumers paying real-time pricing may have actually received a rebate for consuming electricity during this period). This generally occurs at night when demand falls to a level where all generators are operating at their minimum output levels and some of them must be shut down. The <b>negative</b> <b>price</b> is the inducement to bring about these shutdowns in a least-cost manner.|$|E

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{industry is}} currently considering co-locating wind generation and electricity storage facilities. This configuration would allow wind-farms to: (i) store wind generation that exceeds transmission capacity; (ii) time-shift sales of generated power to periods of more favorable prices (i. e., from night to day); and (iii) buy {{power from the}} market for future resale. We model this problem [...] - managing a wind-storage system with limited transmission capacity and the option of buying from the market [...] - as a finite-horizon Markov decision process that assumes uncertain wind and stochastic prices that can be negative, {{and apply it to}} wind and price models calibrated to data. Past literature on wind-storage systems either assumes deterministic wind and price dynamics, based on a single joint historical path, or neglects some relevant market or operational features, such as <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> (a unique feature of the electricity markets) or the buying option. We find that storage can significantly increase the value of wind generators (typically by more than 30 %), but using a deterministic sample path approach could misvalue storage by ± 50 %. Likewise, ignoring <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> could be detrimental when <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> occur at least 5 % of the time (with a loss of about 5 %), and omitting the buying option could result in a much larger loss of value (of about 17 % when <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> occur 5 % of the time), an observation for which we provide theoretical support. We also find that known static threshold heuristic policies can be more than 30 % suboptimal, while a state-dependent multi-threshold heuristic policy that we develop is near optimal (being less than 0. 05 % suboptimal for many scenarios), even when <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> are prevalent...|$|R

You know that your opponent will be able to choose either to buy such a promise from you at the price you have set, or require you to buy such a promise from your opponent, still at the same price. In other words: you set the odds, but your opponent decides which side of the bet will be yours.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{occurrence}} of <b>negative</b> electricity <b>prices</b> on the German day-ahead spot market for the years 2008 and 2009.

By elaborating the actual volumes of renewable electricity that are traded on the spot market, a marginally better correlation can be achieved. Limited transparency in this field makes this type of market-oriented analysis difficult. We also find that the <b>negative</b> spot market <b>prices</b> cause higher capacity <b>prices</b> in the <b>negative</b> minute reserve market.

40|$|The {{concurrent}} {{deregulation of}} the German power market and increased percentage of electricity generated using intermittent renewables {{have resulted in the}} occurrence of significantly <b>negative</b> wholesale power <b>prices</b> and increased overall price volatility. Many studies of methods to curb price volatility suggest that dynamic pricing may be part of the answer. However, few studies have analyzed the resulting consumer price response behavior in the context of intermittent renewables and the subsequent <b>negative</b> <b>prices</b> that have become more common as the use of renewables has increased. This study serves as a preliminary attempt to evaluate the effects of dynamic <b>pricing</b> on <b>negative</b> <b>prices.</b> Using a set of hours from the year 2009, chosen to represent different levels of demand and wind in-feed, and a linear demand curve {{that can be used to}} model demand when <b>prices</b> are <b>negative,</b> I compare <b>price</b> changes resulting from increases in wind in-feed and the implementations of dynamic pricing mechanisms. Using this methodology, I find that without a significant level of consumer prices elasticity, dynamic pricing may not be beneficial and in some cases even harmful to market efficiency. Based on these comparisons, I make recommendations for further research to define policy measures for the successful deployment of demand side management techniques such as dynamic pricing. ...|$|R

To corroborate these results, I also examine whether tunneling actually occurs within one year after the group-earnings announcements. I find that in many cases, resources of low-cash-flow-right firms with relatively good performance are actually transferred to poorly performing firms (mostly, unlisted firms) through purchasing new equity of poorly performing firms. Moreover, the magnitude of <b>negative</b> <b>price</b> reactions at the time of group-earnings announcements is significantly related to the magnitude of resources transferred to poorly performing firms...|$|E

40|$|A typical {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} commodity surpluses is to store them for future sale; in particular, {{this is true of}} electricity. However, because electricity <b>prices</b> can be <b>negative,</b> there exists another potential strategy: To buy and dispose of electricity surpluses at <b>negative</b> <b>prices.</b> It is not clear whether the storage strategy or the disposal strategy is more valuable for a merchant who trades electricity in a market. We investigate this question by modeling the problem of managing an electricity storage facility when prices can be negative: By varying the efficiency of the storage facility, our model encompasses both the case when electricity surpluses are stored and the case when they are destroyed. We establish the optimal policy structure of our model, and show that it subsumes the known optimal commodity storage policy structure when commodity prices are strictly positive. Then, using our optimal policy structure, we compare the storage and disposal strategies based on an existing electricity price model calibrated to historical electricity prices.
