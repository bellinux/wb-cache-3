Elevated levels of CDT suggest recent alcohol abuse, especially if other liver-associated enzymes (such as γGT) are elevated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In HIV-negative populations, light-to-moderate alcohol {{consumption}} {{is associated with}} a lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than alcohol abstention. Whether {{the same holds true for}} HIV-infected individuals has not been evaluated in detail. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Adults on antiretroviral therapy in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study with follow-up after August 2005 were included. We categorized {{alcohol consumption}} into: abstention <b>or</b> very <b>low</b> (< 1 g/d), low (1 - 9 g/d), moderate (10 - 29 g/d in women and 10 - 39 g/d in men), and high alcohol intake. Cox proportional hazards models were used to describe the association between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease-free survival (combined endpoint), cardiovascular disease events (CADE) and overall survival. Baseline and time-updated risk factors for CADE were included in the models. RESULTS: Among 9741 individuals included, there were 788 events of major CADE or death during 46, 719 patient-years of follow-up, corresponding to an incidence of 1. 69 events/ 100 person-years. Follow-up according to alcohol consumption level was 51 % <b>no</b> <b>or</b> very <b>low,</b> 20 % low, 23 % moderate, and 6 % high intake. As compared with <b>no</b> <b>or</b> very <b>low</b> alcohol intake, low (hazard ratio 0. 79, 95 % confidence interval 0. 63 to 0. 98) and moderate alcohol intakes (0. 78, 0. 64 to 0. 95) were associated with a lower incidence of the combined endpoint. There was no significant association between alcohol consumption and CADE. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with <b>no</b> <b>or</b> very <b>low</b> alcohol consumption, low and moderate intake associated with a better CADE-free survival. However, this result was mainly driven by mortality and the specific impact of drinking patterns and type of alcoholic beverage on this outcome remains to be determined...|$|R

50|$|EpCAM has a {{negative}} impact on cadherin-mediated adhesions. Overexpression of EpCAM does not alter the expression level of cadherin but rather decreases the association of the cadherin/ catenin complex in the cytoskeleton. As EpCAM expression increases, the total amount of α-catenin decreases, whereas cellular β-catenin levels remain constant. Active proliferation in a number of epithelial tissues is associated with increased or de novo EpCAM expression. This is especially evident in tissues that normally reveal <b>no</b> <b>or</b> <b>low</b> levels of EpCAM expression, such as squamous epithelium. The level of EpCAM expression correlates with the proliferative activity of intestinal cells, and inversely correlates with their differentiation.|$|E

The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or {{due to a lack of}} sexual desire for the current partner (i.e., situational).

50|$|However, when {{a person}} fails to be aroused in a {{situation}} that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a sexual arousal disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
