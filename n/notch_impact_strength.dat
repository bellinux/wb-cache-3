40|$|During {{laboratory}} tests of machinability {{performed in the}} course of development of new free-cutting alloys, {{it was found that the}} temperature of material being dry machined can reach values as high as 350 °C or more in areas close to cutting tool. During machining it is therefore theoretically possible that in some cases, such as failure of cutting fluid inflow, the temperature of thin wall machined piece may exceed normal temperature considerably. In modern methods of machining using high cutting rates the material may undergo impact loads at elevated temperatures. This type of load can be simulated using the impact bend test, so called Charpy impact test according to European standard EN 10 045 - 1. Unlike common construction AA 6082 alloy, the free machining AA 6262 and AA 6023 aluminium alloys show a significant decrease in <b>notch</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> KU at elevated temperatures. This drop of KU, caused by melting of disperse phases containing low-melting metals, takes place within a certain relatively narrow transition range of temperature.

40|$|Polycarbonate has the {{reputation}} of having a tough breaking behavior, but it is widely unknown that this applies only to special conditions. The <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> of polycarbonate depends on the temperature, thickness (with a tough brittle transition as thickness increases), contribution of <b>notch</b> tip radius, <b>impact</b> speed, physical blowing agent, molecular weight of the polymer, and processing parameters. Research results indicate that microcellular foams produced by injection molding with physical blowing agent (MuCell TM Technology by Trexel) show a significantly higher <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> than compact polycarbonate if the compact material is brittle under the same testing parameters. However, if the compact polycarbonate breaks toughly, the <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> of the foamed material is always lower. Therefore, it is highly important {{to pay attention to}} the testing parameters and conditions when comparing the toughness of the foam with that of the compact material. The toughness of microcellular foams has similar properties like PC/ABS and PC/PP blend systems, which provides the possibility to combine the higher <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> with the advantages of microcellular foaming such as weight reduction, lower shrinkage, shorter cycle times, lower clamp forces, and reduced melt viscosity. In order to use technologies and conditions, which are applied in the polymer industry as well, all materials were produced by an injection molding process. Special processing technologies such as gas counter pressure and precision mold opening were used in order to reach microcellular foam structures with cell diameters around 10 μm. These technologies yield exactly adjustable foam morphologies. Special morphologies are required to improve the <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> of the foamed material. Two different equivalent models were extracted from the analyses, which indicate a significantly higher <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> than the compact material under the same testing conditions.

40|$|To {{obtain a}} balance between {{toughness}} (as measured by <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength)</b> and elastic stiffness of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), {{a small amount of}} tetrafunctional epoxy monomer was incorporated into PBT/ [ethylene/methyl acrylate/glycidyl methacrylate terpolymer (E-MA-GMA) ] blends during the reactive extrusion process. The effectiveness of toughening by E-MA-GMA and the effect of the epoxy monomer were investigated. It was found that E-MA-GMA was finely dispersed in PBT matrix, whose toughness was significantly enhanced, but the stiffness decreased linearly, with increasing E-MA-GMA content. Addition of 0. 2 phr epoxy monomer was noted to further improve the dispersion of E-MA-GMA particles by increasing the viscosity of the PBT matrix. While use of epoxy monomer had little influence on the <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> of the blends, there was a distinct increase in the elastic stiffness.

40|$|Abstract: Compatibilization between polypropylene(PP) and {{wood-flour}} {{was achieved}} by means of direct reactive extrusion of glycidyl methacrylate(GMA), PP, wood-flour, and other additives. Impact cracking surfaces of the PP/wood-flour composites(WPCs) was observed via scanning electron microscope(SEM), and mechanical properties of the WPCs were tested. The effect of comonomer styrene(St) and antioxygen triphenyl phosphite(TPP) on the reactive compatibilization was also evaluated. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} anchoring strength of interface in the composites was obviously strengthened after direct reactive extrusion. The tensile and flexural strength of the WPCs were obviously improved, but the elongation at break and <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> slightly declined after reactive compatibilization by GMA and dicumyl peroxide(DCP). The addition of St and TPP improved the mechanical properties of the WPCs. At 1. 5 % of GMA, 0. 3 % of DCP, 1. 5 % of St and 1 % of TPP in the extrusion composition of WPC, the tensile strength, flexural strength, elongation at break and <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> respectively increased by 39 %, 31 %, 28 % and 29 % comparing to those of the WPC without reactive extrusion...|$|R

Microcellular foams of the composites were prepared by foam injection moulding using nitrogen gas as the blowing agent. The effects of willow-fiber addition on the morphology, mechanical properties, thermal stability, crystallization, and heat deflection temperature (HDT) were studied. At 30 weight percent [wt%] willow-fiber content, unfoamed composites showed good improvement in specific tensile and flexural moduli. Addition of willow-fiber increased crystallinity {{and the rate of}} crystallization and yielded narrow crystallite size distribution as observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results of the foamed composites revealed that increase in willow-fiber content caused smaller average cell size and higher cell density.

To meet this objective, hornbeam wood chips {{were converted to}} kraft pulp at three different alkalinities (15, 20, and 25 %) and three different cooking times (60, 90, and 120 min). The residual lignin contents of these pulps were determined according to the TAPPI standard. Kraft pulp was mixed with polypropylene (PP) at 50 % weight ratios. The amount of maleic anhydride (MAPP) coupling agent was fixed at 4 per hundred compounds (phc) for all formulations.
