50|$|The clubs faced another {{shortfall}} in 2007, after Decree-Law 115/2005 abolished Article 18B; {{they had to}} abolish the amortization fund by 30 June 2007, five years before the original scheduled date. UEFA required all clubs to use IFRS, and the fund was incompatible with the standard. Before 2006, Napoli was bankrupt when its owner refused to increase share capital in 2004 but the club was revived debt-free as a new company by current owner Aurelio De Laurentiis. When Parma was under administration, most of its toxic assets were written off and its balance sheet was transferred to new company Parma FC SpA. A.S.

Using IFRS in the 2006-07 financial year, on 30 June 2006 Roma had a 2005-06 negative <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> of €22,980,335 on the separate balance sheet. The club created a subsidiary, Soccer SAS di Brand Management, revaluing the brand at €125.122 million.

In 2006-07 Lazio also changed to IFRS, with a reclassified negative <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> for the previous season of €25,406,939. The club overcome the shortfall on a separate balance sheet with subsidiary SS Lazio Marketing & Communication, selling its brand to the subsidiary for €104.5 million; this boosted the separate balance sheet but not the consolidated one.

40|$|Capital {{structure}} is a controversial {{issue in the}} field of corporate finance. There are several studies {{to find a way to}} determine the optimal capital structure to minimize the cost of capital and maximize the corporate value. In fact, capital {{structure is}} a combination of firms’ liabilities and capital to meet long term assets. This paper investigates the role of the hierarchical theory in explaining the capital structure of the firms based on enterprise life cycle model on selected firms listed on Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) using three methods of <b>net</b> <b>equities,</b> <b>net</b> liabilities and retained earnings. The study uses Park and Chen’s (2006) method [Park, Y., & Chen, K. H. (2006). The effect of accounting conservatism and life-cycle stages on firm valuation.
