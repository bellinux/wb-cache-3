5000|$|The <b>Non-Access</b> <b>Stratum</b> (NAS) {{protocols}} {{form the}} highest stratum {{of the control}} plane between the user equipment (UE) and MME. NAS protocols support the mobility of the UE and the session management procedures {{to establish and maintain}} IP connectivity between the UE and a PDN GW. They define the rules for a mapping between parameters during inter-system mobility with 3G networks or non-3GPP access networks. They also provide the NAS security by integrity protection and ciphering of NAS signaling messages. EPS provides the subscriber with a [...] "ready-to-use" [...] IP connectivity and an [...] "always-on" [...] experience by linking between mobility management and session management procedures during the UE attach procedure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Non-access</b> <b>stratum</b> (NAS) is a {{functional}} layer in the UMTS and LTE wireless telecom protocol stacks between {{the core network}} and user equipment. This layer is used to manage the establishment of communication sessions and for maintaining continuous communications with the user equipment as it moves. The NAS is defined {{in contrast to the}} Access Stratum which is responsible for carrying information over the wireless portion of the network.A further description of NAS {{is that it is a}} protocol for messages passed between the User Equipment, also known as mobiles, and Core Nodes (e.g. Mobile Switching Center, Serving GPRS Support Node, or Mobility Management Entity) that is passed transparently through the radio network. Examples of NAS messages include Update or Attach messages, Authentication Messages, Service Requests and so forth. Once the User Equipment (UE) establishes a radio connection, the UE uses the radio connection to communicate with the core nodes to coordinate service. The distinction is that the Access Stratum is for dialogue explicitly between the mobile equipment and the radio network and the NAS is for dialogue between the mobile equipment and core network nodes. For LTE, the Technical Standard for NAS is 3GPP TS 24.301. +- - - - - -+ +- - - - - - -+ | HTTP | | Application | +- - - - - -+ +- - - - - - -+ | TCP | | Transport | +- - - - - -+ +- - - - - - -+ | IP | | Internet | +- - - - - -+ +- - - - - - -+ | NAS | | Network | +- - - - - -+ +- - - - - - -+ | AS | | Link | +- - - - - -+ +- - - - - - -+ | Channels | | Physical | +- - - - - -+ +- - - - - - -+ ...|$|E

30|$|In LTE, the RRC {{protocol}} is used {{to transfer}} common (i.e., applicable to all MSs) and dedicated (i.e., applicable to only a specific MS) <b>non-access</b> <b>stratum</b> (NAS) information [27]. The RRC protocol covers a number of functional areas, including the broadcasting of system information, RRC connection control, network controlled mobility procedures, and measurement configuration and reporting. The RRC connection control handles all procedures related to the establishment, modification and termination of an RRC connection, including, among others, the formation of DRBs, radio bearers carrying user data [27].|$|E
40|$|Traditional highly-centralized mobile core {{networks}} (e. g., Evolved Packet Core (EPC)) need to {{be constantly}} upgraded both in their network functions and backhaul links, to meet increasing traffic demands. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is being investigated as a potential cost-effective solution for this upgrade. A virtual mobile core (here, virtual EPC, vEPC) provides deployment flexibility and scalability while reducing costs, network-resource consumption and application delay. Moreover, a distributed deployment of vEPC is essential for emerging paradigms like Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC). In this work, we show that significant reduction in networkresource consumption can be achieved {{as a result of}} optimal placement of vEPC functions in metro area. Further, we show that not all vEPC functions {{need to be}} distributed. In our study, for the first time, we account for vEPC interactions in both data and control planes (<b>Non-Access</b> <b>Stratum</b> (NAS) signaling procedure Service Chains (SCs) with application latency requirements) using a detailed mathematical model...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of packet-switched technologies in mobile communication systems has enabled {{the provision of}} IP-based services to mobile users. Yet, these systems, such as the UMTS network, are unable to meet the stringent delay requirements imposed by the enhanced multimedia services due to the anchor point that introduce into the user's data path. Moreover, such applications will rely on IP-based control protocols for session and mobility management, resulting in duplication of functionality in the network at both the bearer and the application level. For the above reasons, the SAILOR network architecture is presented in this paper, proposing an evolution to the standard UMTS network, where GSNs are integrated into a single entity. Furthermore, the SIP protocol is adopted, for performing mobility and session management procedures currently undertaken by the UMTS <b>Non-Access</b> <b>Stratum</b> protocols. Both modifications to the UMTS network and protocol architecture, result in the smooth evolution of the UMTS core network towards IP as well as accomplish a significant performance gain. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of packet-switched technologies in mobile communication systems has enabled {{the provision of}} IP-based services to mobile users. Yet, these systems, such as the UMTS network, are not flexible enough to allow the extensive deployment of IP-oriented protocols. Furthermore, they {{are not able to}} meet the stringent QoS requirements imposed by the enhanced multimedia services that are expected to be encompassed in future mobile systems. For the aforementioned reasons, an innovative beyond 3 G network architecture denoted as SIPRAN - is presented in this paper, posing an evolution to the standard UMTS network. According to the proposed concept, the GPRS Support Nodes are integrated into a single entity and the Session Initiation Protocol is adopted for performing mobility and session management, currently undertaken by the UMTS <b>Non-Access</b> <b>Stratum</b> protocols. Both modifications to the UNITS network and protocol architecture result in the smooth evolution of the UMTS Core Network towards IP, while accomplishing considerable performance improvement. In order to evaluate the target architecture and substantiate its actual effectiveness, a series-of experiments was carried out, by utilizing a fully functional emulator. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|RRC layer {{specification}} {{is defined}} in TS 36. 331 [1], and for NB-IoT, the RRC layer specifications are slightly {{different from that of}} LTE. In general, RRC connection establishment for LTE and NB-IoT are relatively simple. RRC connection establishment is a 3 -way handshake between UE and eNodeB, which is used to make the transition of UE from RRC Idle mode to RRC Connected mode. UE must make the transition to RRC Connected mode before transferring any application data, or completing any signalling procedures. RRC connection establishment procedure has mainly 3 steps. RRC connection request message sent by UE, RRC connection setup sent by enodeB, RRC setup complete messages send by UE. The RRC connection establishment procedure is always initiated by the UE but can be triggered by either the UE or the network. For example, the UE triggers RRC connection establishment if the end-user starts an application to browse the internet, or to send an email. Similarly, the UE triggers RRC connection establishment if the UE moves into a new Tracking Area and has to complete the Tracking Area Update signalling procedure. The network triggers the RRC connection establishment procedure by sending a Paging message. This could be used to allow the delivery of an incoming SMS or notification of an incoming voice call. The initial <b>Non-Access</b> <b>Stratum</b> (NAS) message is transferred as part of the RRC connection es- tablishment procedure [2] to reduce connection establishment delay. RRC connection establishment configures Signalling Radio Bearer (SRB) 1 and (SRB 1 bis) allows subsequent signalling to use the Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH) rather than the Common Control Channel (CCCH) used by SRB 0...|$|E
