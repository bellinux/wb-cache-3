5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E
5|$|Pius II {{continued}} to support Skanderbeg, {{but did not}} provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg's military skill and his soldiers' aptitude for battle were enough {{to hold back the}} Turkish armies. However, the pope still considered Skanderbeg's assistance essential for his plans for an anti-Ottoman crusade. In 1459, after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia, Ottoman envoys appealed for a three-year armistice between Skanderbeg's Albania and the Ottoman Empire. The sultan's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope's crusade as he believed the crusade's only hope for success was Skanderbeg. In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion, Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal but he had to get the pope's approval. Pius did not allow such an agreement and began to doubt Skanderbeg's loyalty. As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans, Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and pour into Albania. In order to regain the pope's trust, Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace. Skanderbeg, nevertheless, was disappointed by Rome's response and he responded by not participating in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade. The Council ended in failure, signifying that Skanderbeg would receive <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the West. He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged, something which Rome soon allowed.|$|E

Admiral King stayed the course and the US Navy reasserted itself both in the “Battle of the Atlantic” and, with <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the British, {{in a string of}} great victories in the Pacific. The bottom line is if FDR thought Admiral King was incompetent Admiral King would have been fired.|$|E
25|$|At the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix, upon {{witnessing}} a crash which left fellow British driver Roger Williamson trapped in his overturned and burning car, Purley abandoned his own race {{and attempted to}} save Williamson, who was participating in only his second Formula One race. Purley later recalled that upon arriving at the scene, he heard Williamson crying for help as the fire began to take hold. Purley's efforts to right the car and extinguish the flames were in vain as he received <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> nearby track marshals or emergency workers, in spite of attempts to encourage them, and other passing drivers, {{to come to his}} aid; Williamson died from asphyxiation.

25|$|Soon the Balkan rebellions were {{beginning}} to falter. In Europe, papers were filled with reports of Ottoman soldiers killing thousands of Slavs. Even in Great Britain William Ewart Gladstone published his account of Ottoman atrocities in his Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East. Soon, a new Russo-Turkish war had begun. Despite fighting better than they ever had before, the advanced Ottoman armies still were not equal to the Russian forces. This time there was <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> abroad, in truth many European nations supported the Russian war, {{as long as it}} did not get too close to Istanbul. Ten and a half months later when the war had ended the age of Ottoman domination over the Balkans was over. The Ottomans had fought well, the new navy of Ironclads had won the battle for the Black Sea, and Russian advances in the Caucasus had been kept minimal. In the Balkans, however, the Russian army, supported by rebels, had pushed the Ottoman army out of Bulgaria, Romania, and much of East Rumelia {{and by the end of}} the war the artillery firing in Thrace could be heard in Constantinople.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly's {{second and}} final Ashes tour to England {{as a player}} in 1938 again saw him as the most {{effective}} bowler in the team. His final record of 22 wickets {{at an average of}} 27.72 in the four Tests—the Third Test was rained off without a ball being bowled—was marginally less than 1934, and in all matches he took 104 wickets at 16.59. In its report of the tour, however, Wisdens 1939 edition noted that [...] "it was nothing short of remarkable that despite the moderate support accorded to him he bowled so consistently well and so effectively." [...] Again, O'Reilly was often used defensively where there was <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the wicket, but, Wisden added, [...] "when... the wicket gave him the least encouragement he robbed the greatest batsmen of initiative, and was most destructive".|$|E

[...] Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: [...] "I {{have never been able}} to care one farthing about the Poles". Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–04, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to adopt his plans, although the eventual scheme announced by Shackleton owed little to Bruce.

[...] Willis took 32 wickets for 15.09 across the entire tour, 20 of those in the Test matches for 16.75. He took five for 27 in the second Test, and then six for 53 in the fourth – earning him career best Test figures thus far, and taking him past 400 first-class wickets. Four of his wickets came in four overs with the second new ball, [...] "although he received <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the pitch". Wisden record that [...] "His 20 wickets in the series stamped Willis as a bowler of genuine pace and in-disputable class." ...|$|E

She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having [...] "to fight her own flawed battle with <b>no</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> anyone", and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character: [...] "aggressive, intimidating, combative, and scrabbling through life by sheer will, armed with homemade weapons".|$|E
