40|$|Purpose –The {{impact of}} Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in tourism has been {{suggested}} through extensive research. Previous work has urged the development of wide-angle studies to enable benchmarking of destinations and their industries. However, relevant research is limited. Macro-level studies in the area {{tend to focus on}} a single aspect of technology to evaluate adoption, are <b>not</b> <b>sector</b> <b>specific</b> nor take into consideration the different levels of contribution that systems may bring to performance. This paper provides a framework for benchmarking the eTourism Capability of a destination´s tourism industry, understanding the eTourism Capability of a destination´s industry as the contribution that the ICT uptake of that industry makes to its own performance. Design/methodology/approach – A review of the literature on Tourism, eTourism, Benchmarking and Technology Adoption provided the baseline for developing this benchmarking tool. Findings – The literature supported the selection of key tourism industry sectors, i. e. accommodation establishments, visitor attractions and food and beverage; the most suitable methodology, i. e. intermediary performance measures; and the business characteristics that need being taken into consideration when assessing ICT adoption by tourism businesses, e. g. size, type of establishment and area of location. Research Limitations/Implications – the framework has not been tested yet. It is based upon {{a review of the literature}} and needs to be validated through primary research. The framework was developed based on the context of Scotland. Further work should be done to adjust the framework to other destinations worldwide.

Our findings suggest that payroll taxes do indeed influence the decision to be self-employed, with the probability of self-employment increasing as taxes on employees increase and vice versa. Furthermore, there appear to be declines in the return to self-employment caused by the tax, possibly due to inefficient allocation of labour towards self-employment.

40|$|Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are {{claimed to}} provide {{businesses}} with a competitive advantage, {{to the extent}} of reshaping entire industries. In tourism, an information-intensive activity and the impact of ICT has been extensively documented at the industry, destination and business level. eTourism Capability refers here to the contribution of ICT to tourism business performance. Therefore, the work is based within the Tourism domain. However, its methods are mainly emerging from the adapted combination of previous research in business and eBusiness. Previous work has urged for the development of wide-angle studies, assessing the eTourism Capability of a destination. However, existing research addressing this issue, tends to place the focus on only one specific aspect of technology adoption, it is <b>not</b> <b>sector</b> <b>specific</b> and/or does not take into consideration the different levels of contribution to performance made by systems. In order to develop an eTourism Capability Assessment Framework for Scotland, and to provide the baseline for its strategic benchmarking with other tourism destinations, the work included an extensive literature review of Tourism and eTourism, developed of a conceptual framework. This supported the selection of key tourism industry stakeholders, i. e. the accommodation sector within the established context. An electronic questionnaire enabled the data collection. Through a mix of statistical techniques, the data treatment provided answers to the research questions, which related to the most suitable approach for ICT indexing in the accommodation sector, the level of contribution to performance by the different ICT elements, patterns describing the impact of business characteristics on ICT uptake, and the predictive models for this uptake. The results suggested the suitability of IT-based indexes for assessing the ICT uptake of this sector. Additionally, the results suggested important differences in the contribution that each system makes to business performance. This even varies across systems supporting similar business functions. Furthermore, the results emphasised the influence of the individual ICT on their own adoption, and suggested several dimensions to describe systems, which underlie the association between business characteristics and ICT adoption by the accommodation sector. These are compatibility observability, physical accessibility, verticality of systems and whether these support standardisation of processes across branches. Since the influence of business characteristics on ICT uptake seem to be system-specific, the predictive models are developed for each individual system. Finally, recommendations for further research have also been made...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{strategy}} is {{an increasingly important}} concern for managers in almost all industries as they mature, and as the search for competitive advantage moves into knowing more than rivals about customers, resources, and processes. This dissertation seeks {{to understand how the}} firm B&Q is addressing this need for an effective way to create and utilise knowledge. B&Q is a retail firm in the home improvement industry. They are the market leader and are aware of and are attempting to reverse a general decline in the industry. Knowledge concerns everything that the firm does from its interactions with customers to the way managers ensure effective performance. There is significant academic research into the way firms manage their knowledge. Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), Hansen et al (1999), and Zack (1999), among others, have all developed their own models and frameworks that predict and evaluate the knowledge strategies that firms implement. Much of this research is focused on firms in knowledge intensive industries where either knowledge creation is the primary output, such as technology research firms, or where knowledge services are bought by other firms, such as management consultancy. This dissertation will test whether a number of these frameworks are utilised by B&Q – a firm which is in the retail sector. It is important to test these models in industries other than those in which they were originally developed. This will help to gain a general understanding of knowledge management which is <b>not</b> <b>sector</b> <b>specific.</b> The first part of this dissertation will focus on {{a review of the literature}} of knowledge management and strategy. This will inform the analysis of the research results and act as a means of categorisation of knowledge activities within B&Q. The literature review will also help to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the knowledge strategy. The analysis will be based on a number of research hypotheses. Chapter 3 will be a description of the framework I will be using to analyse the data and the research methods I will use to obtain the data. Chapters 4 and 5 will then describe the knowledge management strategy of B&Q based on the data gathered in the interview, which will be analysed in terms of the framework discussed before in chapter 6. Finally, the limitations of the study will be highlighted in chapter 7 and the dissertation will conclude with what has been learnt from this study and implications for future research in chapter 8. This dissertation concludes with the finding that B&Q’s knowledge strategy does closely resemble the results of Hansen et al’s (1999) research. The personalisation and codification strategies are found to be implemented in the manner suggested by Hansen et al (1999) and there are also elements of Zack’s (1999) work as well...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} recent effective rates of protection across the Egyptian economy, using an ad valorem price wedge introduced by nontariff barriers and energy subsidies, and compares today's effective rates of protection {{with those of}} a decade ago. The study uses 23 aggregated sectors from input-output matrix information. Although trade liberalization since the late- 1990 s has had a considerable impact in reducing protection of some industries, some sectors, such as the food and tobacco sector, remain relatively highly protected, due to tariff escalation and nontariff barriers, and due to energy subsidies. Energy subsidies are <b>not</b> formally <b>sector</b> <b>specific</b> but do favor sectors that are energy intensive (of particular note is the electricity sector). It appears that energy pricing {{is part of a}} strategy to subsidize and promote certain industries and in effect offset the dis-protection or taxation that results from tariffs on intermediate inputs. The case of the cement sector is notable because energy subsidies appear to almost exactly offset the negative impacts of tariffs and indirect taxes. The fertilizer sector has zero nominal tariffs, benefiting agriculture, and so a negative effective rate of protection due simply to tariffs on intermediate inputs. However, the fertilizer sector ends up with a very high a positive total effective rate of protection due to energy subsidies.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the horticultural sector has been confronted with {{questions}} about the carbon footprint of its products. However, the global standards {{used to calculate the}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have some gaps that do <b>not</b> address the <b>sector</b> <b>specific</b> issues for horticulture, such as crop rotation, land use of soil organic matter and Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Therefore, a need was identified for a <b>sector</b> <b>specific</b> standard which addresses these interpretations gaps. In response to this need the `Carbon footprinting of horticulture products protocol' (DNCF 2009) was developed by the Dutch horticultural sector. In the greenhouse cultures energy consumption is the main component of the CO 2 emission. To save energy a lot of Dutch greenhouse companies use CHP to heat their greenhouses. The grower thereby generates two products; the horticultural product and the electricity. The CO 2 emission of the electricity production should be deducted from the total CO 2 production of the CHP, in order to calculate the CO 2 emission that should be assigned to the production of the tomatoes. To find out what the position of the organic way of cropping will be, organic crop production is compared with regular cropping systems, with or without CHP. An example for organic grown tomatoes is worked out. It shows the specific organic input factors and their impact at the CO 2 footprint...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. This paper aims at {{providing}} a broad {{analysis of the}} EU’s impact on the CEECs which is <b>not</b> <b>sector</b> or policy <b>specific</b> {{by focusing on the}} changing role of the state in these countries as a result of direct and indirect impact of the EU. It draws on the concepts developed by the Europeanization studies, debates on the regulation in EU and in particular studies of transition reforms. The studies of the two processes of transition and EU accession, in particular the character and outcomes of their interaction, have for a long time been fragmented and divided into two separate fields. Some analysts go as far as to claim that, “the two not only pass each other as ships in the night, but rarely even sail in the same sea. ” (6) This paper starts with the premise that integrating the results of studies from the transition reforms and EU accession policies can provide new insights about the changing role of the state, boundaries between private and public, and potential implications for the success of public policies in the CEECs and growth of their economies. In addition, the paper also critically examines the prevailing arguments concerning the character of EU’s impact on CEECs and provides a different perspective on the issue. Although the literature on the impact of the EU on the redrawing of boundaries between market and the state so far has been rather limited, there have been several arguments which are made explicitly by the authors or are tacitly accepted as the conventional wisdom in policy specific analysis...|$|R
