That's a savings of $26.46, he adds. (Based on average prices from May 25 to Nov. 22 in 922 Loblaws-owned stores, the company notes in fine-print.) He then removes any risk involved in switching by saying if you don't like the no name version, Loblaws will give you your money back.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. In South Africa, Store brands {{are sold}} {{throughout}} retailers {{in the country}} and categories are widespread - from beverages (milk, coffee, water, etc); including most confectionary categories; most household and toiletry categories; and from premium brands, to the more cost effective. Compared to the U. S and Europe, the South African market for store brands is not well developed; however, there are still mega opportunities in the own brand category, as the market is far from being saturated. Even though South African retailers are utilizing own brands as a means of differentiation, some studies are also indicating the lack of well tuned major store brand strategies and own brands were not perceived as of value by consumers as well. Therefore, this study is undertaken to establish a greater insight into consumer perceptions toward The <b>No</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Brand</b> food items by investigating the influence of selected economic, psychosocial and demographic variables. Without a solid understanding of the consumer, the available growth opportunities in the store brand category are likely to be missed. For retailers {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities in the store brand category a greater understanding of consumer behaviour is required. For that purpose, relevant theories and concepts of consumer behaviour are included in the literature review for the study...|$|R

[...] Recent praise for the film has appeared in an online article by film professor Robert Keser, who writes, [...] "Almost two decades after the release of Clara’s Heart, the film looks dated only in its virtues. As commercial cinema, it represents a classical control and modulation of storytelling, spinning its emotional threads patiently with no hammering close-ups and little pandering to the decoratively picturesque. Equally, the film seems sweetly unconscious of consumer culture that seeks to define us by acquisition and consumption: <b>no</b> <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> are touted, <b>no</b> recreational shopping montages display products to suggest meaning." ...|$|R

40|$|Literature review {{suggests}} that Western researchers adopt the stepwise approach {{to investigate the}} <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> process and develop models and tenets for <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> practices. Notably, however, management researchers query {{the applicability of the}} broad Western <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> principles in a Chinese sociocultural context. This paper examines the <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> practices of Chinese enterprises. Eleven Chinese managers were in-depth interviewed. The research results reveal that Chinese managers tend to follow a four-step approach in choosing <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> They are: 1) generating <b>brand</b> <b>names,</b> 2) screening <b>brand</b> <b>names,</b> 3) choosing <b>brand</b> <b>names,</b> and 4) applying for registration. Chinese managers tend to use ‘good luck’ and ‘foreign-sounding’ frequently to evaluate <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> Advertising agencies and brand consultants are involved in the evaluation process. Interestingly, government officials are influential in the <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> decision of Chinese enterprises. However, few enterprises undertake formal research such as consumer surveys to evaluate <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> Most Chinese enterprises, to play safe, register for more than one <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> to establish a name pool. The research findings suggest that the Eastern and Western <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> processes are different and {{there is a need to}} develop a Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> model...|$|R

Three studies investigated the effects of negative <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> valence on <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> memory and liking of a branded product. Study 1 demonstrates that relative to nonnegative <b>brand</b> <b>names,</b> negative <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> and their associated logos are better recognised. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that negative valence of a <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> tends to have a detrimental influence on product evaluation with evaluations worsening as negative valence increases. However, evaluation is also dependent on <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> arousal, with high arousal <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> resulting in more positive evaluations, such that moderately negative <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> are equally as attractive as some non-negative <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> Study 3 shows evidence for affective habituation, whereby the effects of negative valence reduce with repeated exposures to some classes of negative <b>brand</b> <b>name...</b>|$|R
