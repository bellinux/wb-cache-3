5000|$|Insects are passively caught using funnels, pitfall traps, bottle traps, malaise traps, flight {{interception}} {{traps and}} other passive types of insect traps, {{some of which}} are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Different designs of ultraviolet light traps such as the Robinson trap are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies. Aspirators or [...] "pooters" [...] suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.Several different types of nets are commonly used to actively collect insects. Aerial insect nets are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate butterfly wings. A sweep net is used to collect insects from grass and brush. It is similar to a butterfly net, except that the bag is generally constructed from more rugged material.The sweep net is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force.This requires a heavy <b>net</b> <b>fabric</b> such as sailcloth to prevent tearing, although light nets can be used if swept less vigorously. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed with a pooter. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include beating nets and aquatic nets. Leaf litter sieves are used by coleopterists and to collect larvae.|$|E

40|$|All {{mosquito}} nets act as {{a physical}} barrier, preventing access by vector mosquitoes and thus providing personal protection against malaria to the individual(s) using the nets. The pyrethroid insecticides used to treat nets, have an excito-repellent effect that adds a chemical barrier to the physical one offered by the <b>net</b> <b>fabric,</b> further reducing human–vector contact and increasing the protective efficacy of treated nets. Most commonly, the insecticide kills the malaria vectors that {{come into contact with}} the insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). By reducing the vector population in this way, ITNs, when used by a majority of the target population (coverage rates > 80 %) has a mass effect by offering protection for all people in the community, including those who have no nets (Binka, 1998; Hawley, 2003). ITNs protect users against malaria in several ways; firstly, the fabric provides a physical barrier, so reducing man-mosquito contact. Secondly the impregnated insecticide knocks down and often kills mosquitoes that come into contact with the net. The insecticide dosage required for knockdown is well below the threshold level of mammalian toxicity (WHO, 2006). Thirdly impregnated insecticide is excito-repellent hence will prevent entry of mosquitoes into households with ITNs (Curtis et al., 1998, 2003). The two extra properties make ITNs advantageous over untreated nets, such that a treated net can be effective even if torn. If ITNs are used by the whole community the insecticidal effect results in reduced longevity of female Anopheles mosquitoes so that few survive for the time required for development of the malaria parasite to the sporozoite stage in the mosquito thereby reducing malaria transmission. Pyrethroids were developed after prolonged efforts to improve biological and chemical stability of the natural pyrethrins, which have long been known for their insecticidal effects. As well as causing a knockdown effect, insects encountering pyrethroids show restless behaviour and hyper excitability caused by involvement of the central nervous system. Pyrethroids may also have an anti-feeding effect on Anopheles mosquitoes (Becker et al., 2003). 2 The use of ITNs treated with synthetic pyrethroids is increasing fast in many malarial parts of the world including, sub-Saharan African countries. The efficacy and effectiveness of ITNs in terms of mortality and morbidity reduction in malaria endemic countries have been very well documented (Lengeler, 2004). The WHO currently advocates their universal use by all household members in malaria endemic areas. Previously, nets had to be re-treated every 6 - 12 months, more frequently if the nets were washed in between re-treatment. Nets were re-treated by dipping them in a mixture of water and insecticide and allowing them to dry in a shady place. Re-treatment kits (NGAO) were commercially available in retail shops, however not affordable by the needy majority, thus leading to low re-treatment rates (Chavasse et al., 1999; Mubyazi et al., 2002; Kolaczinski et al., 2004; Abdullah et al., 2005). The need for frequent re-treatment was a major barrier to widespread use of ITNs in endemic countries. For ITNs to be fully effective re-treatment rates need to be very high (WHO, 2003). The additional cost of the insecticide kit (NGAO) and the lack of understanding of its importance resulted in low retreatment rates in most African countries. One of the main programmatic issues affecting the conventional ITNs is the necessity for regular re-treatment. For a number of reasons (such as frequency and washing methods, wear and tear, UV light and others) the pyrethroid insecticide on <b>net</b> <b>fabric</b> wears off over time and has, therefore, to be replaced. There is convincing evidence that after 3 to 5 washes, the insecticide is removed from nets treated by conventional dipping. Under programmatic conditions, unless nets can be systematically be retreated after 3 washes as recommended by WHO (1998) the protective efficacy might be much lower than expected, especially if nets are frequently washed. While it is relatively easy to socially market mosquito nets to the population of endemic countries, the idea of a regular insecticide re-treatment has been found very difficult to implement (Minja, 2001; Armstrong-Schellenberg, 2002). 3 The barriers associated with the conventional ITNs that require re-treatment have been mitigated by the invention of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LLINs). Several companies have developed LLINs that maintain effective levels of insecticides {{for the life of the}} <b>net</b> <b>fabric</b> estimated to 5 years mitigating the need for conventional re-treatment. LLINs are treated in the factory with insecticide incorporated into or coated around the fibres, which makes them capable to resist multiple washes. LLINs are designed to survive for several years in the field without further maintenance, and to withstand for at least 20 washes without losing insecticidal activity. Application of LLINs is currently growing in many malaria endemic areas and these nets retain their insecticidal properties for their physical life in domestic use despite many washes (Tami et al., 2004). The <b>net</b> <b>fabric</b> can either be polyesters with a physical life of 3 – 4 years or polyethylene with a physical life of 4 – 5 years (WHO, 2003). Currently several insecticide and net manufactures are active in developing long lasting nets technology (WHO, 2011). Several brands of nets are available in the country including Olyset, Permanet, Mbu net, Afya net, Safi net and others. Olyset nets have been found to be popular and durable than ordinary polyester nets. Currently, Olyset® nets are locally produced in East Africa by the A-Z Textile Industry in Arusha, Tanzania. Olyset® nets have permethrin incorporated into the polyethylene material during the manufacturing process at a concentration of 20 g/kg (± 3 g/kg), 2 %w/w (1. 7 – 2. 3 % limits). The manufacturer has reported that, over time, insecticide migrates to the surface of the yarn, replacing the one that has been removed by washing. This migration being a temperature-dependent process, exposure of nets to heat after washing (e. g. few hours to sun) can accelerate it. Olyset® nets are very strong due to their thick fibres of high density polyethylene which gives them strength of about 180 denier despite the wide mesh of 4 mm. Their durability and long-lasting insecticidal properties make them suitable for use in most rural settings in malaria endemic areas in Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E

For many years, pressure garments {{have been used to}} exert pressure on human limbs for scar management, venous and lymphatic problems, bone, muscle injury and post cosmetic surgery. Pressure garments are produced from knitted elastic fabrics, which extends from a relaxed state and remain extended when worn, thereby exerting pressure on the body of the wearer. Since pressure garments are worn next to the skin and are in intimate contact with the body, their attributes are relevant to the comfort of the wearer hence are of immense importance.

40|$|A new {{technique}} to control phytophagous mites was tested in West Africa on the African eggplant Solanum macrocarpon.

The technique was evaluated in three trials at the INRAB research station and in a grower's field in 2006 and 2007. Results showed that the broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), the major pest of S. macrocarpon which causes severe damage to leaves, and spider mites (Tetranychus spp.), were completely controlled by the dicofol-treated net Very few mites and practically no mite injury were observed on plants covered with the dicofol-treated net compared to 12 - 94 % damaged leaves in the unprotected control plots. The acaricide-treated net was as efficient when used temporarily (once every three nights) as when used every night. No difference in the percentages of leaves damaged by mites was apparent at harvest between plots covered with a non-acaricide deltamethrin-treated net (40 %) and unprotected control (32 %). This new concept of mite control using an acaricide-treated net temporarily covering vegetable crop {{appears to be an}} efficient tool which is easy to use. It can be used repeatedly reducing costs and poses a very low risk of environmental pollution when used in the dry season or in greenhouses...|$|E

40|$|Background To {{validate}} {{assumptions about}} the length of the distribution–replacement cycle for long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in Rwanda, the Malaria and other Parasitic Diseases Division, Rwanda Ministry of Health, used World Health Organization methods to independently confirm the three-year LLIN serviceable life span recommendation of WHO. Methods Approximately 3, 000 coded LLINs, distributed as part of a national campaign, were monitored in six sites, by means of six–monthly visits to selected houses. Two indicators, survivorship/attrition, a measure of the number of <b>nets</b> remaining, and <b>fabric</b> integrity, the proportion of remaining nets in either ‘good’, ‘serviceable’ or ‘needs replacement’ condition, based on holes in the net material, were tracked. To validate the assumption that the intervention would remain effective for three years, LLIN coverage, calculated using either survivorship, or integrity, by removing nets in the ‘needs replacement’ category from the survivorship total, was compared with the predicted proportion of nets remaining, derived from a net loss model, that assumes an LLIN serviceable life of three years. Results After two years, there was close agreement between estimated LLIN survivorship at all sites, 75 % (range 64 - 84 %), and the predicted proportion of nets remaining, 75 %. However, when integrity was considered, observed survivorship at all sites, declined to 42 % (range 10 - 54 %). Conclusions More than half, 58 %, of the LLINs fell into the ‘needs replacement’ category after two years. While these nets were counted for survivorship, they were judged to be of little-to-no benefit to a user. Therefore, when integrity was taken into account, survivorship was significantly lower than predicted, suggesting that net serviceable life was actually closer to two, rather than three years, and, by extension, that the impact of the intervention during year three of the LLIN distribution-replacement cycle could be well below that seen in years one and two...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{effectiveness}} of pyrethroid-treated bednets for malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa is under threat {{because of high}} levels of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in the vectors. Here we assess the durability of polyethylene nets with a novel combination of permethrin, a pyrethroid, with pyriproxyfen, an insect juvenile mimic (PPF-LLIN), in comparison with a typical permethrin-treated long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN). Methods This is a cluster randomised controlled trial of net durability in Burkina Faso, with clustering {{at the level of}} the compound and includes entomological outcome measurements. Half the compounds in each village will be randomly allocated PPF-LLIN and half the LLIN. All sleeping places in a compound will be provided with one type of net. We will distribute the nets at the start of the first transmission season and follow net use at the start and end of each transmission season for 3 years. In one village, bio-efficacy and chemical content will be recorded immediately after net distribution and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. In the other village <b>net</b> survivorship and <b>fabric</b> integrity will be recorded immediately after distribution, and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. Routine measurements of indoor temperature and relative humidity will be made in both villages during the study. Residents will be followed for possible side effects of the PPF-LLIN by surveillance of known asthmatic subjects during the first month post-distribution and pregnancy outcomes will be monitored from antenatal clinic records. Discussion The protocol is novel on two accounts. Firstly, it is the first to describe the procedure for measuring net durability following recent World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. Meeting the minimum requirements set in the guidelines is essential before a new type of net can be recommended by WHO’s Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES). Secondly, it describes methods to monitor the persistence of an active ingredient that reduces vector fertility and fecundity. If the PPF-LLIN is both effective and persistent it will provide an alternative vector control strategy where pyrethroid-resistant vectors are present...|$|R
