5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown {{as a result of}} overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote, [...] "Life has spoilt me... I no longer draw like I breathe, as I used to <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> Tintin is no longer me... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to bring you a new episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, our friend is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E

"We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. <b>Not</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E

So even if hypothetically you recognise that they are being contested in court, then in any case, this can in no way affect the question of the vote's legitimacy or the overall results." [...] On 15 December 2011, Putin claimed that the organizers of the protests were former (Russian) advisors to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko during his presidency who were transferring the Orange Revolution to Russia; he also claimed some organizers were paid by [...] "foreign powers".|$|E
