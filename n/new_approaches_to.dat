5|$|By 1901, the {{population}} of Paris had grown to 2,715,000. At {{the beginning of the}} century, artists from around the world, including Picasso, Modigliani, and Matisse made Paris their home.

5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and {{cultural}} materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting {{to piece together}} its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} taken <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> {{analyzing}} {{both traditional and}} modern Ethiopian historiography. For instance, Donald Crummey (1941–2013) investigated instances in Ethiopian historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, and gender. He also criticized earlier approaches made by Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960) and Richard Pankhurst (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the Ethiopian ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in Ethiopian historical works. Following the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the historical materialism of Marxist historiography came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding of Northeast African history. In her 2001 article Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review, Belete Bizuneh remarks {{that the impact of}} social history on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of women and gender in historical societies, but that Ethiopian historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.|$|E

25|$|Modernism and {{liberalism}} do {{not constitute}} rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought {{into the spirit of}} the Age of Enlightenment.

The Overview page presents about forty of those approaches or techniques, including interactive database use, q-analysis, information visualization, confidence artistry, tensegrity organization, I Ching, transformative conferencing, or marriage between poetry and policy-making.|$|E
25|$|Reliable {{projections}} for CNS risks from space radiation exposure cannot {{be made at}} this time due to a paucity of data on the subject. Existing animal and cellular data do suggest that space radiation can produce neurological and behavioral effects; therefore, {{it is possible that}} mission operations will be impacted. The significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated, however. It is to be noted that studies, to date, have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); this means that testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (<0.5 Gy) has not yet been carried out to a sufficient extent. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is typically used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach has not been discovered to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts. Research on <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> risk assessment may be needed to provide the data and knowledge that will be necessary to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation. A vigorous research program, which will be required to solve these problems, must rely on <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> risk assessment and countermeasure validation because of the absence of useful human radio-epidemiology data in this area.|$|E
