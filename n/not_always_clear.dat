5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b> Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of hare coursing across the different {{states of the}} USA is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b> Animal Place, a California-based animal rights group which opposes coursing, claims that the activity is legal in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming but illegal in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin. The pro-coursing campaign, Stop2110 says that open field coursing is legal in all US states with a huntable population of jackrabbits. Washington state lists jackrabbits as a protected species, due to an unusually low population for a western state, and bans all forms of hunting them.|$|E
5|$|The apothecaries' system {{often used}} the same ounces as the {{precious}} metals system, although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen, 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, it was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> {{which of the two}} systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it. In old merchants' handbooks the former system is sometimes referred to as the pharmaceutical system, and distinguished from the apothecaries' system.|$|E

5|$|Ecology and {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological {{and evolutionary}} theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear,</b> ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E

50|$|In {{traditional}} English grammar, determiners {{were not}} considered a separate part of speech - most {{of them would have}} been classed as adjectives.

25|$|Until the Amsterdam Games in 1928, the {{architectural}} competition was not divided into categories. The 1928 games introduced a town planning category. However, the division was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear,</b> and some designs were awarded prizes in both categories.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between science, engineering, and technology is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b> Science is systematic {{knowledge of the}} physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, {{because they have to}} satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.|$|E
25|$|When {{deciding}} whether to optimize a specific part of the program, Amdahl's Law should always be considered: {{the impact on the}} overall program depends very much on how much time is actually spent in that specific part, which is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> from looking at the code without a performance analysis.|$|E

25|$|In the diffuse-porous woods, the {{demarcation}} between rings is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> so <b>clear</b> and in {{some cases}} is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye.

25|$|While it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> why an intimal tear may occur, {{quite often}} it {{involves}} degeneration of the collagen and elastin {{that make up}} the media.

25|$|The {{distinction}} between touring and sport touring is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> as some manufacturers will list the same bike in either category in different markets. The Honda ST1300 Pan-European, for example, was listed by Honda as a sport touring motorcycle in the United States and Australia, {{but as a}} touring motorcycle in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} organic reactions is basically infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed {{that can be used}} to describe many common or useful reactions.

25|$|Chromatophores {{that contain}} {{large amounts of}} yellow pteridine {{pigments}} are named xanthophores; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores. However, vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell, {{in which case the}} overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments. Therefore, the distinction between these chromatophore types is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{question}} of whether to call a particular language polysynthetic is {{complicated by the fact that}} morpheme and word boundaries are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> cut, and languages may be highly synthetic in one area but less synthetic in other areas (e.g., verbs and nouns in Southern Athabaskan languages or Inuit languages). Many polysynthetic languages display complex evidentiality and/or mirativity systems in their verbs.|$|E

Also on the internet, there are several sites where various older versions can be read online.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear</b> what provokes Sparassidae to bite people, but it {{is known}} that female members of this family will aggressively defend their egg sacs and young against {{perceived}} threats. The rarity of bites on various body parts suggests that most are accidental or incidental, resulting from inadvertent handling. Bites from Sparassids usually do not require hospital treatment. In particular, no cases of necrosis have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{two leading}} manufacturers, HP and TI, {{released}} increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At {{the turn of}} the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a handheld computer was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>clear,</b> as some very advanced calculators such as the TI-89, the Voyage 200 and HP-49G could differentiate and integrate functions, solve differential equations, run word processing and PIM software, and connect by wire or IR to other calculators/computers.|$|E
