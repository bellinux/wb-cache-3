Rotational fretting is one of basic running modes in contact configuration of ball-on-flat, to which was paid little attention. The rotational fretting wear behaviors of the <b>nitrided</b> <b>layer</b> and its substrate steel were comparatively studied in dry condition under varied angular displacement amplitudes (θ) in range of 0. 125 º- 1 º, imposed normal load (Fn) of 20 N and a constant rotational speed of 0. 2 º/s. The experimental results showed that the <b>nitrided</b> <b>layer</b> presented rough and porous surface and high hardness was mainly consist of ε-Fe 2 - 3 N and γ׳-Fe 4 N phases. Compared with the substrate steel, the <b>nitrided</b> <b>layer</b> had a significant effect on reducing the friction coefficient and improving the fretting wear resistance, though the <b>nitrided</b> <b>layer</b> almost didn’t change the fretting running regimes of the substrate steel. In the partial slip regime, lower friction coefficients and slight damage appeared for the <b>nitrided</b> <b>layer</b> due to the coordination of elastic deformation of contact zones.

30|$|Plasma {{nitriding}} is {{a well-known}} diffusional treatment {{to solve this problem}} that improves the mechanical properties of austenitic stainless steels, such as hardness and wear resistance [3, 4, 5]. Increase in the thickness and nitrogen concentration of <b>nitrided</b> <b>layer</b> is an important industrial requirement to improve the hardness, wear resistance, and several other properties in austenitic stainless steels. The temperature of 450  °C is an optimum temperature to obtain a relatively thick <b>nitrided</b> <b>layer</b> with appropriate corrosion resistance in the plasma-nitrided AISI 316 L steel [5, 6, 7].

Design/methodology/approach: Nitriding was done in the nitrogen-hydrogen (or argon) gas atmospheres with various hydrogen content, i. e. 0 %, 30 %, and 70 %, at the glow discharge at temperature 560 °C for 6 hrs. In order to estimate the degree of hydrogen degradation SSRT test was conducted on round smooth specimens 4 mm in diameter. Tests were performed at ambient temperature either in dry air or in 0. 005 M H 2 SO 4 solution. The applied strain rate was 10 - 6 s- 1. Tests in acid solution were conducted under cathodic polarization with constant current densities: 0. 1; 1; 5 and 10 mA/cm 2. Fracture surfaces after SSRT test were examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM) to reveal a mode and mechanism of cracking. Findings: Plasma <b>nitrided</b> <b>layers</b> are effective barriers to hydrogen entry into structural steel which decreases susceptibility of steel to hydrogen degradation. Hydrogen is mainly accumulated in a compact nitrides zone. Evidences of no increase in brittleness of <b>nitrided</b> <b>layers</b> with absorbed hydrogen were observed.
