Two literary groups were established, the Faisalabad Union of Column Writers and Faisalabad Union of Journalists, to bring together printed media personalities for the purpose of providing training to budding writers from the city.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{has contributed}} to American arts and culture. Drawing from its Native American and Yankee roots, along with later {{immigrant}} groups, Massachusetts has produced a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers,</b> artists, and musicians. A number of major museums and important historical sites are also located there, and events and festivals throughout the year celebrate the state's history and heritage.|$|E

5|$|Broccoli {{commissioned}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> {{to work on}} the script, including Stirling Silliphant, John Landis, Ronald Hardy, Anthony Burgess, and Derek Marlowe. In the second volume of his autobiography, Burgess claims to have worked on an early treatment for the movie. The British television producer Gerry Anderson also stated that he provided a film treatment (although originally planned to be Moonraker) much similar to what ended up as The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Achebe again left Nigeria, {{this time}} {{as part of a}} Fellowship for Creative Artists awarded by UNESCO. He {{travelled}} to the United States and Brazil. He met with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> from the US, including novelists Ralph Ellison and Arthur Miller. In Brazil, he met with several other authors, with whom he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese. Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{including}} Murray Rothbard, {{have sought}} to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some {{of which can be}} characterized as antisemitic, others as philosemitic. Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current {{at the time that he}} accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.|$|E

5|$|Wulfstan's {{writings}} influenced a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> in late Old English literature. There are {{echoes of}} Wulfstan's writings in the 1087 entry of the Peterborough Chronicle, {{a version of}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle written at Peterborough Abbey. This entry has long been famous as it deals with the death of King William the Conqueror, and contrasts his worldly power with his status after death. Other suggestions of Wulfstan's writing occur in works of Old English, including the Soul's Address to the Body. His law codes, which were written under Æthelred and Cnut, remained in effect through the reign of King Edward the Confessor, and were still being reaffirmed in 1100, when King Henry I of England swore a coronation oath to observe the laws of King Edward.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{development}} staff had an equal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> as illustrators, {{it was originally}} planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that {{the development}} team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.|$|E
25|$|At age 19, {{like many}} young men of upper-crust American society, Crosby volunteered {{to serve in the}} American Ambulance Service in France.

25|$|Series creator Joss Whedon and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> {{involved}} with the television series authored many of the comic books. Overviews summarizing the comic books' storylines were written early {{in the writing process}} and were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as official Buffy merchandise.|$|E

During her tenure as a Sargeson fellow, Morris undertook two editorial projects: The Penguin Book of Contemporary New Zealand Short Stories (2008) [...] and an expatriate-writing issue of Landfall.|$|R
25|$|The {{series is}} scripted {{by a team}} of writers, {{following}} the American model. Historically, British sitcoms were more generally written by one or two writers. By employing a wider <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> to brainstorm jokes for each episode, DLT Entertainment UK Ltd, the production company, has been able to maintain a consistent and relatively long-lived product without having to wait for a single writer to produce more material.|$|E
25|$|The Pennine Way has {{attracted}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> over the years, including Stephenson himself, who wrote the first official guidebook. A popular guide was {{written and illustrated by}} the writer Alfred Wainwright, whose offer to buy a half-pint of beer for anyone who finished the Pennine Way is estimated to have cost him up to £15,000 by his death in 1991. The National Trail Guide contains a description of the route, GPS waypoints and 1:25000 maps of the entire walk.|$|E
25|$|Boole's {{work was}} {{extended}} and refined by a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers,</b> beginning with William Stanley Jevons. Augustus De Morgan {{had worked on}} the logic of relations, and Charles Sanders Peirce integrated his work with Boole's during the 1870s. Other significant figures were Platon Sergeevich Poretskii, and William Ernest Johnson. The conception of a Boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a propositional calculus is credited to Hugh MacColl (1877), in work surveyed 15 years later by Johnson. Surveys of these developments were published by Ernst Schröder, Louis Couturat, and Clarence Irving Lewis.|$|E

25|$|Fantasy is {{commonly}} associated with science fiction, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> have worked in both genres, while writers such as Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Marion Zimmer Bradley have written works that appear to blur {{the boundary between the}} two related genres. The authors' professional organization is called the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA). SF conventions routinely have programming on fantasy topics, and fantasy authors such as J. K. Rowling have won the highest honor within the science fiction field, the Hugo Award.|$|E
25|$|Some mythicists hold—in terms {{given by}} Robert M. Price—the Jesus agnosticism viewpoint, while others go further {{and hold the}} Jesus atheism viewpoint. Some {{scholars}} have {{made the case that}} there are a number of plausible Jesuses that could have existed, but that there can be no certainty as to which Jesus was the historical Jesus. Others have said that Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> adduce various arguments to show that Christianity has syncretistic or mythical roots. As such, the historical Jesus should not be regarded as the founder of the religion, even if he did exist.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd Webber {{returned}} to the project in 2006, collaborating with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> and directors. However, he still did not feel the ideas he had were adaptable into a piece of musical theatre. Finally, in early 2007, Lloyd Webber approached Ben Elton (who had served as the librettist for Lloyd Webber's The Beautiful Game) to help shape a synopsis for a sequel, based on Lloyd Webber's initial ideas. Elton's treatment of the story focused more on the original characters of The Phantom of the Opera and omitted new characters that Lloyd Webber and Forsyth had developed. Lloyd Webber was pleased with Elton's treatment and began work on the sequel. In March 2007, he announced he would be moving forward with the project.|$|E
