40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> {{opportunities}} collected from a Japanese job searching site (“fromA navi”) and an inter- national job searching site (“Indeed”). We confirm that {{a relationship between}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> opportunities and socioeconomic quantities (the population, the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> firms and workers) in each 1 -km grid square in Japan. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> workers is the best explanatory variable to explain the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> opportunities in Japan. The regression coefficients can be used as an indicator to grasp Japanese macroeconomic conditions. From a global point of view, we analyse the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> opportunities in about 16, 000 cities all over the world. We confirm the daily <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> opportunities in each city varies in time and show some asso- ciations with macroeconomic indicators. We compute a relationship between means <b>of</b> the daily <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> opportunities and their standard deviations and confirm that it follows a scaling relationship with power law exponent α = 1. A possible model based on Poisson processes with intensity of which varies in time {{on the basis of a}} common noise is proposed to explain the phenomenon empirically observed...|$|R
30|$|Note {{that the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> interruptions {{seems to be}} a {{relatively}} important determinant of employment stability compared to the results found for some of the UIS parameter estimates. In our estimation, entitlement to and duration of benefits affect the probability <b>of</b> having a <b>job</b> interruption, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> interruptions affects subsequent employment stability. Hence, to understand the dynamic effects of entitlement duration on employment stability, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> interruptions and open-ended contracts should be taken into account.|$|R

5|$|Born near Glasgow, Reid {{worked a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> {{as a young}} adult—including wholesaler, army medic (during the Second Boer War), farmhand, lumberjack, and dentist—and immigrated to Canada in 1903. He {{involved}} himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated him {{to run in the}} 1921 provincial election as its candidate in Vermilion. The UFA won the election, and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism. When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Interstate 5 and State Route 9 {{in the late}} 1960s brought increased residential development in Arlington, forming a bedroom community for commuters who worked in Everett and Seattle. Suburban housing developments began construction in the 1980s and 1990s, driving a 450 percent increase in Arlington's population to 15,000 by 2007. In 1999, Arlington annexed the community of Smokey Point, located along Interstate 5 to the southwest of the city, after a lengthy court battle with Marysville, which instead was permitted to annex Lakewood to the west. The city began developing a large business park around the municipal airport in the 1990s, bringing the city's <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> {{to a total of}} 11,000 by 2003.|$|E
5|$|Bertie's Brainstorm is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Bertie Fawcett, a dim-witted fop, who erroneously believes to have won the heart of May Vernon. In reality, May loves Jack and the two are set to be married, but May's father wishes he would prove his worth by earning his own living. Bertie chances upon the letter and sets off {{to make a living}} proceeds through a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> with hope to claim May as his bride. The film ends with Bertie returning and finding out that May has married Jack. Little is known about the production of the film save that William Russell played an unknown role and that the scenario was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The foppish character of Bertie may have been inspired by Edwin Thanhouser's role as Bertie Nizril in Thoroughbred. Originally conceived as a series, this ultimately singular work received praise from critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Mitch caused such {{massive and}} {{widespread}} damage that Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed {{fifty years of}} progress in the country. Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700tons of food, 11tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them {{a few days after}} the storm. They also at first offered only $2million (1998USD) in aid, which came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70million (1998USD). The Honduran government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, {{manufacturing}} is in decline, but {{the city}} boasts strong software, publishing and service-oriented industries, being home to companies such as Future plc and London & Country mortgage brokers. The city's attraction to tourists has also led to a significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> in tourism-related industries. Important economic sectors in Bath include education and health (30,000 jobs), retail, tourism and leisure (14,000 jobs) and business and professional services (10,000 jobs). Major employers are the National Health Service, the city's two universities, and the Bath and North East Somerset Council, {{as well as the}} Ministry of Defence although a number of MOD offices formerly in Bath have recently moved to Bristol. Growing employment sectors include information and communication technologies and creative and cultural industries where Bath is one of the recognised national centres for publishing, with the magazine and digital publisher Future plc employing around 650 people. Others include Buro Happold (400) and IPL Information Processing Limited (250). The city boasts over 400 retail shops, half of which are run by independent specialist retailers, and around 100 restaurants and cafes primarily supported by tourism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the influence of}} labor demand for new PhD recipients on time to the doctorate. Researchers and practitioners in graduate education have long been interested in this relationship, but empirical investigation has been hampered by the difficulty of measuring labor demand. I construct a measure of labor demand based on the annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> listings from 1975 to 2005 in seven fields in the humanities and social sciences. My empirical strategy relates cyclical variation in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> listings within a field to the timing of completion using student-level data on all doctorates awarded by U. S. universities in these fields. Estimates from a discrete-time duration model indicate that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> listings is not correlated with expected time to degree. This finding implies that cyclical variation in labor demand in the academic labor market is not responsible for changes in time to degree within fields...|$|R
50|$|The {{selection}} ratio (SR), on {{the other}} hand is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> openings n divided by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> applicants N. This value will range between 0 and 1, reflecting the selectivity of the organization's hiring practices. When the SR is equal to 1 or greater, the use of any selection device has little meaning, but this is not often the case as there are usually more applicants than job openings. Finally, the base rate is defined by the percentage of employees thought to be performing their jobs satisfactorily following measurement.|$|R
30|$|The second way {{in which}} a gap has emerged is at the {{aggregate}} level. Using the SES data alongside Labour Force Survey data a picture can be built up of the aggregate supplies and demands for workers at each broad level of qualifications (Felstead et al. 2007). This analysis has shown a large fall since 1986 in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> held by people with no qualifications, reflecting the expansion of the education system; but the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> which require no qualifications fell much more slowly. Similarly, {{at the other end of}} the spectrum, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> graduates in the labour force has begun, especially in recent years, to outpace the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> graduate <b>jobs.</b> This is why, increasingly, some graduates are finding themselves in lower-ranking jobs.|$|R
