50|$|In the {{procedure}} of hypothesis testing, {{one needs to}} form the joint distribution of test statistics to conduct the test and control type I errors. However, the true distribution is often unknown and a proper <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> ought {{to be used to}} represent the data. For example, one sample and two samples tests of means can use t statistics which have Gaussian <b>null</b> <b>distribution,</b> while F statistics, testing k groups of population means, which have Gaussian quadratic form the <b>null</b> <b>distribution.</b> The <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> is defined as the asymptotic distributions of null quantile-transformed test statistics, based on marginal <b>null</b> <b>distribution.</b> During practice, the test statistics of the <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> is often unknown, since it relies on the unknown data generating distribution. Resampling procedures, such as non-parametric or model-based bootstrap, can provide consistent estimators for the null distributions. Improper choice of the <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> poses significant influence on type I error and power properties in the testing process. Another approach to obtain the test statistics <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> is to use the data of generating <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> estimation.|$|E

40|$|Aim Geographic {{distributions}} of species are constrained by several factors acting at different scales, with climate {{assumed to be}} a major determinant at broad extents. Recent studies, however, have challenged this statement and indicated that climate may not dominate among the factors governing geographic {{distributions of}} species. Here, we argue that these results are misleading {{due to the lack of}} consideration of the geographic area that has been accessible to the species. Location North America. Methods We generated <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> for 75 North American endemic and 19 non-endemic bird species. For each species, climatic envelopes of observed and <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> were modelled using neural networks and generalized linear models, and seven climatic predictors. Values of the area under the receiver–operating characteristic curve (AUC) based on models of observed distributions were com-pared with corresponding AUC values for the <b>null</b> <b>distributions.</b> Results More than 82 % of the endemic species showed AUC higher for the observed than for the <b>null</b> <b>distributions,</b> while 63 % of the non-endemic species showed such a pattern. Main conclusions We demonstrate a dominant climatic signal in shaping North American bird distributions. Our results attest to the importance of climate in determining species distributions and support the use of climate-envelope models for estimating potential distributional areas at the appropriate spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|Olson’s conditional-logistic model {{retains the}} nice {{property}} of the LOD score formulation and has advantages over other methods that make it an appropriate choice for complex trait linkage mapping. However, the asymptotic distribution of the conditional-logistic likelihood-ratio (CL-LR) statistic with genetic constraints on the model parameters is unknown for some analysis models, even {{in the case of}} samples comprising only independent sib pairs. We derive approximations to the asymptotic <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> of the CL-LR statistics and compare them with the empirical <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> by simulation using independent affected sib pairs. Generally, the empirical <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> of the CL-LR statistics match well the known or approximated asymptotic distributions for all analysis models considered except for the covariate model with a minimum-adjusted binary covariate. This work will provide useful guidelines for linkage analysis of real data sets for the genetic analysis of complex traits, thereby contributing to the identification of genes for disease traits...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in large scale testing. Large sample size allows us to {{implement}} a more realistic empirical <b>null</b> <b>distribution.</b> One can generate the empirical null using an MLE fitting algorithm. Under a Bayesian framework, the large-scale studies allow the <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> to be put into a probabilistic context with its non-null counterparts. When sample size n is large, like over 10,000, the empirical nulls utilize a study's own data to estimate an appropriate <b>null</b> <b>distribution.</b> The important assumption is that due to the large proportion of null cases ( [...] > 0.9), the data can show the <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> itself. The theoretical null may fail in some cases, which is not completely wrong but needs adjustment accordingly. In the large-scale data sets, it is easy to find the deviations of data from the ideal mathematical framework, e.g, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. In addition, the correlation across sampling units and unobserved covariates may lead to wrong theoretical <b>null</b> <b>distribution.</b> Permutation methods are frequently used in multiple testing to obtain an empirical <b>null</b> <b>distribution</b> generated from data. Empirical null methods were introduced with the central matching algorithm in Efron's paper.|$|E

40|$|Genes {{that are}} more closely spaced on the {{chromosome}} than expected by chance {{are said to be}} spatially clustered. Standard tests of clustering versus uniformity do not take into account two important features of genes—the high variability of gene length and the low probability that gene locations overlap (exclusion). We show by simulation that the standard <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> which ignore length and exclusion do not appropriately approximate the true <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> of standard tests such as the chi-squared test. We therefore recommend bootstrap sampling to estimate the <b>null</b> <b>distributions.</b> Simulations demonstrate that the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test is a more powerful test of clustering than two other commonly used tests—Kolmogorov and Cramer–von Mises—when the distribution of gene lengths and locations is modeled by a mixture of exponentials and there is a single cluster. The chi-squared test requires binning the gene locations—the number of genes in the bin can be compared to the expected maximum number under random distribution to determine the location of gene clusters and gene deserts. The bootstrap method to test clustering is illustrated using data from human chromosome 22...|$|R
40|$|A {{randomization}} test {{based on}} scaled factorial moments {{was developed to}} identify and determine the statistical significance of intermittency in single-event normally-distributed Gaussian distributions. A total of 96 simulated intermittent distributions based on standard normal Gaussian distributions of size N= 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, and 32000 containing induced holes and spikes were tested for intermittency. Nonintermittent <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> were also simulated {{as part of the}} test. A log-linear model was developed to simultaneously test the significance of fit coefficients for the y-intercept and slope contribution to ln(F 2) vs. ln(M) from both the intermittent and <b>null</b> <b>distributions.</b> Statistical power was also assessed for each fit coefficient to reflect the proportion of times out of 1000 tests each coefficient was statistically significant, given the induced effect size and sample size of the Gaussians. Results indicate that the slope of ln(F 2) vs. ln(M) for intermittent distributions increased with decreasing sample size, due to artificially-induced holes occurring in sparse histograms. For intermittent Gaussians with 4000 variates, there was approximately 70 % power to detect a slope difference of 0. 02 between intermittent and <b>null</b> <b>distributions.</b> For sample sizes of 8000 and greater, there was more than 70 % power to detect a slope difference of 0. 01. The randomization test performed satisfactorily since the power of the test for intermittency decreased with decreasing sample size. Power was near-zero when the test was applied to <b>null</b> <b>distributions.</b> The randomization test can be used to establish the statistical significance of intermittency in empirical Gaussian distributions...|$|R

Results: With unbalanced data, permutation tests may not be suitable {{because they do not}} test the hypothesis of interest. In addition, permuta-tion tests can be biased. Using biased p-values to estimate the false discovery rate can produce unacceptable bias in those estimates. Results also show that the approach of pooling permutation <b>null</b> <b>distributions</b> across genes can pro-duce invalid p-values, since evennon-differentially-expressedgenescan have different permutation <b>null</b> <b>distributions.</b> We encourage researchers to use sta-tistics that have been shown to reliably discriminate differentially-expressed genes, but caution that associated p-values may be either invalid, or a less effective metric for discriminating differentially-expressed genes. ...|$|R
