40|$|DE 10106553 A UPAB: 20021105 NOVELTY - A fat-reduced, e. g. Frankfurter sausage, is {{prepared}} by employing lean meat with staged reduction process incorporating ice {{and water to}} achieve finest texture. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The production stages are as follows. Mince lean, virtually fat-free meat, and cool down to 0 - 3 deg. C. Comminute (by cutting) about 2 / 3 of the meat, adding spice, seasoning and phosphate and <b>nitrite</b> <b>pickling</b> <b>salt</b> and 250 - 300 g filling per kilo of meat, {{in the form of}} ice, up to 10 - 12 deg. C. Add the remaining, previously slightly frozen mince portion, and from about 50 - 70 g filling per kilo of total meat weight in the form of cooled water, in the processor (cutter). There reduce to sausage meat at 13 - 15 deg. C. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a sausage for heating in water, made as described, and containing only 2 - 3 % fat. USE - To make a low fat sausage for water-heating. ADVANTAGE - Use of lean meat and avoidance of fat as an additive reduces fat content of the product. By ice addition, comminution can be prolonged, resulting in a finer sausage meat, which can be emulsified without fat. Water addition together with the remaining meat, confers the required sheen to the meat, also preventing excessive dryness. A tasty, low-fat, e. g. Frankfurter-type sausage results...|$|E

50|$|<b>Pickling</b> <b>salt</b> is a salt {{that is used}} {{mainly for}} canning and {{manufacturing}} pickles. It is sodium chloride, as is table salt, but unlike most brands of table salt, it does not contain iodine or any anti caking products added. A widely circulated legend suggested that iodisation caused the brine of pickles to change color. This is false; however, some anti-caking agents are known to collect {{at the bottom of}} the jars, a minor aesthetic issue. <b>Pickling</b> <b>salt</b> is very fine-grained, to speed up dissolving in water to create a brine, so it is useful for solutions needing salt.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was about {{packaging}} methodologies and processing techniques to extend shelf [...] life of longan fruits (Dimocarpus longan). There were five types of processing techniques that had been used were crunchy longan pickle, longan <b>pickle,</b> longan dried <b>salted</b> <b>pickle,</b> longan syrup and dried longan. The types of packaging methodologies used in this study were air tight containers, sealed plastic bag, glass jar and vacuum packaging. The duration period of the experiment was about two months. All of the data collected was analyzed using SPSS Software with Two Way ANOVA methods. From the observation, it was found that the most suitable processing techniques to extend shelf [...] life of longan were crunchy longan <b>pickle,</b> longan dried <b>salted</b> <b>pickle</b> and dried longan since these three types of methods can extend the shelf —life of longan for about two months. For the packaging methodologies, all types of packaging were suitable to use for crunchy longan <b>pickle,</b> longan dried <b>salted</b> <b>pickle</b> and dried pickle since there were no significance difference occur between the usage of all four types of packaging besides for longan pickle and longan syrup. These were because the two types of longan processing techniques become rotten after one week of storage. In conclusion, the most suitable processing techniques to preserve the longan fruits were crunchy longan <b>pickle,</b> longan dried <b>salted</b> <b>pickle</b> and dried longan by using air tight container, sealed plastic bag, glass jar and vacuum packaging methodologie...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and characteristics of}} water in the muscle of various commercially available Icelandic heavily salted Atlantic cod products were analyzed with proton magnetic resonance methods. The products varied in choice of catching method, in pre- or post-rigor processing, flattening or filleting cut, and pre-salting technique (brine injection with salt with/without polyphosphates, brining and pickling) and choice of brine-injection instruments. All products had heterogeneous water distributions, but the level of heterogeneity was dependent on the handling during processing. Brine injection led to salt-induced swelling, which effect remained after the kench dry salting step. Double brine injection induced needle traces in the muscle, even after kench salting. Relaxation time analysis indicated that <b>pickle</b> <b>salted</b> products had the highest degree of protein denaturation in the muscle amongst the analyzed pre-salting methods.
