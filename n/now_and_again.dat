25|$|Despite Giovanni Battista Mancini's {{claim that}} Hasse was the padre della musica, {{and despite the}} composer's massive {{popularity}} as a figure at the very forefront of 18th-century serious Italian opera, after his death Hasse's reputation vastly declined and his music lay mostly unperformed (with the exception {{of some of his}} sacred works, which were revived <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> in Germany). In particular, his operas sank without trace and revival only begun as the 20th century approached its end: Gluck's reforms took opera away from Hasse's style and Metastasio's Arcadian ideals to a new direction from which it would not return.|$|E

25|$|Roger Smyth was {{the first}} of Trevor’s two Ph.D. {{students}} and Trevor always spoke enthusiastically about their work together, which spanned many years. Roger was employed as a civil servant in the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services, and so did his Mathematics outside of his working hours. Apart from the fact that Trevor got on very well with Roger, it suited Trevor to have Roger among his Northern Ireland friends and informants on political matters. In a different way, Alastair Gillespie was well placed in Edinburgh where there were rugby matches to attend every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> while the Cork connection with Gerard was a different kind of overlap of interests.

500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial.

500|$|The {{song was}} redone by the Will & Grace cast as [...] "He's Hot" [...] for the sitcom's soundtrack in 2004 and even {{includes}} vocal samples from Madonna herself.

500|$|The {{backstage}} drama {{portrayed in}} the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage {{about the same time}} she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health {{as a result of her}} diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: [...] "I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love." [...] The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said [...] "I hate that show." [...] According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though not in the same category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success.|$|E
500|$|Hutton's batting {{technique}} was orthodox and conventional. John Woodcock writes {{that he seemed}} to possess great intuition, for example playing mystery spinners Ramadhin and Iverson with ease. His batting stance was relaxed and still, his first movement being to slide his right foot back and across towards middle stump. He often played the ball off the back foot, getting right back onto his stumps, but never played as far forward, preferring to let the ball come to him and play it late. Occasionally, he left a slight gap between his bat and pads, meaning he was sometimes bowled through it when out of form. This arose mainly through the wartime injury to his arm and by 1950 he had adjusted his technique to compensate and had fewer problems. Immediately before the war, Hutton batted in a more attacking style and several of his contemporaries remembered his attractive strokeplay. By his own admission, Hutton was not the same player after the war. A combination of the effects of his injury and the responsibility of opening the batting in generally weak Yorkshire and England teams, whose success often depended on Hutton, meant that he batted cautiously. Hutton only played attacking shots when they presented no risk, and he rarely lifted the ball in the air; he hit just seven sixes in Test matches. However, Patrick Murphy writes: [...] "Just <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> he would play an innings of genius, when bowlers could not contain him." [...] One such innings was his score of 37 in the second Test of 1946–47 in which the attacking shots he played reminded older spectators of Victor Trumper, regarded as the ultimate Australian strokeplayer. In all his innings, he was expert at hitting the ball just {{out of the reach of}} fieldsmen to allow runs to be taken. Several of his contemporaries believed he did not get enough credit for surviving the short-pitched attacks of the Australian bowlers following the war.|$|E

500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{praise from}} video game journalists {{at the time}} of its release and in retrospect. Andy Greenwald of Spin magazine praised it as a frightening but [...] "restrained" [...] game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: [...] "Silent Hill 2 feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel." [...] IGN's Doug Perry wrote: [...] "It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's all I really want in a survival horror game." [...] Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original." [...] In [...] (2010), Tristian Donovan described Silent Hill 2 as the [...] "high point" [...] of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as [...] "one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the [...] "short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games". Online game critic for [...] The Escapist Magazine Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> to remind myself that for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending," [...] and that [...] "It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university.

Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E
