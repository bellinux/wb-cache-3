40|$|Cooling tower spray zones play an {{important}} role in cooling tower performance. Ideally they must distribute the cooling water uniformly onto the fill and must produce small drops at minimal pressure head to maximise heat and mass transfer in the spray zone with minimal pumping power. Limited thermal performance characteristic data is found in literature for cooling tower spray zones, since it is virtually impossible to measure spray zone performance accurately. In this paper, the method used to model the performance of cooling tower spray zones and results obtained for a medium pressure swirl nozzle are presented. Water flow distribution and drop size distribution tests are conducted on cooling tower spray nozzles to investigate the effects of varying different operating parameters, such as air and water flow rates, and installation parameters, such as nozzle height, <b>nozzle</b> <b>spacing</b> and direction of spray, on performance.

The effects of cross flow onimpinging twin-jet are also investigated. Calculated results show that several recirculatingzones distribute around the flow field.

The jet injector incorporated herbicides by jetting them up through nozzles in a manifold attached to a sweep, into soil that was fractured while passing over the blade. Jets penetrated up into the soil, improving weed control. Diffusion or mechanical mixing moved herbicides into untreated soil between herbicide bands. ^ <b>Nozzle</b> <b>spacing,</b> orifice size, and operating specifications were determined. <b>Nozzle</b> <b>spacing</b> was found by measuring weed control from trifluralin ((alpha),(alpha),(alpha) -trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine) injected in parallel lines into greenhouse flats. Herbicide was applied through a 50. 8 cm jet injector sweep to test, in the field, the two best nozzle spacings determined in the greenhouse experiment. Nozzles spaced 2 cm apart produced the best weed control. A computer simulation of trifluralin diffusion between jet bands showed the herbicide required 4 to 8 days to diffuse between 2 cm bands. Soil compaction reduced the rate of diffusion. ^ Relationships among jet penetration distance, nozzle size and type, and sweep operating variables were studied by injecting a fluorescent tracer through the injector sweep or down into disturbed soil.

Two-dimensional temperature distributions in SF 6, Ar, Ar/SF 6 gas-blast arcs were calculated in a steady state at a direct current of 50 A. Furthermore, transient temperature distributions in these arcs were computed under free recovery condition for a fundamental study. We investigated dependences of the gas mixture ratio of SF 6 to Ar and the gas flow velocity on the arc temperature and the arc voltage. The calculated arc voltage in the steady state and the transition of electron density under free recovery condition were compared with those obtained by laser Thomson scattering method in our experiments. As a result, the increasing admixture ratio of SF 6 to Ar and the increasing gas flow velocity shrinks the arc plasma around nozzle throat inlet, leading to the higher arc resistance. Under free recovery condition, the arc plasma decay more rapidly there.
