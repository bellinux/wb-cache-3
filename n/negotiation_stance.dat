To this end, we present an empirical study showing the relative success of different strategies against different types of opponent in different environments. In particular we adopt an evolutionary approach in which strategies and tactics correspond to the genetic material in a genetic algorithm. We conduct a series of experiments to determine the most successful strategies and to see how and when these strategies evolve {{depending on the context}} and <b>negotiation</b> <b>stance</b> of the agents opponent...|$|E
40|$|In open {{environments in}} which {{autonomous}} agents can break contracts, computational models of trust {{have an important role}} to play in determining who to interact with and how interactions unfold. To this end, we develop such a trust model, based on confidence and reputation, and show how it can be concretely applied, using fuzzy sets, to guide agents in evaluating past interactions and in establishing new contracts with one another. Agents generally interact by engaging in some form of negotiation process which results in them making commitments to (contracts with) one another to carry out particular tasks (Jennings et al. 2001). However, in most realistic environments, {{there is no guarantee that}} a contracted agent will actually enact its commitments (because it may defect to gain higher utility or because there is uncertainty about whether the task can actually be achieved). In such situations, computational models of trust (here defined as the positive expectation that an interaction partner will act benignly and cooperatively in situations where defecting would prove more profitable to itself [Dasgupta 1998]) have an important role to play. First, to help determine the most reliable interaction partner (i. e., those in which the agent has the highest trust). Second, to influence the interaction process itself (e. g., an agent’s <b>negotiation</b> <b>stance</b> may vary according to the opponent’s trust level). Third, to define th...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a potential Philippines-European Union (EU) free trade agreement (FTA) on the agricultural sector. Static analysis indicates that potential gains to the agricultural sector of the Philippines are limited, primarily owing to the low size of initial agricultural trade with EU (compared to other trading partners), as well as moderate to low tariff and other trade barriers to EU products entering the country. CGE analysis confirms that the overall impact of bilateral tariff elimination leads to an overall increase in agricultural output, accompanied by a decline in price; hence, there is an increase in consumption of agricultural products. Impact on poverty is likewise positive, with improvements biased to the poorer households. By subsector, the largest output gains are projected for seaweeds and sugarcane, with 0. 80 percent and 0. 50 percent, respectively; increased access on EU markets are favorable for Filipino exporters of seaweeds, other fiber crops, tobacco leaf, forestry, ornamental plants, raw coffee, abaca, and cocoa. Meanwhile, the subsectors that are on the losing side (as shown by declining output) are cattle, raw rubber, chicken, and hogs. Fears about the negative repercussions of a Philippines-EU FTA on the poor turn out to be unfounded. Poverty incidence declines, and more so in rural than in urban areas. The greater decrease in poverty gap and squared poverty gap, compared with poverty incidence, implies that those who belong to households below the poverty threshold get the most benefits. It would seem that expectations of large benefits from a Philippines-EU FTA will not be found in agriculture, but elsewhere. Conversely, the agricultural sector does not face significant harm from a Philippines-EU FTA, even one involving sensitive products. Relaxation of trade barriers to EU even for sensitive products is warranted; not only would consumers gain (though minimally), but such a <b>negotiation</b> <b>stance</b> may serve as a powerful bargaining chip for gaining concessions on other areas...|$|E

40|$|We employ an {{empirical}} {{general equilibrium model}} of the CAP to determine which factors and countries {{would be expected to}} be opposed to or support reform of the CAP. The objective is to determine who the "friends" and "enemies" of the CAP are. The analysis studies the extent to which lobbying activity by these interested parties could be expected to encourage or discourage internal EC reform of the CAP. Several alternative polices to reform the CAP are evaluated in this manner, so as to determine if one or other set of policies has greater chance of being accepted. Specifically, we study the recent MacSharry proposals for reform, as well as the stated negotiating positions presented at the GATT. The result will be a summary assessment of the relative politico-economic acceptability of these reform proposals within the EC. Our results lead to a very simple policy conclusion. Given the se of policy packages considered here, {{there is little doubt that}} the EC is most inclined to adopt the full MacSharry proposal. This suggests that pushing the U. S. or Helstrom proposals is not likely to lead to EC acceptance unless the EC receives significant compensation from other aspects of the multilateral trade negotiations. If one is just looking for a reform package in agriculture that can be negotiated without consideration of other types of sidepayments than the full MacSharry proposal would have to be the favorite from the EC perspective. Without further disaggregation of the analysis to identify the U. S. or Japan we can only note that the full MacSharry proposal is the best of the group as far as overall welfare goes for the rest of the world. Of course, agricultural interests in the rest of the world have strong preference for the U. S. proposal. These results also imply that a <b>negotiation</b> <b>stance</b> that called the EC to implement the "raw" MacSharry proposal without the elaborate scheme of sidepayments that are built into it would be dangerous. It would cause agricultural interests within the EC to change from being supporters of reform to being staunch opponents. Again, in the absence of sidepayments being effected to the EC from other aspects of the overall trade negotiations on non-agricultural matters, one would not encourage dismantling of the sidepayments scheme that is part of the full MacSharry proposal. ...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} {{a panoply of}} tools and {{techniques}} to manage inter-agent dependencies in open, distributed multi-agent systems that have significant degrees of uncertainty. In particular, we focus on situations in which agents are involved in repeated interactions {{where they need to}} negotiate to resolve conflicts that may arise between them. To this end, we endow agents with decision making models that exploit the notion of trust and use persuasive techniques during the negotiation process to reduce the level of uncertainty and achieve better deals in the long run. Firstly, we develop and evaluate a new trust model (called CREDIT) that allows agents to measure the degree of trust they should place in their opponents. This model reduces the uncertainty that agents have about their opponents' reliability. Thus, over repeated interactions, CREDIT enables agents to model their opponents' reliability using probabilistic techniques and a fuzzy reasoning mechanism that allows the combination of measures based on reputation (indirect interactions) and confidence (direct interactions). In so doing, CREDIT takes a wider range of behaviour-influencing factors into account than existing models, including the norms of the agents and the institution within which transactions occur. We then explore a novel application of trust models by showing how the measures developed in CREDIT ca be applied negotiations in multiple encounters. Specifically we show that agents that use CREDIT are able to avoid unreliable agents, both during the selection of interaction partners and during the negotiation process itself by using trust to adjust their <b>negotiation</b> <b>stance.</b> Also, we empirically show that agents are able to reach good deals with agents that are unreliable to some degree (rather than completely unreliable) and with those that try to strategically exploit their opponent. Secondly, having applied CREDIT to negotiations, we further extend the application of trust to reduce uncertainty about the reliability of agents in mechanism design (where the honesty of agents is elicited by the protocol). Thus, we develop tbmd that allows agents using a trust model (such as CREDIT) to reach efficient agreements that choose the most reliable agents in the long run. In particular, we show that our mechanism enforces truth-telling from the agents (i. e. it is incentive compatible), both about their perceived reliability of their opponent and their valuations for the goods to be traded. In proving the latter properties, our trust-based mechanism is shown to be the first reputation mechanism that implements individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and efficiency. Our trust-based mechanism is also empirically evaluated and shown to be better than other comparable models in reaching the outcome that maximises all the negotiating agents' utilities and in choosing the most reliable agents in the long run. Thirdly, having explored ways to reduce uncertainties about reliability and honesty, we use persuasive negotiation techniques to tackle issues associated with uncertainties that agents have about the preferences and the space of possible agreements. To this end, we propose a novel protocol and reasoning mechanism that agents can use to generate and evaluate persuasive elements, such as promises of future rewards, to support the offers they make during negotiation. These persuasive elements aim to make offers more attractive over multiple encounters given the absence of information about an opponent's discount factors or exact payoffs. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate that agents are able to achieve a larger number of agreements and a higher expected utility over repeated encounters when they are given the capability to give or ask for rewards. Moreover, we develop a novel strategy using this protocol and show that it outperforms existing state of the art heuristic negotiation models. Finally, the applicability of persuasive negotiation and CREDIT is exemplified through a practical implementation in a pervasive computing environment. In this context, the negotiation mechanism is implemented in an instant messaging platform (JABBER) and used to resolve conflicts between group and individual preferences that arise in a meeting room scenario. In particular, we show how persuasive negotiation and trust permit a flexible management of interruptions by allowing intrusions to happen at appropriate times during the meeting while still managing to satisfy the preferences of all parties present.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the politics of}} international liberalization generally supposes that incumbent firms with important stakes in their home markets will lobby against the entrance of foreign competitors. This should be especially true in the markets of network services, which were traditionally structured around monopoly provision in most countries. Yet, are dominant firms really opposed to the liberalization of their markets? This dissertation studies the lobbying of incumbents concerning the international service trade negotiations in two sectors – telecommunications and air transport – and two countries – the US and the EU. It demonstrates that large service providers have actually lobbied in support of the liberalization of their sectors, with the exception of US airlines which prefer preserving the current system. Seeking to explain this support for liberalization, the dissertation examines the weight of four variables that might determine the policy stances of large firms: (1) economic incentives, (2) domestic regulatory traditions, (3) international regimes and (4) policy processes. In line with traditional trade policy literature, it finds that economic incentives play an important role, but it also highlights the effect of political processes and institutions on the trade preferences of economic actors. In particular, the multi-level process of EU policy making provides an incentive to lobby in support of liberalization. On a more theoretical note, the analysis of business-government interactions over time highlights the importance of endogenizing the preferences of economic actors into a theory of the policy process, as preferences evolve {{over the course of a}} firm’s lobbying activities. La littérature sur la politique de la libéralisation internationale présuppose généralement que les entreprises dominantes sur leurs marchés domestiques s'opposent à l'ouverture au concurrents étrangers. Ceci devrait être particulièrement vrai pour des marchés de service de réseaux, qui étaient traditionnellement gérés par des monopoles, souvent publics. Or, les entreprises dominantes, s'opposent-elles vraiment à la libéralisation de leurs marchés domestiques ? Cette thèse examine le lobbying des entreprises dominantes vis-à-vis de la libéralisation internationale de leurs secteurs en service de télécommunications et de transport aérien en s'intéressant à deux pays, les Etats-Unis et l'Union européenne. Nous démontrons que ces entreprises se sont en fait exprimer en faveur de la libéralisation, avec l'exception des compagnies aériennes américaines. Afin de comprendre ce soutien, nous s'interrogeant sur le poids de quatre variables qui peuvent déterminer les préférences politiques de ces entreprises : (1) des incitations économiques, (2) des traditions réglementaires au niveau domestique, (3) le régime international qui gouverne le secteur et (4) le processus politiques dans lequel participent les entreprises. En accord avec la littérature traditionnelle sur le lobbying en matière de commerce extérieur, nous trouvons que les incitations économiques jouent un rôle important, mais nous soulignons également les effets du processus et des institutions politiques sur la formation et l'évolution des préférences. En particulier, nous montrons que le système à plusieurs niveaux de l'UE encourage un lobbying en faveur de libéralisation alors que le processus américain permet des demandes politiques plus variables. Sur une note théorique, l'analyse des interactions entre gouvernements et entreprises dans la durée souligne l'importance de considérer comme endogène au processus du commerce les préférences des acteurs économiques, surtout dans l'analyse de la politique européenne.

A 2004 study {{examined}} China's agriculture markets {{to determine if}} China continued to liberalize after joining the WTO. It found China did liberalize and assessed this would continue. Coincident with joining the WTO, China participated in the Doha agriculture negotiations. In 2003 and 2006 the negotiations collapsed and in 2008, China sided with India and talks collapsed again. Had China reverted to protectionism, moving from market liberalization? What did liberalization indicators and <b>negotiations</b> <b>stances</b> from 2003 to 2008 tell about China's liberalization efforts? Since 2003, China met WTO obligations early and {{was not prepared to}} further lower market access barriers. In negotiations, the sticking point was and continues to be developed members' large domestic supports, subsidies, and special benefits. Statements also point to a emerging developing nations' alliance which support China and India. With this support, the G- 20 will continue to act as the developing world's negotiator.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} identities {{that are made}} {{available}} {{and how they are}} negotiated over time in a second language classroom. Like any classroom, second language classrooms do not exist in a vacuum, they are socially, culturally, politically and historically located. Choices at the political level, about selecting the language to be taught, and at the institutional level, about staffing, timetabling, curriculum content, resources, pedagogy, classroom management, are all inherently ideological. This view of the classroom as a site constituted at the intersection of different ideologies and cultures, of multiple and often conflicting discourses, challenges the notion of language learning as an abstract cognitive process, and has significant implications for the construction of learners' cultural identities as they are negotiated in the micro-politics of second language classrooms (Pennycook, 2000). This study focuses on one student, Nancy and analyses her discoursal journey over the period of a nine month period in a primary second language (Indonesian) class. The concept of 'voice (Bakhtin, 1981) is deployed in this study as an analytical tool to examine dialogic encounters: the sites of <b>negotiation</b> where <b>stances</b> are taken up, and we negotiate our place and positioning towards others with the voices available and in response to the voices of others (Hall, 1995). The study considers what kinds of people are being shaped and are shaping our world in the uneasy tensions between the neo-liberal underpinnings and market driven logic of second language policies, community concerns about security and increased nationalism, and a curriculum that explicitly aspires to the development of intercultural identities.

5000|$|Among the {{explanations}} of the Croat-Bosniak war is that the Croatian policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina was dictated by Tuđman's personal views and his close associates, in particular the Defence Minister Gojko Šušak and the so-called Herzegovina lobby, an interpretation that Croatian-American historian James J. Sadkovich described as a [...] "classic conspiracy theory". In May 1990, Tuđman said that Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] "form a geographic and political whole, {{and in the course}} of history they were generally in a single united state", but suggested that its citizens should [...] "decide their own fate through a referendum". He doubted that Bosnia and Herzegovina could survive the dissolution of Yugoslavia, but supported its integrity if it remained outside a Yugoslav federation and Serbian influence. In his official statements, Tuđman advocated for an integral Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to Sabrina P. Ramet, it was done in an effort to confuse foreign audiences of his intents and placate the international community. Tuđman supported Croatia's territorial integrity, but held that the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina were open to <b>negotiation.</b> His <b>stance</b> was emboldened by the unclear and confusing policy of the international community regarding the Bosnian war and the Serb held areas in Croatia. British historian Mark Almond wrote that [...] "almost all respectable international opinion ... doubted the viability and legitimacy of an integral Bosnia and Herzegovina." [...] Interpretations of Tuđman's actions go from statements that he behaved as a rational opportunist, to claims that he had from the outset a collaborationist policy with the Serbs on the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an aim of ethnic cleansing, whereas others call that an assumption with no convincing evidence, arguing that if Croats and Serbs had been jointly waging a war against Bosniaks, there would have been no Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|R

Firstly, that the US acted primarily as facilitator of communication rather than formulator or manipulator. Secondly, it assumes that the US was not successful in the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict due to a relatively scarce exercise of its leverage in the process of mediation.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} epistemic {{practices in}} broadcast television interviews, focusing on three different interview genres: celebrity interviews, sports interviews and political interviews. In the analysis I examine the linguistic and interactional {{practices that are}} used to construct knowledge in the interviews. These practices include mobilization of different types of knowledge, use of assessments to invite first-hand knowledge, <b>negotiation</b> of epistemic <b>stances</b> while disaligning with the question, and use of assessments for claiming or contesting epistemic rights to authority and expertise. The study comprises four articles and a summary. Article I focuses on celebrity interviews and analyzes how different types of knowledge can be invoked by the participants in a way that enables them to manage the level of intimacy of the interview. Article II explores the interviewers´ use of assessments and evaluations in sports interviews in eliciting athletes´ personal experience regarding their preceding performance. Article III examines political interviews, focusing on instances where politicians, in their answering turns, resist some aspect of the question and negotiate an independent epistemic stance. Article IV also investigates political interviews, concentrating on assessments embedded in questioning sequences. The results of article IV show how assessments contribute to the negotiation of institutional identities and rights to knowledge and authority. The data consists of interviews where English is used as a common language between participants who come from different linguistic backgrounds. This study contributes to the literature on second language interaction by bringing new insights into how second language interaction is conducted in the media, a public sphere of society. The results of this study provide new information on how knowledge is socially constructed and negotiated in different interview genres as part of, and often embedded in, actions that characterize those genres...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with explicating the role of language in mobilising action through management emails. Situated {{within the context of}} organisational change in a globalised manufacturing business, the project is framed by behavioural observations from management scholars Palmer and Hardy (2000) of mobilisation strategies that utilise linguistic resources since they: (a) involve a sense of obligation or inclination in directives; (b) show how co-operation will produce mutual benefits; (c) construct desired actions as legitimate, beneficial or inevitable; and (d) use past or anticipated meanings, for or against certain actions. Systemic Functional Linguistics is the underlying framework employed to provide a theoretically principled account of the intuitively derived observations from Palmer and Hardy (2000) which are applied to a sample of twenty-seven email texts, through corpus- and text-based analysis. A major finding is that the representation of action is enacted interpersonally through the verbal group. This view complements experientially dominated accounts of the verbal group which focus on the tense system. Further, action is found to be motivated through the <b>negotiation</b> of evaluative <b>stance.</b> By relating the grammar of the verbal group as well as other resources to the discourse semantics of Appraisal, modulation (of obligation or inclination) is found to be enabled by both negative as well as positive judgements of capacity. Specifically, judgements of capacity are re-interpreted as invocations of high obligation as managers seek to mobilise (further) positive performance. The analysis demonstrates that elements in the verbal group (complex) and Appraisal co-opt action through enabling positioning of the writer, in terms of assessing and grading categorical meanings, manipulating interpersonal time, or foregrounding solidarity. A significant contribution to the thesis is an extension of the system of GRADUATION: FOCUS (Hood, 2004 a) through the demonstration of how resources of the verbal group negotiate expectations of appearances and achievements. This study has also extended the resources of GRADUATION: FORCE by applying it to the management context. The practical contribution of the study is that these insights may more explicitly inform management training and enable managers to participate more effectively within their community of practice...|$|R
