Thomas later {{announced that he was}} leaving the series, and Sachs and Judah were hired to write {{a new version of the}} script. Casting began before the script was completed, and several cast members of the original series were approached, of whom several accepted to appear. Reviews of the episode were mixed, and one critic explained, [...] "it's not a great show but it's not a terrible teen drama, <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> shot. The new 90210 turns out to be a solid sequel with plenty of shout-outs to fans of the old 90210." ...|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneous Catalysis is {{undoubtedly}} a key technology in modern chemical industry. Nowadays, most processes in chemical production are catalyzed by solid catalysts. It is thus {{not surprising that}} researchers worldwide try to improve existing catalysts or to develop completely new ones. The performance of solid catalysts is determined by their composition but {{to a great extent}} also by morphological properties. Control of particle shape and pore topology are thus crucial factors for high performance catalysts. Many interesting approaches have been reported in recent years and the present contribution tries to summarize some of them.

If one looks, however, at the often vicious quarreling in our own day not only between Christian and non-Christian but often also between Christian and Christian, on matters pertaining to the religious nature, aim and methods of the arts, then it would seem as if the age-old controversy between church and the arts has <b>not</b> been resolved <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> shot...|$|R

In the international context the central challenges result from the following trends: ? Changes in the framework of conditions for international trade (WTO agreements), which offer new opportunities for the export sector, but can also be expected to intensify competition and thus the pressure for adjustment; ? the transition in eastern Europe, the opening up of China and developments in Latin America, all of which, on the one hand, offer new sales markets for German companies, but on the other create new competitive relations and alternative locations for production and investment; ? the trend towards globalisation, which is gradually dissolving traditional ties to production locations...|$|R

In Quintus Smyrneaus' story, Polydamas actually suggests {{that instead of}} attacking or fleeing, the Trojans should just give Helen back to the Greeks.

60|$|Mary {{had often}} felt {{something}} like remorse {{at the thought}} that the first time she read Martin Chuzzlewit, many touches in the delineation of Mr. Pecksniff's character had reminded her of her father. She believed him to be a just and upright man, but she could not help admitting to herself that he was <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way the man the public believed him to be. It was a subject on which she rarely permitted herself to think. They had never got on very well together, and she acknowledged to herself that this was as much her fault as his. It was not so much {{the fact that she had}} a strong will and was bent on going her own way, regardless of the opinion of others, that had been the cause of the gulf which had grown up between them, as the dissimilarity of their character, the absolute difference between the view which she held of things in general, to that which the rest of her family entertained regarding them, and the outspoken frankness with which she was in the habit of expressing her contempt for things they praised highly.|$|E

In her written accounts of the journey for her mother and an eastern feminist newspaper, The Sibyl, she described her unsuccessful attempt to share guard duty, the “large, finely formed, and noble looking” Cheyenne and Arapaho men, and her delight at reaching the 14,000 foot summit of Pikes Peak.

Citing the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Hawkins summarized the observation this way: “Higher education no longer merely anticipates a revolution in computer use; the rev-olution is under way ” (p. 1). Now, nearly fifteen years later, the turbulence of the computer revolution is subsiding. The revolution is <b>not</b> over <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> shot, but information technology (IT) has found its way into every aspect of higher education institutions, and we are beginning to deal with it as a “grown-up ” instead of as the unruly youngster Hawkins and his contemporaries described in 1989. The purpose of this book is to take a new look at the role of IT in higher education from the perspective of trying to be good man-agers of this major institutional resource. We will find ourselves addressing some of the same old questions, some of which will have new answers and some the same old answers. In addition, some new questions have arisen, and some old ones have grown in importance...|$|R
40|$|Immune {{suppression}} is a {{very stable}} property of multipotent stromal cells also known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). All cell lines tested showed robust immune suppression <b>not</b> affected <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> culture history. Several mechanisms were described to account for this capability. Since several of the described mechanisms were not causing the immune suppression, the expression pattern of cord-blood-derived MSCs by microarray experiments was determined. Dendritic cells cocultured with cord blood MSCs were compared with cord blood MSCs. Putative immune suppressive candidates were tested to explain this inhibition. We find that cord blood MSCs themselves are hardly immunogenic as tested with allogeneic T-cells. Dendritic cells cocultured with second-party T-cells evoked abundant proliferation that was inhibited by third-party cord blood MSCs. Optimal inhibition was seen with one cord blood MSC for every dendritic cell. Blocking human leukocyte antigen G only saw partial recovery of proliferation. Several cytokines, gangliosides, enzymes like arginase, NO synthase, and indole amine 2, 3 -dioxygenase {{as well as the}} induction of Treg were not involved in the inhibition. The inhibiting moiety was identified as prostaglandin B 2 by lipid metabolite analysis of the culture supernatant and confirmed with purified prostaglandin B 2...|$|R
