We {{investigated}} {{the understanding of}} pre-service science teacher about the chemistry concept of middle school curriculum using some items in <b>National</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Achievement and analyzed the result according to back-ground variables of pre-service science teacher.

And the percentage of correct answer at some items was low regardless of selection of chemistry as an elective subject at CSAT(Col-lege Scholastic Ability Test). We found some facts through the depth interviews to find the cause of the result. First, the mis-conception acquired in middle school days is tend not to change until college student. Second, the formation of misconception is affected by the study habit with which solve problem by simple calculation and memory without essential understanding.

40|$|To {{attempt to}} measure trends over time seems a {{perfectly}} natural thing to do. It {{is a common}} activity, for example, when studying mortality rates, heights of children, or economic indicators such as the retail price index. In education the popular notion of "standards " is often linked closely to questions about changes in attainment or achievement over time. The <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Performance Unit (APU) in Britain and the <b>National</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Performance (NAEP) in the United States have both given a high priority to making inferences about trends in attainment over time (Gipps & Goldstein, 1983; Wirtz & Lapointe, 1982).

40|$|Policymakers, service providers, {{disability}} {{advocacy groups}} and researchers use disability statistics {{for a wide}} variety of purposes. A common problem that these groups encounter is finding a data source, a disability definition and/or a statistical method that provides them with a disability statistic that is both relevant to their needs and useful. The mission of the Cornell StatsRRTC is to bridge the divide between the sources of disability data and the users of disability statistics. One product of this effort is a series of User Guides to national survey data sets that collect information on the disability population. The purpose of each of the User Guides is to provide disability data users with: 1. An easily accessible guide to the disability information available in the nationally representative survey; 2. Estimates of the population with a disability, the disability prevalence rate, and estimates of participation-related statistics; 3. A description of the unique features of the dataset that will help disability statistics users determine whether the dataset can provide them with the statistic that they need; and 4. A description of how the dataset compares to other national data that are used to describe the population with disabilities. This User Guide contains information on the <b>National</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Programs (NAEP), also known as “the Nation 2 ̆ 7 s Report Card. ” Unlike the other data sources addressed by the User Guide Series, the NAEP focuses solely on children.

40|$|Reading is a {{challenge}} for many children, with 20 % of stu-dents having significant difficulties with reading acquisi-tion (Lyon & Moats, 1997). Reading difficulties often continue past third grade when {{students are expected to}} make the transition from learning to read to reading to learn. According to the <b>National</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Prog-ress, 36 % of fourth-graders have yet to obtain a basic skill level in reading and only 31 % read proficiently (United States Department of Education, 2005). Reading is also a typical need area for students with mild cognitive disabili-ties (Vaughn, Bos, & Schumm, 2007). Approximately 80 % of students with learning disabilities (LD) have identified needs in reading (Shapiro, Church, & Lewis, 2002). Read-ing is also the most common instructional area addressed for at-risk students served within Response to Intervention (RTI) frameworks (Council of Administrators of Special Education, 2009). Reading fluency, defined as the ability to read with speed, accuracy, and proper expression (Kuhn & Stahl, 2003), has been identified by the National Reading Panel as an essen-tial reading skill area (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), 2000). It is also a common skill deficit for students with and without disabilities (Therrien, Gormley, & Kubina, 2006 a). The ability to read a passage fluently is often a stronger predictor of compre-hension than direct measures of reading comprehension such as asking comprehension questions (Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, & Jenkins, 2001). Repeated reading, “a supplemental reading program that consists of re-reading a short and meaningful passage until a satisfactory level of fluency is reached ” (Samuels, 1979, p. 404) is an extensively researched fluency intervention that has been found to improve reading fluency of both students with and without disabilities (Bryant et al., 2000...|$|R

40|$|Maps are the {{integral}} tool of geography. The importance of maps to geographic literacy {{is reflected in}} the National Geography Standards (Geography Education Implementation Project 1994) : the first essential element, the World in Spatial Terms, details the significance of map comprehension to spatial thinking. Despite that centrality, there is little research which tells us how maps are used in the classroom. This study considers Texas teachers' instructional practices with regards to maps. The following questions are addressed: (1) what are teachers' beliefs and knowledge about maps; (2) what are teachers' practices regarding their use; and, (3) to what extent do teachers understand the curricular requirements related to maps? The study was conducted in two phases. During Phase I, a survey was completed by eighty-eight teacher-members of the Texas Alliance for Geographic Education. In Phase II, eleven teachers were selected from the pool of survey respondents for interviews and classroom observations. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative techniques. Analysis included evaluation of teachers' practices along a map skills continuum, which was adapted from <b>National</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Progress' (NAEP) standards in geography, the National Geography Standards, and the state curriculum, the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). The continuum evaluated teachers by grade (elementary, middle, or high school) and proficiency (basic, proficient, or advanced). Teachers in Phase II were representative of the grade and proficiency levels of the survey respondents. Results indicate that map instruction focuses on learning cartographic terminology, performing basic map tasks, and identifying locations. The more advanced tasks illustrated in the continuum are largely absent. The teachers in this study generally had a limited conceptualization of maps and their uses; that limited conceptualization constrained their practices and their understanding of the curricular requirements regarding map skills. Consequently, map instruction does not occur in the rich way conceptualized by the Standards, NAEP, or the TEKS. The implication is that teachers' conceptualization of maps must be improved. This goal could be accomplished by providing teachers with professional development experiences and curricular tools that will enhance their understanding of maps and their many uses...|$|R
