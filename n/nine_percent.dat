40|$|Introduction: Teachers' {{knowledge}} of self-directed learning {{and critical thinking}} are two predictors of learning in learners. This knowledge has impact on promotion of active learning process and academic achievement. This study evaluates the relation between tendency to critical thinking and self-direction in nursing and midwifery students and its role on their academic achievement. Methods: All undergraduate students of nursing and midwifery school Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (N= 550) were studies. Thirty <b>nine</b> <b>percents</b> (n= 214) of students responded (% 26 males and % 74 females). Method of study was descriptive.

DAB is a continuing concern for the auditing profession that can in turn have both direct and indirect impact on audit quality and negative effects on the auditing profession (e. g Enron, WorldCom in USA and Kimia Farma in Indonesia), that created public pressures to improve the audit process and the auditing profession. The prior survey (Otley and Pierce, 1995) on The Big Six suggested that eighty <b>nine</b> <b>percents</b> of auditors admitted to enganging in some form of audit quality reduction behavior (e. g.

On {{the basis of the}} nursing records of 128 patients, the patients were classified according to reasons for their stay in ICU, their staying period, and how they had left ICU to examine the necessity for family cares mainly from the point how families' sentiment and behaviors differed depending on patients' staying period in ICU. Nursing practice for family cares was evaluated in consideration of whether information about patients' families had been recorded or not. As a result, <b>nine</b> <b>percents</b> of the patients studied had left ICU by death and in case patients died within 3 days in ICU, no nurses in charge of them had been assigned to or no sufficient follow-up cares had been given to their families, while families' information of all the patients staying in ICU for more than 14 days was recorded, which indicated that nurses could share the information with patients' families to understand them. This research showed the importance not only of giving grief cares to the families who had lost their important person after a short stay in ICU, but also of evaluating continuous cares for families with patients in ICU for a long time, suggesting the need for some revision of the present care system to give mental as well as physical cares to both patients and their families regardless of staying period in ICU...|$|R

The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400.

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits.

The shrub Grewia hirsuta is frequently eaten. Preferred herbs include Helichrysum, Indigofera and Tinospora species and Leucas aspera. The {{four-horned antelope}} feeds on the leaves of trees such as Cordia wallichii, Emblica officinalis, Randia dumetorum and Zizyphus xylopyrus. Grasses comprise nearly 29 percent of the diet, followed by foliage from trees (nearly <b>nine</b> <b>percent).</b> Grass and browse were consumed in nearly equal proportions. A study in the Panna National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) showed preference for Zizyphus mauritiana, Acacia nilotica, A. leucophloea and A. catechu. Babool flowers were frequently eaten. The antelope often associates with langurs under fruiting trees, just as chital frequently do. Interaction with chital, a sympatric species, was infrequent. The antelope is wary when feeding, often raising its head and looking about its vicinity. The four-horned antelope needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources.|$|E
