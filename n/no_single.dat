5|$|According to Jainism, <b>no</b> <b>single,</b> {{specific}} statement {{can describe}} {{the nature of}} existence and the absolute truth. This knowledge (Kevala Jnana), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, <b>no</b> <b>single</b> morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E

5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples.

5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>single</b> explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} some {{controversy}} about this move, London {{was the first}} city in Canada (in May 2017) to decide to move a ranked choice ballot for municipal elections starting in 2018.

5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules.

5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>no</b> <b>single</b> English word {{is a true}} rhyme for orange, though there are half rhymes such as hinge, lozenge, syringe, flange, Stonehenge, or porridge. Although this property {{is not unique to}} the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on <b>no</b> <b>single</b> technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E

5|$|On St. Laurence's Day in 1500, Portuguese {{explorer}} Diogo Dias {{landed on}} the island and named it São Lourenço.

5|$|Similarly, {{observations}} of the nearby SN PTF 11kx, discovered January 16, 2011 (UT) by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), lead {{to the conclusion that}} this explosion arises from single-degenerate progenitor, with a red giant companion, thus suggesting there is <b>no</b> <b>single</b> progenitor path to SN Ia. Direct {{observations of}} the progenitor of PTF11kx were reported in the August 24 edition of Science and support this conclusion, and also show that the progenitor star experienced periodic nova eruptions before the supernova - another surprising discovery.|$|E
