In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>often</b> one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E

40|$|This {{response}} {{picks up}} on Valverde’s call for scholars to excavate contestable assumptions about {{space and time}} that are embedded in contemporary security arrangements. It does so by re-visiting the problem of time in punishment, focusing on how time works in sentencing and punishment theory compared to how it is experienced by prisoners. Time is both a central concern and banal quality of contemporary punishment, the most basic and so taken for granted dimension of modernity’s exemplary penal form – imprisonment. Sentencing theory operationalizes time through the principle of proportionality. The proportionality principle employs a uniform measure of time in which all prison sentences (or fine amounts or probation hours) of the same length equate to an identical amount of pain, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> to whom, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> or in what order they are applied. By contrast, recent research by Armstrong and Weaver on the lived experience of penal time contradicts in almost every way the temporality assumed in proportionality theory. Such findings expose not only asocial assumptions about time but show how empirical work can be relevant to and inform philosophical and normative thinking on punishment...|$|R
40|$|For {{analysis}} of a high-dimensional dataset, a common approach is to test a null hypothesis of statistical independence on all variable pairs using a non-parametric measure of dependence. However, because this approach attempts to identify any non-trivial relationship <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> weak, it <b>often</b> identifies too many relationships to be useful. What is needed {{is a way of}} identifying a smaller set of relationships that merit detailed further analysis. Here we formally present and characterize equitability, a property of measures of dependence that aims to overcome this challenge. Notionally, an equitable statistic is a statistic that, given some measure of noise, assigns similar scores to equally noisy relationships of different types [Reshef et al. 2011]. We begin by formalizing this idea via a new object called the interpretable interval, which functions as an interval estimate of the amount of noise in a relationship of unknown type. We define an equitable statistic as one with small interpretable intervals. We then draw on the equivalence of interval estimation and hypothesis testing to show that under moderate assumptions an equitable statistic is one that yields well powered tests for distinguishing not only between trivial and non-trivial relationships of all kinds but also between non-trivial relationships of different strengths. This means that equitability allows us to specify a threshold relationship strength $x_ 0 $ and to search for relationships of all kinds with strength greater than $x_ 0 $. Thus, equitability {{can be thought of as}} a strengthening of power against independence that enables fruitful {{analysis of}} data sets with a small number of strong, interesting relationships and a large number of weaker ones. We conclude with a demonstration of how our two equivalent characterizations of equitability can be used to evaluate the equitability of a statistic in practice. Comment: Yakir A. Reshef and David N.

40|$|After {{completing}} this course, {{you will}} have been taught and {{given the opportunity to}} demonstrate proficiency in the following: o	Compare and contrast the formation of Latin America as was presented to you in high school as a means to better understand the development of this important region. o	Discuss in essay form how the decisions that were made in the past are still currently shaping Latin America???s modern landscape and how this impacts their participation in global economic and political affairs. o	Impart the lesson of how a nation???s domestic interests, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> benign, <b>often</b> shape and influence foreign policy relations within a region, a continent, a hemisphere, or globally o	Demonstrate how to write in the Chicago style format; the format accepted by most History journals. o	Discuss how gender, class, and ethnic categories evolved historically and continue to manifest in contemporary national discourses in Latin America. o	Discuss how the influence of men on horseback???caudillaje [...] influenced {{for better or for worse}} the development of a nation immediately after independence o	 Present to you, the student, a different approach to learning via cinema. Discovering the development of Latin America from producers and directors across the globe can provide a different knowledge awareness of the region rather than one coming from a solely United States perspective o	 Present to you how policies enacted by Western European and American imperial interests have previously and currently shape the direction Latin American countries must follow for their own political survivalThis course will offer an exploration of Latin American History from its discovery by nomadic tribes crossing the Bering Straight through the 20 th century. Based on primary and secondary sources, power point presentations and cinema film, this course will analyze the creation of the modern Latin American nation states. Students will have the opportunity to analyze how Latin America reached its current state. They will be able to appreciate that Latin America was formed as a result of a collision of cultures (Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans) that were unexpectedly introduced to each other on a warm October morning in 1492 when Columbus first set foot in Hispaniola. Students will discover for themselves that since this auspicious moment of contact, Latin America experienced profound change, profound wealth acquisition by the Europeans, and profound inequality among non-European peoples. These issues of inequality will become magnified as territories of Spanish America gird themselves for emancipation from their former European masters. Once independence was reached, students will learn about the quest for Latin America stability as the victors struggled amongst each other for political, and economic control. Liberalism versus Conservatism would shape the course of these nations throughout the 19 th Century. The legacy of the caudillos, or strong and influential men that helped form the great nation states of Latin America, will also be explored. Students will appreciate how these caudillos pushed policies of reform that for better or for worse would indelibly leave their mark in the political, social, and economic landscape of their respective countries. Lastly, this course will also explore modern Latin America that has emerged from the social reform disputes that first occurred in the early 20 th century, to the policies enacted as a result of the Great Depression, to the dislocations and marginalization of peoples resulting from the Cold War (U. S. vs. Soviet Union, Capitalism vs. Marxist Leninism). This course would not be complete without the study of America's and Europe???s active involvement in the affairs of Latin American politics. Careful scrutiny of American and European involvement with Latin American affairs will give the student a broader perspective of the difficulties the people had to endure to secure their national sovereignty. This course will end with the neo-liberal policies of the 20 th century and the effects it created to form Pan-American identity...|$|R
