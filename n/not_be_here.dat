25|$|With {{reference}} to rumours which I believe were {{at one time}} afloat, though I know not with what degree of currency: and also with {{reference to}} the times when I shall <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> to answer for myself, I desire to record my solemn declaration and assurance, as in the sight of God and before His Judgement Seat, that at no period of my life have I been guilty of the act which is known as that of infidelity to the marriage bed.|$|E
25|$|An unknown ashik a {{travelling}} troubadour {{appears at}} the palace. Hassan khan orders him to sing. Strings of saz twang, a song about ardent love and a beautiful beloved pours from the strings. How good sings this ashik! In a new song the ashik sings of the glory of Koroghlu's horse Ghir Att. The khan laughs smugly and informs the audience that Ghir Att is in his stables. But the ashik doesn’t believe him saying that Ghir Att could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here.</b> Hassan Khan orders Ghir Att {{to be brought to}} the hall.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Supreme Court {{received}} {{a message on}} the verdict during oral arguments, with the justices quietly passing the note to each other while listening to the attorney's presentation. Congressmen canceled press conferences, with one telling reporters [...] "Not only would you <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> but I wouldn't be here, either".|$|E

2500|$|The anthropic {{principle}} was discussed by Leonard Susskind {{as well as}} Carlo Rovelli, who mentions it in his essay. [...] The {{anthropic principle}} claims {{that the universe is}} the way it is because if it was not specifically like how we see it, we would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> to describe it. Leonard Susskind expands by talking about the idea that the anthropic principle can be seen as a threat to the mentality that every law governing the cosmos is set in stone; thus being unalterable.|$|E

[...] Pietersen went on to say: [...] "You know what - I have never said this before - I lost the captaincy, I got rid of the captaincy for the good of English cricket, and we would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> today if I had not done what I did then." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "While the {{defendant}} committed this horrific crime, what is also so disturbing {{about this case}} is the indifference of the people employed at the bar that night. This court cannot speak to the legal implications of serving someone who is intoxicated, and indeed that issue may be before another judge, but this court can decry the complete indifference and inhumanity of the workers there that night. They were all focused on finishing their shift and leaving. Not {{one of those people}} spared a thought to the wisdom of sending an intoxicated young woman out into the deserted streets of Manhattan at 4 a.m. If only one of them had the common decency to call a taxi, we might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> in this courtroom today." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Action Reports of {{the patrol}} {{were met with}} {{positive}} reviews, General Abrams formally approved the operation. The success of the operation was more valuable than just {{the destruction of the}} enemy, because it allowed Colonel Barrow to request that continued operations in Laos be approved. His reasoning for continued operations was the presence of the enemy in the area was a threat to his troops. Barrow noted, [...] "I put a final comment on my message, which said, quote, [...] "Put another way, my forces should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> if ground interdiction of Route 922 not authorized." [...] The message finally reached General Abrams via General Stilwell, who had adopted the Colonel's recommendation. General Abrams approved [...] further action on February 24 but restricted discussions of the Laotian operation.|$|E
