5000|$|On a {{commercial}} vessel, the bridge will contain the [...] equipment necessary to safely navigate a vessel on passage. Such equipment will vary with ship type, but generally includes a GPS navigation device, a <b>Navtex</b> <b>receiver,</b> an ECDIS or chart system, {{one or more}} radars, a communications system (including distress calling equipment, engine (telegraph) controls, a wheel/autopilot system, a magnetic compass (for redundancy and cross check capability) and light/sound signalling devices.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to equipment listed below, all GMDSS-regulated ships must carry a satellite EPIRB, a <b>NAVTEX</b> <b>receiver</b> (if they travel in any areas served by NAVTEX), an Inmarsat-C SafetyNET receiver (if they travel in any areas not served by NAVTEX), a DSC-equipped VHF radiotelephone, two (if between 300 {{and less than}} 500 GRT) or three VHF handhelds (if 500 GRT or more), and two 9 GHz search and rescue radar transponders (SART).|$|E
5000|$|A modern sailing boat, or {{any other}} modern {{seagoing}} craft, {{is a much more}} complex electronic environment than ever in the past, and even more so than a normal home-based amateur radio [...] "shack". The vessel will probably have electronic navigation instruments, one or more GPS receivers, electronic automatic steering, domestic radio and perhaps television receivers as well as probably radar and VHF transmitters and receivers too. It may have various GMDSS devices too, such as a <b>Navtex</b> <b>receiver</b> and an AIS system. Many of these items are computerised {{and many of them are}} networked together with data, RF and power connections. All of this is crammed into a very compact, three-dimensional space and that space is shared by not only the radio operator, but perhaps several other crew or family members. Safety and EMC issues have never been so important.|$|E
5000|$|NAVTEX marine {{weather and}} safety {{messages}} are broadcast using SITOR-B. The NAVTEX messages {{have a specific}} format that is interpreted by <b>NAVTEX</b> <b>receivers.</b> (<b>NAVTEX</b> is layered on top of SITOR-B just as HTML is layered on top of TCP.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Navtex</b> <b>receivers</b> {{which are}} {{approved}} for GMDSS contain an internal printer and/or a scrollable display, and cost between $800-$1500. A {{new generation of}} <b>navtex</b> <b>receivers</b> intended for non-GMDSS applications such as the recreational community is entering the marketplace. These receivers include features such as LCD screens and RS-232 output and have a purchase price in the $300-$500 range. In the UK they can be purchased for Â£115. There are also a number of navtex engines available {{that do not have}} any user interface, and just output decoded data in RS-232 format, either as a simple ASCII data stream, or using the NMEA navtex sentences, or their own proprietary protocol.|$|R
5000|$|The Lokata Company (pronounced low-kay-tah, [...] "locator") {{was formed}} in the late 1970s in Falmouth, Cornwall, UK. The first product was a {{combined}} marine receiver and direction finder, for yachts and small boats. From there, the company designed and manufactured products for the marine electronics market, including communications <b>receivers,</b> <b>Navtex</b> <b>receivers,</b> radar detectors, transponders and emergency position indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs).|$|R
