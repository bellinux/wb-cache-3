[...] Bakshi responded, [...] "You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary.

How could you not induct Deep Purple?". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction. In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language...'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?" [...] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: [...] "that Deep Purple are not in it [...] It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there." ...|$|E
