40|$|Research {{suggests}} an androgen mediated trade-off between <b>nurturing</b> and defensive behaviour during parental care. This research, however, comes from species with biparental care, where changes in behaviour of one parent can {{be compensated for}} by the other parent. I tested the validity of this trade-off by manipulating androgen levels in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a species where males provide sole parental care. I implanted males with testosterone, 11 -ketotestosterone or flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, and tested their <b>nurturing</b> behaviour and aggressiveness towards a brood predator. Males implanted with 11 -ketotestosterone were 64 % more aggressive and 71 % less <b>nurturing</b> than controls. In contrast, males implanted with flutamide were 7 % less aggressive and 126 % more <b>nurturing.</b> Males with elevated testosterone levels showed marginally higher aggression, but no reduction in <b>nurturing</b> behaviour. This study is {{among the first to}} confirm an androgen mediated trade-off in aggression and <b>nurturing</b> in a uniparental care system...|$|R

5|$|Literature {{also served}} {{religious}} purposes. Beginning with the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, {{and later on}} coffins, and papyri placed within tombs, were designed to protect and <b>nurture</b> souls in their afterlife.

Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales.

Section 3 examines abusive parenting and childrearing (e. g., inappropriate parental expectations of children, lack of empathy toward children's needs, and belief in the value of physical punishment). Section 4 discusses theoretical assumptions of the <b>Nurturing</b> Parenting Programs (the family is a system, empathy is the most desirable quality in <b>nurturing</b> parents, parenting exists on a continuum, and no one truly prefers abusive interactions).

40|$|This {{study is}} about mothers’ {{perceptions}} of their competence regarding basic skills required in caring for an infant (first-time mothers’ perceptions of efficacy in the <b>nurturing</b> role), antenatal attachment that consists of quality of attachment and time spent in attachment mode, four types of aggression: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility, {{and the age of}} the expectant mothers. The main question was: Do antenatal attachment and aggression {{play a role in the}} first-time mothers’ perceptions of efficacy in the <b>nurturing</b> role of expectant mothers between 17 and 25 years? The participants were 60 expectant mothers between 17 and 25 years, expecting their first child. These women have been enrolled in the study mostly through cooperation with obstetrics clinics in the areas of Leiden, Den Haag, Rijnmond, Groot-Kennemerland and Delft. The expectant mothers completed the following questionnaires: the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS), the Aggression Questionnaire (AVL) and the Self-Efficacy in the <b>Nurturing</b> Role scale (SENR). Through correlations and a multiple regression analyses the relations with the first-time mothers’ perceptions of efficacy in the <b>nurturing</b> role have been tested. First-time mothers’ perceptions of efficacy in the <b>nurturing</b> role was associated with (general) antenatal attachment, the quality of attachment and hostility. The quality of attachment was a unique predictor for first-time mothers’ perception of efficacy in the <b>nurturing</b> role, as shown by multiple regression analysis. The conclusion of this study: the higher the quality of attachment, the higher first-time mothers’ perceptions of efficacy in the <b>nurturing</b> role...|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} before federation, the colonial {{government}} recognised that British education and indigenous culture was influencing {{a new generation of}} Iban teachers. Thus, on 15 September 1958, the Borneo Literature Bureau was inaugurated with a charter to <b>nurture</b> and encourage local literature while also supporting the government in its release of documentation, particularly in technical and instructional manuscripts that were to be distributed to the indigenous peoples of Sarawak and Sabah. As well as indigenous languages, documents would also be published in English, Chinese and Malay. In 1977, the bureau came under the authority of the federal government language planning and development agency, the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), which advocated publication only in Malay ultimately causing the demise of fledgling indigenous literature.|$|E
5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life. According to scholars, the novel's main themes are nature versus <b>nurture,</b> rebirth, and the differing {{experiences}} of what society constructs as polar opposites—such as those found between men and women. It discusses the pursuit of the American Dream and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the cypress}} domes and strands retain {{moisture}} and block out {{much of the}} sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also <b>nurture</b> frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E

5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus <b>nurture),</b> stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and <b>nurture</b> controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
