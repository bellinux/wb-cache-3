These studies concerned themselves entirely with the clinical and serological aspects of the disease; but {{up to the present}} little or no attempt has been made to obtain a method of treatment to prevent or lessen the severity of this illness. The present study was undertaken, therefore, with this in view. This work was suggested by the findings of Boots and Swift (2), who showed that in patients with serum sickness the involved joints con-tained a cellular exudate in which the proteins of the horse serum could be demonstrated. They also pointed out that salicylates had little effect upon the course of the illness when administered after the onset of arthritis. During the past two years we have studied the serum-treated patients in this Hospital to determine, first the influence of the early institution of anti-rheumatic therapy upon the course of the disease, and, second the effect of such therapy upon the antigen and antibody content of their sera. <b>Neocinchophen,</b> because of its anti-exudative influence in acute rheumatic fever (3) and the ease with which it is tolerated by patients, was employed in the first twenty-five cases; it was replaced by aspirin in the last nine. Depending upon the age and weight of the patient and his tolerance for the agent, <b>neocinchophen</b> was used in amounts of 8 to 10 grams daily, aspirin in doses of 5 to 6 grams. Drug treat-ment was usualiy begun from 24 to 48 hours after the last serum injection, and continued for 10 to 14 days. As the advantages o...|$|E
