5|$|Horses {{finished}} with a racing career that are <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions.

5|$|However that {{decision}} proved controversial. The Bishops' Council formally {{objected to the}} Commissioners' decision, and the matter was referred by the Archbishops' Council to a committee which, in May 2014, decided that the house in Croscombe was <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> to be a see house, and that the bishop should remain living in the Palace.|$|E
5|$|It {{was quickly}} {{realized}} that a glass dispersive prism was <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> {{for use in the}} ultraviolet spectrum. Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 millimicrons rather than dispersing it. In the Model B, a quartz prism was substituted for the earlier glass.|$|E

5|$|A {{revised version}} of the game was resubmitted to the ACB and {{reclassified}} as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for people {{under the age of}} 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia. According to the ACB board report, the drug content was not removed entirely from the {{revised version of}} the game, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug content was still enough to warrant a refused classification rating.|$|E

Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are <b>not</b> <b>suitable,</b> as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|After one {{additional}} lap had been run, IndyCar officials red-flagged the race as the track was <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for racing. In {{addition to the}} debris left by the fifteen cars involved in the wreck, the asphalt surface was damaged and the catch fencing needed repair. As the teams waited {{to see if they}} would resume racing, they also were waiting for word on Wheldon's condition as word had not been relayed to the track.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Night Interception Committee on 2 May it was decided that the bomber threat was greater than submarines, and the {{decision}} was made to move 80 of the 140 ASV Mk. I transmitters to AI, adding to 70 being constructed by EKCO (E.K. Cole). These would be turned into 60 IIIA's and 40 IIIB's. At a further meeting on 23 May, Tizard, perhaps prompted by comments from Director of Signals (Air), suggested that the units were <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for operational use, especially due to low reliability, and should be confined to daylight training missions.|$|E
5|$|Currently, curium is {{not used}} as a nuclear fuel owing to its low {{availability}} and high price. 245Cm and 247Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore {{could be used in}} portable nuclear weapons, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 would be highly suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.|$|E
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E

5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of ethanol production, in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for sugarcane plantation. The government considers that the suitable areas are {{more than enough to}} meet the future demand for ethanol and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades.|$|E

5|$|Richelieu {{was laid}} down at Toulon in 1869 and {{launched}} on 3 December 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, it was probably due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for the Industrial Age. The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876. She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879.|$|E
5|$|SVT {{made the}} advance {{decision}} to allocate Denmark at one semi-final and Norway at the other, in {{consideration for the}} number of Danish and Norwegian fans likely to come, with the arena being relatively small and so <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for accommodating both countries' fans at one semi-final event.

The facility remained in use from 1967 to 1974, but was closed as it was <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for ESRO's second generation of satellites. During the planning of the station, Longyearbyen had been proposed as a location, and it was largely political concerns by Norwegian authorities to create permanent activity in Ny-Ålesund which lead ESRO to accept the location.|$|E
