The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) notes that: [...] "The international <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> of <b>1</b> <b>852</b> meters (6 076.115 49...feet) was adopted effective July 1, 1954, for use in the United States. The value formerly used in the United States was 6 080.20 feet = 1 nautical (geographical or sea) mile." [...] A separate reference also identifies the geographic mile as being identical to these international <b>nautical</b> <b>miles</b> (and slightly shorter than British <b>nautical</b> <b>miles,</b> which were identified as being equivalent to 1853.184 meters). The unit is not used much, but is cited in some United States laws (e.g., Section 1301(a) of the Submerged Lands Act, which defines state seaward boundaries in terms of geographic miles). While debating what became the Land Ordinance of 1785, Thomas Jefferson's committee wanted to divide the public lands in the west into [...] "hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 and 4-10ths of a foot" [...] and [...] "sub-divided into lots of one mile square each, or 850 and 4-10ths of an acre".|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{conflict}} avoidance {{is crucial}} in air traffic management, and {{it is even more}} challenging as the air traffic is continuously increasing. The problem is to keep a given minimum safety distance for aircraft along their trajectories. In order to ensure safety within the air traffic, minimum distances between aircraft have to be respected. Aircraft are said in conflict if they are too close to each other. The associated problem is called aircraft conflict avoidance. The actual norm of the separation between two aircraft is defined as follows: 1000 ft vertically and 5 NM horizontally (with the units: <b>1</b> NM (<b>nautical</b> <b>mile)</b> = <b>1,</b> <b>852</b> m; <b>1</b> ft (feet) = 0. 3048 m). In this context, various approaches to the aircraft conflict avoidance problem have been provided. A survey is given by Kuchar and Yang in [9]. The problem of aircraft conflict avoidance is largely investigated in terms of aircraft trajectory deviations using altitude or heading changes. Recently, speed regulation appeared to be more and more relevant as a maneuver for solving the problem. In 2008, the European ERASMUS project (Bonini et al. [1]) proposed to use small speed changes to solve aircraft conflicts. Based on velocity variations, new models and solution approaches, generhal- 00867935...|$|R

The model features, contrary to most existing configurations, a high horizontal resolution of ≈ <b>1</b> <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> (≈ <b>1.</b> 85 km), which is eddy-resolving {{over much of the}} domain. The vertical discretisation comprises a total of 47 vertical levels. Results from a 1987 to 1999 hindcast simulation show that the model's fidelity is competitive. As suggested by a comparison with sea surface temperatures observed from space, this applies especially to near-surface processes. Hence, the configuration is well suited to serve as a nucleus of a fully fledged coupled ocean-circulation–biogeochemical model (which is yet to be developed). A caveat is that the model fails to reproduce major inflow events. We trace this back to spurious vertical circulation patterns at the sills which may well be endemic to high-resolution models based on geopotential coordinates. Further, we present indications that – so far neglected – eddy/wind effects exert significant control on wind-induced up- and downwelling...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish warship Vasa sank in Stockholm harbor after sailing {{less than}} one <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> (<b>1.</b> 85 km) on its maiden voyage in 1628. The hull was raised in 1961, and after a lengthy {{conservation}} and reconstruction process, went on display in a state-of-the-art museum in 1990. The hull {{is estimated to be}} 98 % intact, making it the oldest intact wooden ship recovered to date. The recovery and remarkable preservation of the hull presents unparalleled archaeological research opportunities. This dissertation recovers and analyzes the methods of naval architecture used to design the hull of Vasa as evidenced in its intact structure. Digital 3 D solid modeling software is used to virtually deconstruct the hull to facilitate a nuanced understanding of the design principles that guided the construction of the ship Although Vasa was a Swedish warship constructed in Stockholm, it was designed and built by Dutch shipwrights. In the early 17 th century, the Dutch rose to prominence as the premier shipbuilders in Europe. The quality and character of Dutch-built vessels were renowned and Dutch shipwrights were hired to build the merchant fleets and navies throughout Europe. Limited scholarly attention has been given to the methods of naval architecture by which Dutch shipwrights designed their ships. Dutch shipwrights designed and built ships according to orally transmitted principles of design and therefore left little written evidence for their tradition of naval architecture. Vasa presents an unprecedented opportunity to examine the methods used by Dutch shipwrights to design large vessels as they are evident in an intact hull. The results of the analysis contained in this dissertation suggest that Vasa was designed according to proportional and arithmetical methods of naval architecture. The methods are identical or very similar to those described in Nicolaes Witsen?s 1671 treatise on Dutch shipbuilding. While many aspects of Vasa?s hull appear to be derived according to the tradition of naval architecture described by Witsen, certain significant deviations resulted in an atypically narrow hull. The methods of analysis in this dissertation, which highlight digital 3 D visualization, mark an attempt to expand the range of analytic and explanatory tools available to nautical archaeologists in the 21 st century...|$|R
