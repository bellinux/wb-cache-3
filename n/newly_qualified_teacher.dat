40|$|How to {{make sure}} that <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> keep teaching? Research shows that their social {{informal}} learning and job satisfaction determines if (<b>newly</b> <b>qualified)</b> <b>teachers</b> dropout or not (Gerken, Beausaert & Segers, 2015). Job satisfaction is an indicator for the type of relationship with the principal and colleagues, the level of autonomy {{and the way in which}} employees think their job is interesting. Lack of support is an important explanation for a low level of job satisfaction. To increase job satisfaction and reduce dropout of <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers,</b> schools invest in formalized teacher support systems, such as mentoring. Teacher support systems are structured activities at school level to introduce and guide <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers.</b> Furthermore, beginning teachers are supported informally by their colleagues, who also provide them with practical information, help and feedback, but not every collegial network provides starters with equal learning opportunities. The characteristics of the collegial network needs to be taken into account as well, i. e. the accessibility of the network, the knowledge present in the network, appreciation of this knowledge by the member of the network and the psychological safety of the members (Cross, Parker, Prusak & Borgatti, 2001). <b>Newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> learns informally through the group of colleagues where they are part off. Depending on the characteristics of this collegial network <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> will ask/get feedback, information or help. This study looked into two research questions: (1) How does the type of support system influences <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers’ informal learning and in turn their job satisfaction? and (2) How do the characteristics of the collegial network influences <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers’ informal learning and in turn their job satisfaction? A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted among 600 <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> with less than 3 years of experience, teaching in the Dutch speaking community of Belgium. The data will be analyzed by doing path analysis in Amos, version 16. Results and implications for practice on how to better support the informal learning of <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> will be discussed at the SIG 11 meeting. To our knowledge this is one of the first studies that looks into the mediating role of informal learning between teaching support systems and the characteristics of the collegial network on the one hand and teachers’ job satisfaction on the other. Furthermore, this study is original since it studies the variables under study in a quantitative way. Cross, R., Parker, A., Prusak, L. & Borgatti, S. P. (2001).

40|$|M. Ed. (Educational Management) The {{induction}} of <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> {{has become}} a major concern in education policy and reform (Smith & Ingersoll, 2004 : 49). Comprehensive induction programmes are believed to be crucial for successful transition into teaching practice and for retaining novice teachers within the profession (Beutel et al., 2008). It is against this background that the current case study investigates the induction experiences of <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> at a Soweto primary school. In-depth information was obtained through the purposive and convenient selection of participants. The sample of six teachers was recruited from the researched school and included <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers,</b> Heads of Department and a Deputy Principal. The study was conducted at the researcher’s own school in which the researcher acted as research instrument. The research design employed in this study was qualitative in nature, applying an interview approach. Each participant was interviewed individually with the assistance of a semi-structured interview guide. Content analysis was used to interpret the interview data. The results were coded and arranged in accordance with the emerging themes and categories. The key findings of the study revealed that <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> experience challenges {{as a result of the}} induction process at the researched school. Participants perceived the induction process to be ineffective as the planning and structure seemed inadequate. Pre-service training also seemed to exacerbate the situation, as it focused predominantly on theoretical aspects. Practical preparation was perceived as insufficient for the actual working environment. The results of the study emphasized the importance of organised, structured and comprehensive induction strategies [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{paper is}} based on the pilot project (2011 - 12) organized by the Prince’s Teaching Institute (UK), which aimed to provide a limited number of days to develop subject knowledge, for the <b>Newly</b> <b>Qualified</b> <b>Teachers</b> (NQTs) during their first year of teaching. The project was devised in order to increase NQTs’ confidence and engagement with mathematics, and enable them to further develop their mathematical ability through practical work. In order to achieve this aim, a historical approach was designed which would introduce ‘old topics’ in a new way – through historical context and analysis of the development of a mathematical concept. <b>Newly</b> <b>Qualified</b> <b>Teachers</b> (NQTs), subject knowledge, history of mathematics...|$|R

This formed a constraining dimension of the work they were doing. In contrast, the middle leaders mentioned “that <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> had a better understanding of these concepts” and among this group there was a belief that working with the local SQW-booklet “will strengthen their scientific grounding”. Middle leaders recognised that for <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers,</b> the new policy was an enabling feature because of the recency of their training they were more attuned to the practice demands of the new policy.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{concerns regarding}} the preparedness of <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> to deliver Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) in the United Kingdom {{in relation to}} the training received during Initial Teacher Education and through early Continuing Professional Development. The paper is situated not only within a context where OfSTED has questioned the adequacy of some non-specialist PSHE teachers but also one where, due to a range of social and health concerns centred on young people, schools and teachers are being expected to play an increasingly important role in the social and health education of their pupils. As such, PSHE is increasingly seen as important across all curriculum areas. This paper relates specifically to the confidence of trainee and <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> of English in teaching PSHE in secondary schools in the United Kingdom. Drawing on questionnaire data collected from recent Professional Graduate Certificate in Education graduates, the paper suggests that trainee and <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> have the skills and knowledge drawn from their main subject (English) to deliver PSHE; however, many lack confidence and awareness to acknowledge these skills. The paper suggests that this situation may be addressed through increased opportunity to deliver and receive feedback on PSHE teaching during initial teacher training...|$|R

This evaluation is part of pilot activities with NQTs, linked with teacher retention issues, which seeks to explore evidence of professional impact {{of the range of}} support mechanisms and experiences that are available to NQTs – including their ITE experience, their induction, LEA county support, and support in their school. The evaluation focuses on support for developing positive behaviour management strategies; and on supporting NQTs in collecting evidence in support of their progress against the standards. Data collection is through questionnaires to all NQTs and Induction Tutors in the authority. 25 Induction Tutors responded, and 30 NQTs.

50|$|In England and Wales {{teachers}} in the maintained sector must have gained Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and be registered with either the General Teaching Council for England or the General Teaching Council for Wales. There are many paths {{in which a person}} can work towards gaining their QTS, the most popular of which is to have completed a first degree (such as a BA or BSc) and then a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). Other methods include a specific teaching degree or on-the-job training at a school. All qualified {{teachers in}} England must serve, after training, a statutory one year induction period that must be passed in order to remain a registered teacher. In Wales this period lasts for two years. During this period a teacher is known as an NQT (<b>Newly</b> <b>Qualified</b> <b>Teacher).</b> Schools are obliged to provide guidance, support and training to facilitate the NQT's success during this year.

50|$|Series 5 {{follows the}} merger of Waterloo Road with the local private school - John Fosters. The current Head Teacher, Rachel Mason, and newly {{appointed}} executive Head Teacher, Max Tyler (played by Tom Chambers), almost immediately face a clash of personalities, especially when Max takes the liberty of using Rachel's office. The lack of unity between the two schools extends to {{all levels of the}} school environment, the rivalry in the playground as well as the staff room is documented throughout the series. Six new teachers from John Fosters transferred to Waterloo Road to support the merger, much to the disapproval of the former John Fosters and new Waterloo Road Food Technology teacher Ruby Fry (Elizabeth Berrington), and to the immediate shock of the unskilled <b>newly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>teacher,</b> Helen Hopewell (Vinette Robinson), whom the pupils, and some staff, soon label 'Hopeless Hopewell.', in mockery of her lack of control and insufficient experience as a teacher. Other John Fosters staff transfers include New Deputy Head and Science teacher Christopher Mead (William Ash) and Head of Modern Languages Jo Lipsett (Sarah-Jane Potts). The afforementioned mix of new pupils also soon make their mark with their obvious disapproval of Waterloo Road and its existing pupils and staff, causing fights amongst both. The events brought forth by the forced merger lead to many conflicts within the two newly combined schools.|$|E

One of his pupils, a cute and smart 12-year-old boy named Duilio, a farmer's son, gradually grows to love Lorenzo and they become good friends but the boy wishes Lorenzo was his older brother. Lorenzo often visits Duilio's home, meets his family, and they become good friends. Lorenzo meanwhile meets a young woman, with whom he falls in love. However, the relationship with his girlfriend is not perfect and he chooses to break up with her as {{she is about to}} be married: her fiance and her agree on an open relationship. Lorenzo declines the offer. At the same time Lorenzo becomes much closer to Duilio, and they often spend time with each other. The boy is given books and other things and the boy in turn makes and gives his friend a carved boat and poems. The boy kisses his teacher in a farm building on the lips. The boy's sister returns and all three become friends. But many things change after Duilio’s stepmother begins to distrust Lorenzo and says as much to the father. Gradually {{at the request of the}} father, who knows that his son loves his teacher more than himself, they meet less often. Duilio has to work on his father's farm in the afternoon, but Duilio still needs Lorenzo and misses him. To get out of this difficult situation, Lorenzo decides to leave the village and Duilio forever. The mother realises that the teacher's feelings for the boy are pure and asks to be forgiven. The family say he is always welcome anytime. The boy knows his teacher will never return not that he can not return. The teacher rejects the idea of a loving but homosexual relationship with the boy and has to leave. The boy does not know why his friend will never come back and runs after the taxi. The teachers weeps at the lost love with a boy who tells him everything and trusts him totally.|$|E
