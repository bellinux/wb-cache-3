5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob's pants have shrunk in the dryer. Unable {{to find a new}} pair, he tries round pants, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to recognizes him as SpongeBob RoundPants.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E
25|$|Bacon {{was usually}} careful to cite his sources {{but does not}} mention Shakespeare once in any of his work. Baconians claim, furthermore, that, if the Gesta Grayorum was {{circulated}} prior to its publication in 1688 – and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> {{to know if it}} was – it was probably only among members of the Inns of Court.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{gets back}} {{together}} with Hunter, and during a family dinner with Hunter, Mary K finally finds {{out the truth}} about what Selene had done to her, and how Selene and Cal died. To make things worse, strange occurrences begin to happen in Morgan's presence. Books begin flying and light bulbs explode, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to know the cause - thus attributing the blame to Morgan. Morgan's school grades begin to slip and she finds herself having difficulty finding a balance between her school work and a life of Wicca. She is grounded because of it, meaning she cannot go to a circle. At the end, Sky leaves.|$|E
25|$|Aditya {{starts to}} feel good about life again and starts to have fun with Geet who takes him to her home in Bhatinda where her family is very thankful to Aditya. When Geet's {{grandfather}} (Dara Singh) sees them both together, he thinks that they are a couple and that they are in love with each other. But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to believe him. Aditya has fallen in love with Geet but is aware that Geet loves Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Geet decides to elope with Anshuman as she is sure that her family wouldn't agree for their marriage as their religions are different. When she escapes from her house along with Aditya, her family thinks that they both eloped. They go to Manali, where Anshuman resides. Geet requests Aditya to come with her and meet Anshuman, but he says that their journey together is over and bids her farewell, and the two part ways.|$|E
500|$|The Quest {{has been}} around since 1970, long enough for its {{provenance}} and purpose to sink into mystery ... <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to like it much, and others actively dislike it. But there it stays, a free sex-education lesson for busloads of suburban schoolchildren, the uncertain limbs forever reaching somewhere or other, for something.|$|E

In this episode, on the night of a show, head writer Liz Lemon grows increasingly infuriated when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to remember her 40th birthday. Just before TGSs live taping, Tracy Jordan decides to break character, to his co-workers' chagrin. Meanwhile, television executive Jack Donaghy struggles with the consequences of his promise to give up drinking while his girlfriend Avery Jessup is pregnant with their child.|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of a patient known as [...] "Yo-yo Man" [...] who offers them wise advice, Guy, Mac and Martin all decide to propose to Caroline. She rejects Martin, {{considers}} the offer from Guy, and Mac appears to be unable to form a proposal. Caroline then learns that Mac wants to meet her at the train station, but when she arrives, it is Guy who turns up. Mac is still at the hospital, where he learns {{that he is going to}} die. Caroline then accepts Guy's proposal of marriage. Meanwhile, in the HR department, Karen is sitting on a windowsill, due to her fear of Clangers. Whilst sitting there, Rachel opens the window behind her, and causes Karen to fall out. However, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to notice.|$|E
500|$|Dawn tells Tara she is {{glad that}} Tara and Willow {{have made up}} after their argument. Since Tara has no {{recollection}} of an argument, she suspects that Willow has used magic to alter her memory. She goes to the Magic Box to consult a book, leaving Dawn alone. Dawn starts to bemoan that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to notice her ("Dawn's Lament"), but is soon seized by minions of Sweet (Hinton Battle), a zoot suit-wearing, tap-dancing, singing demon. They take Dawn to The Bronze, where her attempt to escape transforms into an interpretive dance with the minions ("Dawn's Ballet") before she meets Sweet. He tells Dawn that {{he has come to}} Sunnydale in response to her [...] "invocation", and he will take her to his dimension to make her his bride ("What You Feel") when his visit is complete.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} {{accepting}} of the character. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he [...] "love the idea of Adam" [...] but {{was having a hard}} time understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam's existence, noting, [...] "Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> overly bothered by the fact that one of their leaders was building a monster." [...] Murray, however, did conclude that the show's writers and producers [...] "did a decent job of bringing [...] to a conclusion". Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was [...] "always impressed with [...] costume/make-up". Furthermore, he was positively surprised that it [...] "took [...] a minute to recognize" [...] Adam's appearance in [...] "Restless" [...] sans makeup.|$|E
500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but {{for me it was}} a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare". Cizmar wrote a positive {{review of the}} restaurant in August 2014, in which he paid tribute to Leo's and described his two $1 extras (an egg on his BLT and maple syrup for his pancakes) as [...] "the best two dollars [...] spent all week". That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places you can go in Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E

6000|$|She {{was able}} to walk a little now and {{together}} we went about the village, and visited relatives and neighbors in the country. We ate [...] "company dinners" [...] of fried chicken and shortcake, and sat out on the grass beneath the shelter of noble trees during {{the heat of the}} day. There was something profoundly restful and satisfying in this atmosphere. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> in a hurry and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to fear either the wind or the sun.|$|R
500|$|Poniewozik {{notes that}} [...] "It also remains {{a delight to}} watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards’ arid Capitol chill. If only his {{character}} weren’t so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series’ movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> nearly in Underwood’s league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it." [...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that [...] "Frank's [...] "Survivor"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive." [...] and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: [...] "...things always seem to fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided..." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday notes that [...] "Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey-toned drawl." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{approximately}} 1995 (<b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to {{know for}} certain), Paul has annually played Club Passim over New Year's, performing two shows on December 30 and two shows on New Year's Eve. [...] In early 2006 Black Wolf Records released Live at Club Passim, a recording compiled from Paul's 2005 New Year's Eve shows. [...] In May 2006, Paul toured Europe and England playing to sold-out shows in Paris, France; Twickenham, England; Cheltenham, England and Wasserburg, Germany. [...] The tour also included two BBC radio interviews and a radio interview in Paris. [...] Paul was included on the Woody Guthrie Coalition's DVD Woody Sez: a Tribute to Woody Guthrie released in 2006. [...] The tribute show, recorded July 13, 2005 at the Crystal Theater in Okemah, Oklahoma, included Paul performing a duet with The Burns Sisters on [...] "God's Promise". [...] Also released in 2006 was Paul's [...] "best of" [...] album, released as Ellis Paul Essentials, on October 10. [...] The two-disk retrospective of Paul's 15-year career contained some songs that were absolutes and others that were included based on polls held on his website and discussion board.

500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... the main hero foolishly/recklessly [...] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be {{at a point where}} we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?" ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1889, two amateur archaeologists, George Payne and A. A. Arnold, {{came across}} the monument, which they noted was known among locals as the [...] "Coldrum Stones" [...] and [...] "Druid Temple"; {{according}} to Payne, [...] "the huge stones were so overgrown with brambles and brushwood {{that they could not}} be discerned". He returned the next year, noting that the brushwood had since been cut away to reveal the megaliths. [...] In his 1893 book Collectanea Cantiana, Payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844, [...] "since that time <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan", an unusual claim given that a copy of Petrie's published plan existed in his library. For this reason, after gaining permission from the landowner, he convinced Major A. O. Green, Instructor in Survey at Brompton, to conduct a survey of the monument in August 1892. He also wrote to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, encouraging him to schedule the Coldrum Stones as a legally protected site under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. Payne described the Coldrum Stones as [...] "the finest monument of its class in the county, and one worthy of every care and attention." [...] Comparing it to other monuments of its type in Britain, he stated that it was undoubtedly [...] "of sepulchral origin, belonging to a period anterior to the Roman domination of Britain." [...] Payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although added that he was unable to discover any physical evidence of this feature.|$|E

The Finnish film director Aki Kaurismäki boycotted the festival in protest. Kiarostami had been invited by the New York Film Festival, as well as Ohio University and Harvard University.|$|E
