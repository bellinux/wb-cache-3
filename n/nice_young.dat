25|$|Maës focused {{again on}} her stage {{work during the}} 1960s with several {{performances}} at the Århus Theatre. In 1966, she caused a public reaction when she went against her usual movie persona, playing against type {{in the role of}} a prostitute named Lucy in the black comedy Galgenhumor (Gallows Humor). She explained that she was tired of playing the <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> girl. She also began acting in a series of roles playing middle-aged mothers and wives. In 1971, Maës starred in the title role of Det er nat med Fru Knudsen (Curtains for Mrs. Knudsen). The film, directed by Henning Ørnbak and Leif Petersen, was an adaptation of Petersen's stage play that had debuted one year earlier with Maës in the same role. Maës' portrayal of the drunken and grotesque mother of a small-time criminal brought her the Bodil Award for Best Actress. For the 1975 comedy film Ta' det some en mand, frue! (Take it Like a Man, Miss!) she was awarded the Mathilde Prize from the Danish Women's Society. She again won the Bodil Award in 1982 for her performance as an overlooked but fantasy-filled retiree in Erik Clausen's drama Felix.|$|E
500|$|Peterson {{served as}} the best man at a wedding planned by the [...] "Morning Zoo" [...] of radio station KKRZ (Z-100) FM in 1989. Professional wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper officiated. Peterson, who had never met the 24-year-old groom, called him [...] "a very <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> gentleman." [...] He also played bongo drums on Where's the Art?, a public-access {{television}} cable TV show with Stephanie Pierce, proprietor of the 24 Hour Church of Elvis.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Chandler {{was one of}} ten inaugural {{members of}} the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame. A vestryman at St. John's Church in Versailles, {{he was awarded the}} Bishop's Medal of the Episcopal Church in 1959. That same year, he {{received}} the Cross of Military Service from the United Daughters of the Confederacy. He served as a trustee of the Ty Cobb Foundation and Transylvania University. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention, he again sought the party's presidential nomination, opining that the front-runner, John F. Kennedy, was [...] "a <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> fellow... (but) too young for the nomination." [...] Chandler proposed that he be the presidential nominee with Kennedy as the nominee for vice-president, but the convention chose Kennedy for president instead.|$|E

5000|$|Kravchuk married {{math teacher}} Antonina Mykhailivna Mishura in 1957. First Lady of the United States from 1989-93, Barbara Bush (wife of the 41st President of the United States George H. W. Bush), {{described}} Antonina in her memoirs: [...] "She was the <b>nicest</b> <b>young</b> woman, a math teacher {{with absolutely no}} interest in politics".|$|R
60|$|The Lanings and the Stanhopes {{had been}} in the best of health since {{returning}} from the south. Mrs. Stanhope was no more the pale and delicate person she had been, and her former nervous manner was entirely gone. The cheeks of the three girls were like roses, and it was no wonder that the Rovers thought them the <b>nicest</b> <b>young</b> ladies in the whole world.|$|R
500|$|Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities: Nicolay {{tending to}} assist Lincoln {{in his office}} and in meetings, while Hay dealt with the correspondence, which was very large. Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office-seekers and others who wanted to meet with the President. Unlike the dour Nicolay, Hay, with his charm, escaped much of the hard {{feelings}} from those denied Lincoln's presence. Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as [...] "a <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> fellow, who unfortunately looks about seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy". Hay continued to write, anonymously, for newspapers, sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man, religious and competent, giving of his life and health to preserve the Union. Similarly, Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a [...] "White House propagandist", in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Manassas in July 1861.|$|E
500|$|Howe {{was opposed}} in his riding by CCF {{candidate}} Doug Fisher, a {{local high school}} teacher. Fisher's campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, {{and a number of}} corporate enemies Howe had made over the years. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station—Howe initially scheduled no television appearances. The voters of Port Arthur saw Fisher on television every night, explaining why the Liberals had gone wrong in his view, and what his party proposed to do to correct matters. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher's appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn [...] "treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> fellow that they had been seeing on television {{for the last couple of}} months was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him." [...] Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher's hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect's mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. [...] Howe's defeat came as the Liberals still led narrowly in the reported returns. The Tories forged ahead, and took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105. [...] St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{was elected}} {{president}} of the American Political Science Association in 1910, but soon decided to leave his Princeton post and enter New Jersey state politics. McGeorge Bundy in 1956 described Wilson's contribution to Princeton: [...] "Wilson was right in his conviction that Princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> men; it has been more ever since his time".|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{came in to}} find Tom," [...] said Sam, as he, too, shook hands. He and his {{brothers}} had once done Minnie Sanderson a great service, the particulars of which I have related in [...] "The Rover Boys at College." [...] Since that time Songbird had frequently visited the Sanderson homestead, to call on Minnie, whom he regarded as the <b>nicest</b> <b>young</b> lady of his acquaintance.|$|R

2500|$|... "The {{garden is}} divided into two {{portions}} – the fruit garden and the vegetable garden; good wide slips of ground are also carried all round outside the walls for cultural purposes and a <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> orchard of thriving trees occupies a space between the garden and a public road. The ground in the fruit garden has been made almost if not quite level that in th vegetable garden has a regular and even fall. Immense quantities of earth had to be moved to secure these forms of surface and it was turned to account thus:- At the boundary of the fruit garden a thick retaining wall was built; in front of this the back wall for a range of glass running right across the garden was built leaving room for fruit rooms, sheds stoke holes etc. between the two walls. All the spare earth was thus used to fill up the space between the two walls and to carry a terrace walk right across the garden, eight or ten feet above the vegetable ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 John and Edward {{formed a}} duo and the {{following}} year they auditioned in Glasgow as a group for the sixth series of The X Factor, under the name John & Edward. Despite being described by judge Simon Cowell as [...] "not very good and incredibly annoying", John & Edward were put through to bootcamp, then made it to judges' houses, where Louis Walsh selected them for the live shows. The twins' inclusion in the final 12 was a controversial decision, due to their lack of experience, but Walsh stood by them, saying [...] "I don't know how people can hate two <b>nice</b> <b>young</b> kids from Ireland. They've been edited really badly and come across as the people everyone loves to hate... but they're just raw, naïve and innocent {{and they have the}} potential to be really good." [...] John & Edward became known for their unpolished but enthusiastic performances, famously including a version of Britney Spears' [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", during which they reenacted the Titanic monologue. After their departure from The X Factor, Jedward were signed to Modest! Management, however it was later announced that Louis Walsh had reached [...] "an amicable agreement", which allowed him to take the twins on.|$|E

60|$|So {{one of the}} <b>nicest</b> <b>young</b> men sent a kiss to the Princess, and the King tied {{it to the end}} of {{the line}} and put it in the lake. The sinker carried it down through the sugar-syrup until the kiss was just before the sweet, red lips of the pretty Princess. She took the kiss at once, as the Queen had guessed, and the King pulled up the line, with the Princess at the end of it, until he finally landed her on the shore.|$|R
