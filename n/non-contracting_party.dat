40|$|One {{of the key}} {{problems}} facing regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) {{in the twenty-first century}} is a lack of compliance by flag States. Non-compliance by both contracting and <b>non-contracting</b> <b>parties</b> to RFMOs threatens the effectiveness of a regime which relies almost entirely upon cooperation and the interests of individual States to function. The political will of States to effectively address problems caused by non-compliance including, inter alia, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has recently been deemed wanting. This thesis is concerned with the need for better implementation of compliance enforcement mechanisms by RFMOs to which Australia is a party (AusRFMOs). It examines the range of compliance enforcement mechanisms available to RFMOs and evaluates how AusRFMOs are currently tackling the problem of non-compliance. It recognises the difficulties faced by RFMOs in implementing their mandate and demonstrates that policy and diplomatic avenues along with a range of countermeasures may be, and have been, evoked by RFMOs to tackle flag State noncompliance. This thesis concludes that AusRFMOs could improve their compliance enforcement across the board. It demonstrates that despite the widespread adoption of mechanisms such as IUU vessel lists, there remains a gap between the theoretical mandate of these organisations and their adoption of measures to enable more effective enforcement. The thesis submits that AusRFMOs must better utilise their enforcement capabilities if they are to fulfil the role envisaged for them under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other associated international agreements. It concludes that AusRFMOs should take steps to move beyond their role as cooperative entities towards an enforcement capacity if they are to make a real contribution to achieving sustainable global fisheries...|$|R

Consequently, data formats and reference codes have evolved rather independently despite some links with the FAO Coordinating Work- ing Party on Fishery Statistics. We have developed a global harmonized database for tuna sheries data by collating the public domain datasets (total catch, monthly-spatially aggregated catch and eort, and catch at size) from IOTC, ICCAT, IATTC and WCPFC. The database currently covers the period 1919 - 2014 and is freely accessible online along {{with a set of}} open source codes to handle the data, i. e. transform the data formats, load the standardized data into the database, extract data and compute a suite of indicators (e. g. global maps of catch).

40|$|The article {{addresses}} the vexing problem of holding corporations liable for assisting in the sovereign abuse of human rights. Currently domestic human rights litigation against corporations {{appears to be}} a proxy fight in which the accomplice is pursued while the principal evades punishment. Typically the principal malfeasor - the sovereign - is immune from suit because of foreign sovereign immunity. But corporations can be found liable for aiding and abetting those violations. This article suggests a solution to this problem, drawing on principles from contract law and arbitration. If a corporation is found liable for aiding and abetting sovereign abuse, it may invoke contractual provisions in the agreement with the sovereign to arbitrate the question of shared responsibility. While the victims may not pursue the sovereign because of immunity, there is no impediment for a corporate joint malfeasor to pursue the sovereign in arbitration to secure its share of liability, either in the form of contribution or indemnification. In short, human rights litigation against the corporation could lead to who pays cross-claim arbitration against the sovereign. Using Guido Calabresi 2 ̆ 7 s scheme of cost avoidance, this approach establishes a system of cost avoidance for human rights, in which corporations incur costs, and then seek to transfer those costs to the cheapest cost avoider - the sovereign. But the tools of contract law and arbitration are not simply for the corporation that aids and abets human rights abuse. They also are available to the majority of corporations that are good corporate citizens. For these corporations, contract law and arbitration procedures create opportunities to impose human rights obligations on transnational contractors, vendors, and suppliers. Human rights obligations can be internalized by contract and subjected to effective dispute resolution procedures, including international arbitration. Finally, some corporations may wish to go even further and create opportunities for <b>non-contracting</b> <b>parties</b> - such as employees or NGOs - to invoke third party beneficiary rights to facilitate compliance with human rights obligations embedded in the contract. These corporations thereby can incorporate a mechanism for those third parties to initiate an effective dispute resolution process to address core human rights concerns...|$|R

This thesis examines how such third party externality and newly generated information should affect the initial form of the contract. In the first essay, a headquarters of a firm designs a mechanism with which it extracts the division managers' superior information about the external market opportunities. The information allows the headquarters to provide optimal investment incentive to the managers and make efficient trading decisions. The essay provides a justification for a real-world headquarters, who delegates all the operating decisions to the division managers but maintains the ultimate authority within the firm. The second essay examines how a client would contract with her lawyer to provide best incentive to the lawyer and maximize her return from litigation. By providing different contingent shares based on settlement and judgment, she is able to provide better incentive without diluting her return from litigation. At the same time, when she has relatively poor bargaining leverage against the counter party, the essay shows that delegating the settlement authority to the lawyer and leaving him a large rent would be more beneficial for the client. The third essay analyzes the salary contracting problem faced by the owner of a firm who is aware of a potential opportunity to sell her firm in the future. The essay demonstrates that when the owner grants a large severance payment to the employee, {{she would be able to}} defer the compensation burden to the potential buyer and increase her net return from the firm. by Albert H.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] In die onderhawige saak het die eiser ingevolge ’n huurkontrak sy motorvoertuig aan ’n konstruksiemaatskappy verhuur. Die konstruksiemaatskappy het op sy beurt ’n sekuriteitsmaatskappy aangestel om die konstruksieperseel te beveilig. Nadat die eiser se voertuig van die perseel gesteel is, stel hy ’n deliktuele skadevergoedingseis teen die sekuriteitsmaatskappy in. Die hoogste hof van appèl klassifiseer die diefstal van die eiser se motorvoertuig as suiwer ekonomiese verlies. Aangesien die veroorsaking van suiwer ekonomiese verlies nie as prima facie onregmatig beskou word nie, moes die hof bepaal of die sekuriteitsmaatskappy volgens die regsopvattings van die gemeenskap ’n regsplig opgelê kan word, en indien wel, of die nienakoming van sodanige plig onredelik was. Die beantwoording van hierdie vrae het onder andere vereis dat die hof allerlei relevante beleidsoorwegings en faktore moes ondersoek ten einde te bepaal of die verweerder se optrede as onregmatig beskou kan word. Binne hierdie konteks moes die hof ook die verdere vraag ontleed: Wat is die impak van die uitsluitingsklousule in die sekuriteitskontrak op die oplegging van ’n regsplig teenoor ’n niekontrakterende derde party? Daar word aangevoer dat die hof nie die nodige aandag aan die volgende faktore en beleidsoorwegings verleen het nie: (a) die beheer wat die sekuriteitsmaatskappy oor die perseel asook die gesteelde voertuig uitgeoefen het; (b) die redelike voorsienbaarheid van die ekonomiese verlies wat volgens die hoogste hof van appèl se eie vroeëre bevindinge wél relevant is by die onregmatigheidsondersoek en wat grotendeels die hof se vrees vir onbeperkte aanspreeklikheid kon besweer; (c) die praktiese stappe wat die sekuriteitsmaatskappy kon gedoen het om die intrede van die verlies te vermy; (d) die omvang van die risiko van intrede van die verlies; en (e) die skep van ’n redelike verwagting by die voertuigeienaar dat sy belange beskerm sou word – iets wat die sekuriteitsmaatskappy ook redelikerwys kon voorsien het. Daar word verder aangevoer dat die hof oordrewe klem plaas op die eiser se onvermoë om sigself behoorlik te beskerm teen die intrede van enige skade aan sy voertuie en dat die erkenning van die skadevergoedingseis nie in hierdie geval sou lei tot onbeperkte aanspreeklikheid nie. Laastens word aangevoer dat sekuriteitskontrak wel ’n belangrike faktor is wat in ag geneem moet word by die bepaling van ’n regsplig. Daar word egter voorgehou dat die implikasie van die uitspraak, naamlik dat ’n uitsluitingsklousule kan funksioneer as ’n beding ten laste van ’n niekontrakterende derde party wat onafhanklik van die kontraktuele verhouding tussen die perseel-okkupeerder en sekuriteitsmaatskappy staan, nie wenslik is nie. Alhoewel die bepalings van ’n kontrak ’n bepalende faktor by die onregmatigheidsvraagstuk is, volg dit nie dat sodanige kontrak ook bindend is ten opsigte van niekontrakterende derde partye nie. In die laaste paragraaf word gekyk na die benaderings wat in ander jurisdiksies oor hierdie netelige kwessie gevolg word. ABSTRACT: In the present case the plaintiff concluded a lease agreement with one Lone Rock, a construction company, in terms of which it leased several of its trucks to Lone Rock. Subsequent to {{the conclusion of the}} lease agreement, and on the insistence of the plaintiff, Lone Rock entered into a security services agreement with the defendant, a security services company, according to which the defendant was obliged to provide security services at Lone Rock’s construction site. The security services agreement included an exclusion clause in terms of which the defendant could not be held liable for any harm or loss arising from the provision of the security services. Following the theft of one of its trucks from the premises the plaintiff instituted a delictual claim for damages against the defendant. The court of first instance denied the plaintiff a remedy and, on appeal, the supreme court of appeal dismissed the plaintiff’s claim, holding that the exclusion clause in the security services agreement operated effectively as against the non-contracting plaintiff. Furthermore, the court held that the theft of the plaintiff’s truck constituted pure economic loss, which, since its causation is not considered to be prima facie wrongful, required the plaintiff to prove that the defendant had a legal duty to the plaintiff to prevent the pure economic loss. The court held that the plaintiff could not prove the existence of such legal duty and that, accordingly, it could not be said that the defendant’s conduct was wrongful {{for the purposes of the}} law of delict. In this article the decision of the supreme court of appeal is analysed along the following grounds: Was the court correct in classifying the loss as purely economic? If the harm suffered was indeed purely economic, did the court come to the right conclusion when it decided that no legal duty to prevent such harm was owed by the defendant to the plaintiff? Was the court correct in holding that the contractual exclusion clause operated against <b>non-contracting</b> <b>parties?</b> First, it is argued that the court’s classification of the theft as purely economic loss is incorrect. This argument has since also been recognised in a subsequent judgement of the supreme court of appeal, Freddy Hirsch Group (Pty) Ltd v Chickenland (Pty) Ltd. Secondly, it is contended that the court came to the wrong conclusion with respect to wrongfulness. This argument is based on a thorough application of the standard test for wrongfulness in the South African law of delict, the so-called boni mores test. According to this test, a court confronted with the causation of pure economic loss should launch an inquiry into the following question: Taking into account the legal convictions of the community, was the causation of the harm unreasonable in the specific circumstances? In order to find unreasonableness, the court must further enquire as to whether there was a legal duty on the plaintiff to prevent the harm. To answer these questions there are a series of factors and policy considerations, which have crystallised in a number of previous cases, which the court may take into account. However, in casu, the court failed to take cognisance of the following relevant factors and policy considerations: (a) the defendant was in control of the plaintiff’s trucks; (b) the plaintiff also had control over the construction site, which was situated in a crime-stricken area; (c) considering the nature of the defendant’s services, as well as the specific facts of the case (not least the manner in which the theft occurred, i. e. by two unknown men who, completely unannounced, showed up at the construction site on a Sunday during a long weekend and gained access by providing the security guard with a forged letter of authorisation and took the vehicle out for a “test drive” after apparently providing maintenance repairs to the vehicles) the harm was reasonably foreseeable; (d) the plaintiff could easily have taken reasonable steps to prevent the harm from occurring; and (e) the reasonable expectation that was created on the part of the plaintiff that the defendant had taken sufficient measures to secure its vehicles and the reliance placed on the defendant as a result hereof. Furthermore, it is submitted that the court’s insistence on the plaintiff’s lack of contractual and/or insurance protection was exaggerated and, also, that the court suffered from a hyperbolic fear of unlimited liability in the present case: the plaintiff’s loss as a particular victim of an unascertained class was foreseeable and, it could be said, the plaintiff’s lease agreements with Lone Rock operated as a limiting factor in this regard. Lastly, regard is had to the role the court assigned to the exclusion clause. In accordance with the court’s own submission, and based on precedent, it is trite that a delictual legal duty owing to third parties may arise from a contractual agreement. The defendant’s security services agreement in this way also forms a basis for a delictual legal duty owing to the plaintiff, specifically taking into consideration the nature of the services the defendant undertook to perform. Accordingly, the court was correct in deciding that the terms of the security agreement were relevant in determining wrongfulness. In this regard, it is submitted, the court is in line with Longueira v Securitas of South Africa (Pty) Ltd, one of only two earlier security guard cases (both of which held the defendant liable despite the existence of a contractual exclusion clause). In line with the general rule of contract law it is further submitted that contractual clauses apply only inter partes. Although the terms of the contract may be a factor in determining wrongfulness, it is argued that the defendant’s security services agreement cannot operate to discharge it from a legal duty to persons who are strangers to those contracts. In the final paragraph, regard is had to some of the approaches to the same legal dilemma which have been developed in foreign jurisdictions, notably England and the Netherlands.

40|$| Furthermore, {{groups on}} both sides must be « representative » of the trade group or sector covered, be it local, {{regional}} or national. Nothing in the texts defines « representative », but the courts and administrative practice have provided for this. The detailed enumeration of the criteria would fall {{outside the scope of}} this study Furthermore, they must include a certain number of clauses whose provisions themselves obviously remain free. Generally, extension covers the whole of a pre-determined industry branch and even, in some cases, to the whole of the branches at the national level, for example, the national intertrade agreement on supplementary pensions. In Germany, at least 50 % of the workers involved must already be covered by an agreement before it can be extended, and there are certain other conditions. In Italy, nothing in the texts positively provides for legal extension but in practice, under the constitution and the powers given in the 1959 statutes, the government has practised extension in certain cases, at least in matters relating to salaries. In Belgium, an agreement can only be imposed on <b>non-contracting</b> <b>parties</b> if it has been entered into within a joint parity commission where the parties involved must also be « representative ». In Holland, extension is not considered an exceptional procedure, because it applies automatically when an agreement is approved by the Labour Foundation, a consultative parity organization at the national level with which we will deal further on. As for Great Britain, we are familiar with their wages councils system, which can extend salary standards in trade union sectors to the whole of a branch or region. In Sweden and Denmark, this extension procedure is non-existent as such in law, but trade unionism is so powerful and the authority of negotiation parties is so effective that, in practice, the few employees not covered by agreements obtain the same advantages as the others. Furthermore, in Sweden, the provisions of the 1928 Labour Collective Agreements Act permit terms of an agreement to be {{in a manner of speaking}} « imposed » through pressures during negotiations disputes between an employer who is not covered and his employees, by those who are already covered (strike or sympathy action). It must be noted that extension procedure is not a new development achieved during recent years. The fact remains that it is always practised and that it is still in most European labour laws, and this is why we take note of it here without evaluating its chances of disappearance or survival during the next few years. Negociation Through Joint OrganizationsOne of the most common formulas used in Western Europe for collective negotiations, and for that matter for several other labour relations aspects (for example dispute settlements) is what is called « paritism ». Paritism consists of any formula or any institution within which the social partners meet, discuss, negotiate and determine « jointly », generally without the help of a third party and without resorting to open dispute, the relations systems between them in connection with labour relations, and every other aspect of their relations on problems of any type. Paritism implies necessarily a certain equilibrium of forces, a mutual recognition of the diverging points of view of the partners, a determination to achieve compromise where possible, a certain consensus on the long-term objectives to be reached by each party, and, finally, a certain maturity which will incite the partners to make all possible decisions on their own, while limiting as far as possible resorting to arbitration and compulsory decisions by the public powers. In our opinion this constitutes the most spectacular post-war development in certain continental European countries in relation to institutionalized co-operation in labour relations. What differentiates the situation in negotiations co-operation as between Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries on the one hand and the countries of the European Economic Community on the other hand, is that in the former countries government abstention is almost total (joint decision procedures were developed in those countries as safeguards against state intervention) while in those countries of the latter group where they are most prevalent, measures were initiated following increased intervention of the public powers in the field of labour-management relations, after the Second World War. In such countries, paritism is not the same as in the former countries and is not the result of agreements between parties (free « contractual » system), but rather of co-operation with the public powers who included these matters in a « policy », by instituting them and by maintaining them with the support of the interested parties (accepted « statutory » system). B — DISPUTE SETTLEMENTS AND INDUSTRIAL PEACEThe dispute settlement system in labour relations vary considerably from one country to another. It is therefore extremely difficult to sift out common features which could, by themselves, give a good idea of the overall situation in this connection. As for individual labour dispute settlements certain West European countries, at least from a legal point of view, have no other procedure than common law. In Holland, for example, there are labour magistrates, but they are operating within ordinary jurisdictions. In France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, as well as in Belgium labour tribunals deal with these disputes. In Germany and Sweden for example, the decisions of these tribunals are final and without appeal. On the other hand, in France, beyond a certain amount, appeal can be made to appeal courts and to the social chamber of the Appeal Court. In England, nothing in the Act imposes recourse to labour tribunals which do not exist. An individual dispute is legally based on the individual labour contract (as is the case for the other countries mentioned above) and there can be, in theory, recourse to ordinary tribunals. In practice, a whole series of conciliation stages is provided between the parties from the local level up to the national level and, eventually, the dispute can be brought before the Industrial Court, whose decision in fact is not mandatory, unless the parties agree to it beforehand. As to the distinction between legal disputes and disputes in interests, i. e., the interpretation or the violation of an existing agreement, during negotiations or the renewal of an agreement, certain countries make a clear distinction between these two types of disputes while other countries make no distinction at all. In the former group, mention could be made of West Germany, Sweden and Denmark where any dispute arising on the interpretation of a collective agreement must be brought before a labour tribunal, whether it is collective or individual ; this springs from a principle recognized in these countries that the signatories must respect industrial peace when they are bound by an agreement. The second group includes Belgium, Italy, England and France, where nothing in the statutes, as far as we know, prevents the eventuality of a strike during the term of an agreement in connection with a collective dispute, unless the parties had excluded this action in the agreement. None of the countries have compulsory arbitration procedures for disputes of interests, at least as far as private services are concerned. Employer associations as well as employee associations were always firmly opposed to this, since, according to them, this would be tantamount to state salary controls, as is more or less the case in New Zealand and Australia. Management and labour representatives on the Belgian National Labour Council, during the study recently made by it of a proposed bill to organize collective social relations between workers and employers, were once again opposed to having a clause deal with this because « in connection with arbitration, the execution force results from arbitration compromise », achieved between the parties themselves if they deemed it advisable to submit to it. ConciliationIn most European countries, conciliation procedures are a purely voluntary matter subordinated to the will of the parties. Obviously most of the countries have placed at the disposal of the parties, for a long time in many cases, conciliation and mediation services and the social partners themselves have often developed such procedures either through basic agreements to this end or through collective agreement themselves. The fact remains, however, that it is interesting to note how, in Canada, our labour laws are by far more stringent than those of these countries in Western Europe. In England, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, there is no legal obligation to resort to conciliation procedures. Only France, in spite of the fact that it liberalized significantly its legislation in this field since 1936, still maintains compulsory conciliation (without procedures) in case of industrial disputes. Section 5 of the statute of February 1950 states that all collective labour disputes must be submitted to conciliation. But this conciliation does not rule out strikes and can take place during strikes. Furthermore, no penalty is provided for in case this obligation was not fulfilled, except that a fine can be levied for failing to appear before the Conciliation Commission. If, as we have just seen, legislation is most summary and not compulsory in relation to conciliation or mediation procedures in European countries, this does not mean, and far from it, that conciliation and mediation are non-existent in their labour relations systems. Quite to the contrary, in most countries, conciliation is common practice on a voluntary basis. The social partners preferred to rely on their own initiative in this field rather than see the government intervene. Joint OrganizationsIt must also be said that where joint organizations exist at the level of the branch activity, as is the case for example in England, Belgium and the Netherlands, these organizations are expected not only to negotiate agreements but also to settle disputes arising between the parties and they constitute, because of this, the best channel through which these disputes are taken up and settled. Paritism plays an important role in this sector. Since collective agreements are generally centralized at their level, these joint organizations constitute the logical terminal for the settlement of disputes. In our opinion, this is an important example of institutionalized co-operation allowing the parties themselves, often without the help of third parties, to settle their own problems without resorting in most cases to tests of economic strength or violence. This is also due to the fact that, in Europe, management and labour confederations effectively control their affiliated bodies and members. England's experience in this field is quite revealing. This may be where the control of the central authority over the basic elements at the local level is at its weakest and least efficient both for employers and workers. The presence of the shop steward, who represents the union but holds his authority from the members he represents, often excludes any « real » presence of the confederation in the establishment. In Great Britain, the number of days lost through strikes or lockouts has increased in recent years in comparison to the other countries of Western Europe, in spite of joint industrial councils and long tested procedures for private conciliation at the industry branch level. All this tends to show that everywhere where control from top to bottom is even slightly effective, co-operation is made much easier when it is achieved at a higher level, where the dispute is out of the hands of the interested parties...|$|R
