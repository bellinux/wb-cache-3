5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s. These cars were aging, in need of maintenance, {{and in many cases}} incompatible with each other. The company recognized the <b>need</b> <b>and</b> opportunity to standardize on a single design.|$|E

He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} <b>need,</b> <b>and</b> no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised lambing to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E

5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian {{government}} depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this <b>need</b> (<b>and</b> the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, environmental protection, and becoming financially independent amidst widespread overpopulation and unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with {{a rise in the}} economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Vedic goddess Nirriti is {{associated}} with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize offerings to keep her away. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati {{is associated}} with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, ugly and {{is associated with}} the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and has a bad temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka-Tantra, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and antithesis of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, luck and beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, <b>need,</b> <b>and</b> poverty.|$|E

It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E

At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they <b>need,</b> <b>and</b> that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} McClelland's (1981) hypothesis that operant and respondent personality measures generally assess independent domains of psychological thought. The conceptual {{basis for the}} measurement of <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> values is explored, through reference to unconscious and conscious levels of thought. It is questioned {{as to whether the}} relationship between <b>needs,</b> values, <b>and</b> traits is generally an independent one, and reference is made to the contribution of development and to different learning environments. An operant measure of <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> respondent measures of values and traits were administered to 203 male and female undergraduate students. Findings for males, but not females, supported McClelland's hypothesis. Results showed that for women, there was a significant relationship between <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> values, <b>and</b> between <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> traits, and that the relationship varied for particular personality variables and for particular age groups of women. Findings are discussed generally in terms of cognitive, affect, and information processing theories...|$|R

5|$|The king {{determined}} the tax levels based on <b>need</b> <b>and</b> circumstances {{in the kingdom}} while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region. The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The {{quantity}} of studio work created {{a conflict between}} Costa's <b>need</b> <b>and</b> desire to support his family, sometimes achieved through working day and night in studios, and his belief in developing his jazz talents, which would have required playing more in clubs {{and dealing with the}} people – agents, club owners, artists and repertoire men, and so on – whose goals seldom matched those of creative musicians. Notable examples of Costa's studio work from this period are being part of Gigi Gryce's final recordings as leader, appearances on Gunther Schuller's Third Stream album Jazz Abstractions, a series of small-group recordings with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, and two tracks of Shelly Manne's 2-3-4, with Costa featuring on piano for one track and vibes on the other, both with just George Duvivier and Manne. Costa also contributed on vibes to Gryce's music for Fred Baker's short dance film On the Sound. A long association with pianist and arranger Ralph Sharon meant that Costa was the vibraphonist in the Sharon orchestra on June 9, 1962, when it played with Bennett at Carnegie Hall. Costa's final recording session was on July 12, 1962, as part of a group assembled by saxophonist Al Cohn mainly from the Benny Goodman band that had toured the Soviet Union earlier that year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{contribute}} to the development of the modern theory of lexicographical functions by offering a critical examination of the following concepts associated with it: primary needs, primary data, secondary needs, secondary data, function-related <b>needs,</b> <b>and</b> function-related data. By way of introduction, a presentation of the basic tenets of the theory is offered, fol-lowed by a description of the general characteristics of secondary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data. Next, on the basis of both a critical analysis of the theory and an examination of selected data types in existing lexicographical products, it is argued that all user <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> all data that satisfy those needs are function-related. The distinction between the concepts function-related and usage-related is thus rejected. Since this has serious implications for the relation between secondary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data on the one hand <b>and</b> primary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data on the other, this relation is subsequently reconsidered. This leads to a redefinition of all the concepts examined. It is also explained why an ideal state of lexicography, where secondary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data do not exist, cannot be achieved in the real world...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to broadly explore both the achievements <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> problems of the diverse Hmong American community across the United States, with a particular emphasis on felt <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> problems. Felt <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> problems are defined as <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> problems ”perceived by individuals experiencing the problem, may be equated with want and are phenomenological in character ” (Cox, Erlich, Rothman & Tropman, 1984, p. 9). Taken from this perspective, among the problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> discussed in this paper are those that were identified by key informants or members of the Hmong American community, {{who live in the}} community and are well informed of the acute issues experienced by their fellow co-ethnics. Felt <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> problems, in addition to other needs, are very important issues for Hmong community gatekeepers, social workers and service providers to know and understand, in order to effectively work with a particular community (Cox, et al. 1984). The phenomena identified in this exploratory paper are intended to provide a departure point for researchers undertaking future relevant studies of social issues important to the Hmong community...|$|R
