5|$|Glenn was {{on several}} {{committees}} {{during his first}} term as Senator, including the Government Operations Committee, Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, and Energy Research and Water Resources Subcommittee, and was chair of the Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Glenn introduced bills on energy policy to try to counter the energy crisis in the 70s. Glenn also introduced legislation based on nuclear <b>non-proliferation,</b> and was the chief author of the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Act of 1978, the first of six major pieces of legislation that he produced on the subject.|$|E
5|$|East Timor {{ratified}} the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty, Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and Chemical Weapons Convention in 2003. The East Timorese Government {{has no plans}} to acquire nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The country also became a party to the Ottawa Treaty, which bans anti-personnel mines, in 2003.|$|E
5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of nuclear weapons policy and <b>non-proliferation,</b> as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier post-Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty.|$|E
5|$|On the AEC from 1949 to 1954, Smyth argued unsuccessfully {{against a}} crash course to develop the {{hydrogen}} bomb and in favor of international control of nuclear weapons. He was the sole {{member of the commission}} to vote against stripping J. Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance. As IAEA ambassador from 1961 to 1970 he {{played an important role in}} the realization of the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with President Lyndon Johnson and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty. Seaborg was called to the White House {{in the first week of}} the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland made {{detailed}} {{plans to}} acquire and test nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Less {{than two weeks}} after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Swiss government started studying the possibility of building nuclear weapons, and continued its military nuclear program for 43 years until 1988. It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons. Switzerland never possessed biological or chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{signed the}} Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons (NTP) on 27 November 1969, and its process of {{ratification}} first {{met with the}} resistance of the Federal Department of Defense. After signing the treaty, Switzerland's policy of pursuing acquiring nuclear weapons was replaced by one of studying acquisition to provide options in case the treaty broke down. Switzerland ratified the treaty on 9 March 1977. Soon after that, Switzerland ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) {{was opened}} for signature. All five nuclear weapons states {{recognized}} under the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) signed the treaty, with 66 other states following that day. Fiji {{became the first}} state to ratify the treaty on October 10, 1996. Currently, 183 states have signed and 166 states have ratified the treaty. Most recently, Niue signed the treaty on April 9, 2012 and Myanmar and Swaziland ratified on September 21, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Defence Force {{seeks to}} be a {{high-technology}} force, {{and much of}} its equipment {{is scheduled to be}} replaced or upgraded in the near future. Australia does not possess {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty. Although most of the ADF's weapons are only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the FN Herstal 35 is the ADF's standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the FN Herstal MAG-58 the standard light machine gun and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The PTBT was a {{first of}} a series of nuclear arms control {{treaties}} in the second half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed Arms Control Treaty in 1971, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972. In 1974, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} Cold War, NATO's watch {{against the}} Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not {{actually}} lead to direct military action. On 1July 1968, the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until {{a decision was made}} to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1968, Fisher {{served as}} the Deputy Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in which he took a primary {{negotiations}} role during the Atomic Test Ban Treaty of 1963 between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. At that time he was Deputy to John J. McCloy, Adviser to the President on Disarmament. In 1968, Fisher served {{as one of the}} chief U.S. negotiators of the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty, which was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and 59 other countries on July 1, 1968. A collection of letters from Adrian Fisher to President Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk regarding his perception and activities on arms control and disarmament is maintained by the Federation of American Scientists.|$|E
5|$|John F. Tierney (born September 18, 1951) is an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts from January 3, 1997, to January 3, 2015. In February 2016, he was appointed {{the executive director of the}} Council for a Livable World and the Center for Arms Control and <b>Non-Proliferation,</b> the council’s affiliated education and research organization. He is a Democrat who represented the state's , which includes the state's North Shore and Cape Ann. Born and raised in Salem, Massachusetts, Tierney graduated from Salem State College and Suffolk University Law School. He worked in private law and served on the Salem Chamber of Commerce (1976–97). Tierney first ran for the House of Representatives in 1994 against Republican incumbent Peter G. Torkildsen, losing by a small margin; but he defeated Torkildsen in the subsequent election and was sworn in as a U.S. representative in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan {{would amount to}} espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of a}} comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a <b>non-proliferation</b> agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban would have the same effect on limiting proliferation.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{increasing}} role on {{the world}} stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. However, recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.|$|E
25|$|On January 10, 2003, North Korea {{withdrew from}} the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty.|$|E
25|$|The Nuclear <b>Non-proliferation</b> Act {{amended the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 by {{establishing}} new criteria governing U.S. nuclear exports {{licensed by the}} NRC. Congress directed the DOE to initiate and plan the design, construction, and operation activities for expansion of uranium enrichment capacity, sufficient for domestic and foreign needs. The act specified that the nuclear <b>non-proliferation</b> controls would not expire annually, {{eliminating the need for}} extensions.|$|E
25|$|Aiken {{was also}} a {{champion}} of nuclear <b>non-proliferation</b> and he received the honour {{of being the first}} minister to sign the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty in 1968 at Moscow. Aiken's impact as Minister for External Affairs was such that he is sometimes seen as the father of Irish foreign policy. His performance was praised in particular by a later Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fine Gael's Garret FitzGerald.|$|E
25|$|In an oped in The Washington Times, Nazarbayev {{called for}} the Nuclear <b>Non-proliferation</b> Treaty to be modernised and better balanced.|$|E
25|$|The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission preparatory {{commission}} is tasked with preparing {{the activities of}} the nuclear <b>non-proliferation</b> organization.|$|E
25|$|The Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Act of 1978 {{sought to}} limit {{the spread of nuclear}} weapons. Among other things, it {{established}} criteria governing U.S. nuclear exports licensed by the NRC and took steps to strengthen the international safeguards system. This helped ensure the security of the United States. Countries that signed the international Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty (NPT) committed {{to prevent the spread of}} nuclear weapons in return for U.S. knowledge and materials in the form of nuclear reactors and fuel.|$|E

25|$|Iran {{signed the}} Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty (NPT) in 1968 and {{ratified}} it in 1970, making Iran's nuclear program subject to IAEA verification.|$|E
25|$|Reid is {{currently}} {{a member of the}} Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and <b>Non-proliferation,</b> established in October 2009.|$|E
25|$|The ministers were of {{the view}} that {{multilateral}} institutions established under various disarmament agreements should be the primary mechanism to achieve the desired objective of disarmament and <b>non-proliferation.</b> They agreed to continue cooperation at IAEA and other forums with regard to peaceful use of atomic energy under suitable safeguards. They also agreed to consider enhancing international civilian nuclear cooperation, with other nations who share similar objectives of <b>non-proliferation.</b> The ministers also hoped for a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear program, {{within the context of}} IAEA.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Romania {{ratified}} the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty, which banned them from developing and building their own nuclear weapons. However Nicolae Ceaușescu started the Danube Program in secret.|$|E
25|$|India {{has been}} pushing for reforms in the United Nations and in the World Trade Organisation with mixed results. India's {{candidature}} for a permanent seat at the UN Security Council is currently backed by several countries including United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, African Union nations, United States and China. In 2005, the United States signed a nuclear co-operation agreement with India even though the latter is {{not a part of}} the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty. The United States agreed that India's strong nuclear <b>non-proliferation</b> record made it an exception and persuaded other Nuclear Suppliers Group members to sign similar deals with India.|$|E
25|$|The {{option to}} {{continue}} development of weapons was abandoned in 1966, and Sweden's subsequent {{signing of the}} <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty (NPT) in 1968 began the wind-down of the program, which finally concluded in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Brazil acceded to the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty on September 18, 1998, {{ratified}} the Geneva Protocol on 28 August 1970, the Biological Weapons Convention on 27 February 1973, and the Chemical Weapons Convention on 13 March 1996.|$|E
25|$|Despite Russia's claimed {{annexation}} of Crimea, which the UN General Assembly rejected as invalid, the Government of Ukraine in 2014 reaffirmed its 1994 decision to accede to the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon state.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{developed}} a new domestic version of the missile, the SLBM-designated Alfa. The program was cancelled in 1975 after Italy ratified the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> Treaty, with the final launch of the third prototype in 1976.|$|E
25|$|During the 1976 presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter voiced strong {{criticisms of}} the Brazil-West Germany deal {{as well as the}} Gerald Ford administration’s {{handling}} of the matter. In Carter’s view, a more assertive stance on <b>non-proliferation</b> was necessary.|$|E
