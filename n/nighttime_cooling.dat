50|$|Depending on {{a variety}} of factors (wall thickness, type of wood, {{particular}} mortar recipe), the insulative value of a cordwood wall, as expressed in R-value is generally less than that of a high-efficiency stud wall. Cordwood walls have greater thermal mass than stud frame but less than common brick and mortar. This is because the specific heat capacity of clay brick is higher (0.84 versus wood's 0.42), and is denser than airy woods like cedar, cypress, or pine. Thermal mass makes it easier for a building to maintain median interior temperatures while going through daily hot and cold phases. In climates like the desert with broad daily temperature swings thermal mass will absorb and then slowly release the midday heat and <b>nighttime</b> <b>cool</b> in sequence, moderating temperature fluctuations.

50|$|One {{result of}} this {{stability}} is that as the summer wears on, there is less and less oxygen below the thermocline as the water below the thermocline never circulates {{to the surface and}} organisms in the water deplete the available oxygen. As winter approaches, the temperature of the surface water will drop as <b>nighttime</b> <b>cooling</b> dominates heat transfer. A point is reached where the density of the cooling surface water becomes greater than the density of the deep water and overturning begins as the dense surface water moves down under the influence of gravity. This process is aided by wind or any other process (currents for example) that agitates the water. This effect also occurs in Arctic and Antarctic waters, bringing water to the surface which, although low in oxygen, is higher in nutrients than the original surface water. This enriching of surface nutrients may produce blooms of phytoplankton, making these areas productive.|$|E
50|$|The lower {{atmosphere}} also typically contains a boundary between two distinct regions (the troposphere and stratosphere), but that boundary (the tropopause) displays quite different behavior. However, atmospheric thermoclines, or inversions, can occur, e.g. as <b>nighttime</b> <b>cooling</b> of the Earth's surface produces cold, dense, often calm air {{adjacent to the}} ground. The coldest air is next to the ground, with air temperature increasing with height. At {{the top of this}} nighttime boundary layer (which may be only a hundred meters) the normal adiabatic temperature profile of the troposphere (i.e. temperature decreasing with altitude) is again observed. The thermocline or inversion layer occurs where the temperature profile changes from positive to negative with increasing height. The stability of the night time inversion is usually destroyed soon after sunrise as the sun's energy warms the ground, which warms the air in the inversion layer. The warmer, less dense air then rises, destroying the stability that characterizes the nightly inversion.|$|E

In order to clarify the cooling period most effective in reducing decreases in feed intake and milk production, experiments were carried out based on the diurnal rhythm of heat production and heat dissipation. In experiment 1, the effects of hot environment on milk production were investigated. The animals were kept first in a thermoneutral environment (20. 0 °C, 80. 0 %) for 12 days, they were then transitioned to a hot environment (32 °C, 80. 0 %) for 13 days before being returned to second thermoneutral environment for a further 12 days.

While ten lactating Japanese Saanen goats (aged 2 years, weighing 41. 0 kg) during early lactation were used in experiment 1, ten lactating goats (aged 2 years, weighing 47. 5 kg) during mid-lactation were used in experiment 2. The animals were fed 300 g of concentrated feed and excessive amounts of crushed alfalfa hay cubes twice daily. Water was given ad libitum. The animals were milked twice daily.

40|$|In the subtropics, air {{conditioning}} (A/C) for a bedroom in residential buildings commonly serves {{to provide an}} appropriate indoor thermal environment at nighttime for sleeping. During daytime when A/C is not provided, {{a large amount of}} thermal energy can be stored in the thermal mass in its envelope components, in particularly its external walls. The energy stored would be gradually released, contributing significantly to the total space cooling load in the bedroom at nighttime. Therefore, this paper reports a simulation study on the impacts of daytime external envelope heat gain/storage on the <b>nighttime</b> <b>cooling</b> load in a hypothetic west-facing bedroom and the related mitigation measures in the subtropical Hong Kong. The study results showed that, among all envelope components, the west-facing external wall contributed most significantly to the total <b>nighttime</b> <b>cooling</b> load, because of its direct exposure to solar radiation, thus the heat gain and storage in its thermal mass. In addition, adding an air gap in the west-facing external wall can reduce remarkably the hourly total <b>nighttime</b> <b>cooling</b> load for the first hour (21 : 00 - 22 : 00) and the total cooling load for the 10 -h A/C period.

30|$|Although it is {{well known}} that sap {{exudation}} during early spring in temperate deciduous trees occurs in response to daytime warming and <b>nighttime</b> <b>cooling,</b> the mechanisms of the process are not yet fully understood. Previous theories suggested that changes in stress in the wood caused by daytime heating and <b>nighttime</b> <b>cooling</b> might be linked with sap flow. Consequently, a study of itaya-kaede maple (Aver mono) and shirakamba birch (Betula platyphylla var.japonica) looked at tangential strains. One-hour intervals for 3 years of the tangential strains on the inner bark of stem and root were measured in itaya-kaede maple and shirakamba birch during the sap exudation season. The measurements indicated different mechanisms of sap exudation in these two trees. During the sap exudation season in late March, when the temperature fluctuated around 0 °C, the tangential strain in the root of itaya-kaede maple showed expansion in the daytime and contraction at night. Conversely, in early April the tangential strain in the root of shirakamba birch exhibited contraction in the daytime and expansion at night. The changes in tangential strains in itaya-kaede maple were attributed to conditioning, a known concept used to explain the uptake mechanism of soil water in maple and its exudation during early spring. However, because the change in tangential strain in the roots of shirakamba birch was similar to that found during the rampant season, sap exudation was not attributed to conditioning but to the plentiful supply of water from the roots. The implications of these mechanisms are that different sap harvesting techniques may be appropriate for different tree species.|$|E

Mean current speed at the surface increases as the effects of wind stress become confined to a shallow layer.

Having previously reported an improved scaling analysis on the daytime radiation-induced natural convection, the authors present in this paper a detailed scaling analysis quantifying the flow properties at varying offshore distances induced by nighttime surface cooling. Two critical functions of offshore distance have been derived to identify the distinctness and the stability of the thermal boundary layer. Two flow scenarios are possible depending on the bottom slope. For the relatively large slope scenario, three flow regimes are possible, which are discussed in detail. For each flow regime, all the possible distinctive subregions are identified. Two different sets of scaling incorporating the offshore-distance dependency have been derived for the conduction-dominated region and stable-convection-dominated region respectively.
