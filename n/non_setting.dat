40|$|Abstract: Idioscopus clypealis (Lethierry) is {{commonly}} known as mango leaf hopper. The hopper reduces mongo production by causing <b>non</b> <b>setting</b> of flower and dropping of immature fruits. The first appearance of hoppers (0. 12 and 0. 16) on the branches of mango trees was recorded in February, which is correlated with increase in maximum (23. 89 oC and 24. 29 oC) and minimum temperature (11. 46 oC and 11. 88 oC) and decrease in relative humidity (88. 15 % and 86. 85 %). Peak hopper population (5. 88 and 6. 46) was recoded in May on temperature range of (40. 34 oC and 40. 88 oC) and (27. 22 oC and 27. 62 oC) as maximum and minimum, which was very high, whereas, relative humidity was very low (55. 80 % and 55. 09 %). With the increase in maximum and minimum temperature and decrease in relative humidity, hopper population raised. Thus, maximum and minimum temperature positively affected the hopper population, whereas, relative humidity had negative effect, but rainfall showed no significant effect, as it was fluctuating...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainable}} forest management and biodiversity conservation has {{become more and more}} important in the last decades. The preservation of key habitats and ecologically valuable forests is recognized to be a goal in the planning process. Forest certification is a tool used to implement and achieve this objective. In Sweden the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification imposes to the forest owners who want to be certified, to set aside at least 5 % of their properties for biodiversity purposes. In southern Sweden this mechanism becomes very relevant, since the small private forest is {{the most common form of}} ownership. This thesis aims to investigate how much the conservation value of the set aside areas differs among different estates. Furthermore the presence of structures important for biodiversity in such small private forest estates is analysed, in particular comparing set aside areas and the most ecologically valuable <b>non</b> <b>set</b> aside areas. The question that was tried to be answered was if the stands presenting the highest ecological and biodiversity values were those set aside. The study implementation consisted of inventorying ten estates certified according to FSC scheme and estimating the ecological value of the stands belonging to both, <b>set</b> aside and <b>non</b> <b>set</b> aside areas. A simplified biodiversity estimate was used where features representing the most important structures for forest biodiversity were checked. In particular different types of dead wood were surveyed and analysed, tree diameters (as a representation of old trees) and deciduous tree component. In addition an assessment of biodiversity potential was conducted in each stand, as a further variable which gives a score indicating the presence of valuable elements. The data analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the amount of dead wood between <b>set</b> aside and <b>non</b> <b>set</b> aside stands. The only difference that was found was in the amount of lying dead trees, with a slightly higher volume for the <b>non</b> <b>set</b> aside area. The field survey, combined with the biodiversity potential and the data revealed that in some cases low productive stands were preferred to stands with higher ecological characteristics in the setting aside process. A lack of large trees was also noticed. In conclusion, as a general observation, it could be said that in certified small private forest estates, a good management of stands presenting high biodiversity potential is conducted. Yet here are elements that could be improved, like ensuring the percentage of the forest set aside fully corresponds to the most ecologically valuable area. Furthermore, the management could be done in a more efficient way, with more careful attention to substrates and element lacking in the landscape, such as large trees and deadwood...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Record {{matching}} {{refers to}} the task of finding entries that refer to the same entity in two or more files, is a vital process in data integration. Most of the supervised record matching methods require training data provided by users. Such methods can not apply for web database scenario, where query results dynamically generated. In existing system, an unsupervised record matching method effectively identifies the duplicates from query result records of multiple web databases by identifying the duplicate and <b>non</b> duplicate <b>set</b> in the source and from that <b>non</b> duplicate <b>set</b> again searches for the existence of duplication. Then use two co-operative classifiers from the <b>non</b> duplicate <b>set,</b> they are Weighted Component Similarity Summing (WCSS) Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. These two classifiers can be used to identify the query results iteratively from multiple web databases. In this paper we modify record matching algorithm with genetic algorithm. The genetic programming is time consuming so we proposed UDD with genetic programming. A performance evaluation for accuracy is done for the dataset with duplicates using UDD and UDD with Genetic algorithm...|$|R

Credit constraints introduce an un-priced negative effect of the real interest rate on investment. Because of this effect, the standard characterization of economic efficiency with the Golden Rule fails to apply. When fiscal policy is optimally designed, the first best allocation can be achieved thanks to a positive inflation rate and a proportional tax on consumption. credit constraints; long run inflation; <b>non</b> Ricardian <b>setting...</b>|$|R
