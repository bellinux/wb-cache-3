The major drawback of using neat biodiesel in CI engines is its superior NOx emissions and lower thermal efficiency (Pandian et al. 2018). NOx emissions should be controlled by suitable methods to meet the emission standards (Anbarasu et al. 2015). Among many techniques, an emulsion process is preferred for the instantaneous decrease in PM and NOx emissions for a biodiesel-fueled diesel engine (Ravikumar and Saravanan 2016). In this process, water is mixed with the biodiesel in a certain percentage {{in the presence of}} a nonionic surfactant, which emulsifies water and biodiesel to improve the stability of the mixture (Melo-Espinosa et al. 2015; Anbarasu and Karthikeyan 2016; Appavu and Venkata Ramanan 2018).

30|$|There {{is concern}} that {{availability}} {{of crude oil}} and petroleum products may decline {{in the future and}} that they will also continue to be expensive. On the other hand, the fuel economy of engines is improving and will continue to progress. However, the massive increase in the number vehicles has led to high fuel demand. Gasoline and diesel fuels may probably become limited and costly in the near future. An alternate fuel must be developed to reduce the forecast gap between the demand and the availability of fuel. Biofuels derived from vegetable oils are found to be the most promising alternative fuel to diesel. Biofuels can be employed in existing diesel engines with minor or no modifications (Mohod et al. 2015). In addition, the use of biofuel can extend the life of diesel engines because it is more lubricating than petroleum diesel fuel (Mohod et al. 2011). However, studying the behavior of biofuel as a <b>neat</b> <b>fuel</b> is an inevitable task for designing the combustion process of the future’s engines. The chemical composition of these biofuels should also be studied in order to use them as a prospective alternate fuel for future application in engines and combustors.

The effects of fuel blending, combustion staging, and operating furnace temperatures on {{emissions of pollutants}} were assessed. Furnace effluents were analyzed for products of incomplete combustion (PICs) including CO, volatile and semi-volatile hydrocarbons, and particulate matter, as {{has been reported in}} Ref. [1]. Emitted unburned hydrocarbons include traces of potentially health-hazardous Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are the focus of this work. Under the batch combustion conditions implemented herein, PAH were only generated during the volatile combustion phase of the fuels. The most prevalent species were in descending order: naphthalene, acenaphthylene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, dibenzofuran, benzofuran, byphenyl, fluorene, 9 H-fluoren- 9 -one, acephenantrylene, benzo[b] fluoranthene, 1 -methyl-naphthalene; 2 -methyl-naphthalene, benz[a] anthracene and benzo[a] pyrene. PAH yields were the highest from combustion of neat bagasse. Combustion of the blends resulted in lower yields of PAH, than combustion of either of their <b>neat</b> <b>fuel</b> constituents. Increasing the furnace operating temperature enhanced the PAH emissions from bagasse, but had little effect on those from the coal or from the blends. Flue gas treatment in a secondary-stage furnace, upon with additional air, typically reduced PAH yields by promoting oxidation of the primary-stage furnace effluents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both fundamental droplet combustion experiments and experiments using an unstable liquid rocket combustor {{are used to}} study the effects these additives on the combustion behavior. The liquid fuels consist of ethanol and JP- 8. The droplet experiments consist of both visual and OH high speed planar laser–induced fluorescence measurements. Simple combustion models are incorporated as well to provide further understanding. It is found that ammonia borane increases the regression rate of a single ethanol droplet. Evidence indicates that hydrogen gas is released throughout the combustion process of the droplet and influences the combustion behavior notably. Laser diagnostics indicate that changes in flame structure occur. The other components of ammonia borane affect the combustion behavior of the droplet, especially {{near the end of}} the droplet lifetime, causing the droplet to shatter. Nano aluminum has very little impact on the combustion behavior of single fuel droplets of JP- 8 and ethanol. Nano aluminum is observed to combust only when a surfactant, Neodol, is present which produces gas generation and bubble formation within the droplet. Combustor experiments show similar trends as the droplet combustion experiments. Ammonia borane has a notable impact on the combustion stability of the system allowing it to be unstable for more combustor geometries. It is shown that ammonia borane addition produces a bimodal unsteady energy release within the combustor while the <b>neat</b> <b>fuel</b> does not. This combustion behavior allows for the increased amount of unstable combustor geometries.

The A 25 case was also extended to achieve information how the soot emissions varies with the operational parameters; start of injection (SOI), NOx level (regulated by EGR) and needle opening pressure (NOP). The spray studies were performed in a high temperature/high pressure spray chamber at relevant conditions. For the numerical simulations the KIVA 3 -V code was used with detailed chemical kinetics. The results shows that the <b>neat</b> FAME <b>fuels</b> lower the soot emissions by up to 90 % compared with Diesel fuel. Moreover, even low blend ratios lowers the soot emissions significantly. Among the FAME fuels, combustion with PME had the lowest amount of soot emissions due to its lowest amount of di-and tri-unsaturated fatty acids (i. e. less double bonds) in comparison with SME and RME. The NOx emissions were increased for the <b>neat</b> FAME <b>fuels</b> in relation the Diesel fuel. The increase in NOx emissions for the <b>neat</b> FAME <b>fuels</b> is due to the higher flame temperature for the FAME fuels which could be a result of the oxygen content which causes a lower equivalence ratio (phi), i. e. leaner local reacting mixture.

The momentum flux, mass flow, instantaneous mass flow, discharge coefficient, injection velocity, momentum coefficient and momentum efficiency have been examined. The injections were carried out in a high pressure chamber filled with nitrogen. The measured momentum flux is observed to increase with increasing injection pressure in a linear form.

Emberson, et al, 'Hydraulic {{characterization}} of Diesel and water emulsions using momentum flux', Fuel, Vol. 162, pp. 23 - 33, December 2015, doi: [URL] ?? 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Diesel and water emulsions {{have the potential}} to be used in compression ignition engines to control the emissions of NOx and PM. Very {{little is known about the}} influence emulsification will have on the fuel sprays formed during injection. This paper outlines the measurement of the momentum flux of injection sprays of Diesel fuel and Diesel fuel emulsions containing 10 % and 20 % water, with the goal of hydraulically characterizing the sprays and identifying the influence emulsification may have on them. The momentum flux, mass flow, instantaneous mass flow, discharge coefficient, injection velocity, momentum coefficient and momentum efficiency have been examined. The injections were carried out in a high pressure chamber filled with nitrogen. The measured momentum flux is observed to increase with increasing injection pressure in a linear form. Increasing the ambient density in the chamber resulted in a decrease in the measured momentum flux. The emulsified fuel sprays had a very similar momentum flux as the <b>neat</b> Diesel <b>fuel</b> sprays. The total mass of emulsified fuel injected was less than for neat Diesel at corresponding condition. The instantaneous mass flow rate was determined using a normalized form of the momentum flux measurement and the independently measured total mass injected. The emulsions tended to have a lower discharge coefficient and there is no evidence that the nozzle is cavitating at these conditions. The emulsified fuels have tended to have a higher injection velocity than the <b>neat</b> Diesel <b>fuel</b> sprays. The momentum efficiency is introduced, which uses the instantaneous mass measurement and the theoretical velocity of the spray. The emulsified fuels have a larger momentum efficiency, a result of their high injection velocity compared with the <b>neat</b> Diesel <b>fuel...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Biodiesel is a non–toxic, {{biodegradable}} {{and renewable}} alternative fuel {{that can be}} used with little or no engine modifications. Biodiesel is currently expensive but would be more cost effective if it could be produced from low–cost oils (restaurant waste, frying oils, animal fats). These low–cost feedstocks are more challenging to process because they contain high levels of free fatty acids. A process for converting these feedstocks to fuel–grade biodiesel has been developed and described previously. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the biodiesel produced from high free fatty acid feedstocks on engine performance and emissions. Two different biodiesels were prepared from animal fat–based yellow grease with 9 % free fatty acids and from soybean oil. The <b>neat</b> <b>fuels</b> and their 20 % blends with No. 2 diesel fuel were studied at steady–state engine operating conditions in a four–cylinder turbocharged diesel engine. Although both biodiesel fuels provided significant reductions in particulates, carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbons, the oxides of nitrogen increased by 11 % and 13 % for the yellow grease methyl ester and soybean oil methyl ester, respectively. The conversion of the biodiesel fuel’s energy to work was equal to that from diesel fuel...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study is conducted {{to evaluate the}} performance and exhaust emissions characteristics of diesel fuel blends with 8 %, 16 % and 24 % (by vol.) diethyl ether (DEE), in a standard, experimental, single-cylinder, four-stroke, high-speed direct injection (HSDI), 'Hydra' diesel engine located at the authors' laboratory. The tests are conducted using each of the <b>fuel</b> blends or <b>neat</b> diesel <b>fuel,</b> with the engine working at three different loads. Fuel consumption, exhaust smoke, and regulated gas emissions such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons are measured. The differences in the performance and exhaust emission parameters of the three DEE/diesel fuel blends from the baseline operation of the diesel engine, i. e., when working with <b>neat</b> diesel <b>fuel,</b> are compared. Combustion chamber and fuel injection pressure diagrams are obtained, and heat release rate analysis of the experimentally obtained cylinder pressure diagrams is performed, revealing some interesting features of the combustion mechanisms. These results and the widely differing {{physical and chemical properties}} of DEE against those for diesel fuel are used to aid the interpretation of the observed engine behavior. It is revealed that this fuel, which can be produced from biomass (bio-DEE), is a promising one for diesel engines. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
30|$|Recent {{experimental}} investigations {{conducted using}} a single-cylinder spark-ignition research engine allowed comparing {{the performance and}} emissions of <b>neat</b> n-butanol <b>fuel</b> to that of gasoline and ethanol. It was found that gasoline and butanol are closest in engine performance, with butanol producing slightly less brake torque. Exhaust gas temperature and nitrogen oxide measurements show that butanol combusts at a lower peak temperature. Of particular interest were the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, which were between two and three times to those of gasoline, suggesting that butanol is not atomizing as effectively as gasoline and ethanol [13].|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the environmental hazards and the alarming levels of air pollution have led to more restrictive regulations on engines emission control in recent years. Approach: The dwindling resources and rising cost of crude oil have resulted in an intensified search for alternate fuels. In the present study biodiesel (palm oil methyl ester) blends with diesel was investigated in a direct injection stationary diesel engine. The stationary engine test bed used consists of a single-cylinder four stroke diesel engine, eddy current dynamometer with computer control data acquisition system and exhaust emissions analyzer. Results: Engine tests were conducted at constant speed using <b>neat</b> diesel <b>fuel</b> and various proportions of biodiesel blends. The exhaust emissions such as CO, HC and NOx were measured using exhaust gas analyzer. Performance characteristics like brake thermal efficiency and specific fuel consumption were recorded. The differences in the measured emissions and performance of the biodiesel-diesel fuel blends from the baseline operation of the engine, i. e., when working with <b>neat</b> diesel <b>fuel</b> were determined and compared. Conclusion: It was concluded that the lower blends of biodiesel increased the brake thermal efficiency and reduced the fuel consumption. Biodiesel blends produces lower engine emissions than diesel. From the result, it has been established that 20 - 40 % of palm oil biodiesel can be use as a substitute for diesel without any engine modifications...|$|R
