5000|$|Because the {{appendix}} {{is a piece}} of intestine, it follows a similar referral pattern. An appendix with some early inflammation may give a <b>non-specific</b> <b>irritation</b> somewhere near the umbilicus (belly button). Should the inflammation become severe, it may actually irritate the inner lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum. This thin layer lies under or behind the abdominal wall muscles. Now the pain is [...] "localized". If pressure is applied to the muscles of the right lower abdomen (or iliac fossa) near a very irritated appendix, then the muscle fibers in that area will be stretched and will hurt.|$|E
40|$|Background Rhinitis, either {{allergic}} or non-allergic, is frequent in athletes, {{particularly in}} swimmers. In this latter case, exposure to chlorine in swimming pools seems {{to play a}} relevant role, since it can exacerbate a pre-existing allergic rhinitis (AR) or produce a <b>non-specific</b> <b>irritation.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to detail the clinical and cytological characteristics of rhinitis in swimmers, and to assess the possible role of chlorine-induced symptoms. Methods Elite swimmers with rhinitis symptoms underwent a complete diagnostic work-up, including allergy testing, nasal cytology and anterior rhinomanometry. Those evaluations were repeated after 1 month of use of a nasal clip during swimming. A matched group of asymptomatic swimmers was also studied. A total of 74 swimmers (54 symptomatic and 20 controls), with an age range of 9 - 21 years, were studied. In the control group, only mild and non-specific findings were observed, and only two had a positive skin test. Results In the symptomatic group, 24 (44...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{and repeat}} dose {{inhalation}} {{studies have been}} {{an important part of}} the safety assessment of drugs, chemicals, and other products throughout the world for many years. It is known that damage to the respiratory tract can be triggered either by <b>non-specific</b> <b>irritation</b> or by specific immune-mediated pathogenesis, and it is acknowledged that traditional inhalation studies are not designed to address fully the impact of the latter. It is also rec-ognized that different types of immune-mediated responses can be triggered by different classes of compounds and that some immune reactions in the lung are life threatening. As such, it is important to understand as fully as possible the basis for the immune-mediated damage to the lung in order to characterize adequately the risks of individual chemicals or proteins. It is against this background that a review of the methods used to assess the potential for immune-mediated respiratory hypersensitivity was conducted. The primar...|$|E

40|$|The {{sense of}} smell of 106 {{alkaline}} battery workmen exposed at their work to cadmium and nickel dust has been compared with a control group of 84 men matched for age. The battery workers reported significantly more anosmia than the controls (15 % to zero) and did less well in the phenol smelling test (27 · 3 % to 4 · 8 %). Cadmium proteinuria was found in 17 of the battery workers, 11 of whom showed virtual anosmia. Figures of recent concentrations of cadmium and nickel in the atmosphere are given. The noses of 85 battery workers and 75 controls were examined. Signs of <b>non-specific</b> chronic <b>irritation</b> were more frequent in the battery workers but no significant relationship was established between this appearance {{and the presence of}} anosmia. It is concluded that the anosmia is due to exposure to cadmium or nickel dust or a mixture of the two...|$|R
40|$|Artists in {{northern}} Canada carve soft stones that are mineralogically diverse. In addition, some artists carve organic media such as ivory, bone and antler. In recent decades, power tools have replaced traditional methods for producing artworks, {{resulting in the}} production of more dust and finer particles. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether these artists had increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms related to their work. A cross-sectional survey documented respiratory symptoms of 232 carvers and 232 non-carvers. Logistic regression analysis was used to model the role of exposure in relation to symptoms. Some symptoms suggestive of bronchial responsiveness were found in excess among carvers. However, there was little evidence of exposure–response relationships among these symptoms, an exception being wheeze with chest tightness. Symptoms suggestive of <b>non-specific</b> airway <b>irritation</b> were not found in excess, although the odds ratios for chronic phlegm increased with increasing number of pieces carved. No strongly suggestive patterns were found for cough. Many, but not all, symptoms were more common among those carving organic media in addition to stone...|$|R
40|$|Adverse effects {{caused by}} {{airborne}} {{material to the}} respiratory tract are due either to <b>non-specific</b> <b>irritation</b> or to hypersensitivity. In this study 20 people employed in swine barns and 18 controls were tested for sensitisation against dusts present in the barn. Immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) were used to test for IgG antibodies; IgE antibodies against swine epithelium were tested using solid phase radioimmunoassay. Precipitins against swine antigens were found in two swine workers; while ELISA found six to be sensitised. Sensitisation against swine antigens correlated with exposure {{but not with the}} presence of symptoms. No IgE antibodies were found. Precipitins against feed antigens were detected in 12 workers; in nine of the 12 with symptoms, and in three of the eight asymptomatic workers. No single antigen was of special importance as an inducer of sensitisation. Sensitisation against feed dusts in barns, as indicated by the presence of circulating antibodies, suggests an immunological background for persistent symptoms. A large antigen penal should be used in testing for sensitisation because of the many immunogenic dusts present in the air in swine barns...|$|E
40|$|Moulds are {{responsible}} for diseases in humans through the three pathogenetic mechanisms of infection, allergy, and toxicity. Fungal infection is especially {{a risk factor for}} immunodeficient patients, but it occurs in immunocompetent patients as well. Fungal allergy is manifested as bronchial asthma, hypersensitivity pneumo-nitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or allergic fungal sinusitis. Myco-toxicosis is almost exclusively the result of ingestion of mould-contaminated foodstuffs. In each case there is specificity for the etiologic mould. There is controversy regarding the ability of indoor airborne mould spores to cause human disease through non-specific toxicity via the inhalation route. Pulmonary mycotoxicosis is an established, although rare, occupational disease of farmers who inhale enormous quantities of mycotoxins, endotoxins, and other toxic chemicals from contaminated silage. Other conditions attributed to indoor airborne mycotoxin are unproven. These include infantile pulmonary hemosidero-sis, epistaxis, ‘toxic encephalopathy’, immune dysregulation and a variety of subjective complaints without objective signs of pathology such as fatigue, headache, dyspnea, gastrointestinal distress, neuromuscular and skeletal com-plaints, etc. <b>Non-specific</b> <b>irritation</b> from moulds via the inhalation route is also a controversial subject that remains unproven. Published studies alleging an epidemiologic causal relationship are unconvincing...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} fungal products may {{be associated}} with health effects ranging from <b>non-specific</b> <b>irritation</b> of the respiratory tract or mucus membranes to inflammation provoked by specific fungal antigens. While concentrations of airborne fungi are frequently measured in indoor air quality investigations, the significance of these measurements in the absence of visual mold colonization is unclear. This study was undertaken to evaluate concentrations of airborne fungal concentrations in school classrooms within a defined geographic location in British Columbia, Canada, and to build a model to clarify determinants of airborne fungal concentra-tion. All elementary schools within one school district participated in the study. Classrooms examined varied by age, construction and presence or absence of mechanical ventilation. Air-borne fungal propagules were collected inside classrooms and outdoors. Variables describing characteristics of the environment, buildings and occupants were measured and used to con-struct a predictive model of fungal concentration. The classrooms studied were not visibly contaminated by fungal growth. The data were evaluated using available guidelines. However, the published guidelines did not take into account significant aspects of the local environment. For example, there was a statistically significant effect of season on the fungal concentration...|$|E
40|$|Endemic {{pneumonia}} of the albino rat {{is commonly}} {{regarded as an}} infectious disease but its etiology is still uncertain, though {{it has often been}} investigated and a wide variety of bacteria isolated from the lung. The opinion has also been expressed that the disease is not primarily bacterial in orgin but is referable rather to a <b>non-specific</b> pulmonary <b>irritation</b> with resultant bronchial obstruction. Associated Bacterial Factors. [...] Klein (1) isolated a diphtheroid which he named B. muris from the lung and heart's blood of two albino rats with pneumonia accompanied by hemorrhage and visceral hyperemia. Subcutaneous injection of the bacillus in rats resulted only in a local abscess. Mitchell (2) studied a highly fatal outbreak of pneumonia in albino rats and isolated the same organism from the lung. It likewise produced a local abscess on subcutaneous injection and resulted in death with pleural involvement on intrapleural injection. It was innocuous, however, when introduced by the nasal route. Pneumonic lesions similar to those in endemic pneumonia of the albino rat have also been reported in wild rats. The morbidity rate, however, is much lower in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} work herein reported tends to justify our hypothesis recently expressed, {{that the common}} failure of antibacterial serums to combat active infections when passively transferred to a normal animal, is due {{not so much to}} a lack of suitable or sufficient antibodies as to absence of cell preparation or mobilization in the recipient. In the case of experimental streptococcus empyema in the rabbit the course of the ordinarily fatal infection is in no wise affected by the transfer of the pleural fluid containing large numbers of mononuclear cells derived from an animal that is itself protected {{as a result of a}} <b>non-specific</b> <b>irritation.</b> The serum of a rabbit highly immunized against the streptococcus and containing antibodies for it, produces relatively slight effect in prevention or cure. In contrast to this the pleural exudate, either acute (polymorphonuclear) or subacute (mononuclear), produced in an actively immunized animal does protect passively to a considerable degree. In a similar fashion normal exudate cells of either type in combination with the relatively ineffective antiserum give a high degree of protection. It remains for further analysis to determine whether this form of passive immunity by antiserum enhanced by the addition of cells depends on the vital properties of the cells transferred or on their stimulation to cell mobilization in the recipient. And furthermore the extent to which this enhanced passive immunity may be effective in cure, and whether the cure is applicable to local or to both local and generalized infection remains to be seen...|$|E
40|$|Tyrosinase {{activity}} {{is a key}} determinant of melanin production in skin. Because retinoic acid regulates tyrosinase activity in melanoma cells, we analyzed modulation of pigmentation in vivo by retinoic acid. Black and white subjects were either not treated, or treated topically for 4 d under occlusion with vehicle, retinoic acid (0. 1 %), or the irritant sodium lauryl sulfate (2 %). In untreated skin, tyrosinase activity and melanin content were significantly greater (2. 3 times, and 3. 2 times, respectively) in blacks versus whites. Four days of treatment with topical retinoic acid did not alter tyrosinase activity or melanin content in black skin. In contrast, retinoic acid treatment significantly induced (2. 7 times, n = 8) tyrosinase activity, compared to vehicle treatment, in white skin. Melanin content, however, remained unchanged at 4 d. In separate experiments, tyrosinase activity in white subjects (n = 25) was increased 16 % (p = 0. 01) in sodium lauryl sulfate – treated skin, and 77 % (p = 0. 0005) in retinoic acid – treated skin, compared to vehicle-treated skin. The effect of retinoic acid on tyrosinase activity could be differentiated from <b>non-specific</b> <b>irritation,</b> because tyrosinase activity in retinoic acid – treated skin was significantly greater (52 %, p = 0. 004) than sodium lauryl sulfate-treated skin. Similar results were obtained with the dihydroxyphenylalanine reaction done on vehicle, sodium lauryl sulfate-, and retinoic acid – treated white skin. Northern analysis (n = 6) and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (n = 6) demonstrated that retinoic acid treatment did not alter tyrosinase mRNA levels in white skin. Western analysis revealed that induction of tyrosinase activity by retinoic acid also {{was not associated with}} increased tyrosinase protein content (n = 9), indicating that regulation of tyrosinase activity by retinoic acid occurs through a post-translational mechanism. These data demonstrate that low tyrosinase activity in white skin in vivio is retinoic acid inducible and high tyrosinase activity in black skin in vivo is neither further induced nor reduced by retinoic aci...|$|E
