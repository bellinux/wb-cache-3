40|$|Sixty-six {{derivatives}} of spiramycin I and <b>neospiramycin</b> I were synthesized {{and evaluated}} by four parameters, MIC, affinity to ribosomes (IDB 0), therapeutic effect in mice and retention time in HPLC. Among the derivatives, 3, 3 ", 4 *-tri- 0 -propionyl-and 3, 4 "-di-O-acetyl- 3 "-O-butyrylspiramycin I showed the highest therapeutic effect which {{was superior to}} acetylspiramycin. Structure activity relationships of spiramycins are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of tilmicosin, tylosin, spiramycin, and its major me-tabolite <b>neospiramycin</b> was developed that is suit-able for porcine, bovine, and poultry muscles. Macrolide residues were extracted from muscle with acetonitrile, fat was removed by liquid–liquid extraction with isooctane, and the extract was then cleaned on Bond Elut C 18 cartridges. The HPLC separation {{was performed on}} an Inertsil ODS 3 C 18 column (150 × 4 mm) with 0. 05 % trifluoroacetic acid–acetonitrile in a gradient mode. Two different chromatographic gradients were used for tilmicosin–tylosin and spiramycin–neospiramycin, and the detection wavelengths were 287 an...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{method for}} the {{identification}} and quantification of macrolides (erythromycin, josamycin, tilmicosin, tylosin, spiramycin and <b>neospiramycin)</b> in tilapia fillets by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass (LC–QToF) spectrometry is presented. Sample preparation was quite simple and low cost: proteins were precipitated and the analytes were extracted with ethanol, extract was defatted with hexane and concentrated by solvent evaporation. The matrix effect was statistically demonstrated during method validation, in which matrix-matched calibration was applied. Matrix effect mechanism was clarified thanks to the capability of QToF mass spectrometer of generating full scan spectra with accurate mass measurement. The limits of quantification were at least 45 % lower than the maximum residue limits. The method was {{able to identify the}} studied macrolides with relative m/z errors lower than 2. 5 ppm and to monitor two fragment ions per analyte, which is in accordance with the European Community recommendations for the analysis of contaminants in foods. Samples from the retail market of São Paulo State, Brazil, were analyzed by the developed method and none of them presented positive results for the macrolides studied...|$|E
40|$|While {{antibiotic}} pollution has attracted considerable attention {{due to its}} potential in promoting the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, the antibiotic activity of their related substances has been neglected, which may underestimate {{the environmental impacts of}} antibiotic wastewater discharge. In this study, a real-time quantitative approach was established to evaluate the residual antibacterial potency of antibiotics and related substances in antibiotic production wastewater (APW) by comparing the growth of a standard bacterial strain (Staphylococcus aureus) in tested water samples with a standard reference substance (e. g. oxytetracycline). Antibiotic equivalent quantity (EQ) was used to express antibacterial potency, which made it possible to assess the contribution of each compound to the antibiotic activity in APW. The real-time quantitative method showed better repeatability (Relative Standard Deviation, RSD 1. 08 %) compared with the conventional fixed growth time method (RSD 5. 62 - 11. 29 %). And its quantification limits ranged from 0. 20 to 24. 00 mg L- 1, depending on the antibiotic. We applied the developed method to analyze the residual potency of water samples from four APW treatment systems, and confirmed a significant contribution from antibiotic transformation products to potent antibacterial activity. Specifically, <b>neospiramycin,</b> a major transformation product of spiramycin, was found to contribute 13. 15 - 22. 89 % of residual potency in spiramycin production wastewater. In addition, some unknown related substances with antimicrobial activity were indicated in the effluent. This developed approach will be effective for the management of antibacterial potency discharge from antibiotic wastewater and other waste streams...|$|E
