5|$|Bus {{services}} are provided to numerous stations. Most bus services provide feeding to the metro system where possible, {{and then do}} <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> into town. However, since the metro operates solely into town, instead of across it, many buses operate between stations on different lines, or provide alternative routes across town.|$|E
5|$|His {{historical}} {{account of}} the expedition included a description of platinum as being neither separable nor calcinable. Ulloa also anticipated the discovery of platinum mines. After publishing the report in 1748, Ulloa did <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> to investigate the new metal. In 1758, {{he was sent to}} superintend mercury mining operations in Huancavelica.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{laid the}} basis for {{scholarship}} that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As {{the head of the}} University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E

5|$|Public opinion, {{based upon}} the {{immediate}} media furore resulted in (according to one BBC poll) 90% of respondents believing Hoddle should <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> as English coach. However, the BBC survey showed that while many considered his comments insensitive to the disabled, others defended his right to express his religious beliefs by claiming that to sack him would constitute religious discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{outcome is}} unknown, {{since it has}} two {{versions}} which differ depending on the source. In the first version Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, {{and in the second}} version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. Suleiman, having been delayed nearly four weeks, withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and did <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> towards Vienna as he had intended, but turned homeward.|$|E
5|$|The last abbot, John Bourchier, {{was granted}} the {{substantial}} pension of £200 a year, when the abbey was dissolved: {{the largest in}} the Diocese of Lincoln. Payments did <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> for very long, however, as in 1552, in the reign of Henry VIII's son King Edward VI, the national finance's were so poor that all pensions over £10 were suspended, with Bourchier recorded as having not received payments for over six months.|$|E

5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
5|$|Blackpool {{qualified}} for the final again in 1972, but were unsuccessful in their defence of the title, with Roma winning 3–1. In 1973, points were no longer awarded for each goal scored, and Newcastle United {{went on to win}} the final 2–1 against Fiorentina at the Stadio Artemio Franchi on 3 June 1973. Due to lack of interest the tournament did <b>not</b> <b>continue,</b> and it was not until 1976 that it re-emerged as a semi-professional competition.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, WNTA-TV {{was losing}} money, and the network's {{flagship}} station {{was sold to}} the Educational Broadcasting Corporation that November. WNTA-TV became WNDT (later WNET), flagship station of the National Educational Television network, a forerunner of PBS. NTA network operations did <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> without a flagship station, although parent company National Telefilm Associates continued syndication services; four television series (Probe, Tintin, The Fair Adventure, and A Day With Doodles) were syndicated by NTA between 1962 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|Casimir, who {{formally}} gave up {{his rights}} to several Silesian principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the House of Luxembourg (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the Gniezno Archdiocese by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> his efforts.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, {{the final}} tournament is rotated between confederations, {{allowing}} only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid {{to host the}} tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft engine manufacturer, and that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could sell their products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E

Luger was placed in a tag team with Davey Boy Smith known as The Allied Powers, but the team never won the tag team titles.
