40|$|Government {{agencies}} and corporations are growing increasingly reliant on networks for day-to-day operations including communication, data processing, and data storage. As a result, these networks {{are in a}} constant state of growth. These burgeoning networks cause the number of network security events requiring investigation to grow exceptionally, creating new problems for <b>network</b> security <b>analysts.</b> The increasing number of attacks propagated against high-value networks only increases the gravity. Therefore, security analysts need assistance to be able to continue to monitor network events at an acceptable rate. <b>Network</b> <b>analysts</b> rely on many different systems and tools to properly secure a network. One line of defense is an intrusion detection system or IDS. Intrusion detection systems monitor networks for suspicious activity and then print alerts to a log file. An important part of effective intrusion detection is finding relationships between network events, which allows for detection of network anomalies. However, <b>network</b> <b>analysts</b> typically monitor these logs in a sparsely formatted view, which simply isn’t effective for large networks. Therefore, a Visual Intrusion Detection System or VIDS is an interesting solution to aid <b>network</b> security <b>analysts</b> in properly securing the networks. The visualization tool takes a log file and represents the alerts on a three-dimensional graph. Previous research shows that humans have an innate ability to match patterns based on visual cues, which we hope will allow <b>network</b> <b>analysts</b> to match patterns between alerts and identify anomalies. In addition, the tool will leverage the user’s intuition and experience to aid intrusion detection by allowing them to manipulate the view of the data. The objective of this thesis is to quantify and measure the effectiveness of this Visual Intrusion Detection System built as an extension to the SNORT open source IDS. The purpose of the visualization is to give <b>network</b> security <b>analysts</b> an alternative view from what traditional network security software provides. This thesis will also explore other features that can be built into a Visual Intrusion Detection System to improve its functionality. Department of Computer ScienceThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{breakout}} game as {{a professional}} came on October 14, 2007 against the Chicago Bears, highlighted by a three-touchdown performance and a then-franchise record of 224yards rushing on 20carries. Peterson established additional team records for a rookie during this game, which included the most 100-yard games rushing and the longest touchdown run from scrimmage. He also set an NFL rookie record with 361 all-purpose yards in a single game. His 607rushing yards through the first five {{games of the season}} is second in NFL history to Eric Dickerson. Following Peterson's record performance, Deion Sanders, now an NFL <b>Network</b> <b>analyst,</b> said about him: [...] "He has the vision of a Marshall Faulk, the power of an Earl Campbell, and the speed of an Eric Dickerson. Let's pray he has the endurance of an Emmitt Smith." [...] He has also been compared to Walter Payton and Tony Dorsett by Star Tribune sports journalist Jim Souhan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{revelation of}} Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said {{that much of}} Williams' speech was {{standard}} pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to [...] "attack the head" [...] of running back Frank Gore, {{he was saying that}} the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far. His former teammate, NFL <b>Network</b> <b>analyst</b> Michael Irvin, said that he [...] "almost threw up" [...] when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to [...] "never take out a man's knees." [...] Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was [...] "woefully underpunished," [...] especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.|$|E

On August 10, 2016, the Los Angeles Rams announced the broadcast team for their 2016 season games with KCBS-TV providing English-language telecasts of all the team's preseason games (with the exception of contests broadcast by the NFL's national television partners) and Spanish-language sister stations Univision 34 (one home game) and UniMás 46 (two away games) in Spanish. The KCBS broadcasting team includes Andrew Siciliano (play-by-play announcer), Pro Football Hall of Fame former running [...] backs Eric Dickerson and Marshall Faulk [...] providing color commentary. In 2017 NFL <b>Network</b> <b>analyst</b> Daniel Jeremiah replaced Dickerson. KCBS's Jill Arrington and Rams reporters Dani Klupenger and Myles Simmons also provide insight; a pre-game show airs half-hour before each game in addition former Rams quarterback Jim Everett and former defensive back and sports anchor/director Jim Hill provides an inside look into each upcoming game with player profiles, live interviews from booth and sideline updates and a thirty-minute postgame that provides game breakdown, film analysis, and press conference look-ins with head coach Sean McVay and select players.In 2016, the Rams' news and highlights where shown on Rams Primetime Live on KABC-TV on Saturday nights after college football games during the regular season, hosted by sports anchor Rob Fukuzaki, sports reporter Ashley Brewer and traffic reporter Alysha Del Valle.|$|E
40|$|Social <b>network</b> <b>analysts</b> {{study the}} {{structural}} patterning of {{the ties that}} link social actors. For the most part, they seek to uncover two kinds of patterns: (1) those that reveal subsets of actors that are organized into cohesive social groups, and (2) those that reveal subsets of actors that occupy equivalent social positions, or roles. To uncover patterns of those kinds, <b>network</b> <b>analysts</b> collect and examine data on actor-to-actor ties. Such data record who is connected to whom and/or how closely they are connected. Typically, the data are organized into square, N-dimensional, N-by-N matrices where the N rows and the N columns both refer to the social actors being studied. Cell entries in these matrices indicate either the presence/absence or the strength of some social relationship linking the row actor to the column actor. In the present discussion, we will deal only with symmetric relationships where, given a connection from actor i to actor j, actor j is also connected to i in the same way. <b>Network</b> <b>analysts</b> sometimes use standard statistical procedures in examining their actor-by-actor matrices. And there are several statistical modeling tools {{that have been developed}} specifically for network data (Holland and Leinhardt, 1981; Wasserman and Pattison, 1996). But these tools were designed primarily for testing hypotheses. They do not provide a simple direct way to explore the patterning of network data—one that will permit an investigator to “see ” groups and positions. The aim of the present paper is to introduce and illustrate such an exploratory device. In the next section, I will show some ways to create visual images {{that can be used to}} display the kinds of structure of interest to 2 <b>network</b> <b>analysts.</b> Then, following that, I will show how those images can be adapted to help to uncover both the antecedents and the consequences of observed network structure...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{detailed}} transactional information are generated by ongoing social processes. For managing and mining such data, we {{treat them as}} “objects” and “relations”. These ideas strongly parallel the way that social <b>network</b> <b>analysts</b> conceive of social structure. Modality (roughly, distinguishing multiple classes of social actors or nodes in networks) and equivalence classes (roughly, distinguishing general patterns {{in the ways that}} objects in classes are related to one another or to objects in other classes) have proven to be very useful in helping social <b>network</b> <b>analysts</b> to think about complex relational structures among social objects. Dimensional and generalized “block models” of multi-modal social networks provide tools for designing searches to identify patterns. The ideas are illustrated by descriptions of how a number of social process-produced data might be approached, including bibliographic databases, communications logs, virtual communities, and economic transactions...|$|R
