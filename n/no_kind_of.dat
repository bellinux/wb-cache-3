25|$|In 1990 and 1991, peace {{negotiations}} with several smaller guerrilla movements resulted in their demobilization and transformation into civilian political actors. The first guerrilla group to demobilize following {{a peace agreement}} with the Colombian government was the 19th of April Movement (M-19), which demobilized and surrendered its weapons in exchange for blanket amnesty for all actions committed {{as part of the}} conflict. Other guerrilla groups which demobilized along similar conditions included most fronts of the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) and the Movimiento Armado Quintin Lame (MAQL). However, repeated attempts at finding a negotiated settlement through formal peace talks {{between the government and the}} FARC have all been unsuccessful. Prior to the current peace process, the most recent attempt at peace talks with the FARC was the 1999-2002 peace process under the government of President Andrés Pastrana, who had conceded a demilitarized zone to the FARC to facilitate peace talks within Colombian territory. Although the peace process continued for three years, <b>no</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> agreement was reached between the two sides. Pastrana formally broke off all talks and ordered the military to retake control of the demilitarized zone on February 20, 2002, a few months before the 2002 presidential elections. The FARC had used the demilitarized zone as a safe zone to keep hostages, negotiate prisoner exchanges, train troops and plan offensive actions.The paralyzed peace process coincided with an escalation of the conflict, owing to a variety of factors including the rapid numerical and geographic expansion of paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) who opposed the government's negotiations with the FARC. The 1998–2002 period was one of the most violent periods in recent Colombian history, with the national homicide rate increasing from 58.92 (1998) to 69.69 per 100,000 inhabitants (2002). In addition, there were 390 attacks on civilian settlements - the majority of them by the FARC; over 3,000 kidnappings each year between 1998 and 2002 and 898 massacres - mostly committed by paramilitary groups - killing over 5,400 people.|$|E

500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath.

Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is <b>no</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{while the}} empire at times was {{extended}} to the north, the Qin could rarely {{hold on to the}} land for long. The tribes of these locations, collectively called the Hu by the Qin, were free from Chinese rule during the majority of the dynasty. Prohibited from trading with Qin dynasty peasants, the Xiongnu tribe living in the Ordos region in northwest China often raided them instead, prompting the Qin to retaliate. After a military campaign led by General Meng Tian, the region was conquered in 215 BC and agriculture was established; the peasants, however, were discontented and later revolted. The succeeding Han dynasty also expanded into the Ordos due to overpopulation, but depleted their resources in the process. Owen Lattimore said of both dynasties' attempts to conquer the Ordos, [...] "conquest and expansion were illusory. There was <b>no</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> success that did not create its own reaction." [...] Indeed, this was true of the dynasty's borders in multiple directions; modern Xinjiang, Tibet, Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and regions to the southeast were foreign to the Qin, and even areas over which they had military control were culturally distinct.|$|E

Empson told Inside Soap that she was unsure if Kat would cheat on Ray as Kim is her best friend, while Venn said that [...] "Kat's a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with her?
