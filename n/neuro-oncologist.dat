40|$|Cancer {{immunotherapy}} {{represents the}} biggest change in the cancer treatment landscape {{in the last several}} years. Indeed, the clinical successes in several cancer types have generated widespread enthusiasm that immune-based treatments may influence the management of patients with malignant brain tumors as well. A number of promising clinical trials in this area are currently ongoing in neuro-oncology, and a wave of additional efforts are sure to follow. However, the basic immunology underlying immunotherapy-and the nuances unique to the immunobiology in the central nervous system-is often not in the daily lexicon of the practicing <b>neuro-oncologist</b> and neurosurgeon. To this end, here we provide a timely and working overview of key principles of fundamental immunology as a pragmatic context for understanding where therapeutic efforts may act in the cellular dynamics of the immune response. Moreover, we review the issues of lymphatic drainage, antigen presentation, and the blood-brain barrier as considerations that are germane to thinking about immunity to tumors arising in the brain.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite novel {{multimodal}} therapeutic approaches, {{the vast}} majority of glial tumors are not curable. Patients may search for complementary therapies in order to contribute to the fight against their disease or to relieve symptoms induced by their brain tumor. The extent of the use of complementary or alternative therapies, the patients' rationale behind it, and the cost of complementary therapy for gliomas are not known. We used a questionnaire and the database of the German Glioma Network to evaluate these questions. METHODS: A total of 621 questionnaires were available for evaluation from patients with glial tumors of WHO grades II to grade IV. The patients were recruited from 6 neuro-oncologic centers in Germany. Complementary therapy was defined as methods or compounds not used in routine clinical practice and not scientifically evaluated. RESULTS: Forty percent of the responding patients reported the use of complementary therapies. Significant differences between the group of complementary therapy users and nonusers were seen with respect to age (younger > older), gender (female > male), and education (high education level > low education level). The motivation for complementary therapy use was not driven by unsatisfactory clinical care by the <b>neuro-oncologists,</b> but by the wish to add something beneficial to the standard of care. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, patients' use of complementary therapies may be largely overseen and underestimated. The major motivation is not distrust in conventional therapies. <b>Neuro-oncologists</b> should be aware of this phenomenon and encourage an open but critical dialogue with their patients...|$|R

40|$|Background : The {{prognosis}} for glioma remains dismal, and {{little is known}} about the final disease phase. To obtain information about this period, we surveyed caregivers of patients who were registered in the German Glioma Network and who died from the disease. MethodsA questionnaire with 15 items, focusing on medical, logistic, and mental health support and symptom control during the final 4 weeks, was sent to caregivers. For some of the questions, a scale from 1 (inadequate) to 10 (excellent) was used. ResultsOf 1655 questionnaires, 605 were returned (36. 6 %) and evaluated. We found that 67. 9 % of the patients were taken care of at home for the last 4 weeks; 47. 7 % died at home, 22. 6 % died in hospitals, and 19. 3 % died in hospice facilities. Medical support was provided by general practitioners in 72. 3 % of cases, by physicians affiliated with a nursing home or hospice in 29. 9 %, and by general oncologists in 17 %. Specialized <b>neuro-oncologists</b> were involved in 6 %. The caregivers ranked the medical support with a mean of 7. 2 (using a 10 -point scale), nursing service with 8. 1, and mental health support with 5. 5. In 22. 9 % of cases, no support for the caregivers themselves was offered by medical institutions. ConclusionsAlthough these data reflect the caregivers' subjective views, they are useful in understanding and improving current patterns of care.

40|$|Abstract. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) {{presents}} {{a major challenge}} to neurosurgeons, <b>neuro-oncologists,</b> and radiation therapists {{by virtue of its}} location with a blood-brain barrier, chemoradioresistance, highly malignant phenotype, and angiogenic potential. Because nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) can transcrip-tionally activate genes leading to the synthesis of anti-apoptotic, chemoresistant, growth promoting, and angiogenic proteins; we assessed the state of activation of NF-κB in 6 GBM cases at diagnosis. Morphoproteomic analysis confirmed the constitutive activation of NF-κB by demonstrating the phosphorylation (p) and nuclear translocation of p-NF-κBp 65 (Ser 536) in these cases. This observation coincides with (a) previous immunohistochemical findings showing nuclear translocation of total p 65, (b) demonstration of NF-κB DNA binding activity, (c) the results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and (d) existing genomic data in GBM.

40|$|Gliomas are {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring primary brain tumors in adults. Although they exist in differ-ent malignant stages, including histologically benign forms and highly aggressive states, most gliomas are clinically challenging for <b>neuro-oncologists</b> because of their infiltrative growth patterns and inherent relapse tendency with increased malignancy. Once this disease reaches the glioblastoma multiforme stage, the prognosis of patients is dismal: median survival time is 15 months. Extensive genetic analy-ses of glial tumors have revealed a variety of deregulated genetic pathways involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, cell migration/adhesion, and cell cycle. Recently, it has become evident that epigenetic al-terations may also {{be an important factor}} for glioma genesis.

There are few prospective clinical trials for newly diagnosed patients and multiple {{approaches to the}} treatment of these patients. This study explored the recommended treatment offered by experts in neuro-oncology. A Web-based survey was developed and distributed to 800 members of the Society of Neuro-Oncology (SNO) who had an e-mail address listed with SNO. Questions addressed use of molecular genetic information and treatment recommendations. A total of 99 clinical SNO members (20 %) responded.

40|$|Neuroimaging {{enables the}} noninvasive {{evaluation}} of glioma {{and is considered}} {{to be one of the}} key factors for individualized therapy and patient management, since accurate diagnosis and demarcation of viable tumor tissue is required for treatment planning as well as assess-ment of treatment response. Conventional imaging techniques like MRI and CT reveal morphological infor-mation but are of limited value for the assessment of more specific and reproducible information about biology and activity of the tumor.

Treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy has improved outcomes in recent years, but patients are frequently left with devastating neurocognitive and other sequelae following such therapy. While the prognosis {{has traditionally been}} based on conventional histopathology and clinical staging (based on age, extent of resection, and {{presence or absence of}} metastasis), it has become apparent in recent years that the inherent biology of the tumor plays a significant part in predicting survival and sometimes supersedes clinical or pathologic risk factors. The advent of deep sequencing gene technology has provided invaluable clues to the molecular makeup of this tumor and allowed <b>neuro-oncologists</b> to understand that medulloblastoma is an amalgamation of several distinct disease entities with unique clinical associations and behavior. This review is a concise summary of the pathology, genetic syndromes, recent advances in molecular subgrouping, and the associated gene mutations and copy number variations in medulloblastoma.

Molecular tumor markers that predict survival and treatment response are being identified with hope of even greater gains in this area from emerging array technologies. Regarding risk factors, studies of inherited susceptibility and constitutive polymorphisms in genes pertinent to carcinogenesis (for example, DNA repair and detoxification genes and mutagen sensitivity) have revealed provocative findings. Inverse associations of the history of allergies with glioma risk observed in 3 large studies and reports of inverse associations of glioma with common infections suggest a possible role of immune factors in glioma genesis or progression. Studies continue to suggest that brain tumors might result from workplace, dietary, and other personal and residential exposures, but studies of cell phone use and power frequency electromagnetic fields have found little to support a causal connection with brain tumors; caveats remain. The only proven causes of brain tumors (that is, rare hereditary syndromes, therapeutic radiation, and immune suppression giving rise to brain lymphomas) account for a small proportion of cases. Progress in understanding primary brain tumors might result from studies of well-defined histologic and molecular tumor types incorporating assessment of potentially relevant information on subject susceptibility and environmental and noninherited endogenous factors (viruses, radiation, and carcinogenic or protective chemical exposures through diet, workplace, oxidative metabolism, or other sources).

40|$|Advances in {{genetics}} {{research have}} greatly expanded {{our ability to}} accurately diagnose gliomas and provide more useful prognostic information. Herein specific examples are used to show how high-yield targets such as EGFR, 1 p/ 19 q, IDH 1 / 2, MGMT, and BRAF can expand {{the power of the}} surgical neuropathologist. To avoid errors, however, the significance and controversies associated with each test must be thoroughly understood. As is the case in other pathology subspecialties, molecular diagnostics is now a prominent component of surgical neuro-pathology. Not long ago, an H&E–stained section and perhaps a few immunostains were considered adequate, but this is no longer true. As our knowledge of the molecular events under-pinning gliomagenesis and progression have exploded, so too has the demand for greater diagnostic and prognostic accuracy from <b>neuro-oncologists</b> and neurosurgeons. However, the “hyper-subspecialized ” nature of molecular neuro-oncology means that, even in centers offering molecular testing of glio-mas, it is difficult to keep abreast of new insights on when to conduct specific tests, how to interpret test results, and how to integrate new biomarkers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH 1 / 2) and BRAF into a workup.

The de novo management of LGG is transitioning to include postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy after the RTOG 9802 study results demonstrated a survival benefit in this setting. In 2014, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists and <b>neuro-oncologists</b> {{who were members of}} the Australian Cooperative Trials Group for Neuro-oncology (COGNO), as well as additional attendants of the COGNO annual scientific meeting, were surveyed. The survey presented six LGG clinical scenarios and asked respondents to select their preferred management strategy. Some additional questions included the respondents’ approach to 1 p/ 19 q testing and chemotherapy preferences. The response rate was 30. 2 % (61 / 202), with the majority (77 %) working in tertiary referral neuro-oncology centers. There was no consensus regarding the management approach for each scenario, with postsurgery observation alone remaining a popular strategy. Only 25 % of respondents reported that their institution routinely tests for 1 p/ 19 q status in LGG, although 69 % were of the opinion that all LGG patients should be tested. The majority (81 %) preferred to use temozolomide rather than the procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine combination as the first line chemotherapy for LGG, but only 44 % would actually use it in this setting.

40|$|OPINION STATEMENT: Primary {{central nervous}} system {{lymphoma}} is a particular challenge in clinical neuro-oncology. In contrast to most other malignant brain tumors, it may be considered a curable disease at least in younger patients who can tolerate intensive treatment regimens. Yet, therapeutic progress has been limited with little measurable improvement in outcome {{over the last two}} decades, mainly due to the low incidence of this tumor, which impedes the execution of large randomized clinical trials, and the failure of most large cooperative groups to conduct such trials. Whenever possible, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is the backbone of the therapeutic regimen. Response rates can be increased by the addition of second agents like ifosfamide or cytarabine, however, their impact on overall survival is less clear. Similarly, the use of the anti-CD 20 antibody rituximab, commonly used in the treatment of B cell lymphomas outside the CNS, remains controversial and has not been examined in adequate clinical trials. The prognosis of patients, who do not qualify for HD-MTX-based chemotherapy, is considerably poorer. Radiation therapy is an active treatment with high response rates but does typically not result in long-lasting remissions. It remains an important therapeutic option as a salvage therapy in patients progressing on or no longer responding to HD-MTX-based treatment. The combination of HD-MTX and radiation therapy does not prolong overall survival. It is associated with significant neurotoxicity, and it should be avoided. Another matter of debate is whether consolidation therapy by other means, such as high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell support, is the most promising regimen. Given these numerous uncertainties, <b>neuro-oncologists</b> should strive for a treatment of PCNSL patients within clinical trials to allow for the development of improved therapeutic regimens...|$|R

Diagnosed serologically, this disorder is often responsive to immunosuppressant treatment. The objective of this review is to educate clinicians on the challenges of diagnosis and management of this disorder. Materials and methods: A review of the relevant literature on clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and recommended management was conducted using a PubMed search. Examination of the results identified articles published between 2007 and 2014. Results: The literature {{highlights the importance of}} recognizing early common signs and symptoms, which include hallucinations, seizures, altered mental status, and movement disorders, often in the absence of fever. Although the presence of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid autoantibodies confirms diagnosis, approximately 15 % of patients have only positive cerebrospinal fluid titers. Antibody detection should prompt a search for an underlying teratoma or other underlying neoplasm and the initiation of first-line immunosuppressant therapy: intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasmapheresis, or a combination thereof. Second-line treatment with rituximab or cyclophosphamide should be implemented if no improvement is noted after 10 days. Complications can include behavioral problems (eg, aggression and insomnia), hypoventilation, catatonia, and autonomic instability. Those patients who can be managed outside an intensive care unit and whose tumors are identified and removed typically have better rates of remission and functional outcomes. Conclusion: There is an increasing need for clinicians of different specialties, including psychiatrists, neurologists, oncologists, <b>neuro-oncologists,</b> immunologists, and intensivists to become familiar with this disorder and its potential complications.

Cochrane Reviews are regularly updated as new evidence emerges {{and in response}} to comments and criticisms, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews should be consulted for the most recent version of the Review. BACKGROUND: High grade glioma (HGG) is an aggressive form of brain cancer. Treatment of HGG usually entails biopsy, or resection if safe, followed by radiotherapy. Temozolomide is a novel oral chemotherapy drug that penetrates into the brain and purportedly has a low incidence of adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether temozolomide has any advantage for treating HGG in either primary or recurrent disease settings. SEARCH METHODS: The following databases were searched: CENTRAL (Issue 10, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, Physician Data Query and the Meta-Register of Controlled Trials in October, 2012. Reference lists of identified studies were searched. The Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-oncology were handsearched from 1999 to 2012 including conference abstracts. We contacted <b>neuro-oncologists</b> regarding ongoing and unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where the interventions were the use of temozolomide during primary therapy or for recurrent disease. Comparisons included no chemotherapy, non-temozolomide chemotherapy or different dosing schedules of temozolomide. Patients included those of all ages with histologically proven HGG. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors undertook the quality assessment and data extraction. Outcome measures included: overall survival (OS); progression-free survival (PFS); quality of life (QoL); and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: For primary therapy three RCTs were identified, enrolling a total of 745 patients, that investigated temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

40|$|Objective. - Internet {{has become}} the first place where {{patients}} go to when seeking information about their disease. Little {{is known about the}} type {{and the quality of the}} medical information available on French-speaking websites, especially in the field of neuro-oncology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of these sites. Materials and Methods. - We entered six key words "glioblastome", "meningiome", "metastase cerebrale", "neurinome de l'acoustique", "adenome a prolactine" and "lymphome primitif cerebral" into 2 different search engines and, for each key word, the first fifty websites were reviewed using the tool "DISCERN", and with the help of two <b>neuro-oncologists,</b> we rated their content in terms of quality and comprehension. Results. - On 612 websites only 110 (18 %) contained information that proved to be somewhat useful to patients. The average score for quality was 32, which is considered to be "poor". According to our scoring system, 1. 8 % of websites were found to be "excellent", 11. 8 % "good", 24. 5 % "fairly good", 15. 4 % "average", 32. 7 % "poor" and 13. 6 % "very poor". Just over 50 % of the websites were found to be clear. The study also showed that the order in which these websites were ranked in the search engine, their affiliation, their target or who financed them had little impact on quality. The websites were more likely to be of high quality if they were managed by doctors and had bibliographical references as well as a date indicating a recent website's update. Discussion and conclusion. - This study shows that the search for medical information on the Internet is time consuming and often disappointing: very few websites provide information that is both clear and exhaustive. However, we also found that very few websites contained information that was seriously inaccurate. Given the growing popularity of the Internet, patients could certainly benefit from a high quality French speaking website that would specialize in cerebral tumors, as well as from a neuro-oncological portal that would take them to selected websites as it would save time and would be a guarantee for quality.

40|$|Glioblastoma is {{the most}} common primary brain tumour. It is an incurable disease and is {{commonly}} referred to as the worst of the “incurable cancers” by neurosurgeons and <b>neuro-oncologists.</b> It is heterogeneous on a cellular and genetic level. The genetic mutations that occur in glioblastoma lead to dysregulation of several principal pathways, the most commonly dysregulated pathways involve mTOR. mTOR is involved in the control of several cellular processes including autophagy and apoptosis. Despite maximal treatment, median survival remains abysmal ranging from 15 to 16 months. Current standard of care consists of two phases. The first phase involves maximal safe surgical resection. This intervention reduces the tumour burden and improves the efficacy of the second phase. This second phase involves chemotherapy and radiotherapy commonly referred to as the “Stupp protocol”. This phase employs a common strategy of inducing apoptosis in an attempt to control the residual disease. Within this thesis we explore both phases of treatment for glioblastoma. Firstly, we established the in vitro efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor, AZD 8055 using the glioblastoma cell line U 87 MG, and glioblastoma tissue derived from a patient in Norway referred to as patient 3. We then assessed the in vivo efficacy of AZD 8055 in combination with temozolomide, using the patient derived glioblastoma tumour material from patient 3, in an orthotopic bioluminescence murine model. We demonstrated that although AZD 8055 is a strong inhibitor of the mTOR pathway when used as a monotherapy or combined with temozolomide, this did not translate into either increased survival or a reduction in tumour growth in vivo. By interrogating the points of crosstalk between autophagy and apoptotic pathways, we hypothesized that mTOR inhibition induced a protective autophagy which antagonised the apoptosis induced by temozolomide. Secondly, we validated a novel animal model of surgical resection. We established that orthotopic implantation of glioblastoma cells can be safely resected, and that the residual tumour, which has invaded the surrounding brain parenchyma, can be reliability imaged in vivo. We advocated the use of this model for the investigation of local delivery of novel therapies into the surgical resection cavity or in the assessment of systemic therapeutic agents targeting residual tumour that has migrated into the normal brain parenchyma...|$|R
40|$|Background: Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral {{alkylating agent}} with {{demonstrated}} efficacy as therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma. TMZ has widely replaced the procarbazine, lomustine plus vincristine (PCV) combination {{for the treatment}} of malignant brain tumours {{as a result of its}} oral administration and favourable toxicity profile. Objectives: This study had three related aims. First, the cost effectiveness of TMZ (from the Finnish healthcare payer perspective) was compared with PCV in patients with GBM that had relapsed after primary treatment with surgery and radiotherapy. Second, the probability that TMZ is cost effective, compared with PCV, was estimated at different societal willingness-to-pay levels. Third, the value of new information for reducing the uncertainty related to the choice of treatment between TMZ and PCV was evaluated. Methods: The cost effectiveness of TMZ and PCV was evaluated using a decision-modelling approach. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for cost per gained life-month, progression-free life-month and QALY were calculated. Various information sources were used to acquire parameter values for the model. The efficacy information of both treatments was derived from the medical literature, quality-of-life (QOL) estimates were gathered from Finnish <b>neuro-oncologists</b> using visual analogue scale methods, and data on the use of healthcare resources were collected from hospital databases. The exact prices for resource use were gained from the list of Finnish health service unit costs (year 2001 prices). The model was analysed using second-order Monte Carlo simulation. The value of new information on reducing uncertainty was analysed using the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) approach. Results: According to the derived ICERs, 1 extra life-month gained with TMZ costs _ 2367, 1 extra progression-free life-month costs _ 2165, and 1 extra QALY costs _ 32 _ 471, compared with PCV, in the treatment of GBM. The probability of TMZ being the most cost-effective choice of treatment was > 60 % for all levels of willingness to pay >_ 5000 per gained life-month. The respective probabilities were > 75 % for all levels of willingness to pay >_ 10 _ 000 per gained progression-free life-month and about 85 % for all levels of willingness to pay >_ 20 _ 000 per gained quality-adjusted life-month. According to EVPI analysis, future research would potentially be cost effective if the costs of research were _ 4. 1 million (maximum). Conclusions: On the basis of this Finnish analysis, TMZ has a high probability of being more cost effective than PCV for patients with GBM. The addition of QOL aspects to the prolonging of survival increases the probability further. Cost-utility, Glioblastoma, Lomustine, Procarbazine, Temozolomide, Vincristine...|$|R
