5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the <b>nest,</b> <b>to</b> prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years. Most do not leave the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> breed for four to five years.|$|E
5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds {{has been found to be}} increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E

5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E
5|$|Mature adult ants of {{this species}} mostly eat sweet substances, so dead insects are given to their larvae {{collected}} while foraging. However, larvae are only fed insects when they have reached a particular size. Workers will mostly collect small insects, sap-sucking insects along with the honeydew which is taken to their <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> feed their young. Observations have been made of fly predation by jack jumper ants; they would only attack the smaller fly species and ignore larger flies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nests</b> tend <b>to</b> be large, {{containing}} about 150 cells. Combs of the <b>nest</b> {{also tend}} <b>to</b> be large, reaching 15X20 cm. The nests are single-layered and circular or umbrella-shaped. The <b>nests</b> tend <b>to</b> {{be supported by}} longer pedicals than are found in other vespids.|$|R
25|$|Many {{species of}} bird conceal their <b>nests</b> <b>to</b> {{protect them from}} predators. Some species may choose nest sites that are {{inaccessible}} or build the <b>nest</b> so as <b>to</b> deter predators. Bird nests can also act as habitats for other inquiline species which may not affect the bird directly. Birds have also evolved <b>nest</b> sanitation measures <b>to</b> reduce the effects of parasites and pathogens on nestlings.|$|R
50|$|A {{honeycomb}} is {{a mass of}} hexagonal prismatic wax cells {{built by}} honey bees in their <b>nests</b> <b>to</b> contain their larvae and stores of honey and pollen.|$|R
5|$|P.exclamans {{has several}} {{different}} predators. Their most dangerous predators are birds, which will fly by and knock the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> the ground. This phenomenon {{was discovered by}} the disappearance of nests, and wasp nests being found on the ground near the bird’s nest. It has also been found that birds eat the larvae from the P.exclamans nest. This attack kills the whole nest but it isn’t very effective against the adults from the colony. When attacked, the adults fly away either to another colony or a satellite colony.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies {{compared}} to certain other eusocial wasps species. Thus, {{it is common}} for the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> be destroyed, for the queen to die prior {{to the end of the}} season, or for the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> fail through other means, such as predation, parasitisation, or worker mortality, leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps. Due to this, it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain casteless till adulthood, allowing female wasps’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic. It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present, exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity. Experimentally, this has been found to be true. Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had the eggs and larvae removed. In the experimental group, the wasps began to behave like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens. In the control group, the wasps continued to behave as workers. This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as {{incubators}} for the creatures' offspring. When the marines kill a chestburster, the other aliens are roused and ambush the troops, killing Frost, Crowe, Wierzboswki, and Drake while capturing Apone and Dietrich alive to be cocooned as hosts. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, taking control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> rescue Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson and Private Vasquez, the only three survivors. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots Spunkmeyer and Ferro, causing it to crash into the station. The remaining group barricade themselves inside the colony command center.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from the egg and the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their parents for {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> fend for themselves, possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food.|$|E
5|$|Satellite nests {{are common}} among P. exclamans. A queen will fly somewhere between 0.15 and 11m {{away from the}} {{original}} <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> settle in a new location. About 16–39% of nests create satellites from May to July. Similar to the wasp species, Parischnogaster alternata, constructing multitude of nests in clusters {{in order to create}} protection through dilution effect, the satellites are used as an insurance against attacks by predators and parasitoids. Of 12 nests that were knocked down by birds that had satellites, 66.7% of the colony survived by moving to the satellite, compared to the reproductive success of nests with no satellite that were attacked (5.7%). When Chalcoela iphitalis invades, the prevalence of satellites didn’t increase the survivability, however it did have an effect when Elasmus polistis were introduced. It gave the P. exclamans a place to escape to.|$|E

5|$|Sphecius grandis {{has very}} similar nesting and feeding habits to {{other members of}} its genus, most notably Sphecius speciosus. As with S.speciosus, the female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks, helped by the calls of the cicada males, and paralyses the insect by {{piercing}} {{the central nervous system}} with her stinger. She drags the cicadas back to her <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> place them in brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell. Females carry cicadas that are on average 88% heavier than their own body mass. It has been hypothesised that cicada killers may also have the ability to capture cicadas mid-flight. There are approximately two or more cicadas to each brood cell. When the larvae hatch, the cicada provides nutrition for the offspring to feed on.|$|E

While fitting out, these rangefinders were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images {{that had to be}} superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|E

5|$|The {{song of the}} American {{goldfinch}} is {{a series}} of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> become less conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> its mate.|$|E
5|$|This martin {{builds a}} deep bowl nest on a {{sheltered}} horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, {{and may be}} built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 22–24 days, although the young birds {{will return to the}} <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> roost for {{a few days after the}} first flight.|$|E
50|$|Their colonies nest on smooth, windswept sand flats {{that allow}} their <b>nests</b> <b>to</b> stay between a {{temperature}} range of approximately 28 °C to 38 °C. These salt flats, or pampas, {{allow for a}} fairly high density of booby nests.|$|R
