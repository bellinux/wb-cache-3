Baird also indicated that his government was <b>not</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister.|$|E

During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was <b>not</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> retire yet.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his governorship, Romney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions, but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits. A November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health). Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former. In May 2004, in compliance with the court decision, the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, he said no marriage licenses were to be issued to those people <b>not</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> move to Massachusetts. In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment, stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions. Instead, he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family (an alliance of socially conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for civil unions. In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Operation Mascot, Tirpitz {{continued}} to prepare for potential combat operations. Following trials in the sheltered waters of Altafjord, she put to sea on 31 July and 1 August to train with her protective destroyers. Additional smoke generators were also installed around Kaafjord to improve the area's already strong defences. These activities were reported by spies, and the British Admiralty interpreted them to mean that Tirpitz was being readied for a raid against Allied shipping. To defend against this threat, {{it was decided to}} conduct further attacks against the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord {{at the time of the}} next series of Arctic convoys. In reality, the German Navy was <b>not</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> use Tirpitz offensively as she would be very vulnerable to the superior Allied naval and air forces if she put to sea. Instead, the battleship was being maintained in active service to tie down Allied warships and aircraft.|$|E
25|$|As World War II {{approached}} {{its conclusion}} (effectively on 14 August but formally not until 2 September), training {{activities and the}} strength of Training Command declined. The end of the war in Europe in May caused the focus of training to shift from the needs of the European Theater to those of the Pacific, particularly courses associated with very heavy bombardment. Then, with the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific, most training ceased for those students <b>not</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> remain in the post-war air forces. Before that time, however, the trend in training had gone increasingly toward specialized training on particular types of aircraft. Then during the last four months of 1945, rapid retrenchment in training occurred, and emphasis shifted to separating people from the Army Air Forces and reorganizing Training Command for its still undetermined peacetime goals.|$|E

25|$|From July to September 1945, Parks {{commanded}} the US Sector and was Military Governor in Berlin. He represented the United States in the Kommandatura which permitted the four Allied powers {{to govern the}} city. This effectively made him {{the mayor of the}} US sector in Berlin. In October 1945, Parks went to Washington D.C. to become the chief of the Public Information Division for the Army. He held this post from 1945 until 1948. In this position he released to the press that General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower was <b>not</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> run as a candidate for either party, Democratic or Republican, in the 1948 elections. From 1948 to 1949 he was the Deputy Commanding General of the United States Army Pacific in Hawaii. While performing duties as such he was flying over the Solomon Islands and witnessed the eruption of the Mt Bagana volcano on Bougainville Island. His photographs of this eruption were published in Life magazine. The following year he won the All Army Golf Championship, Senior Division, held in San Antonio, Texas on August 13, 1949. After his service in Hawaii he became chief of the Information Department, a position he held until 1953. He received a promotion to lieutenant general that year and served as Commanding General for the Second United States Army at Fort Meade, Maryland, until his retirement in 1956.|$|E

500|$|Huggan died on 10 December. Bligh {{attributed}} this to [...] "the {{effects of}} intemperance and indolence... {{he never would}} be prevailed on to take half a dozen turns upon deck at a time, through the whole course of the voyage". For all his earlier favoured status, Christian did not escape Bligh's wrath. He was often humiliated by the captain—sometimes {{in front of the}} crew and the Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became increasingly common. On 5 January 1789 three members of the crew—Charles Churchill, John Millward and William Muspratt—deserted, taking a small boat, arms and ammunition. Muspratt had recently been flogged for neglect. Among the belongings Churchill left on the ship was a list of names that Bligh interpreted as possible accomplices in a desertion plot—the captain later asserted that the names included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh was persuaded that his protégé was <b>not</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> desert, and the matter was dropped. Churchill, Millward and Muspratt were found after three weeks and, on their return to the ship, were flogged.|$|E

[...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
