40|$|Since 2005 an {{increased}} investment activity of territorial governments in Poland has been noticed. This was possible {{due to the}} availability of quite significant funds from the EU non [...] repayable aid. Investments that are being implemented have led, on the one hand, to the widening of the scope and the improvement of quality of local public services and, on the other hand, to {{the rise in the}} maintaining costs of the infrastructure that was brought to life. Investment needs of self [...] governments are still really high. This article aims to present financial investment opportunities of Polish self governments after the year 2012. Achieving such an aim was possible due to the analysis of historical data concerning revenues and expenses of LSE as well as their forecasts for the future. Study of theliterature was also carried out. Taking into consideration both the revenue and expenditure situation of self-governments and limitations in the indebtedness from 2014, it is possible to state that it is highly likely thata significant number of LSE {{will not be able to}} carry out investment activity, including this one, which can be financed from the EU <b>non-repayable</b> <b>aid.</b> Decreasing tax revenues together withincreasing running expenses caused by, among others, increase in the cost of debt service or salaries, will result in the higher difficulty for the self-governments to set investment funds aside. As the forecasted revenues and expenditures of LSE show, keeping the system of financing with no changes will lead to such a situation that LSE neither will be able to carry out investment activity nor pass the budget for the future years. According to the estimates, the number of suchLSEs can equal to 1300. Such a lingering situation in the long run will lead to the deepening of the infrastructural gap between Polish self-governments and better developed European countries...|$|E
40|$|This paper makes three {{contributions}} to the literature on educational attainment gaps by family income. First, we conduct a parallel empirical analysis {{of the effects of}} parental income on post- secondary (PS) attendance for recent high school cohorts in both the U. S. and Canada using data from the 1997 Cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and Youth in Transition Survey. We estimate substantially smaller PS attendance gaps by parental income in Canada relative to the U. S., even after controlling for family background and adolescent cognitive achievement. Second, we develop an intergenerational schooling choice model that sheds light on the role of four potentially important determinants of the family income [...] PS attendance gap: (i) borrowing constraints, (ii) a 'consumption value' of attending PS school, (iii) the earnings structure, and (iv) tuition policies and the structure of financial aid. Third, we document Canada [...] U. S. differences in financial returns to PS schooling, tuition policy, and financial aid, discussing {{the extent to which these}} differences contribute to the stronger family income [...] attendance relationship in the U. S. Most notably, we document the dependence of both <b>non-repayable</b> financial <b>aid</b> and government student loan access on parental income in both countries. ...|$|R
