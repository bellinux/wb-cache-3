5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{compares the}} 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was suffering from a creative drought. The audience for comics was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods of storytelling that drew in and retained readers who were in their teens and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.|$|E
5|$|Under the Plantagenets, England was transformed, {{although}} {{this was only}} partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> {{the most powerful man}} in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, and the establishment of English as the primary language.|$|E

He claimed that Subud {{is not a new}} teaching or religion but only that the latihan kejiwaan itself is the kind of proof that humanity is looking for. There are now Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> {{a place where}} people come to work. For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community. The firm of the 21st century is not just a hierarchy which ensures maximum efficiency and profit; it is also the community where people belong to and grow together, where their affective and innovative needs are met.|$|E
25|$|Informal {{learning}} {{consists of}} the learner setting the goals and objectives. It has been claimed that media <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> influence human culture; they are human culture. With such {{a high number of}} users between the ages of 13–18, a number of skills are developed. Participants hone technical skills in choosing to navigate through social networking services. This includes elementary items such as sending an instant message or updating a status. The development of new media skills are paramount in helping youth navigate the digital world with confidence.|$|E

25|$|Commenting on {{the rape}} of women and {{children}} in recent African conflict zones, UNICEF said in 2008 that rape was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> perpetrated by combatants but also by civilians. According to UNICEF rape is common in countries affected by wars and natural disasters, drawing a link between the occurrence of sexual violence and significant uprooting of a society and the crumbling of social norms. UNICEF states that in Kenya reported cases of sexual violence doubled within days of recent post-election conflict erupting. According to UNICEF rape was prevalent in conflict zones in Sudan, Chad, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.|$|E
25|$|Because {{multimodality}} {{is continually}} evolving from a solely print-based to a screen-based presentation, {{the speaker and}} audience relationship evolves as well. Due to the growing presence of digital media over the last decade, the central mode of representation is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> text; recently, the use of imagery has become more prominent. In its current use for Internet and network-based composition, the term “multimodality” has become even more prevalent, applying to various forms of text such as fine art, literature, social media and advertising. An important related term to multimodality is multiliteracy, which is the comprehension of different modes in communication – not only to read text, but also to read other modes such as sound and image. Whether and how a message is understood is accredited to multiliteracy.|$|E

The title was changed to Traveler's Green Book: International Edition – <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>just</b> for the Negro, or the motorist – as its publishers sought to widen its appeal. Although the content continued to proclaim its mission of highlighting leisure options for black travelers, the cover featured an affluent white blonde water-skiing – a sign of how, as Michael Ra-Shon Hall puts it, [...] "the Green Book ‘whitened’ its surface and internationalized its scope, while still remaining true to its founding mission to ensure the security of African-American travelers both in the US and abroad." ...|$|E

500|$|Box Car Racer, {{intended}} as a one-time experimental project, became a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit and Hazen Street guitarist David Kennedy on guitar.

[...] "At the end of 2001, it felt like Blink-182 had broken up. It wasn’t spoken about, but it felt over", said Hoppus later. Barker, meanwhile, joined rap rock group Transplants in 2002 and was featured on their first album, Transplants.
