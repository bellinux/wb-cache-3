5|$|Finn's death hits Beiste hard, {{and when}} Puck {{comes into the}} locker room drunk, weeks after the funeral and saying that he is lost without Finn, Beiste tells him he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> charge of his life and give himself the advice and {{guidance}} he would have gotten from his best friend. The two cry over their loss. Later, the two gather at Finn's outdoor memorial at McKinley, which includes a tree that Puck had stolen as a memento and later replanted at Beiste's behest, and Puck tells the coach that he has decided to join the Air Force.|$|E
5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account the needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who {{promises}} {{to pay them}} money if they can find naughty little boys {{for him to take}} to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking tobacco, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.|$|E

5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|Working {{with the}} ALARP principle, before {{a patient is}} exposed for a nuclear {{medicine}} examination, {{the benefit of the}} examination must be identified. This <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account the particular circumstances of the patient in question, where appropriate. For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it would be inappropriate to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.|$|E
25|$|Before a cell {{can enter}} cell division, it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in nutrients. All of the {{preparations}} are done during interphase. Interphase {{is a series}} of changes that takes place in a newly formed cell and its nucleus, before it becomes capable of division again. It is also called preparatory phase or intermitosis. Previously it was called resting stage because there is no apparent activity related to cell division.Typically interphase lasts for at least 90% of the total time required for the cell cycle.|$|E

To stop the incinerator, the player needs to choose to pull the trigger, which has a 50% possibility of firing a live bullet, killing the character in the chair. The way the decisions are made varies: some involve choosing between options, and some have the player input their own answer.|$|E

25|$|Far {{from being}} simply of {{theoretical}} interest, relativitistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user {{and is thus}} in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as GPS, GLONASS, and the forthcoming Galileo, must account {{for all of the}} relativistic effects, such as the consequences of Earth's gravitational field, in order to work with precision. This is also the case in the high-precision measurement of time. Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle accelerators would not work if relativistic considerations were omitted.|$|E
25|$|A fast bowler <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a longer}} run-up toward the wicket than a spinner, {{due to the}} need to {{generate}} the momentum and rhythm required to bowl a fast delivery. Fast bowlers will measure their preferred run up in strides and mark the distance from the wicket. It is important for the bowler to know exactly how long his or her run-up is because it must terminate behind the popping crease. If the bowler steps on or beyond this, he or she will have bowled a no ball, which affords the batsman immunity from dismissal, adds one run to the batting team's score and forces the bowler to add another ball to the over.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{has been}} a cosponsor of the Marriage Protection Act in each Congress since the bill's {{original}} introduction.

Speaking in support of the Marriage Protection Act in 2004, he urged those of his fellow congressional representatives who “believe Congress <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> immediate action to protect marriage” to vote for the bill because its passage, requiring only simple majorities in both Houses of Congress, would be much more readily achieved than the passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment, which, as a Constitutional amendment, would require not only much larger majorities in both Houses but also ratification by the state legislatures.|$|E

25|$|Automatic aiming is also {{applied to}} the shot, which may (especially in lower difficulties) cause the cannonballs to be fired at a {{narrower}} angle to the ship's heading. This automatic aiming attempts {{to take into account}} the heading and speed of the enemy ship, and often will cause a more accurate hit, although it can also be detrimental, especially against quick enemies. Cannon facing the enemy are fired in volleys. After firing, the crew begins to reload, a task which takes a certain amount of time depending on the number of cannon, the number of crew, and several other factors. Volleys can be fired even when not all cannon have been loaded, as opposed to a broadside. The largest broadside possible (24 guns) is fired by a fully armed Ship of the Line, which mounts 48 guns in total. Such a volley is often wide enough to hit the enemy regardless of his attempts to maneuver out of the way. The player <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account the enemy's heading and speed when firing, as cannonballs take some time to travel the distance between the two ships and therefore cannot be fired directly at the enemy's position unless the enemy is motionless or at extremely close range.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E
25|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (3D) {{structure of}} SERT {{is not known}} and has been the main obstacle for elucidation of the structural mechanism of the human SERT. Comparative molecular modeling {{have been used in}} research to create structural models of human SERT in complex with its ligand but has not given good results because of low phylogenetic and functional similarity between human SERT and available template proteins. However the 3D structure of some bacterial homologous transporters like the leucine transporter (LeuT) is known. The human SERT, NET and DAT are all members of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) protein family. SERT contains approximately 630 amino acids that are predicted to form 12 transmembrane alpha-helixes (TMs) which are connected with intra- and extracellular loops (ILs and ELs). LeuT, which {{is also a member of}} the NSS family that functions as an amino acid transporter, was crystallized from Aquifex aeolicus by Yamashita et al., and shares 20-25% identity in primary structure with the human neurotransmitter transporters. Therefore, the crystal structure of LeuT and its transport mechanism have been proven to be a good model system for the study of NSS proteins. Although detailed transport mechanism of the NSS proteins is not fully understood, it is clear that in order for transport to occur a rearrangement of large proteins <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place.|$|E
